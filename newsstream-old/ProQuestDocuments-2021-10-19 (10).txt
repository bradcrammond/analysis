Full text: PEOPLE might look to European beaches packed with summer sunbakers, cafe dining with no masks or big crowds for sporting matches in the United States.
A Ballarat immunologist warns it is a different picture to the summer Victoria and other Australians are preparing to face.
Remember last year's flatten the curve manta for lowering cases to come out of lockdown?
Federation University immunology professor Stuart Berzins said we had to start thinking that way again, holding out a little longer from re-opening, just to allowed enough time for every one who can be vaccinated, to have the chance to be vaccinated.
This would prove the big difference between Australia and major nations in the northern hemisphere - or even what could unfold a little north in New South Wales.
"Europe has a vaccination rate that is much higher and of those who are not vaccinated, many are immune because they've had COVID. But the rate of death is 50 times high than Australia," professor Berzins said.
"Things aren't as bad as what they were, but they've been through the worst of it. Providing we can hold on long enough to get our vaccination rate higher, we can avoid what the US and UK [United Kingdom] is going through.
"...A lot of people are not understanding we're at a point where if we can stretch it out a little longer, there will be a stage when, no doubt, infections will rise a lot but we can make it look a lot more like a bad flu season."
Professor Berzins said even a nation like Denmark, while painted as a success story, had death and hospitalisation rates as high or higher than Australia right now.
In speaking to staff across Federation University campuses, Professor Berzins said the nature of the Delta-variant meant we would all inevitably be exposed to COVID-19 so the goal was to minimise its impact on the community.

He said vaccination could not hold on its own and would remain critically important to curbing infections. Only, juggling measures, he said, was a tricky balance when it meant closing shops or barring home visits.
The more we began to open up, Professor Berzins said the more important it was to keep up public health measures such as mask wearing and hand hygiene through to density limits and contact tracing to help slow the virus' spread and ensure out hospitals could cope with the most severe cases.
"Although vaccination is very effective at preventing serious illness from COVID, a proportion of the population either won't or can't be vaccinated, and some people who are fully vaccinated will still get seriously ill from COVID," Professor Berzins said. "...For example, countries with much higher vaccination rates than us are still having large outbreaks, resulting in higher rates of hospitalization and death than we are seeing...outbreaks that we have mostly avoided."

Federation University immunology professor Stuart Berzins, in partnership with Ballarat Health Services oncologists Stephen Brown and Wasek Faisak, are collaborating their data with a Doherty Institute trial.
Professor Berzins said the aim was to better understand why some people responded better to vaccination than others, how much vaccine effectiveness might be diminished by cancer treatment, who might need booster shots sooner and ways that might improve vaccine design.
The study is seeking volunteers to offer a small blood sample before and after vaccination. Details: s.berzins@federation.edu.au.

Why reopening Tasmania will be the most costly challenge yet

Full text: Tasmania must reject the federal government's national plan for reopening the country and take the most cautious approach possible due to recent overseas evidence of the transmissibility of Delta, a health policy analyst believes.
And even when state borders fully reopen - either in December or early 2022 - mask mandates and restrictions would likely still apply to prevent extreme pressure being placed on Tasmania's health system.
Martyn Goddard released analysis on Tuesday into the latest overseas data on the effectiveness of vaccines to prevent Delta transmissibility, claiming that while the vaccines were effective at preventing serious illness, they were not entirely effective at slowing the spread.
He found that modelling relied upon by the Doherty Institute in informing the federal government's reopening plan was already out of date, and that vaccination targets of 70 and 80 per cent were far too low.
Mr Goddard's analysis found that Tasmania would be in trouble even with the state government's ambitious target of 90 per cent double-dose vaccination for all people eligible over the age of 16 by December should COVID be allowed to spread, given the large numbers of unvaccinated people still in the community at that level.
He commended the government on having more ambitious vaccination targets than the federal government, but warned Tasmanians that life was unlikely to return to normal any time soon.
"Once we start to open up, it will not be as free as it is now, that's the price we're going to have to pay," Mr Goddard said.
"We either stay where we are now, keep the borders closed and try to control anything that does come in, or we start to open up and the extent to which we open up - the controls we put in place - are going to be absolutely crucial."
While Victoria, NSW and ACT might want borders reopened at 80 per cent, Mr Goddard said this would be unfair on states that have gone without COVID spread for much of the past 18 months.

"What the federal government is wanting states like Western Australia and Tasmania to do is, in my view, insane," he said.
"It might go down OK in Sydney and Melbourne where they've got lots of lockdowns - that's a different mindset, a different situation to what we're facing.
"What works for them does not work for us, and for any state government - in the Tasmanian or Western Australian situation - to just open up and do what Scott Morrison wants would be, in my view, nuts."
With 90 per cent of eligible Tasmanians vaccinated, there would still be 116,000 unvaccinated, with children 15 and under not included in the government's figures.
Slow and steady approach preferred for Tasmania Economist Saul Eslake agreed with Mr Goddard's analysis, and urged the Tasmanian Government to only reopen when modelling showed it was absolutely safe to do so.
"I think it would be better in the medium to longer run to wait until we have reached levels of vaccination that the serious modelling tells us is safe, and minimises the risk of going back into recurring lockdowns, than to go earlier than that and run the risk," he said.
Tasmania has not experienced community transmission since May last year, when the North-West outbreak resulted in the closure of two hospitals.
Mr Eslake said the evidence from the United Kingdom and Israel showed that opening up the economy too soon could have dire consequences for health systems, costing the state more in the long run.
"If you open up with (vaccination) percentages of the total population that low, especially bearing in mind that the Delta variant seems to be affecting younger people much more than the Alpha and other variants, you are... taking a considerable risk," he said.
"There is a sound argument that Tasmania needs to be more careful than other jurisdictions might be able to be given the inadequacies of our health system."
The pair were eager to urge all Tasmanians to get vaccinated as the greatest defence against COVID.
"You can't rely on somebody else getting vaccinated to protect you," Mr Goddard said.
"You've got to do it yourself. You've got to protect yourself, you've got to take responsibility to get vaccinated and it's really important to do it now."
Tasmania-specific modelling weeks away to inform opening plan Professor Raina MacIntyre from the University of NSW's Kirby Institute is preparing Tasmania-specific modelling to guide the government's opening plan, expected to be released within two weeks.
Director of Public Health Mark Veitch said the latest data - including the transmissibility of the Delta strain among the vaccinated - will be factored in.
"They will also be putting into it estimates of the extent to which the vaccine prevents transmission," he said.
"We know that's less effective at preventing transmission as it is at those severe clinical consequences, but the models will put the latest in, and it'll also put values in a bit higher or lower just to see how that changes the picture."
Health Minister Jeremy Rockliff welcomed Mr Goddard's input, and said the health and safety of Tasmanians would be the main priority in developing a reopening plan.
"That will inform us when we make some very key decisions when we get those vaccination rates at 90 per cent or above," he said.
"There are various scenarios that Professor MacIntyre is modelling through the Kirby Institute, and we look forward to receiving that modelling."

Calm down? Queenslanders sick of leaders’ excuses

Full text: IT’S been three months since Annastacia Palaszczuk backed the formulation of a four-phase national plan to lead Australia out of Covid-19.
Then, on August 6, national cabinet fully agreed to the plan that revealed once 80 per cent of a jurisdiction became fully vaccinated, only “highly targeted” lockdowns would be needed while all restrictions on outbound travel for the vaccinated would be lifted.
But, in the months since, what’s become clear is how unclear Queensland’s reopening strategy is.
While the state has so far avoided a mass Delta outbreak such as those in NSW and Victoria, Ms Palaszczuk has repeatedly refused to say whether the state will reopen once it hits 80 per cent fully vaccinated.
Queenslanders have listened to a growing string of reasons why the state can’t open up just yet.
Like, “What’s going to happen to the children?” And then that 80 people could die each day (according to worst-case Doherty modelling).
Then that Queensland’s already struggling hospitals needed more funding from the commonwealth.
Then amid questions from media, the Premier said “calm down” and wait until the next national cabinet meeting. That was eight days ago.
As other states reveal plans based on Doherty modelling, you can’t help but think – why can’t Queensland? Queenslanders have been praised almost daily for their response to this pandemic. The least the state government can afford them is some certainty and hope.

Full text: IT’S been three months since Annastacia Palaszczuk backed the formulation of a four-phase national plan to lead Australia out of Covid-19.
Then, on August 6, national cabinet fully agreed to the plan that revealed once 80 per cent of a jurisdiction became fully vaccinated, only “highly targeted” lockdowns would be needed while all restrictions on outbound travel for the vaccinated would be lifted.
But, in the months since, what’s become clear is how unclear Queensland’s reopening strategy is.
While the state has so far avoided a mass Delta outbreak such as those in NSW and Victoria, Ms Palaszczuk has repeatedly refused to say whether the state will reopen once it hits 80 per cent fully vaccinated.
Queenslanders have listened to a growing string of reasons why the state can’t open up just yet.
Like, “What’s going to happen to the children?” And then that 80 people could die each day (according to worst-case Doherty modelling).
Then that Queensland’s already struggling hospitals needed more funding from the commonwealth.
Then amid questions from media, the Premier said “calm down” and wait until the next national cabinet meeting. That was eight days ago.
As other states reveal plans based on Doherty modelling, you can’t help but think – why can’t Queensland? Queenslanders have been praised almost daily for their response to this pandemic. The least the state government can afford them is some certainty and hope.

Get ready for when we let Delta into the state

Full text: SOUTH Australia has been an oasis of almost-normal life for most of the Covid-19 pandemic.
Even as the Delta strain has ravaged NSW and Victoria in particular, SA has, thus far, managed to stave off a widely expected outbreak with tight border controls.
Apart from mask wearing on public transport, indoor public spaces and high schools, the most significant change to pre-pandemic life within SA is a 20-person limit on home gatherings.
But the rest of the world is opening up. For example, the legendary rockers in a Covid-19 high-risk group, the 70-plus trio of remaining Rolling Stones, on Monday night started a rescheduled US tour in St Louis, Missouri, to a packed 50,000-seat stadium.
Prime Minister Scott Morrison on Friday announced international borders would start reopening in ­November, as double-dose Covid-19 vaccination rates begin hitting 80 per cent.
High-case states have laid out ­reopening plans, predicated upon ­allowing greater freedoms for the fully vaccinated. But Western Australia, Tasmania and Queensland – the latter on the precipice of a lockdown – have signalled they will not reopen to NSW and Victoria while Covid cases remain high.
This encapsulates the tension ­between opening up state borders once SA reaches 80 per cent double-dose vaccination for Covid-19 and continuing the defensive stance that has protected South Australians from the worst of the pandemic.
The next few weeks will be the biggest test yet of Premier Steven Marshall’s leadership. In football terms, SA has had a run of wins during the minor round. But the finals series will be the state letting in the Delta wave for the first time.
As the Sunday Mail revealed on September 26, authorities are planning to start a staged reopening of SA’s borders after mid-November, when modelling predicts the state will reach an 80 per cent Covid double-dose vaccination rate.
The first stage is expected to ­involve admitting fully vaccinated people from low-risk local government areas in NSW and Victoria.
SA’s borders cannot stay closed forever. South Australians eventually will be exposed to Covid-19. The key question is whether enough people can be fully vaccinated in time to prevent major outbreaks causing significant casualties and overloading the health system.
Once the 80 per cent threshold is reached, Doherty Institute modelling predicts community transmission will be less likely and cases will be less severe, thus reducing hospital admissions and deaths.
But the path forward is littered with political risk for Mr Marshall, given case numbers will rise in the weeks before next March’s state election. Helped by doctors’ and paramedics’ unions, the Labor opposition has gained public traction with its case that the health system is under extreme pressure and will not be ready for the Covid surge.
There is growing pressure for Mr Marshall to reveal a road map for reopening. This is an important part of the social contract he has successfully forged with the SA public during the pandemic, based on clear communication and mutual trust.
But it is clear there will not be a freedom day. Instead, borders will be gradually dismantled and some ­internal restrictions will remain. We will have to learn to live with Covid.
The four-step transition plan agreed by national cabinet on ­August 6, to which Mr Marshall has adhered, effectively spells out the pathway, even if it is relatively silent on state borders.
Once full vaccination levels reach 80 per cent, the plan’s objective is to “seek to minimise serious illness, hospitalisations and fatalities as a ­result of Covid-19 with baseline ­restrictions”. These include “highly targeted lockdowns only” and ­exempting “vaccinated residents from all domestic restrictions”.
Mr Marshall cannot rely solely on the transition committee, spearheaded by Police Commissioner Grant Stevens and chief public health officer Nicola Spurrier, to make the key decisions on opening up. Nor can he bank on more guidance from the national cabinet.
Ultimately, the Premier will have the final say, even if the decision is substantially based on expert ­advice.
Despite Labor’s mantra that Mr Stevens and Professor Spurrier are running the state, the buck clearly stops with Mr Marshall. He is the Premier.
Mr Stevens on Tuesday said SA Health was conducting modelling to assess the implications of border reopenings. He committed to communicating this “as quickly as possible” so the public “might have an understanding of what 80 per cent really means for us”. Given Covid-19 is increasingly a pandemic of the unvaccinated, there now is an even greater incentive to get the jab as soon as possible.

Full text: The Premier also doubled down on her stance that the NRL Grand Final was not the reason the state wasn’t already in lockdown, saying the chief health officer would have “no qualms” about locking down if it was needed.
One of the new cases is linked with the aviation cluster and spent time on the southern end of the Gold Coast for four days.
Another case was acquired interstate and only in the community for one day.
Premier Annastacia Palaszczuk said there were almost 20,000 tests on Thursday – giving Queensland an “added layer of protection”.
Responding to repeated questions on why the state wasn’t already in lockdown, the Premier said if the health advice is to go into lockdown the state will enter lockdown.
“This is serious,” she said.
“We will go hard, we will go fast if necessary.
“The fundamental reason we’re not in lock down is because we don’t have any seeding or unlinked community transmission,” she said.
If that changed, chief health officer Dr Jeannette Young wouldn’t hesitate to recommend a lockdown, Ms Palaszczuk said.
Dr Young said it was “encouraging news” that there was no unlinked community transmission uncovered by high testing rates in the past day.
NED-3869-Covid-19-Exposure-Sites-Qld
Ms Palaszczuk was asked whether people would be able to travel to Queensland at Christmas, saying she didn’t have a crystal ball.
“We will do so when it is safe,” she said.
“If it is unsafe, it will not happen.”
Dr Young was asked whether the NRL grand final would still go ahead.
“We just need to see what happens over the next few days,” she said.
She repeated the restrictions that would be in place for that game, including 75 per cent capacity.
Dr Young said the two new community cases recorded on Friday had both been active in the community.
One is a new cluster, a man who travels between Queensland and New South Wales picking up animals and relocating them.
He was only in the community for one day.
“I don’t think he’s a risk,” Dr Young said.
A second person is linked to the aviation cluster – with the man spending time at the offices where there was virus spreading between the 20-24th September and went with family to Kirra Beach Resort for four days and was infectious the entire time.
The man was in Kirra from the 25th to the 29th and was infectious at venues including North Kirra Surf Club, the Kirra Surf Club, Timezone, Kirra Woolworths, and some cafes in the area.
Dr Young urged anyone in the southern Gold Coast region, and indeed statewide, with any symptoms at all to get tested.
Dr Young said exposure sites would be published on Queensland Health’s website today.
chief health officer Dr Jeannette Young says she remains concerned about Queensland's growing outbreak. "I’m still concerned. It’s really important that people comply with the restrictions that are in place for those six Local Government Areas," Dr Young said. "One other thing that I forgot to mention in my earlier update is that you would have seen that New South Wales has removed the restrictions on Walgett. "So we will similarly put them back into the border zone allowing that small amount of movement. "So that will happen from 1:00am tomorrow, and New South Wales has put stay-at-home restrictions in place for Kyogle. So we will also put those higher levels of restrictions in place for there from 1:00am tomorrow."
She said people who had been in any of the restricted LGA must carry those restrictions over with them as they moved around.
For example, someone leaving Brisbane would still need to abide mask restrictions.
Ms Palaszczuk said she would not hesitate to institute a lockdown if necessary.
“There’s no ifs and buts here people, this is serious,” she said.
“It’s going to depend on whether we see any unlinked community transmission over the next 24-48 hours.”
Ms Palaszczuk said people were continuing to check in, making contract tracers’ jobs easier.
Health Minister Yvette D’Ath said people travelling around the state on holidays should get vaccinated while they are away.
“Get vaccinated on holiday ... because the quicker we get vaccinated, the quicker we can protect our community,” Ms D’Ath said.
She reiterated her calls for people to get vaccinated and said anyone with an appointment for the future should cancel and get the jab immediately.
“Don’t worry, turn up now,” she said.
“Being vaccinated is not enough to stop you passing it on that’s why each and every one of us needs to be vaccinated so we don’t acquire it and get severe illness.”

Ms D’Ath said if you are due for your second dose and have a booking for the coming days, you can attend a walk-in clinic sooner and get your second dose.
“Don’t wait, come out and get vaccinated today,” Ms D’Ath said.
Ms Palaszczuk on Thursday warned the next 24 hours would be “absolutely critical” to halt the worsening outbreak, with one mystery case of Covid-19 carrying the potential to plunge millions of Queenslanders into lockdown.
Southeast Queensland remains on a knife’s edge with a growing number of linked community Covid-19 cases rapidly spreading across the Brisbane, Gold Coast, Moreton Bay and Townsville regions.
Sources said the major saving grace so far has been that all cases have been able to be traced to their origin within 24 hours.
Ms D’Ath said if you are due for your second dose and have a booking for the coming days, you can attend a walk-in clinic sooner and get your second dose.
“Don’t wait, come out and get vaccinated today,” Ms D’Ath said.
Meanwhile, the virus has claimed another major Queensland event, with surf life saving’s national pool rescue championships on the Gold Coast cancelled.
The championships were due to be held at the Southport Aquatic Centre in December after being postponed from August, attracting hundreds of lifesavers from across the country.
But Surf Life Saving Australia says continuing uncertainty over border closures has forced the ‘unfortunate decision’ to cancel.
It follows the cancellation of other major events including the Gold Coast Marathon and Gold Coast 600 Supercars race.
SLSA National Sport Manager Wayne Druery said that while it was disappointing to cancel the event for a second year in a row, there was too much uncertainty for a national championship to proceed.
“Unfortunately, we are currently in a position where there is little certainty around border restrictions between states, and there is an inability for many athletes to be able travel for the Australian Pool Rescue Champs that were set to be held on the Gold Coast, Queensland,” Mr Druery said.
“It is difficult to conduct a national championship that doesn’t offer many of our competitors the same opportunity to compete, and it simply is not a national championship if only competitors from one or two states can contest the titles.
“We recognise that with the second consecutive cancellation of the National Pool Championships there are impacts on athletes and we will be working hard next year to re-engage our pool athletes after another unfortunate cancellation.”
The Premier was on Thursday forced to hose down claims she is reluctant to call a snap lockdown ahead of the major sporting event and insisted she would take advice from chief health officer Jeannette Young.
“Let me make it very clear that the health of Queenslanders comes first and as soon as Dr Young says we need to move into lockdown, we will,” Ms Palaszczuk said.
One of the six new cases recorded on Thursday is a 14-year-old girl who is the daughter of a man connected to the aviation cluster, and she was among 52 lifesavers taking part in a school holiday bronze medallion course at Southport Surf Club this week.
Increasing vaccination rates, mask compliance and the lack of mystery cases has delivered cautious optimism to authorities, but Ms Palaszczuk warned there were clear guidelines on what would trigger a lockdown.
There are 65.7 per cent of Queenslanders with a first dose and 46.7 per cent are fully vaccinated.
When asked about Friday’s national cabinet meeting, Ms Palaszczuk said she didn’t have updated Doherty modelling and that she could therefore could not make decisions around the future restrictions in Queensland until she saw it.
She said she expected it by the middle of the month.
Deputy Commissioner Steve Gollschewski said police intercepted 14,606 cars on the border on Thursday with 169 turned around.
One person was issued with an on the spot fine.
There were 67 masks handed out yesterday – up from six the day before.
Mr Gollschewski said investigations had concluded that a Covid-positive Brisbane woman who crossed into northern NSW and back hadn’t attended an illegal party.
She had attended a pub, he said.
“We have dealt with that with a caution. It is the appropriate response,” he said.

Queensland Premier Annastacia Palaszczuk says from 4pm today six areas will enter into stage two restrictions. It comes as the state recorded six new locally acquired cases of COVID-19. "We will go from stage three to stage two for the following areas: from 4pm today for two weeks will apply to Brisbane, Gold Coast, Moreton Bay, Logan, Townsville and Palm Island," she said at a media conference on Thursday. "That means the number of people allowed into your home will be 30 including visitors, resident and children, weddings and funerals will go back to 100, 20 people dancing at weddings, restaurants and cafes for two weeks will return to one person per 4sqm rule." "I think everyone realises that we've got to put these restrictions in place if we are to avoid a lockdown at this stage."

Time is right for a fresh challenge on state borders

Full text: The legal prospects of a successful challenge to the Queensland and West Australian border closures may just be looking up.
There are several avenues by which an aggrieved and powerful litigant may proceed.
National cabinet agreed in August on a national plan to transition Australia’s Covid-19 response to post-vaccination settings, starting when national vaccinations reached 70 per cent, with that target expected to be reached by Oct­ober 22. But Queensland Premier Annastacia Palaszczuk and West Australian Premier Mark McGowan have a very different plan for their states – to stay closed.
Although previous legal challenges to state border closures such as these have failed, including Clive Palmer’s constitutional challenge to the WA border restrictions, unanimously dismissed by the High Court last year, the legal prospects, just like the pandemic, are changing.
The High Court’s reasons in the Palmer case were based on limited legal grounds and very different facts. Three members of the five-judge bench (Chief Justice Susan Kiefel and justices Patrick Keane and James Edelman) were careful not to rule out definitively the possibility of a future successful challenge.
Meanwhile the Queensland border closure legislation has not been subjected to a sustained challenge and its constitutionality remains an open question.
The border closure also could be challenged via judicial review of public health measures, which would argue restrictions go further than is necessary to protect public health.
A new challenge also may garner support from other stakeholders. Scott Morrison says Australians just want to “get on with it”. Home Affairs Minister Karen Andrews has waged a public war of words with the Queensland Premier since July and Attorney-General Michaelia Cash, a senator from WA, says things have changed fundamentally and as a result the WA border restrictions are “no longer necessary and proportionate”.
South Australia’s backing is likely, given its position in the Palmer case. And while NSW did not show its hand in the Palmer case, border tensions and social media posts by Attorney-General Mark Speakman may indicate where its sympathies lie. The basic facts of any case could be agreed and should not be contentious, given Covid-19 is perhaps the most rapidly and exhaustively studied phenomenon in history.
Apart from vaccines and new treatments, what has changed?
Critical to the High Court’s reasoning in the Palmer case were “uncertainties about the level of risk”. Chief Justice Kiefel and Justice Keane endorsed WA’s position with a powerful and prescient statement of the court’s reasoning: “There is no known vaccine, and no treatment presently available to mitigate the risks of severe medical outcomes or mortality for a person who contracts Covid-19.” The question is this: did the High Court deliberately leave the door open to a future challenge as soon as a vaccine was rolled out and other treatments approved?
Fast forward to last month, and more than 50 per cent of Australians now are fully vaccinated against the virus. Uncertainty has been dispelled by Doherty Institute and Burnet Institute modelling based on more than 12 months of international data. With test, trace, isolate and quarantine measures in place, the level of risk in reopening at 70 per cent has been quantified with precision: 2737 infections and fewer than 15 deaths, with no lockdowns required.
That is a caseload the health system surely can cope with. Since April last year, Victoria has tripled its intensive care unit capacity, bringing an additional 1600 beds online. The NSW and Queensland governments announced early in the pandemic that they would double their capacity.
Australia’s prospects for returning to everyday life are looking very good. Health capacity has been ramping up continuously since Covid-19 reached our shores last year. All of which makes Palaszczuk and McGowan’s refusal to commit publicly to a date for reopening difficult to understand.
Vaccination rates in Queensland and WA lag behind the rest of the country by a wide margin, which adds to the uncertainty on reopening. It is not clear when Queensland and WA will reach 80 per cent vaccination. And their premiers tell Queenslanders and West Australians borders will stay closed for as long as necessary to keep the virus out.
However, we also know the implications of border indecision aren’t merely about convenience and federal consistency. The livelihoods of many Australians are affected. The tourism industry in particular is under pressure. In WA, tourism is an $11bn industry employing about 8.2 per cent of the state’s population. In Queensland, always a popular holiday destination, about 75 per cent of the $28bn sector is reliant on domestic tourism.
More intangible but no less deeply felt is the human cost for all of us. Queenslanders and West Australians with friends and relatives living elsewhere have endured almost two years of separation. The daily lives of border residents have been disrupted, including by restrictions on movement within their own states.
Faced with indefinitely prolonged restrictions, the Australian Human Rights Commission has expressed concern, citing a “lack of transparency in explaining the continued justification for some emergency measures”. The commission says: “The need for the restrictions must be regularly assessed, and the moment they are no longer necessary they must cease.” Prospective plaintiffs may be wondering whether that moment finally has come. With agreed facts, a challenge could be heard and determined in as little as a few weeks: the High Court pronounced orders on Palmer’s challenge within two days of the close of hearings.
Whatever the outcome of any challenge, it will be a step further down the path out of Covid-19 and back to normal life, something likely welcomed by all of us. Leon Zwier is a partner at Arnold Bloch Leibler.

DELTA THREAT RIPS HEART OUT

Full text: PREMIER Peter Gutwein has warned those impatient for the state to reopen its borders that the Delta variant of Covid-19 will take a grim toll unless every eligible Tasmanian has had a chance to be vaccinated.
The timing and conditions for the state’s border reopening remain unclear. Digging in around a ­reopening dependent on double dose vax rates reaching 90 per cent – in defiance of the Prime Minister’s call for easing restrictions at 80 per cent – Mr Gutwein said ­it would not ­happen before December.
He described NSW’s plan to open early as “ a recipe for an acceleration of the spread of the virus”.
Mr Gutwein said Tasmania would await modelling on the impact of the Delta variant of Covid-19 and watch the larger states reopening over the next two months and see how they fared.
“We do know, and there is no doubt about this, that if we were to relax border restrictions at 80 per cent that Covid would enter Tasmania and it would take off,” he said.
“Some people would get sick, some people would get very sick. And, unfortunately, some Tasmanians would lose their lives.” Mr Gutwein said based on existing projections, Tasmania would experience 14,900 cases, up to 590 hospital admissions, 97 people in intensive care and almost 100 deaths within six months.
The annual flu death toll, by comparison, is 50 to 100 deaths. “I haven’t sugar coated things,” Mr Gutwein said.
“As we move forward and prepare ourselves for when Delta will one day be here, it’s important we take every step we can to protect ourselves and importantly vaccinate ourselves,” he said.
The government is awaiting modelling from the Garvan Insti­tute on the likely prognosis for a local easing of travel restrictions before making an announcement.
When inbound travel ­resumed, Mr Gutwein warned that it was likely that it would be for double-vaxxed travellers only, who might be subject to testing before and after travel, and short periods of ­quarantine.
“To be very clear, Victoria and NSW have reopening plans because they are currently closed. Their communities are locked down,” he said.
“Now, under their plans while they get some freedoms back at 80 per cent for fully vaccinated people, even at 90 per cent, as foreshadowed by NSW, which they expect to achieve by the first of December, they will only come back to being broadly in line with the restrictions that we have in place here.” “Now we have the benefit of watching these two largest states reopen over the next two months, we’re going to have the benefit of watching one of the largest social and health experiments in the country’s history unfold as they attempt to bring their communities broadly into line with where we are here in Tasmania today.” Director of Public Health Mark Veitch would not say what level of deaths would be considered acceptable, but noted modelling was predictive only, not authoritative.
“What we will do when we get information from the ­Garvan [Institute], is we will look at the information that it provides the projections of what might happen at various [vaccination] rates we will also look at the Doherty Institute information,” Dr Veitch said. david.killick@news.com.au

Full text: Significant concerns have been raised over the NSW regional, rural and remote health system's ability to cope with a potential surge in COVID-19 cases as the state re-opens from its pandemic hibernation.
Submissions and witness testimony to a State parliamentary inquiry that began in September last year paint a picture of an already chronically ill system.
How that system will cope with the added burden of a predicted increase in COVID-19 cases filling beds and ICU wards and requiring transport to and from regional and rural centres to receive expert care has medical professionals and community leaders deeply concerned.
Health Services Union NSW Secretary, Gerard Hayes, said our regional and rural health care services are not prepared for what lies ahead.
"I'm not saying this to be obtuse, but what we have seen over the past decade has been a system tightening its belt constantly and working to be as lean as possible," Mr Hayes said.
"Now as many can work from home, city people are moving to rural locations compounding the pressure already lumped on the health system in these areas as it struggles to cope with a growing population."
A driving force behind the inquiry into health outcomes and access to health and hospital services in rural, regional and remote New South Wales, 60 Minutes reporter Elizabeth Hayes knows too well the system's existing flaws.
Ms Hayes' father, Bryan Ryan, died of a stroke at Manning Base Hospital at Taree after he was initially overdosed and then failed to receive his blood thinning medication for eight days.
"In all, it reeks of a system that needs urgent attention," Ms Hayes said. "If anything should be in ICU, it's the rural health system.
"These are people's lives and whether you're a worker at the coalface or a patient or a family who has had a terrible outcome ... It's devastating."
The parliamentary inquiry received more than 700 submissions statewide.
Among them are stories like that of a new mother presenting to Coolah Hospital with suspected appendicitis.
She was told she would need to travel to Dubbo Hospital via her own transport because her four-month-old baby couldn't join her in an ambulance.
Twenty-four hours later, she was told she could go home and see what happened or have a CT scan. She opted for the latter.
The CT scan revealed a blocked and twisted bowel with her surgeon remarking "if this had been left [for] another 12 hours, it would have been a very different story".
Another submission tells of an 80-year-old woman who passed away at Cessnock Hospital from a heart condition because there weren't any beds free at Maitland Hospital or John Hunter Hospital.
She had presented to the hospital on three separate occasions with the same condition and had been transferred to the other hospitals which had cardiac equipment.
Earlier this month, the State Government released its roadmap out of COVID-19 lockdowns.
The roadmap, based on modelling by the Doherty Institute, suggested NSW could begin to ease restrictions once 70 per cent of the adult population was fully vaccinated against the virus.
The Doherty Institute has since conducted a "sensitive analysis" of its modelling which was presented to the National Cabinet last week.
The analysis suggests it would be "prudent" to maintain restrictions in areas of concern where there are thousands of cases per day until Australia reaches 80 per cent of the adult population double jabbed.
In a statement, the Institute said, "these findings confirm our earlier strategic advice that even high levels of vaccination will not be sufficient to stop COVID-19 in its tracks".
That could mean an increase in COVID-19 cases across the state as it opens up and an upswing in hospitalisation, patients in ICU and deaths.
"It's every rural and regional health officials nightmare, I would think, and it should be," Ms Hayes said.
"It is obvious hospital healthcare services in rural regions are under-resourced ... They can't cope with what's happening day to day.
"They know that they are barely getting through with what they have for you or me walking in with a regular event without throwing in a virus that knows no boundaries."
At the coalface, there is fatigue. Health advocates and professionals described a dedicated workforce of nurses, doctors, paramedics and other professionals, but also a workforce weary off the back of two years of fire, flood, a mouse plague and the pandemic.
"We are at a critical point where we will start seeing doctors burn out next year from working extra hours, there will be those charging a greater gap because business costs have gone up and there will be no general practitioners for new patients in the area," Dr Debra King, North Coast representative on the Royal Australian College of General Practitioners NSW board said.
"This all results in a rise in chronic illness because people won't be attending their doctor regularly and they will attend hospital emergency departments instead. General practitioners are getting burnt out with the increased workload. Our workforce doesn't go up, we just work longer hours."
It is a message repeated by Scott Beaton, vice-president of the Australian Paramedics Association and paramedic based in Gilgandra.
"We've seen an increase in workload obviously in Dubbo and those areas where there are high amounts of COVID positive patients. So we not only have our normal workload to deal with, but then we're topped up with more problems from the extra patients requiring hospitalisation or transport to the hospital for COVID issues."
"Obviously in regional NSW we have a limited amount of health resources. Any extra stress or strain on regional and rural health is going to cause a serious issue."

Full text: Almost 100 Tasmanians would lose their lives to COVID-19 if the state opened its borders to the country at an 80-per-cent vaccination rate.
This statistic is based on state-specific modelling, revealed on Wednesday, applied to the Doherty Institute report on border reopenings.
Premier Peter Gutwein said there would be 14,900 COVID cases in the state in the first six months should Tasmania open to states, including NSW and Victoria, at 80 per cent with baseline restrictions.

Fallen Tasmania Police officers remembered at service He said there would be 590 hospital admissions, 97 intensive care admissions, and almost 100 deaths.
"As we move to reopen our borders, the Delta [strain] will arrive," Mr Gutwein said.
"When Delta arrives, that will mean that some people will get sick, some people will get very sick, and unfortunately some people will die."
Health Department secretary Kathrine Morgan-Wicks said the state was still on track to reach a 90-per-cent vaccination rate by December 1.
She said more than 331,000 Tasmanians had been administered their first dose of the COVID vaccine and more than 251,000 had been fully vaccinated.
Ms Morgan-Wicks said more than 25,000 people aged over 50 years old had not yet received a first dose of the vaccine.
She said those in the 12 to 15 year age group were lagging behind the vaccination rate of that cohort in other states.
Tasmanian specific modelling, to take into account the outcome of borders reopening at a 90-per-cent vaccination rate, by the Garvan Institute is due to be released in mid-October.
Mr Gutwein said that rate still left 130,000 Tasmanians unvaccinated, including 45,000 unvaccinated adults across various age groups.
Mr Gutwein said borders were planned to be reopened by Christmas, however, that depended on circumstances around COVID-19 in other jurisdictions.
He said modelling from the Garvan Institute would determine what border entry requirements, such as testing, might be imposed on people who wanted to come to Tasmania.

Another submission tells of an 80-year-old woman who passed away at Cessnock Hospital from a heart condition because there weren't any beds free at Maitland Hospital or John Hunter Hospital.
She had presented to the hospital on three separate occasions with the same condition and had been transferred to the other hospitals which had cardiac equipment.
Earlier this month, the State Government released its roadmap out of COVID-19 lockdowns.
The roadmap, based on modelling by the Doherty Institute, suggested NSW could begin to ease restrictions once 70 per cent of the adult population was fully vaccinated against the virus.
The Doherty Institute has since conducted a "sensitive analysis" of its modelling which was presented to the National Cabinet last week.
The analysis suggests it would be "prudent" to maintain restrictions in areas of concern where there are thousands of cases per day until Australia reaches 80 per cent of the adult population double jabbed.
In a statement, the Institute said, "these findings confirm our earlier strategic advice that even high levels of vaccination will not be sufficient to stop COVID-19 in its tracks".
That could mean an increase in COVID-19 cases across the state as it opens up and an upswing in hospitalisation, patients in ICU and deaths.
"It's every rural and regional health officials nightmare, I would think, and it should be," Ms Hayes said.
"It is obvious hospital healthcare services in rural regions are under-resourced ... They can't cope with what's happening day to day.
"They know that they are barely getting through with what they have for you or me walking in with a regular event without throwing in a virus that knows no boundaries."
At the coalface, there is fatigue. Health advocates and professionals described a dedicated workforce of nurses, doctors, paramedics and other professionals, but also a workforce weary off the back of two years of fire, flood, a mouse plague and the pandemic.
"We are at a critical point where we will start seeing doctors burn out next year from working extra hours, there will be those charging a greater gap because business costs have gone up and there will be no general practitioners for new patients in the area," Dr Debra King, North Coast representative on the Royal Australian College of General Practitioners NSW board said.
"This all results in a rise in chronic illness because people won't be attending their doctor regularly and they will attend hospital emergency departments instead. General practitioners are getting burnt out with the increased workload. Our workforce doesn't go up, we just work longer hours."
It is a message repeated by Scott Beaton, vice-president of the Australian Paramedics Association and paramedic based in Gilgandra.
"We've seen an increase in workload obviously in Dubbo and those areas where there are high amounts of COVID positive patients," he said.
"So we not only have our normal workload to deal with, but then we're topped up with more problems from the extra patients requiring hospitalisation or transport to the hospital for COVID issues.
"Obviously in regional NSW we have a limited amount of health resources. Any extra stress or strain on regional and rural health is going to cause a serious issue."

Full text: Significant concerns have been raised over the NSW regional, rural and remote health system's ability to cope with a potential surge in COVID-19 cases as the state re-opens from its pandemic hibernation.
Submissions and witness testimony to a State parliamentary inquiry that began in September last year paint a picture of an already chronically ill system.
How that system will cope with the added burden of a predicted increase in COVID-19 cases filling beds and ICU wards and requiring transport to and from regional and rural centres to receive expert care has medical professionals and community leaders deeply concerned.
Health Services Union NSW secretary, Gerard Hayes, said our regional and rural health care services were not prepared.
"I'm not saying this to be obtuse, but what we have seen over the past decade has been a system tightening its belt constantly and working to be as lean as possible," Mr Hayes said. "Now as many can work from home, city people are moving to rural locations compounding the pressure already lumped on the health system in these areas as it struggles to cope with a growing population."
A driving force behind the inquiry into health outcomes and access to health and hospital services in rural, regional and remote NSW, 60 Minutes reporter Elizabeth Hayes knows too well the system's flaws.
Ms Hayes' father, Bryan Ryan, died of a stroke at Manning Base Hospital at Taree after he was initially overdosed and then failed to receive his blood thinning medication for eight days.
"In all, it reeks of a system that needs urgent attention," Ms Hayes said. "If anything should be in ICU, it's the rural health system. These are people's lives and whether you're a worker at the coalface or a patient or a family who has had a terrible outcome ... It's devastating."
The parliamentary inquiry received more than 700 submissions statewide.
Among them are stories like that of a new mother presenting to Coolah Hospital with suspected appendicitis. She was told she would need to travel to Dubbo Hospital via her own transport because her four-month-old baby couldn't join her in an ambulance.
Twenty-four hours later, she was told she could go home and see what happened or have a CT scan. She opted for the latter.
The CT scan revealed a blocked and twisted bowel with her surgeon remarking "if this had been left [for] another 12 hours, it would have been a very different story".

Vaccinated youth key to Covid-19 freedom

Full text: Pushing Waikato's vaccination rates above 90 per cent requires young people to get the jab en masse - a feat that's proved challenging overseas.
The Government this week released modelling which shows how much different vaccination rates would protect New Zealand. A successful vaccination programme is seen as crucial to shifting the country away from using harsh lockdowns to control Covid-19 outbreaks.
On present numbers, about 70 per cent of Waikato's eligible 12-plus population has had one Pfizer dose, while 37 per cent has received two jabs - well below campaigners target of 90 per cent plus coverage.
Auckland University professor Nikki Turner, medical director of the Immunisation Advisory Centre, said Waikato and the country have a "good chance" of achieving 90 per cent plus vaccination coverage among older people by the end of the year.
Getting young people to agree to the jab, however, could prove more challenging.
"I think the population group that's harder to achieve this for is younger and midlife adults because a lot of them are healthy, they don't go regularly to a general practice, and they don't have to engage often with health services," Turner said.
International experience has also highlighted the challenges of getting young people vaccinated.
"What New Zealand is trying to do, and I applaud, is exploring all sorts of ways, lots of creative solutions, to make it easier for people to get vaccinated," Turner said.
On Saturday, Kingi Tuheitia will open a vaccination clinic at the Hopuhopu Sports Ground as part of a wider push to get Maori vaccinated. This week, the Maori king issued a statement, together with Sir Tumu Te Heuheu and Tumuaki Anaru Thompson, calling on Maori to get vaccinated against Covid-19.
"This is an important step in ensuring our reo, our tikanga and everything about being Maori stays here for generations to come," the leaders said.
Those getting vaccinated at the Hopuhopu event will get a $20 petrol voucher and go into a draw to win a trip to Rarotonga valued at $5000, as well as other prizes.
Lady Tureiti Moxon, who chairs the National Urban Maori Authority, said vaccination efforts targetting Maori have to be nimble and creative. Work also has to be done to counter vaccine misinformation spread on social media.
"There is still a lot of fear around the vaccine because of those conspiracy theorists. Our young people are online, and they pick it up there," Lady Tureiti said.
"We also have to give people a reason to get vaccinated beyond themselves.
"It's not just about me protecting myself. I'm doing this for a greater good, for my future generations, my whakapapa, for my whanau and for my grandchildren."
Clinical immunologist Dr Maia Brewerton said it's clear higher vaccination rates will allow the country more freedoms and lower the risk of the country's health system being overwhelmed in the event of a Covid-19 outbreak.
Contact tracing and people self-isolating when unwell will continue to be important measures, even when a community achieves a high vaccination rate. There will also be "a time and a place" for masks, such as when a person is in a confined space with others, Brewerton said.
One of the most powerful strategies people can use to encourage others to get vaccinated against Covid-19 is to share their own immunisation story.
"It really resonates with the people that know you, and there is a body of literature that tells us the most important influence actually comes from family and friends," Brewerton said.
"I do want people to understand that they can play a role beyond just getting the vaccine themselves. It might be sharing your story, it might be giving someone a ride, it might be helping them get information about the vaccine. All these things, if we do it together, can help us achieve a high vaccination rate."
Hamilton mayor Paula Southgate said the city council is exploring ways its staff can support the Waikato DHB in its vaccination campaign.
Southgate has shared her experience of getting the Pfizer vaccine and encourages others to get vaccinated. She experienced a sore arm and a mild headache after her second dose, all of which were preferable to getting Covid-19.
"We need to dispel any fears that people have that the vaccine is not safe, because clearly what is not safe is getting Covid- 19," she said.
Auckland University associate professor and vaccinologist Helen Petousis-Harris said achieving high vaccination rates in Waikato will require health officials to understand the different reasons why some people are reluctant to get the jab.
Barriers to people accessing the vaccine, such as a lack of transport, also need to be overcome.
There isn't a lot of evidence to suggest incentives, such as prizes and money, persuade people to get vaccinated. Small rewards, however, can prove effective.
"Some people get a buzz out of a lollipop. For me, I quite like a coffee," Petousis-Harris said.

Full text: Significant concerns have been raised over the NSW regional, rural and remote health system's ability to cope with a potential surge in COVID-19 cases as the state reopens from its pandemic hibernation.
Submissions and witness testimony to a state parliamentary inquiry that began in September last year paint a picture of an already chronically ill system.
How that system will cope with the added burden of a predicted increase in COVID-19 cases filling beds and ICU wards and requiring transport to and from regional and rural centres to receive expert care has medical professionals and community leaders deeply concerned.
Health Services Union NSW secretary, Gerard Hayes, said our regional and rural health care services were not prepared.
"I'm not saying this to be obtuse, but what we have seen over the past decade has been a system tightening its belt constantly and working to be as lean as possible," Mr Hayes said. "Now as many can work from home, city people are moving to rural locations compounding the pressure already lumped on the health system in these areas as it struggles to cope with a growing population."
A driving force behind the inquiry into health outcomes and access to health and hospital services in rural, regional and remote NSW, 60 Minutes reporter Elizabeth Hayes knows too well the system's flaws.
Ms Hayes' father, Brian Ryan, died of a stroke at Manning Base Hospital at Taree after he was initially overdosed and then failed to receive his blood thinning medication for eight days.
"In all, it reeks of a system that needs urgent attention," Ms Hayes said. "If anything should be in ICU, it's the rural health system. These are people's lives and whether you're a worker at the coalface or a patient or a family who has had a terrible outcome ... It's devastating."
The parliamentary inquiry received more than 700 submissions statewide.
Among them are stories like that of a new mother presenting to Coolah Hospital with suspected appendicitis. She was told she would need to travel to Dubbo Hospital via her own transport because her four-month-old baby couldn't join her in an ambulance.
Twenty-four hours later, she was told she could go home and see what happened or have a CT scan. She opted for the latter.
The CT scan revealed a blocked and twisted bowel with her surgeon remarking "if this had been left [for] another 12 hours, it would have been a very different story".
Another submission tells of an 80-year-old woman who passed away at Cessnock Hospital from a heart condition because there weren't any beds free at Maitland Hospital or John Hunter Hospital.
She had presented to the hospital on three separate occasions with the same condition and had been transferred to the other hospitals which had cardiac equipment.
Earlier this month, the state government released its roadmap out of COVID-19 lockdowns.
The roadmap, based on modelling by the Doherty Institute, suggested NSW could begin to ease restrictions once 70 per cent of the adult population was fully vaccinated against the virus.
The Doherty Institute has since conducted a "sensitive analysis" of its modelling which was presented to the National Cabinet last week.
The analysis suggests it would be "prudent" to maintain restrictions in areas of concern where there are thousands of cases per day until Australia reaches 80 per cent of the adult population double jabbed.
In a statement, the Institute said, "these findings confirm our earlier strategic advice that even high levels of vaccination will not be sufficient to stop COVID-19 in its tracks".
That could mean an increase in COVID-19 cases across the state as it opens up and an upswing in hospitalisation, patients in ICU and deaths.
"It's every rural and regional health officials nightmare, I would think, and it should be," Ms Hayes said.
"It is obvious hospital healthcare services in rural regions are under-resourced ... They can't cope with what's happening day to day.
"They know that they are barely getting through with what they have for you or me walking in with a regular event without throwing in a virus that knows no boundaries."
At the coalface, there is fatigue. Health advocates and professionals described a dedicated workforce of nurses, doctors, paramedics and other professionals, but also a workforce weary off the back of two years of fire, flood, a mouse plague and the pandemic.
"We are at a critical point where we will start seeing doctors burn out next year from working extra hours, there will be those charging a greater gap because business costs have gone up and there will be no general practitioners for new patients in the area," Dr Debra King, North Coast representative on the Royal Australian College of General Practitioners NSW board said.
"This all results in a rise in chronic illness because people won't be attending their doctor regularly and they will attend hospital emergency departments instead. General practitioners are getting burnt out with the increased workload. Our workforce doesn't go up, we just work longer hours."
It is a message repeated by Scott Beaton, vice-president of the Australian Paramedics Association and paramedic based in Gilgandra.
"We've seen an increase in workload obviously in Dubbo and those areas where there are high amounts of COVID positive patients," he said.
"So we not only have our normal workload to deal with, but then we're topped up with more problems from the extra patients requiring hospitalisation or transport to the hospital for COVID issues.
"Obviously in regional NSW we have a limited amount of health resources. Any extra stress or strain on regional and rural health is going to cause a serious issue."

Full text: Significant concerns have been raised over the NSW regional, rural and remote health system's ability to cope with a potential surge in COVID-19 cases as the state reopens from its pandemic hibernation.
Submissions and witness testimony to a state parliamentary inquiry that began in September last year paint a picture of an already chronically ill system.
How that system will cope with the added burden of a predicted increase in COVID-19 cases filling beds and ICU wards and requiring transport to and from regional and rural centres to receive expert care has medical professionals and community leaders deeply concerned.
Health Services Union NSW secretary, Gerard Hayes, said our regional and rural health care services were not prepared.
"I'm not saying this to be obtuse, but what we have seen over the past decade has been a system tightening its belt constantly and working to be as lean as possible," Mr Hayes said. "Now as many can work from home, city people are moving to rural locations compounding the pressure already lumped on the health system in these areas as it struggles to cope with a growing population."
A driving force behind the inquiry into health outcomes and access to health and hospital services in rural, regional and remote NSW, 60 Minutes reporter Elizabeth Hayes knows too well the system's flaws.
Ms Hayes' father, Brian Ryan, died of a stroke at Manning Base Hospital at Taree after he was initially overdosed and then failed to receive his blood thinning medication for eight days.
"In all, it reeks of a system that needs urgent attention," Ms Hayes said. "If anything should be in ICU, it's the rural health system. These are people's lives and whether you're a worker at the coalface or a patient or a family who has had a terrible outcome ... It's devastating."
The parliamentary inquiry received more than 700 submissions statewide.
Among them are stories like that of a new mother presenting to Coolah Hospital with suspected appendicitis. She was told she would need to travel to Dubbo Hospital via her own transport because her four-month-old baby couldn't join her in an ambulance.
Twenty-four hours later, she was told she could go home and see what happened or have a CT scan. She opted for the latter.
The CT scan revealed a blocked and twisted bowel with her surgeon remarking "if this had been left [for] another 12 hours, it would have been a very different story".
Another submission tells of an 80-year-old woman who passed away at Cessnock Hospital from a heart condition because there weren't any beds free at Maitland Hospital or John Hunter Hospital.
She had presented to the hospital on three separate occasions with the same condition and had been transferred to the other hospitals which had cardiac equipment.
Earlier this month, the state government released its roadmap out of COVID-19 lockdowns.
The roadmap, based on modelling by the Doherty Institute, suggested NSW could begin to ease restrictions once 70 per cent of the adult population was fully vaccinated against the virus.
The Doherty Institute has since conducted a "sensitive analysis" of its modelling which was presented to the National Cabinet last week.
The analysis suggests it would be "prudent" to maintain restrictions in areas of concern where there are thousands of cases per day until Australia reaches 80 per cent of the adult population double jabbed.
In a statement, the Institute said, "these findings confirm our earlier strategic advice that even high levels of vaccination will not be sufficient to stop COVID-19 in its tracks".
That could mean an increase in COVID-19 cases across the state as it opens up and an upswing in hospitalisation, patients in ICU and deaths.
"It's every rural and regional health officials nightmare, I would think, and it should be," Ms Hayes said.
"It is obvious hospital healthcare services in rural regions are under-resourced ... They can't cope with what's happening day to day.
"They know that they are barely getting through with what they have for you or me walking in with a regular event without throwing in a virus that knows no boundaries."
At the coalface, there is fatigue. Health advocates and professionals described a dedicated workforce of nurses, doctors, paramedics and other professionals, but also a workforce weary off the back of two years of fire, flood, a mouse plague and the pandemic.
"We are at a critical point where we will start seeing doctors burn out next year from working extra hours, there will be those charging a greater gap because business costs have gone up and there will be no general practitioners for new patients in the area," Dr Debra King, North Coast representative on the Royal Australian College of General Practitioners NSW board said.
"This all results in a rise in chronic illness because people won't be attending their doctor regularly and they will attend hospital emergency departments instead. General practitioners are getting burnt out with the increased workload. Our workforce doesn't go up, we just work longer hours."
It is a message repeated by Scott Beaton, vice-president of the Australian Paramedics Association and paramedic based in Gilgandra.
"We've seen an increase in workload obviously in Dubbo and those areas where there are high amounts of COVID positive patients," he said.
"So we not only have our normal workload to deal with, but then we're topped up with more problems from the extra patients requiring hospitalisation or transport to the hospital for COVID issues.
"Obviously in regional NSW we have a limited amount of health resources. Any extra stress or strain on regional and rural health is going to cause a serious issue."

Locked-down and out in Dan’s penal pandemic paradise

Full text: My hometown, Melbourne, is about to surpass Buenos Aires as the most locked-down city in the world during this pandemic.
It’s a fact my friends in Washington, where I lived until earlier this year, cannot comprehend. “How could that happen?” they ask me. “Why do Australians still put up with such restrictions?” I explain that Australia is six months behind the rest of the world on vaccinations because our federal government didn’t fight hard enough last year to secure global supplies. But things are improving, I say; in another month or so Australia will be about 70 per cent double vaxxed. By that time almost everyone who wants a vaccine will have had the opportunity to have one.
“Wow, that’s great, so you guys in Melbourne will finally be free then,” they say.
“Um, well, not real­ly,” I reply. “Even at 70 per cent, fully vaccinated people in Melbourne still won’t be allowed to eat inside a restaurant or drink at a bar, or go to the movies, or send their kids back to school full time or have a single visitor in our house.” There is silence on the phone from my friends, who are living freely despite the US being only 55 per cent fully vaxxed. “You’re kidding me, right?” they say.
I’ve been back in Melbourne for about six months, and it is easy to forget how abnormally cautious our so-called road map out of lockdown seems to the rest of the world. In the US, Britain and Europe, life and freedoms have returned to something close to normal despite having fewer than 70 per cent of their populations fully vaccinated. People still catch the virus and many still die. But unlike last year, when there were no vaccines, this is now a pandemic of the unvaccinated. Those getting ill and dying overwhelmingly are those who chose not to get the jab when they could have.
Yet even when Australia finally reaches those Doherty Institute milestones of 70 and 80 per cent, Victorian Premier Daniel Andrews is choosing to sleepwalk his way out of the pandemic. His road map to freedom released this week is so cautious, it has been dubbed a “road map of roadblocks”. His government has used the same Burnet Institute modelling as NSW Premier Gladys Berejiklian, yet at 70 per cent double vaxxed people in Melbourne will receive substantially fewer freedoms than their counterparts in Sydney. At 80 per cent they also will receive fewer freedoms.
This tells you why Melbourne is the rightful heir to the embarrassing title of the most locked-down city. That sad prize will be seen by many of Andrews’ supporters as proof of how he has protected his people. Instead, it is a reflection of the pro-lockdown mindset that continues to infect the Andrews government.
Andrews, assisted by the ultra-cautious advice of chief health officer Brett Sutton, believes the health risks posed by Covid when 70 per cent of people are double vaxxed are more dangerous than the damage indefinite lockdown is causing to children’s education, mental health and jobs.
Melbourne is barely recognisable as the city I left for Washington more than four years ago. It is beaten down by perpetual Covid-19 lockdowns. The physical scars of these – the hundreds of closed businesses and the emptiest CBD in the country – are easy to see. Less easy to spot is the devastation it has caused to children’s education, to mental health and to the psyche of the city. Melbourne has lost its mojo. I bet Buenos Aires looks equally shabby.
No matter what your view is of Andrews’ four-month lockdown of Melbourne last year, his eventual triumph over the (pre-Delta) virus at that time instilled in him a bias towards lockdowns that he is finding difficult to shake. He has abandoned his previous Covid-zero targets now only because Delta has got away from him.
I lived in the US during the worst of its Covid crisis last year and saw how it mismanaged the pandemic compared with Australia. But the tables are reversed now, with the US being awash in vaccines and opening up, while in Australia 60 per cent of us remain locked down amid a bumpy vaccine rollout.
“What has gone wrong Down Under? You guys were doing so well last year,” my American mates ask me.
When Melbourne finally emerges from its lockdown – in very minor ways – on October 26, the city will have been locked down for a staggering 267 days.
As the city’s Herald Sun puts it, that is “a shameful indictment on a government that has failed the people of Melbourne and Victoria at almost every turn over the past 18 months”.
One wonders how the exhausted people of Melbourne will feel as they watch Sydneysiders regain many of their freedoms at 70 and 80 per cent vaxxed while the Andrews government robs them of similar rewards. On October 4, Melbourne will win the lockdown world cup – straight to Dan’s pool room – when it surpasses the 245 days of lockdown experienced by Buenos Aires. Yet Victoria’s Premier still will refuse to reward his battered city with at least the same freedoms as Sydneysiders. As my American mates would say, “Goddamn it.”

Uncivil war a disaster of Premier’s making

Full text: VICTORIA is a state in deep crisis. Three violent protests in four days is just the tip of the iceberg.
As the state’s billion-dollar-a-week construction industry was shut down in reaction to a violent CFMEU protest, NSW announced construction will return to 100 per cent capacity on Monday, up from its current 50 per cent restriction.
This is in stark contrast from Victoria where the Dan Andrews government spitefully shut down the entire sector after CFMEU members staged a violent protest against mandatory vaccine passports outside CFMEU headquarters.
On Tuesday construction workers marched again, some carrying banners reading “F--k U Andrews” and “Setka the sellout”, before congregating on the West Gate Freeway.
Stung by criticism, the police response was stronger than the previous day but the protesters were not corralled, indiscriminately pepper sprayed or fined and arrested en masse, as we have seen with anti-lockdown protesters as recently as Saturday.
Instead they were allowed to take over a section of a busy freeway where they sang Daryl Braithwaite’s Horses and jumped on the back of flat-deck trucks.
One can only laugh at the gaslighting from union leaders, and relevance-deprived former Labor leader Bill Shorten, pushing the patently absurd claim Monday’s protest was some false flag operation. That desperate narrative deserves to be treated with the disdain reserved for flat-earthers and Greens voters; the CFMEU don’t tolerate impostors and they hardly need any help in behaving thuggishly.
On Tuesday the Dan Cult was being mocked as DAnon for advancing the fake tradie conspiracy theory rather than deal with the reality that a number of unions are opposed to vaccine passports.
The United Workers Union, Australian Manufacturing Workers’ Union, the Transport Workers Union and the Communications Workers Union are just some that have expressed opposition to mandatory vaccine passes.
As the protests continue many non-construction workers may join their ranks but this started as a CFMEU protest by CFMEU members. The reality is the great majority of those opposed to the ruinous policies of the Andrews government would never think of taking to the streets, it’s simply not in their make-up.
Premier Andrews has succeeded in turning Victorian against Victorian and has used the politics of division to seize greater personal power over the Labor Party, the crisis cabinet and the government.
And yet these are dark days for Andrews, for he owns every level of the disaster befalling this state.
ROAD MAP TO MISERY AFTER being shamed into releasing a road map, the Andrews government has delivered a document of misery and malpractice. Not so much a road map to freedom but a plan to inflict further crippling restrictions even once we reach 80 per cent double vaccinated.
Lockdown Six, sold as a seven-day short, sharp lockdown will in fact last more than 80 days.
NSW’s plan is imperfect and overly cautious, particularly when it comes to schools, but their citizens will be living relatively freely when the 70 per cent double-jabbed target is met while Victorians will still be under sweeping restrictions.
The harm being inflicted in the name of “Covid safety” now far exceeds the benefit.
Throughout this pandemic the modelling, both here and overseas, has been wildly wrong and always wrong in the one direction. The Burnet Institute is no different and as late as August 2021 released absurd, scaremongering predictions about Sydney’s outbreak topping 7000-plus cases a day.
“Furthermore, unless new controls introduced on 28 and 30 July or in the future (eg. LGAs that develop large case numbers are included in the tighter controls) have a major impact, our model projects that Sydney will have about 7700 cases per day four weeks from now,” the Burnet Institute claimed in an August 2 report authored by a quartet of their top experts, including the director and deputy director.
Well, the new controls didn’t have much of an impact and yet NSW never got anywhere near the doomsday predictions. More than 85 per cent of Victoria’s cases are concentrated in the west and northern suburbs and yet more than five million Melburnians remain under curfew with draconian restrictions that the rest of the world has long abandoned regardless of their vaccination rate.
The slavish adherence to health advice that is never released and modelling that has been consistently wrong sees Australia isolated from the rest of the world and trapped in a Covid hellscape of its own making.
We don’t need to wait for NSW to reopen to recalibrate the modelling as Premier Andrews claimed during Monday’s press conference. The rest of the advanced world, with the exception of Australia and New Zealand, is open and they opened with vaccination rates well below Australian targets.
We can look at their figures and how their hospital systems have coped rather than rely on flawed models designed by lockdown enthusiasts.

Twenty-four hours later, she was told she could go home and see what happened or have a CT scan. She opted for the latter.
The CT scan revealed a blocked and twisted bowel with her surgeon remarking "if this had been left [for] another 12 hours, it would have been a very different story".
Another submission tells of an 80-year-old woman who passed away at Cessnock Hospital from a heart condition because there weren't any beds free at Maitland Hospital or John Hunter Hospital.
She had presented to the hospital on three separate occasions with the same condition and had been transferred to the other hospitals which had cardiac equipment.
Earlier this month, the State Government released its roadmap out of COVID-19 lockdowns.
The roadmap, based on modelling by the Doherty Institute, suggested NSW could begin to ease restrictions once 70 per cent of the adult population was fully vaccinated against the virus.
The Doherty Institute has since conducted a "sensitive analysis" of its modelling which was presented to the National Cabinet last week.
The analysis suggests it would be "prudent" to maintain restrictions in areas of concern where there are thousands of cases per day until Australia reaches 80 per cent of the adult population double jabbed.
In a statement, the Institute said, "these findings confirm our earlier strategic advice that even high levels of vaccination will not be sufficient to stop COVID-19 in its tracks".
That could mean an increase in COVID-19 cases across the state as it opens up and an upswing in hospitalisation, patients in ICU and deaths.
"It's every rural and regional health officials nightmare, I would think, and it should be," Ms Hayes said.
"It is obvious hospital healthcare services in rural regions are under-resourced ... They can't cope with what's happening day to day.
"They know that they are barely getting through with what they have for you or me walking in with a regular event without throwing in a virus that knows no boundaries."
At the coalface, there is fatigue. Health advocates and professionals described a dedicated workforce of nurses, doctors, paramedics and other professionals, but also a workforce weary off the back of two years of fire, flood, a mouse plague and the pandemic.
"We are at a critical point where we will start seeing doctors burn out next year from working extra hours, there will be those charging a greater gap because business costs have gone up and there will be no general practitioners for new patients in the area," Dr Debra King, North Coast representative on the Royal Australian College of General Practitioners NSW board said.
"This all results in a rise in chronic illness because people won't be attending their doctor regularly and they will attend hospital emergency departments instead. General practitioners are getting burnt out with the increased workload. Our workforce doesn't go up, we just work longer hours."
It is a message repeated by Scott Beaton, vice-president of the Australian Paramedics Association and paramedic based in Gilgandra.
"We've seen an increase in workload obviously in Dubbo and those areas where there are high amounts of COVID positive patients," he said.
"So we not only have our normal workload to deal with, but then we're topped up with more problems from the extra patients requiring hospitalisation or transport to the hospital for COVID issues.
"Obviously in regional NSW we have a limited amount of health resources. Any extra stress or strain on regional and rural health is going to cause a serious issue."

Full text: Significant concerns have been raised over the NSW regional, rural and remote health system's ability to cope with a potential surge in COVID-19 cases as the state re-opens from its pandemic hibernation.
Submissions and witness testimony to a State parliamentary inquiry that began in September last year paint a picture of an already chronically ill system.
How that system will cope with the added burden of a predicted increase in COVID-19 cases filling beds and ICU wards and requiring transport to and from regional and rural centres to receive expert care has medical professionals and community leaders deeply concerned.
Health Services Union NSW secretary, Gerard Hayes, said our regional and rural health care services were not prepared.
"I'm not saying this to be obtuse, but what we have seen over the past decade has been a system tightening its belt constantly and working to be as lean as possible," Mr Hayes said. "Now as many can work from home, city people are moving to rural locations compounding the pressure already lumped on the health system in these areas as it struggles to cope with a growing population."
A driving force behind the inquiry into health outcomes and access to health and hospital services in rural, regional and remote NSW, 60 Minutes reporter Elizabeth Hayes knows too well the system's flaws.
Ms Hayes' father, Bryan Ryan, died of a stroke at Manning Base Hospital at Taree after he was initially overdosed and then failed to receive his blood thinning medication for eight days.
"In all, it reeks of a system that needs urgent attention," Ms Hayes said. "If anything should be in ICU, it's the rural health system. These are people's lives and whether you're a worker at the coalface or a patient or a family who has had a terrible outcome ... It's devastating."
The parliamentary inquiry received more than 700 submissions statewide.
Among them are stories like that of a new mother presenting to Coolah Hospital with suspected appendicitis. She was told she would need to travel to Dubbo Hospital via her own transport because her four-month-old baby couldn't join her in an ambulance.

Ballarat hits 50% fully-vaccinated benchmark

Full text: More than half of Ballarat residents are now fully vaccinated, but one of the city's strongest voices in the vaccination race says more can still be done.
According to the latest data released by the federal health department, 50.1 per cent of Ballarat residents aged 15 years and over have received two doses of a COVID vaccine while 76.8 per cent have received at least one dose.
However, Ballarat is still behind other regional centres with Geelong currently at 81.2 per cent first dose and 53 per cent fully vaccinated and Bendigo at 79.2 per cent and 53 per cent.
In terms of nearby local government areas, Hepburn Shire is leading the way with 57.2 per cent of its population fully vaccinated and 80.2 per cent receiving a first dose, closely followed by Pyrenees Shire at 52.3 per cent and 76.3 per cent.

Ballarat has been lagging behind some of its regional counterparts with 3.2 per cent of the population receiving its second dose last week, compared to 3.6 per cent in Horsham and 3.4 per cent in Bendigo, but was ahead of Geelong which had just 2.8 per cent of its population receiving a second dose.
Ballarat is also ahead of both the national vaccination rate, which stands at 47 per cent fully vaccinated and 72.1 per cent first dose, and the Victorian rate of 44.1 per cent and 72.6 per cent.
Committee for Ballarat chief executive Michael Poulton said while the city was making steady progress, it could still do better.
"I think with the arrival of Moderna and the additional capacity to administer vaccinations through pharmacies and GPs of Moderna, we need to and we can rapidly accelerate towards 80 per cent plus," he said.
"If I look at the last 14 days, there's been a six per cent increase; in the last seven days, there has been a 3.2 per cent increase, so we made up for what was an ordinary week two weeks ago, but I would still describe it as steady and I think we need to do better than steady."
While Ballarat's vaccination rate is increasing, Mr Poulton said it was being overtaken by counterparts in Victoria and nationally and the rollout should be extended.
"If I look at Warrnambool and seeing the things that are happening down there, they are a smaller community but 56 per cent double dose, that's a fantastic effort," he said. "If I look at Hobart, it's 61 per cent double dose so we can do better and I think we can do better in terms of a Victorian context and also do better in terms of a national context.
"We've been relying on people coming to vaccination centres and we need to continue to have that as part of our armoury but now, with extra supply, we've also got to get out to workplaces, get out to hard-to-get communities and get into schools when schools open up again."
The latest statistics come as the Victorian government outlined its roadmap out of COVID restrictions which is strongly focused on the population crossing vaccination rate thresholds, targeting 80 per cent fully vaccinated to lift many restrictions and bring down the metro-regional border currently in place.
However, University of Melbourne epidemiologists believe 80 per cent might not be enough to avoid future lockdowns.
Professor Tony Blakely said vaccinating 90 per cent of the population down to the age of five could still result in lockdowns being used 14 per cent of the time.
"What the modelling shows is that at 80 per cent of adults vaccinated, life won't be tickety-boo next year. We need to do more than that," he said.
"Sometime early next year, probably, we'll get to 90 per cent. As people see their friends get incentivised because they see their friends getting sick, or as people realise that if they go to the pub or the community sports centre they need to be vaccinated."
It comes as updated Doherty Institute modelling, underpinning a national reopening plan, predicts stay-at-home orders will be needed with double-dose rates of between 70 and 80 per cent.
Its initial advice compared outbreaks seeded with 30 cases. But the institute has now taken into account scenarios with hundreds and thousands of cases.
Its epidemiology director Jodie McVernon said conclusions about the 70 and 80 per cent vaccine goals remained robust under the updated model.
But 'medium' public health safety measures should be retained during the transition between the targets in places like NSW and Victoria where new daily cases are in high numbers.
That includes staying at home except for essential purposes, retail and hospitality opening with density limits, working from home where possible and closed or graduated return to schools.

Full text: On August 4, the federal government released modelling it had commissioned, led by the Doherty Institute, that looked at the path to reopening. This modelling has been endlessly debated.
The Doherty report models scenarios based on different levels of vaccination, restrictions and contact-tracing. Which scenario is most likely?
Dr Michael Lydeamore, research fellow, infectious diseases at Monash University:
"The road maps that have been announced correlate most with the 80 per cent partial test, trace, isolate, quarantine scenarios, with a medium case load for the initial condition." (This 80 per cent scenario would equate to 914,357 cases in Australia with 35,322 cases hospitalisations, 7611 ICU admissions and 6402 deaths.)
Dr Lydeamore: "The health system will be very stretched, but it is within capacity. Don't forget those are cumulative over a six-month period, so there won't be 7611 people in ICU at once, they're spread out."
How big a difference does vaccinating children make
to the modelled outcomes?
Professor Nick Golding, Telethon Kids Institute and Curtin University:
"This is the thing that surprised us about COVID when it first emerged: it is surprisingly unable to transmit among kids. They can transmit it, but the numbers are much lower.
"Also, when you vaccinate the parents of those kids because they are not particularly able to transmit to one another ... you don't get that much transmission in schools, or sustained transmission. A lot of kids we see getting infected are getting infected by their parents at home."
Professor Jodie McVernon, Director of Doherty Epidemiology, Doherty Institute:
"When we looked at adding 12- to 15-year-olds over and above that target, they made a relatively smaller contribution [to reducing transmission]. At this point, if we had vaccination rates tracking with the 16-plus population at target percentages, anything else is a bonus."
Do the Doherty's scenarios assume vaccination rates stop
at 70 or 80 per cent, or rise
after reopening ?
Professor McVernon:
"In our simulation, vaccination coverage continues past 80 per cent to about 90 per cent. And that's obviously really important in the final control of disease."
Many of the scenarios assume optimal or partial test, trace, isolate and quarantine (TTIQ) effectiveness. Could this break down with large case loads?
Dr Freya Shearer, Senior Research Fellow, Melbourne School of Population and Global Health, University of Melbourne:
"We've seen, even in the last few months, states that have had higher case loads have been adapting, changing strategies, trying to find efficiencies in the way they do TTIQ. There are probably ways we can achieve similar levels in reductions of infectiousness with different strategies that are more efficient."
When the report was published, case levels were low. How big a difference does this make to the findings?
Professor McVernon:
"We undertook a sensitivity analysis where we seeded our outbreaks at 70 and 80 per cent [vaccine coverage] with hundreds, or thousands, of cases. Overall, our conclusions were robust.
"However, there was one important distinction. At the 70 per cent threshold, starting off with thousands of cases meant in this window ... between 70 and 80 per cent, when the system was more robust, we did see there was the opportunity for cases to grow more rapidly. And that led to overshoot - the ultimate size of the epidemic was bigger. The logical conclusion was jurisdictions should look at the situation they are in ... and those who are coming into the 70 per cent mark with thousands of infections should aim to keep case numbers as low as possible by continuing to suppress epidemic growth. We showed how medium restrictions were able to do that, until they got to the 80 per cent threshold."
(At 70 per cent, 977,638 cases are predicted 38,301 hospitalisations, 9143 ICU admissions and 7043 deaths.)
Professor James McCaw, Professor in Mathematical Biology, University of Melbourne:
"NSW is not having a complete open-up freedom day. We don't recommend that, and I don't see any evidence that's how states are approaching this. All the discussions in NSW and Victorian road maps are about a staged step-down of restrictions. That's compatible with the work we've got."
Will we need to wear masks once we pass the 80 per cent vaccination threshold?
Dr Lydeamore:
"I think masks are probably here to stay, even indoors. And I think the reason for that is they are a relatively low-cost impost that reduces transmission ..."
Is the NSW epidemic curve bending? Is that linked to vaccination? Is Victoria likely to see the same effect?
Professor McCaw:
"You can see a slow and steady decline in transmission potential in NSW, and that's almost entirely due to the vaccine rollout. There's been some small changes in behaviour and mixing within NSW. But it's mainly a vaccine effect ...We're seeing the transmission potential reduce in Victoria as well, due to the vaccine. The vaccine is a little behind ... and there are some slight differences in mixing behaviours ... But I would anticipate, over the coming weeks, Victoria's transmission potential would get very close to 1, if not drop under 1. And with that, it makes control that much easier."
On herd immunity ...
Professor McVernon:
"What we showed was, even at very high levels of vaccine coverage, we won't stop COVID in its tracks. We were seeing back in July many countries opening back up with freedom days, and seeing escalating case counts."

Covid Qld: No new community cases recorded, border bubble bursts

Full text: Queensland’s Chief Health Officer Jeannette Young has determined the Byron and Tweed shires would become part of the restricted New South Wales border zone from 1am on September 22.
Border zone residents who have been to Byron and Tweed will only be allowed to enter Queensland for limited essential purposes.
Queensland residents may only return to Queensland if they have entered a restricted area for limited essential purposes.
People from a non-restricted local government area who must travel through a hotspot to enter Queensland can do so if they transit using private transport without stopping.
Anyone who is in Queensland but has visited the area in the past 14 days should get tested if they have symptoms and isolate until they receive a negative result.
A public health alert has also been issued for Brisbane Domestic Airport after a previously confirmed positive case transited from New South Wales to the Northern Territory, via Brisbane.
The case was infectious on the flight to Brisbane and in the airport on September 17.
NED-3869-Covid-19-Exposure-Sites-Qld
NSW Health Minister Brad Hazzard said there had been “some cases” in the northern part of the state.
“It (lockdown) will be initially for seven days,” he said.
The stay-at-home orders also apply to anyone who has been in the affected areas since the following dates:
Kempsey LGA - 14 September
Byron LGA - 18 September
Tweed LGA - 18 September
NED-4339-New-South-Wales-LGAs-In-Lock-Down
There were 1,022 new cases recorded in NSW the 24 hours to 8pm on Sunday and 10 people died from the virus.
Earlier, it was revealed that Queensland has recorded no new cases of Covid-19 while Queensland Premier Annastacia Palaszczuk urged people to get vaccinated and trust health advice.
“Do not listen to misinformation on Facebook or social media,” she said.
“Go and see your doctor or come to one of our vaccination hubs.”
Ms Palaszczuk also confirmed the state’s vaccination total had hit the 60 per cent mark following the “Super Pfizer Weekend” campaign that ended a record 325,000 week in which 325,000 jabs were administered.
She again defended questions over the efficacy of Queensland Health’s exemption unit - declaring there was a “massive outbreak” of Covid-19 in New South Wales which meant the unit was required.
NED-4476-Covid-19-Vaccine-Rates-Brisbane
“If the virus came in here from New South Wales or Victoria then we would be in lockdown,” she said.
Ms Palaszczuk said Chief Health Officer Jeannette Young would determine whether to halt Queensland’s border bubble with the Tweed region after the Byron case.
“It’s a wait and see at the moment,” she said.
The Premier insisted she was not considering delaying Queensland’s opening until the state’s vaccination rate hit 90 per cent.
“That is misinformation that was being pedalled today,” she said.
“Let me say categorically, national cabinet is working on a national plan.”
Ms Palaszczuk pointed to Victoria’s roadmap, which will permit 30 people into a home once vaccination rates hit 80 per cent.
“We already have 100 people allowed into our homes, we have Queenslanders going about their normal business, going to cafes, restaurants and shops,” she said.
“We have record bookings at the moment for school holidays.”
The Premier revealed a Director-General in the Wide Bay was forced to stay in a caravan park due to the lack of vacancy.
As Queensland’s vaccination rate reaches 60 per cent, Ms Palaszczuk said there was still a risk of Covid-19 creeping across the border.
“We would have to go into lockdown then we would be fighting to get our freedoms back,” she said.
“I am trying to get Queenslanders vaccinated to protect our lifestyle and to protect our freedom.”
Ms Palaszczuk said national cabinet was working on a plan to limit lockdowns and border restrictions once further modelling from the Doherty Institute was available.
Queensland Vaccine Locator
New analysis by The Courier-Mail shows Queensland could have 80 per cent of the community aged 16 and older fully vaccinated by November 13 if the state government made “Super Pfizer Weekends” a fixture and other areas of the rollout collectively grew 5 per cent each week.
On that forecast, Queensland would hit 90 per cent of the adult population fully vaccinated by November 23, six days sooner than the current national forecast, assuming supply remains unhampered and demand is sustained.
But keeping Queensland’s borders shut until it reaches a 90 per cent vaccination rate will only extend the pain for the downtrodden holiday sector, the state’s peak tourism body says.

Full text: Home quarantine is a first step to restarting international travel
As the number of vaccinated Australians increases, the pathway to reopening the nation is becoming clearer. The announcement by NSW Premier Gladys Berejiklian on Friday that her state will start a trial of home quarantine for those who are fully vaccinated is an important step towards getting life back to normal. The levels of vaccination identified by Doherty Institute modelling to be sufficient to lift restrictions are rapidly approaching and a return to greater mobility is in sight. Melbourne also is considering a system of home quarantine, and pioneering work on monitoring systems already has been assessed in trials in Adelaide. Tasmania will trial a quarantine-at-home program for residents returning from regional NSW and aims to have 90 per cent of its eligible population double-vaccinated by December 1. Premier Peter Gutwein said a “spring into summer” ramp-up of vaccinations would aim to have 80 per cent of eligible Tasmanians vaccinated by Melbourne Cup Day (November 2) and 90 per cent by December 1. The Northern Territory has indicated its willingness to allow fully vaccinated people returning from certain countries to quarantine at home.
A system of home quarantine is essential to build the critical mass needed in passenger numbers to get airlines properly back in operation for international travellers. Freeing hotel beds occupied by quarantining citizens and visitors is another essential part of restarting the embattled travel sector. Qantas aircrew will take part in the NSW home isolation trial that will pave the way for the abolition of hotel quarantine for international arrivals. In total, 175 people will be allowed to stay at home for seven days, rather than in a supervised facility for 14. Location-based apps and facial recognition technology could be used to ensure compliance.
The home quarantine trial comes weeks after Qantas announced it would restart international travel in December, when double-dose vaccination rates reach 80 per cent. Qantas chief executive Alan Joyce has welcomed the home quarantine trials but said the airline would be looking for a further easing of restrictions before the expected reopening of international borders. Having confidence to make plans is critical for airlines and travellers. Travel-bubble arrangements have been beset by revisions and setbacks. On Friday New Zealand authorities extended the pause on quarantine-free travel within the trans-Tasman bubble for another eight weeks.
Ms Berejiklian said the NSW trial was the first step towards phasing out hotel quarantine and welcoming more travellers from overseas. “One of the things that we expect to occur at 80 per cent is to consider our international borders,” she said. “That’s Aussies returning home through Sydney Airport, but also our citizens having the opportunity to go overseas when previously they weren’t able to.” Only travellers who have had a Therapeutic Goods Administration-approved vaccine will be able to take part in the trial.
Managing Covid-19, even with high levels of vaccination in the community, will be a challenge. Henry Ergas wrote on Friday that the Doherty Institute report and the latest modelling by the US Centres for Disease Control and Prevention suggest the vaccinated are about five times less likely than the unvaccinated to catch Covid. The Business Council of Australia notes that vaccines dramatically reduce the risks of transmission and serious illness, so as we get closer to reaching our targets we have to lay the groundwork to reopen now. BCA chief executive Jennifer Westacott says the move to home quarantine will build much-needed confidence. We agree that hotel quarantine has been a crucial first response to the pandemic. But as the number of fully vaccinated people increases, we should get rid of the bottlenecks that stop Australians getting home and critical skilled workers getting into the country. The longer we delay planning to reopen and reunite, the bigger the risk to our international reputation as a good place to live, to do business, invest, visit and create jobs.

Death rates near lowest: Hunt

Full text: Australia is second only to New Zealand for the lowest number of coronavirus deaths per capita in the OECD - a sign the country's public health measures have worked to protect the population, Health Minister Greg Hunt said.
By yesterday evening, more than 70 per cent of the eligible population aged 16 and over would have had a first dose. Once 70 per cent of the population is fully vaccinated, the country can move into the next phase of the national recovery plan that will see fewer restrictions and increased caps on international arrivals.
More than 95 per cent of aged care workers have also had their first shot as the jab becomes mandatory for staff in the sector from today. That program will be discussed at national cabinet today as state and territory leaders look to mandate vaccinations for all healthcare workers.
Prime Minister Scott Morrison said the pace of the vaccine rollout means the double-dose target will be reached soon.
"Today we will hit 70 per cent of the country aged over 16 who have had their first dose. That 70 per cent double dose and 80 per cent double dose mark is within plain sight," he said yesterday.
Government analysis shows Australia has the second-lowest cumulative rate of COVID-19 deaths in the OECD, with just 0.75 deaths per 100,000 people.
In contrast, between February 24 and September 14, the US recorded nearly 308,000 coronavirus deaths or 93 per 100,000 people, while Britain recorded 89.4 deaths per 100,000.
Mr Hunt said it shows even as NSW records thousands of cases a week, Australians have been protected from the brunt of the pandemic by international border controls, testing and contact tracing, social distancing and vaccinations.
"The fact that we have the second-lowest per capita levels of lives lost means that tens of thousands of lives were saved not just last year, but this year as well.
"The focus on aged care, both workers and residents, has meant that there are dramatically different human outcomes from the Sydney outbreak this year as opposed to the Victorian outbreak last year," Mr Hunt said.
Across the country 95.8 per cent of the 252,625 people working in residential aged care have had at least one dose of a vaccine, and 76.9 per cent are fully vaccinated.
National cabinet will discuss mandating vaccines in healthcare workers more broadly. States including NSW, WA and Tasmania have already made immunisation a work requirement, and Victoria has plans to soon follow.
State and territory leaders will also receive an update on the outbreak in NSW, an update on the national plan, and an update on the scientific modelling behind the plan from the Doherty Institute.
So far more than 9.2 million people aged 16 and over, or 44.7 per cent of the eligible population, are fully vaccinated.
The ACT and Tasmania have fully vaccinated more than 50 per cent of the eligible population. In NSW more than 80 per cent have had one dose, and 49.6 per cent of those aged 16 and up have had two.
Victoria will have passed the 70 per cent first dose mark yesterday, while 42.4 per cent of the eligible population is fully vaccinated.

Full text: Donato calls for restrictions to go at 80 per cent vaccinations
All COVID restrictions should be lifted when 80 per cent of Orange's population is double vaccinated.
That's view of the member for Orange Phil Donato who has called on the state government to provide a more-detailed roadmap for the future once people are vaccinated.
Mr Donato said the restrictions should be lifted across the state once 80 per cent of NSW residents were double-dosed.
But he said if Orange reached that level before other areas residents should then be allowed full freedom from restrictions.
And he said the government should not be able to reintroduce health restrictions once the 80 per cent target was reached.
"The government's so-called Roadmap to Freedom more closely resembles the conditions of parole than it does a pathway to a life without COVID-19 health order restrictions," he said.
"The government says they 'intend to open up further freedoms' when hit 80 per cent double-dose vaccinations, flagging there will be ongoing health order restrictions beyond that point.
"Freedom doesn't come with terms and conditions or strings attached.
"We don't want them to keep moving the goalposts."
Mr Donato said the government also needed to clarify what restrictions would be lifted when 70 per cent vaccinations were reached.
"We now know (the premier's) 70 per cent goal is no real freedom at all, with many restrictions remaining," he said.

He said an Orange hairdresser had told him they would not re-open with those limits in place.
Mr Donato said he did not support a COVID passport, which keeps restrictions in place for the unjabbed.
He said it was up to people to decide whether to get vaccinated and those that didn't get vaccinated ran the risk of getting sick or dying.
"I'm not a supporter of vaccine passports," he said.
READ MORE: Orange council calls on government to assure 'COVID-safe' elections "The reality of policing it is going to be very difficult."
Mr Donato said it would be hard for shop owners to stop unvaccinated people entering their business.
Mr Donato said the state government should follow the Doherty Institute's modelling which showed the rate of COVID transmission fell when the 80 per cent target was reached.
"Given this is the accepted measure, 80 per cent vaccination is the official high target and therefore the point at which society should resume normality, free of health order restrictions," he said.

He said the uncertainty of the current situation was impacting businesses, costing people their jobs and putting people under stress leading to mental health problems.
Mr Donato also called on the government to re-open state parliament which is currently closed due to the pandemic.

Full text: Donato calls for restrictions to go at 80 per cent vaccinations
All COVID restrictions should be lifted when 80 per cent of Orange's population is double vaccinated.
That's view of the member for Orange Phil Donato who has called on the state government to provide a more-detailed roadmap for the future once people are vaccinated.
Mr Donato said the restrictions should be lifted across the state once 80 per cent of NSW residents were double-dosed.
But he said if Orange reached that level before other areas residents should then be allowed full freedom from restrictions.
And he said the government should not be able to reintroduce health restrictions once the 80 per cent target was reached.
"The government's so-called Roadmap to Freedom more closely resembles the conditions of parole than it does a pathway to a life without COVID-19 health order restrictions," he said.
"The government says they 'intend to open up further freedoms' when hit 80 per cent double-dose vaccinations, flagging there will be ongoing health order restrictions beyond that point.
"Freedom doesn't come with terms and conditions or strings attached.
"We don't want them to keep moving the goalposts."
Mr Donato said the government also needed to clarify what restrictions would be lifted when 70 per cent vaccinations were reached.
"We now know (the premier's) 70 per cent goal is no real freedom at all, with many restrictions remaining," he said.

He said an Orange hairdresser had told him they would not re-open with those limits in place.
Mr Donato said he did not support a COVID passport, which keeps restrictions in place for the unjabbed.
He said it was up to people to decide whether to get vaccinated and those that didn't get vaccinated ran the risk of getting sick or dying.
"I'm not a supporter of vaccine passports," he said.

Mr Donato said it would be hard for shop owners to stop unvaccinated people entering their business.
Mr Donato said the state government should follow the Doherty Institute's modelling which showed the rate of COVID transmission fell when the 80 per cent target was reached.
"Given this is the accepted measure, 80 per cent vaccination is the official high target and therefore the point at which society should resume normality, free of health order restrictions," he said.

He said the uncertainty of the current situation was impacting businesses, costing people their jobs and putting people under stress leading to mental health problems.
Mr Donato also called on the government to re-open state parliament which is currently closed due to the pandemic.
He said parliament provided opportunities for state members to put the government under scrutiny and be held accountable.
And he has questioned why Premier Gladys Berejiklian has called off her daily 11am COVID update press conferences.

Experts weigh risk of double-dose freedoms

Full text: Some epidemiologists say people in Victoria and NSW who are fully vaccinated against COVID-19 should immediately be given additional freedoms, such as interstate travel and quarantine exemptions.
Such a move would come with some risk, they say, as people who are vaccinated can still pass the virus on, but at much lower rates.
They say it is a question of how much risk political leaders are willing to take in states where the virus is endemic.
At least 39 per cent of Australians over 16 are now fully vaccinated, while 63 per cent have had a first dose. So far, only NSW has made tentative moves to ease restrictions for the vaccinated.
The states could consider dropping border bans on fully vaccinated people travelling to see double-dosed family members, or drop the requirement to isolate if exposed, said Emma McBryde, an infectious diseases physician and epidemiologist at the Australian Institute of Tropical Health and Medicine who has been modelling Australia's reopening strategies.
"If you're in Victoria and you have family in NSW, COVID-19 is essentially endemic in both states," Professor McBryde said.
"Particularly if they are both fully vaccinated, your risk is as low as it is going to be in the next several months. We have to start allowing vaccine-specific risk stratification now. And when we hit 70 or 80 per cent, that should just ramp up."
Driss Ait Ouakrim, an epidemiologist and COVID-19 modeller at the University of Melbourne, said forcing fully vaccinated people to quarantine for two weeks if exposed to the virus didn't make sense.
"Whatever we do, the number of cases, we know, are going to go up," Dr Ait Ouakrim said. "It would make sense if we were still chasing COVID zero. We're not any more, and the cases are going to go up."
So far, Victoria has not revealed plans to ease any restrictions for the vaccinated. In NSW, as of September 13, fully vaccinated people in non-hotspot areas can gather outdoors with up to five people for as long as they want.
There is strong evidence showing people who are fully vaccinated are far less likely to catch and pass on the virus, but they can still transmit. More than 7 million Australian adults are yet to receive a first dose of the vaccine.
Dr Stephen Duckett, who has been modelling reopening for the Grattan Institute, said: "It is, as with all these decisions, a trade-off. What risks are you prepared to take?"
Experts say it is difficult to work out how big that risk is. There is little evidence from overseas, and local modelling is not yet complete.
Associate Professor James Wood, one of the authors of the Doherty Institute's report on reopening, said: "Contacts between fully vaccinated people will be much lower risk, but if you allow large fractions of the population to increase their numbers of close contacts, then it will lead to some overall increase in risk."
The logistics of enforcing restrictions only on the unvaccinated present another hurdle.
A Police Association Victoria spokesman said: "It is beyond police to enforce a direction of this type, in isolation. It would require a combination of voluntary compliance, industry participation and a layer of enforcement support."
Polling by the Melbourne Institute suggests easing restrictions on the vaccinated might encourage about 20 per cent of people who are unwilling or unsure about vaccination to get vaccinated.
Tom van Laer, an associate professor of narratology at the University of Sydney, said: "A vaccination passport would combine punishment and reward, making it one of the best ways to endorse vaccination."

In America, health authorities issued new recommendations for people who were vaccinated when less than 20 per cent of Americans had received a first shot; vaccinated people could gather indoors in small groups, and even visit unvaccinated people.

"A vaccination passport would combine punishment and reward, making it one of the best ways to endorse vaccination," said University of Sydney associate professor Tom van Laer.

COVID plan lays out a cautious path to freedom

Full text: NSW has laid out its first detailed plan to get out of lockdown and, on balance, it is more cautious than many might have expected from the libertarian rhetoric that accompanied it.
According to the "road map to freedom" Premier Gladys Berejiklian announced yesterday, NSW will start relaxing the lockdown on the Monday after the double-dose vaccination rate in the population over the age of 16 passes 70 per cent. As a share of the total NSW population, that is a rate of 57 per cent.
For some anxious citizens, that timetable is far too rushed. Based on international experience, they would prefer that NSW waited until 80 per cent, which they say is the level needed to prevent a surge of serious cases among the unvaccinated.
In Florida, which relaxed the rules in May with a vaccination rate of under 40 per cent of its total population, the hospital system is now close to breaking point and about 350 people are dying each day. That is the equivalent of a death rate of 130 a day in NSW. NSW must certainly not repeat that experience.
Yet the detail of Ms Berejiklian's plan includes safeguards that should help avoid those outcomes, providing they are rigorously applied. One key point is that the plan does not specify a date for reopening apart from schools, which will restart from October 25. Instead, the plan ties reopening to a vaccination target, which maintains the pressure on people to get inoculated.
The 70 per cent trigger might be lower than some might like but it has not been plucked out of the air. National modelling by the Doherty Institute generated a fairly plausible scenario where deaths stayed reasonably low after reopening at 70 per cent.
The most reassuring aspect of the plan is that Ms Berejiklian is not promising that that Monday in the middle of October will be anything like the "freedom day" that ended lockdowns in US states such as Florida. Those jurisdictions gave in to pressure from business groups and citizens frustrated by lockdowns and scrapped all restrictions in one fell swoop.
The NSW road map envisages only a return to a situation like the stage 2 restrictions during the exit from the lockdown in May last year, with continuing capacity restrictions on public venues and tight limits on home visits.
Chief health officer Kerry Chant, who must play a crucial role in this process, also stressed yesterday that she is ready to bring back some restrictions if cases surge or vulnerable populations need extra protection.
One safeguard in the plan that should not be underestimated is the very tough approach it takes towards the unvaccinated. They will not receive extra freedoms in October. A new system linking vaccine passports and QR sign-in codes will still bar them from restaurants and non-essential retail outlets and it will still be illegal to enter others' homes. Ms Berejiklian has even said that she personally would not feel comfortable sharing a room with an unvaccinated person.
Some will complain that the measures against the unvaccinated are discriminatory and perhaps exceptions will have to be made in special circumstances. But, in general, the Herald agrees that in this case, the public interest in protecting the community outweighs the right to individual choice.
NSW is blazing a trail for the rest of the country by showing that high vaccination rates can gradually replace lockdowns and border closures as a means of controlling COVID-19.
But Dr Chant said yesterday she believed that NSW will still be dealing with COVID-19 for years.
Everyone in NSW would love to declare victory and return to life before COVID-19. But this is a long war and not a single battle. We will still need to be patient.

Full text: After the country reached more than 40 per cent fully vaccinated adults on Wednesday, the Prime Minister said the national cabinet’s reopening plan was a deal with Australians to end “the fear of future lockdowns”.
A report released by the Business Council of Australia on Friday, outlining the next steps required to lift Covid-19 restrictions, said inter­national border closures and lockdowns were costing the economy $4.3bn a week.
Pressure from business and industry groups for state leaders to stick with the plan came as the Nat­ional Skills Commission on Thursday said labour market conditions were easing, with one in four NSW employers standing down staff in August.
Mr Morrison said state and territory leaders must “hold your nerve” as millions of Pfizer and Moderna vaccines arrive in coming weeks, ensuring that by mid-October the country would have enough vaccine supply to double-jab all eligible Australians.
With West Australian Premier Mark McGowan saying he would not reopen the state until vaccine thresholds reached between 80 and 90 per cent, potentially delaying the lifting of domestic travel restrictions until April, Mr Morrison said it was time for the country to “live with the virus”.
“The next stage will be hard. We’re about to see that in NSW and Victoria. As they ease up, both states know hospitals will come under pressure, we’ll see case numbers rise, and that will be challenging,” he said.
“If you want to live with the virus, you inevitably have to pass down that tunnel.
“My advice to WA is get vaccinated and get ready – get your hospital system ready, get your health system ready and push through, and we can all reconnect and be one again.”
The BCA – representing the nat­ion’s largest employers – said before achieving the 70 and 80 per cent vaccine targets, governments needed to adopt the UK model of rapid antigen tests in workplaces and homes and prepare health systems for capacity surges during outbreaks. It released polling showing strong support – ranging from 71 and 77 per cent – for opening state borders and phasing out lockdowns when vaccine thresholds were met.
As the nation moves out of the suppression phase to stage two of the plan, the BCA said home quarantine should be introduced, ­arrangements put in place for the return of international students and skilled workers and digital proof of vaccination systems prepared to allow fully vaccinated Australians greater freedoms.
BCA chief executive Jennifer Westacott called on states and territories to follow NSW Premier Gladys Berejiklian’s lead in releasing freedom road maps to “put the nation first and start planning to rejoin the rest of the world … We can either move forward as one nation or risk standing still as a collection of divided states.
“Based on the national plan and informed by expert Doherty ­Institute-led modelling, this is a plan to end the friction that makes it too difficult to plan and do business,” Ms Westacott said.
“This isn’t just about the staggering economic cost of lockdowns, it’s about letting Aus­tralians see their loved ones again, meet up with friends and just get on with their lives.”
NAB chief executive Ross McEwan said businesses needed “clarity to plan for the future”, including more detail on exempting vaccinated residents when restrictions lift at 80 per cent vaccinated.
“European countries have provided this by implementing a vaccine pass, which gives people freedom to attend restaurants, sporting events, major concerts and domestic travel,” Mr McEwan said.
“Australia needs its own ­national vaccine pass, providing similar freedoms, ready to launch when we reach 80 per cent.
“This should be developed alongside existing plans for an international vaccine passport for Australians to prove their immunisation status overseas and on their return to Australia.”
Ms Westacott said any delays in reopening would be a “risk to our international reputation as a good place to do business, invest, visit and create jobs”.

Full text: Media sensationalism played a big role in hyping a one-in-a-million risk of death from rare blood clots associated with Australia’s preferred AstraZeneca vaccine. Coverage was so overblown many people in Sydney are still waiting for Pfizer jabs, rather than take the readily available Astra. Yet ABC health editor Norman Swan, an early critic of Astra, now says it may be more effective than Pfizer against the Delta variant of Covid.
Our medical regulators also harmed the vaccine rollout. The Therapeutic Goods Administration’s first approval came six weeks after US approval. Then the Australian Technical Advisory Group on Immunisation stoked vaccine hesitancy by first “preferring” Astra for over 50s, and then for over 60s. This left Australia with globally low vaccination rates in June at the start of the present Sydney outbreak.
Hindsight is easy but Astra was the logical choice for Australia a year ago. Labor would probably have made the same choice. Astra could be stored at normal refrigeration temperatures, was easier to handle and distribute and could be made in Australia.
More than 38 per cent of all Australians over the age of 16 are now fully vaccinated against COVID-19. Currently, more than 62 per cent of Australia’s population over the age of 16 have had one dose of a COVID-19 vaccine. More than 20.8 million doses have been administered in Australia.
As this column argued three months ago, Prime Minister Scott Morrison had little choice, with almost no Covid at the time, but to cave in to ATAGI’s “medical advice”, given the ABC and others would have blamed him personally for every Astra blood clot death. Morrison did eventually find his mettle in June when Delta hit Sydney, and on cue he was bagged by the ABC and Guardian for urging young people to see their doctor about an Astra jab.
Media coverage of virus escapes from quarantine has been just as flawed. Journalists should know hotel quarantine was agreed to by national cabinet. Victorian Premier Dan Andrews even claimed it was his idea. The premiers understandably wanted the money from quarantine to support CBD hotels that were struggling with low occupancy rates after the international border closure.
Morrison has largely ignored his critics on vaccination and quarantine to preserve the unity of national cabinet. This leaves him looking flat-footed as Labor premiers backflip on deals they have already agreed to. Few reporters call the premiers out. For example, journalists who could not give Labor state and federal politicians enough space to demand faster quarantine returns of Australians stuck overseas never questioned the premiers mid-year when they demanded dramatic reductions in overseas arrivals.
The truth is politicians did not know what they did not know at the start of the pandemic. Yet they got a fair bit right. From the decision to stop flights between Australia and China to the closing of our international borders and the introduction of JobKeeper, our leaders did a better job than most overseas governments. They got half a million Australians home and finished 2020 with among the world’s lowest Covid death rates – 910 dead from a population of 25 million – and the second best performing economy in the OECD.
The media did less well last year. Journalists jumped all over the Berejiklian government’s mishandling of the Ruby Princess in April 2020. Partisan reporters tried to pin it on then Home Affairs Minister Peter Dutton. An inquiry by the nation’s sharpest Queen’s Counsel, Bret Walker, pinned most of the blame on state health officials.
The media again split along partisan lines over the 112-day lockdown by Victorian Premier Dan Andrews, who held his own Commission of Inquiry that ended in the resignation of the head of his department and claims no one knew who decided on private security firms to run the state’s hotel quarantine.
The media Right went nuts, and still is on Andrews. The media Left fell in behind the “I Stand With Dan” hashtag on Twitter. Journalists who asked Andrews tough questions were targeted personally on social media. No journalist should “stand with” any politician, until they leave the business for PR.
Many journalists who defended every step Andrews made last year have criticised every Berejiklian step this year. They don’t mention Victoria’s much higher death rate. Nor do they admit reporters from this newspaper and Sky News have been just as tough on Berejiklian as Andrews.
By the middle of last week even the most provincial media defenders of the Labor premiers prepared to abandon their own national cabinet commitments in the name of Covid-zero must have been starting to see the light. Andrews on Wednesday admitted Victoria’s hard lockdown would not achieve zero Covid.
Alice Springs Deputy Mayor Jacinta Price says the vaccine rollout in Indigenous communities requires a “more targeted approach”.
He was accepting what Berejiklian had said for more than a month – only rapidly increasing vaccination would pare back the Delta virus. WA and Queensland Labor leaders Mark McGowan and Annastacia Palaszczuk will eventually reach the same conclusion. Journalists who can’t see the obvious just need to look at New Zealand’s latest outbreak.
Palaszczuk and her chief health officer disgraced themselves mid-year with false claims about AstraZeneca. They did so again last week when they allowed the families of NRL players across the state’s border even as they refused entry to a three-year-old who had been holidaying with his grandparents in NSW. As politics, it put Sir Joh Bjelke-Petersen to shame. Palaszczuk’s fearmongering on Doherty Report modelling in state parliament last week rivalled Craig Kelly for misinformation.
Worse have been the senior ABC women feeding into false claims about vaccination for children. Palaszczuk falsely implied Coalition governments were risking child safety when she knows young children are not approved for vaccination anywhere in the world. While they can catch Covid, it seldom makes them sick.
Neither has a timid, politically correct media been intelligent enough to look seriously at the cultural factors in Aboriginal Australia and in outer suburban Sydney and Melbourne multicultural communities that feed vaccine hesitancy and rapid case spread.
My Aboriginal contacts have been predicting a Covid disaster in outback communities all year. Cultural, family and lifestyle issues, more than poverty, racism or language, have assured the most vaccine-hesitant communities in Aboriginal and multicultural communities are also the ones with the highest smoking rates, the worst general health, the highest density per household and the highest rate of multi-generational families.
That sort of reporting is difficult. It’s much easier to lead bulletins with sensational claims of soaring case numbers, out-of-control virus spread and a failing hospital system, even though this is not what is happening.
Sydney’s hospital system is coping well. Lockdowns in Sydney and Melbourne have slowed the spread. Virus reproduction numbers are falling and in Sydney, it’s only just above 1. Case numbers in Sydney and Melbourne will continue to rise, but the curve will bend as vaccinations rates rise.
More interesting will be watching how the health systems cope in WA and Queensland when Delta inevitably hits the way it did in New Zealand.

Labor in a bind as it grapples with how to support a reopening

Full text: Bill Shorten has been busy. Across many radio and television interviews, and even in an opinion piece in the West Australian newspaper, the former Labor leader has been making himself heard on what the Morrison government - and implicitly, the Albanese opposition - ought to be doing.
"There's a very fine line between being too weak in opposition and too strong in opposition," he opined on radio last week. "I was opposition leader for six years. I guarantee you, that line is invisible to the human eye. You're either too weak or too negative. I think we've been getting the balance right."
Labor is in a difficult moment. The federal opposition has seen its political fortunes wax and wane this year as the vaccine rollout began and then faltered badly, the Brittany Higgins allegations surfaced, a well-received budget and lacklustre reply bit and then, tragically, the Delta variant took hold in NSW, then Victoria and then the ACT.
Albanese's line of attack on Scott Morrison - that he had two jobs: vaccination and fit-for-purpose quarantine - has worked until now.
But Australians are also eager for their freedoms. In the south-east of the country - even amid a sense of dread about COVID-19 becoming endemic, with all that entails in terms of illness and death - there is a desire to meet the moment, hit vaccination targets and reopen.
The federation is fracturing too, with Queensland and Western Australia enjoying their COVID-zero status and Liberal-led South Australia and Tasmania gone quiet.
There is a growing realisation in Labor's federal caucus that the "two jobs" attack line has a use-by-date as states hasten and hobble (respectively) towards the 70 and 80 per cent vaccination targets.
There is also concern within Labor about the polls. The Australian's Newspoll has the opposition ahead 54-46 in the two-party preferred vote and 40-36 on the primary vote. But The Age's Resolve Political Monitor tells a very different story, with Labor trailing 32-40 on the primary vote and lagging or line ball on a number of other key indicators. The most recent Resolve findings were widely discussed within the caucus and stoked significant concern.
The criticism is twofold: that Albanese has decided to outsource Labor's fate to Morrison and rely on the Prime Minister making mistakes (of which he has made plenty); and, secondly, that Shorten is correct when he argues Labor should be selling a more positive and ambitious agenda, with stronger public support for the domestically made AstraZeneca vaccine and a more clearly defined position around issues such as vaccination targets.
In the words of one caucus member: "Our fate is in Morrison's hands - he f--ks up or he doesn't. People are off Morrison at the moment but they aren't on to Albo. People want their kids back at school, they want to travel again. Only Tanya [Plibersek] can win it for sure as she's being positive."
Albanese's reluctance to embrace AstraZeneca, in contrast with Shorten, has been noted. So too has his initial reluctance to push back against Queensland and WA.
Victorian Premier Daniel Andrews further complicated the picture last week when he moved from aiming for COVID-zero to accepting the virus and vaccinating as quickly as possible.
Albanese is also pivoting in terms of his strategy. He has called for a $300 payment to encourage people to get the jab, for booster-shot plans and for 12-15-year-olds to be included in the rollout targets - as well as a plan for under-12 vaccination.
Labor's dilemma over whether and to what extent to back the plan to reopen Australia at 70 and 80 per cent vaccination coverage of the 16-plus population has run up against Annastacia Palaszczuk and Mark McGowan.
In a tweet, Palaszczuk claimed the Doherty Institute predicted 80 people would die each day after six months if the country opened at 70 per cent vaccination. In fact, the modelling predicted about 1457 deaths in the first six months, and that could be dramatically reduced to 13 deaths in six months with optimal public health measures.
Federal Labor's deputy leader, Richard Marles, was blunt on Friday. "I would be distancing myself from the comments of Annastacia," he said, before adding that he understood states without COVID-19 wanted to stay that way, and that premiers would stand up for their states.
The back-and-forth between Palaszczuk and Marles forced Albanese to attempt to clean up the split on Friday, which he did by heaping praise on the premier for her handling of the virus and avoiding his deputy's comments.
That state-federal division within Labor came a week after Shorten's comments that Australia must prepare to live with COVID-19, which was seen as a pivotal intervention by some in the party in getting the opposition to support the Doherty modelling and national plan to reopen the country. Morrison forcefully changed tack and made it a political issue two weeks ago when he said Australians "can't stay in the cave".
While federal Labor has equivocated, NSW Labor has backed the reopening plan as clearly as it can. Opposition Leader Chris Minns said the mood of locked-down voters in NSW was indisputable: they want this to be over. He acknowledges there is "debate" among his federal counterparts about the party's position on reopening.
For Albanese and federal Labor, there are months ahead of attempting to balance support for state Labor governments while also not being seen to oppose the gradual opening up of the COVID-affected states of NSW and Victoria.

UK Pfizer deal to speed up jab rates

Full text: Scott Morrison says Australia will be able to reopen sooner after striking a deal with Britain to immediately bring an extra four million Pfizer doses into the vaccine program, with the new jabs to “break the back” of the supply issues that have plagued the nation’s recovery from the Covid-19 pandemic.
As he rallied premiers to stick to the plan to reopen the nation, the Prime Minister said people from NSW would be able to travel overseas when vaccination rates reached 80 per cent, even if they were subjected to border closures from Western Australia and Queensland.
Health Minister Greg Hunt said recent deals with Britain, Singapore and Poland had brought forward the vaccination program by two months and there was enough supply for every Australian over 12 to get a jab.
“The burden and balance of vaccination in Australia will have moved forward two months, from October and November to August and September,” Mr Hunt said.
“There’s more than nine million Pfizer that are available (in September). A million Moderna in the last two weeks of the month on the current plan and, of course, the AstraZeneca, which is still seeing very significant numbers.
“Every Australian will be able to come forward as early as possible to be vaccinated if they haven’t yet.” Before a national cabinet meeting on Friday, Mr Morrison rejected Queensland Premier Annastacia Palaszczuk’s claim there would be more than 2200 deaths a month if the nation ­reopened when the population was 70 per cent vaccinated.
“That’s not what the national plan suggests and to suggest that that’s what the national plan is would be a complete misreading it,” Mr Morrison said.
With Ms Palaszczuk claiming children under 12 could be put at risk if state borders opened when vaccination rates increased, Mr Morrison declared there was “not a country in the world that has ­approved a vaccine for under 12”.
“To sort of hint that that was something that’s about to happen or should be happening now, I don’t think is very responsible,” Mr Morrison said.
NSW announced 1431 new cases up to Friday, and 12 deaths including a woman in her 30s. There were 208 new cases in Victoria and 18 cases in the ACT.
Mr Morrison said the Pfizer swap deal would bring more vaccines into the rollout this month, doubling the forecast September supply.
Australia will ship the equivalent doses to Britain in December, when there is not a local shortage of the vaccine.
“This will enable us to bring forward, significantly, the opportunity for Australia to open up again under the national plan,” Mr Morrison said.
He said this was the critical month to secure extra Pfizer doses as there were 11 million ­Pfizer jabs due in October and November.
The government also struck deals to secure extra Pfizer jabs with Poland and Singapore.
“This really does break the back of (the supply issues), I think it’s fair to say,” Mr Morrison said.
Two Qantas flights will bring Pfizer vaccines from Britain to Australia on the weekend.
Before the meeting of ­national cabinet, Ms Palaszczuk said she would demand updated modelling showing the impact of reopening on children aged under 12.
“Let’s have an educated conversation about these issues,” she said. “There is nothing wrong with asking decent questions about the safety of families.
“It is not about being against a national plan.” But The Weekend Australian has been told Ms Palaszczuk was subdued in the meeting.
Doherty Institute director Jodie McVernon told state and territory leaders children were included in the expert modelling.
She gave a briefing on the modelling, taking into account high case levels, which is expected to be publicly released on ­Monday. Health secretary Brendan Murphy addressed state and territory leaders on hospital capacity as case numbers increased.

The transition to living with 'endemic' COVID could be rough

Full text: In the Orwellian world of the pandemic, Victorian Premier Daniel Andrews' raising of the white flag on "COVID zero" was greeted positively by the Morrison government and with relief by many among the public who are at the end of their tether.
We've now officially moved into a new stage. As federal Health Minister Greg Hunt declared, "the pandemic has become endemic".
In accepting Victoria couldn't get back near zero, Andrews was following NSW Premier Gladys Berejiklian, who lost control of the virus. Only weeks ago there were hopes of suppressing the outbreaks in both states. When it was becoming obvious NSW was failing, Berejiklian was criticised for not locking down early and hard enough. Andrews went hard immediately - and failed too.
"Living with COVID is a reality - it's not an option," Berejiklian said on Thursday, sending the blunt message to premiers still set on COVID-minimalism that they'd have to accept the Delta world.
As they will. But not for some time, if they can help it. Watching Australia's third wave escalate, the Labor states of Western Australia and Queensland are dug in, trenchantly and vociferously, behind their efforts to keep cases out. The brawling between them and the Morrison government took on an even sharper edge this week.
Australia's federation is now more fractured than at any time during this crisis, in a toxic mix of policy differences and politics, exacerbated by the approaching federal election.
WA's Mark McGowan must be concerned about how he'll reintegrate his state into the rest of the country, which he accepts must happen eventually. With WA vaccination levels lagging, he's not tying himself down but says he'll set a date when "the time is right" (assuming he's not mugged by a runaway outbreak).
Economic imperatives for WA's opening will strengthen, but McGowan can usually outplay the federal government on the politics.
Last year Scott Morrison had to make an embarrassing withdrawal from the Clive Palmer challenge (subsequently lost) to the WA border closure, after it became clear local public opinion was strongly on the state government's side.
This week, federal Attorney-General Michaelia Cash, who's from WA, mused about how an action could be more successful in the changed circumstances of a vaccinated population (not that the federal government is planning to launch a case).
McGowan seized the baseball bat. "West Australians don't want me to bring [the border] down now, to give in to this sort of crazy bullying by the federal government, and infect our population, lose jobs and shut down part of our economy, including the mining industry," he said.
This highlights, incidentally, a point often overlooked in the heated political rows. Talk about "opening" WA and Queensland refers to opening borders. Internally, these states are "open" - unlike the shuttered NSW and Victoria.
McGowan is usually careful to avoid overreach. In contrast, Queensland Premier Annastacia Palaszczuk went over the top when she defended her closed border with an emotive claim about the danger to young children.
"You open up this state and you let the virus in here, and every child under 12 is vulnerable," she said. The federal government, and other critics, retorted that while young children caught the virus, very few got a severe illness, and they've not so far been vaccinated in other countries.
In the border wars, it's worth remembering the big border decisions - about reopening Australia to the world - rest with the federal government. That won't be done all at once; even so it will be challenging - for example, needing home quarantine arrangements as well as vaccination requirements.
The one bit of good news this week was the government's securing an extra 4 million Pfizer doses, in a swap deal with the United Kingdom.
The government's COVID strategy is built around the national cabinet "plan", underpinned by the Doherty Institute's modelling, and buttressed with the catchword "hope" and the promise of a great Christmas.
But grim realities will accompany the transition.
NSW is likely to reach 3000 to 4000 daily new cases this month, while Victoria is expected to rise above 1000 daily. In NSW, the state government is bracing for the month of October to be very bad for in hospitalisations and deaths.

More generally, the Australian Medical Association wrote to Morrison this week warning of a looming crisis in the public hospital system.
"As it stands, our hospital system is not ready to cope with an easing of restrictions, even with increased vaccination rates," the letter said.
The AMA suggested a vaccination rate of higher than 80 per cent of the adult population was likely to be required, "given the existing constraints on hospital capacity and staffing".
With Friday's national cabinet receiving a report on the health system and its workforce, the government appears inclined to regard the AMA pitch as part of its periodic appeal for more hospital funding.
But from what we've seen in NSW, with some hospitals coming under acute pressure, and evidence the WA system is already inadequate, hospitals are clearly a potential weak point in our defences as COVID cases rise quickly after restrictions are eased in coming months.
We know the Morrison government is now totally focused on getting life back to some normality. It stresses this will be done "safely".
In fact, it is less a matter of opening "safely" than minimising the risks inevitable in opening. That goes beyond the state of the health system to include issues such as subgroups in the population who might not be adequately vaccinated when the general community levels of 70 per cent and 80 per cent are reached.
The government is banking on the attention of people - who are now deeply frustrated if they live in NSW or Victoria - shifting decisively off the health issues once life is freer. That, however, will depend on effective management of an unpredictable transition.

We've now officially moved into a new stage. As federal Health Minister Greg Hunt declared, "the pandemic has become endemic".
In accepting Victoria couldn't get back near zero, Andrews was following NSW Premier Gladys Berejiklian, who lost control of the virus. Only weeks ago there were hopes of suppressing the outbreaks in both states. When it was becoming obvious NSW was failing, Berejiklian was criticised for not locking down early and hard enough. Andrews went hard immediately - and failed too.
"Living with COVID is a reality - it's not an option," Berejiklian said on Thursday, sending the blunt message to premiers still set on COVID-minimalism that they'd have to accept the Delta world.
As they will. But not for some time, if they can help it. Watching Australia's third wave escalate, the Labor states of Western Australia and Queensland are dug in, trenchantly and vociferously, behind their efforts to keep cases out. The brawling between them and the Morrison government took on an even sharper edge this week.
Australia's federation is now more fractured than at any time during this crisis, in a toxic mix of policy differences and politics, exacerbated by the approaching federal election.
WA's Mark McGowan must be concerned about how he'll reintegrate his state into the rest of the country, which he accepts must happen eventually. With WA vaccination levels lagging, he's not tying himself down but says he'll set a date when "the time is right" (assuming he's not mugged by a runaway outbreak).
Economic imperatives for WA's opening will strengthen, but McGowan can usually outplay the federal government on the politics.
Last year Scott Morrison had to make an embarrassing withdrawal from the Clive Palmer challenge (subsequently lost) to the WA border closure, after it became clear local public opinion was strongly on the state government's side.
This week, federal Attorney-General Michaelia Cash, who's from WA, mused about how an action could be more successful in the changed circumstances of a vaccinated population (not that the federal government is planning to launch a case).
McGowan seized the baseball bat. "West Australians don't want me to bring [the border] down now, to give in to this sort of crazy bullying by the federal government, and infect our population, lose jobs and shut down part of our economy, including the mining industry," he said.
This highlights, incidentally, a point often overlooked in the heated political rows. Talk about "opening" WA and Queensland refers to opening borders. Internally, these states are "open" - unlike the shuttered NSW and Victoria.
McGowan is usually careful to avoid overreach. In contrast, Queensland Premier Annastacia Palaszczuk went over the top when she defended her closed border with an emotive claim about the danger to young children.
"You open up this state and you let the virus in here, and every child under 12 is vulnerable," she said. The federal government, and other critics, retorted that while young children caught the virus, very few got a severe illness, and they've not so far been vaccinated in other countries.
In the border wars, it's worth remembering the big border decisions - about reopening Australia to the world - rest with the federal government. That won't be done all at once; even so it will be challenging - for example, needing home quarantine arrangements as well as vaccination requirements.
The one bit of good news this week was the government's securing an extra 4 million Pfizer doses, in a swap deal with the United Kingdom.
The government's COVID strategy is built around the national cabinet "plan", underpinned by the Doherty Institute's modelling, and buttressed with the catchword "hope" and the promise of a great Christmas.
But grim realities will accompany the transition.
NSW is likely to reach 3000 to 4000 daily new cases this month, while Victoria is expected to rise above 1000 daily. In NSW, the state government is bracing for the month of October to be very bad for in hospitalisations and deaths.

More generally, the Australian Medical Association wrote to Morrison this week warning of a looming crisis in the public hospital system.
"As it stands, our hospital system is not ready to cope with an easing of restrictions, even with increased vaccination rates," the letter said.
The AMA suggested a vaccination rate of higher than 80 per cent of the adult population was likely to be required, "given the existing constraints on hospital capacity and staffing".
With Friday's national cabinet receiving a report on the health system and its workforce, the government appears inclined to regard the AMA pitch as part of its periodic appeal for more hospital funding.
But from what we've seen in NSW, with some hospitals coming under acute pressure, and evidence the WA system is already inadequate, hospitals are clearly a potential weak point in our defences as COVID cases rise quickly after restrictions are eased in coming months.
We know the Morrison government is now totally focused on getting life back to some normality. It stresses this will be done "safely".
In fact, it is less a matter of opening "safely" than minimising the risks inevitable in opening. That goes beyond the state of the health system to include issues such as subgroups in the population who might not be adequately vaccinated when the general community levels of 70 per cent and 80 per cent are reached.
The government is banking on the attention of people - who are now deeply frustrated if they live in NSW or Victoria - shifting decisively off the health issues once life is freer. That, however, will depend on effective management of an unpredictable transition.

Full text: He says the Doherty modelling is “much more complex than a number and a simple three-word slogan”.
I wonder if he had those pearls of wisdom for his own leader, who this week led Queensland through a mire of confusing messaging, scary warnings of impending death and imagery of sick kids, all the while trumpeting her own three-word slogan of “keeping Queenslanders safe”.
Because it wasn't exactly a week of informed and constructive public debate down on George Street either.
It might have been different if Palaszczuk had just stood up Tuesday and apologised for the fact football WAGs were allowed to fly into the state over locked-out Queenslanders - something she ended up doing anyway, just four days late.
Instead, the Premier let her Chief Health Officer wear the fault and left her to defend her own Twitter death warnings at a long press conference she didn't attend herself.
Because Twitter is definitely the best place for public debate, not a press conference. Right?
Queensland Vaccine Locator
Oh the hypocrisy.
Palaszczuk was much more measured yesterday, using the press conference to try to reset after the horror week and call for a more nuanced debate on living with Covid.
That's not only best for public policy, but best for her after she was left so isolated this week by medical experts and federal Labor colleagues, and so politically outplayed by Canberra.

Full text: Despite Premier Annastacia minutes earlier calling for a national conversation around the risks associated with Australia’s plans to live with Covid, Queensland’s Chief Health Officer became visibly upset when asked what level of deaths she would be “comfortable with” in a scenario going forward.
That’s despite the Doherty modelling charting the numbers of infections, ICU hospitalisations and deaths under several scenarios, depending on different levels of restriction.
“Comfortable with? I’m a doctor, none,” she told the reporter.
“Can you please remember who I am?
“I stand up here every day but ultimately I went into medicine to save lives.
“I’m not comfortable with any deaths that are preventable.
“So that’s why I want every single Queenslander who can be vaccinated to get vaccinated because that is the best protection and that’s why I’ve spent the last 19 months doing everything I can.
“Thank goodness I work with a Premier that we have here and the Cabinet to stop the virus coming into Queensland.”
Responding to a question that suggested she was “making political decisions”, Dr Young shot back: “I’m not making political decisions.”
“You’ve got me quite upset now,” she said.
“I do not want to see any death of a Queenslander that is preventable, whether it be due to smoking, due to obesity, due to high-alcohol intake, due to accidents that could have been prevented, due to road trauma, I could go on.
“That is what I’ve just spent the last 16 years of my life working on.
“So I don’t want to see any deaths.”
Queensland Vaccine Locator
Asked when she would be comfortable opening up and lessening restrictions, she said that would not be until “every single Queenslander has been given the opportunity to be vaccinated”.
“So it is up to individuals to choose whether they wish to protect themselves,” she said.
“Once they’ve had that opportunity, of course we make decisions, but I would not want to see the virus coming into Queensland without mitigating factors until that’s happened,” she said.

Full text: COVID DEATH FEARS DON’T ADD UP Palaszczuk slammed for use of selective worst-case data to ‘mislead’ on virus future PREMIER Annastacia Palaszczuk has been accused of misrepresenting the Covid deaths Australia faces by extrapolating worst-case scenario scientific modelling to warn of an impending body count despite vaccinations.
In a highly charged parliamentary performance, Ms Palaszczuk relied on a single graph to warn that: “Doherty Institute modelling predicts that even with 70 per cent of the population vaccinated, 80 people will die each day from Covid once the outbreak reaches six months after it started – that is 2240 who will die each month.” But her claims of mass deaths under the national plan were blasted as “false, misleading and wrong” by federal Health Minister Greg Hunt, who said “with optimal public health measures and no lockdowns” the Doherty modelling actually forecast just 13 deaths over six months.

Full text: Queensland has recorded a new locally-acquired case of COVID-19 in a truck driver and placed an entire family in hotel quarantine, with some of them unwell after they were believed to have returned from Melbourne.
Premier Annastacia Palaszczuk says the truckie, who lives at Windaroo, was picked among 10,433 virus tests in the 24 hours to 6.30am on Thursday.
The man, who is currently in NSW, was infectious in the community around Logan and the Gold Coast between August 28 and September 1.
"We are contacting him to find where he has been in Queensland," Ms Palaszczuk told parliament on Friday.
"This is an addition to the truck driver reported yesterday."
Health Minister Yvette D'Ath said authorities have also placed an entire Gold Coast family of five into hotel quarantine after the children told their classmates they had been to Melbourne.
She said early indications are the family returned to the state undetected via an inland route without going into hotel quarantine.
Ms D'Ath said it's a difficult situation because some family members are unwell with symptoms, but they're not cooperating with health authorities and contact-tracers.
"Some of the family members who are unwell, but we don't know if it's COVID we have to treat it as if it is," she told parliament.
"And so, the school is working with us on that and we really do hope the family do cooperate with us because it's in the best interest of everyone, including their own health, because we really want to make sure if they've gotten COVID that we are able to treat them."
Queensland has already been on alert after another truckie tested positive in NSW after being infectious while in the Sunshine State last week.
Authorities sent an alert on Thursday morning saying that driver had also visited a third service station at Bundamba, near Ipswich, also on August 26.
He later tested positive when he returned to NSW and Queensland authorities are trying to track down anyone who may have come into contact with him.
The case comes as Queensland's border is still shut to the southern state for all but essential workers who have had at least one vaccine.
Ms Palaszczuk says domestic hotel quarantine will reopen for Queenslanders stranded instate from Saturday.
The program, which was paused due to capacity strain last week, will only be open for 50 families initially.
The premier told parliament on Thursday that she wanted to see more modelling on the impact of opening on 0- to 12-year-olds before she made any commitment to easing border restrictions.
"I want to know what is going to happen to the children of this state," she said.
"It is a fundamental question that is omitted from any modelling."
Federal Treasurer Josh Frydenberg, who said the Doherty Institute modelling indicated more children would get COVID-19 but wouldn't have serious symptoms, urged premiers not to delay opening up.
"My message to the premiers and the chief ministers is very clear: Do not delay the inevitable. You have to learn to live with COVID. COVID may come to your state within a week, it might be a month, it might be a little bit after that. But the reality is we can't eliminate the virus," he told Nine's Today program on Friday.
"There's only one pathway out ... that's to get people vaccinated."
Queensland's vaccination coverage is the second-lowest in the nation after Western Australia.
Just under 52 per cent of eligible Queenslanders have had one vaccine and 32.28 per cent are fully vaccinated.

Full text: How times have changed. It was not that long ago that Prime Minister Scott Morrison was adamant NSW Premier Gladys Berejiklian's refusal to lock down Sydney despite a new outbreak was the right call. As Mr Morrison told Sky News: "My fellow Sydneysiders can feel very confident that if anyone can get on top of this without shutting the city down, it is the NSW government." In economic terms, Mr Morrison's logic was sound. Keeping COVID-19 at bay while keeping borders and businesses open is the best-case scenario. Globally, few cities or regions have managed such a feat. Sydney had led the way, and played a significant role in keeping Australia's economy afloat.
The passage of time has shown how misguided Ms Berejiklian was to delay locking down, but it has also highlighted the political shape-shifting going on. If you live in Perth or Brisbane today, going to the office, a restaurant or to a show is not unusual. Students are going to school. Life is relatively free of restrictions. Their economies are humming. Based on Mr Morrison's previous stance on NSW, you would think their success would get the PM's stamp of approval.
There is a big difference, of course. Western Australia has achieved its feat by shutting its border to the rest of the country. The national cabinet, which includes the Prime Minister as well as all state and territory leaders, has outlined a plan to ease restrictions once vaccination rate targets of 70 and 80 per cent are met, but West Australian Premier Mark McGowan and Queensland's Annastacia Palaszczuk have since distanced themselves from those thresholds.
There is too much politicking on this and some odd logic. Yesterday, Treasurer Josh Frydenberg repeated his comment that "if the borders remain shut and if all states don't follow the plan, jobs will be lost, businesses will close, the wellbeing of Australians will suffer, our debt burden will increase and our recovery will be slowed". It's a strange argument to make against states that, by keeping COVID-19 out, are keeping people in jobs and businesses open, and are not requiring financial aid from Canberra, which would further inflate the debt.
But there is a bigger reality that all Australians, wherever they live, are having to face. At some point, states like Western Australia and Queensland will have to open their borders and that will almost certainly mean that COVID-19 will enter. Do we accept that, or refuse to acknowledge the inevitable? Do we accept, too, the Doherty Institute modelling that found that if 70 and then 80 per cent of eligible Australians are fully vaccinated, then we can indeed "live with COVID" because the severity of illness will be so much less?
The Age has some sympathy for Queenslanders and West Australians, but it did not help this week when Ms Palaszczuk threw up a red herring when she linked a possible delay to border openings with the safety of children. While no vaccine has been approved for children aged up to 11, the virus has shown itself to be far less deadly in younger people. As well, health experts have warned against panic about children being exposed to the virus. The increased percentages of children being infected is purely because older Australians are now more likely to be vaccinated. The impact of the virus on children was part of modelling by the Doherty Institute presented to national cabinet including sections on the low rate of infections among children compared to older age groups.
It is a but a faint hope, but if we stick to the evidence as best we know it, avoid partisan squabbling - and get vaccinated as quickly as possible - we have a reasonable chance of emerging from this pandemic to resume some semblance of normal life.

Full text: How times have changed. It was not that long ago that Prime Minister Scott Morrison was adamant NSW Premier Gladys Berejiklian's refusal to lock down Sydney despite a new outbreak was the right call. As Mr Morrison told Sky News: "My fellow Sydneysiders can feel very confident that if anyone can
get on top of this without shutting the city down, it is the NSW government."
In economic terms, Mr Morrison's logic was sound. Keeping COVID-19 at bay while keeping borders and businesses open was the best-case scenario. Globally, few cities or regions had managed such a feat. Sydney had led the way and played a significant role in keeping Australia's economy afloat.
The passage of time has, of course, shown how Ms Berejiklian's delay in locking down was the wrong call but it has also highlighted the political shape-shifting going on.
If you live in Perth or Brisbane today, going to the office, a restaurant or to a show is not unusual. Students are going to school. Life is relatively free of restrictions. Their economies are humming. Based on Mr Morrison's previous stance towards NSW, you would think this would get the Prime Minister's stamp of approval for their success. There is a big difference, of course. Western Australia has achieved its feat by shutting its border to the rest of the country. The national cabinet - which includes the prime minister as well as all state and territory leaders - has outlined a plan to ease restrictions once vaccination rate targets of 70 and 80 per cent are met, but West Australian Premier Mark McGowan and Queensland Premier Annastacia Palaszczuk have since distanced themselves from those thresholds.
The Federal Treasurer has emerged as a key spokesman against their move. Mr Frydenberg yesterday repeated his assertion that "if borders remain shut and if all states don't follow the plan, jobs will be lost, businesses will close, the wellbeing of Australians will suffer, our debt burden will increase and our recovery will be slowed".
It is a strange argument to make against the states which, by keeping COVID-19 out, are keeping people in jobs, businesses open, and are not requiring financial assistance from Canberra.
But there is a bigger reality that all Australians, regardless of where they live, must face. At some points, states like Western Australia and Queensland will have to open their borders and that will almost certainly mean COVID-19 will enter. Do we accept that, or refuse to acknowledge the inevitable? Do we accept, too, the Doherty Institute modelling that found if 70 and then 80 per cent of eligible Australians are fully vaccinated, then we can indeed "live with COVID" because the severity of the illness will be so much less?
The Herald has some sympathy for the future of Queenslanders and West Australians because they face a difficult time if the country as a whole is indeed to begin the process of reopening and living with COVID.
But it does not help when Ms Palaszczuk threw up a red herring when she linked a possible delay to border openings with the safety of children. While no vaccine has been approved for children aged up to 11, the virus has shown to be far less deadly in younger people.
The impact of the virus on children was part of modelling by the Doherty Insitute presented to national cabinet, including sections on the low rate of infections amoung children compared to older age groups.
It is a faint hope, but if we stick to the evidence as best we know it, avoid partisan squabbling - and get vaccinated as quickly as possible - we have a reasonable chance to emerge from this pandemic to resume some semblance of normal life.

Federal fury at 'scaremongering'

Full text: A furious political row has deepened divisions over the national plan to ease lockdowns after federal ministers slammed a "scaremongering" claim from Queensland about the danger to children from rising coronavirus cases.
Angry at new objections to the agreed plan, the federal government accused Queensland Premier Annastacia Palaszczuk of misleading Australians over the risks to children if and when restrictions are eased and case numbers might rise.
Health experts have warned against panic about children being exposed to the virus when a steady increase in vaccinations among older Australians results in a greater proportion of cases among those under 12, given there is no approved vaccine for this age group.
Tapping into community anxiety on the issue, Ms Palaszczuk said the health modelling in the national plan needed to be revised to consider infections among children, citing concerns about a "pandemic of the unvaccinated" in the United States.
"Unless there is an answer on how these young people are going to be vaccinated, you are putting this most vulnerable population at risk," she said.
"There are many steps ahead of us towards this plan but the number one thing we can do is get as many of our population vaccinated as possible now."
The impact of the virus on children was part of modelling by the Doherty Institute presented to national cabinet in recent weeks, including sections on low rates of infection among children compared with older age groups. "While intense school-based mixing is anticipated between children aged five to 14, the transmission matrix accounts for the relatively low observed infectiousness of this age group, associated with a high proportion of asymptomatic infections," the report said.
Medical experts have warned against alarm about the rate of infection among the young, given public data showing very low rates of serious illness among children.
"They can catch infection easily but most cases have no or mild symptoms. You might not even know you've had COVID-19," Robert Booy, professor of child health at the Children's Hospital at Westmead, told the Herald last week.
Murdoch Children's Research Institute paediatrician Fiona Russell said last month the most recent experience in Britain suggested no increase in risks to children.
Federal government figures show low rates of serious illness and very few admissions to intensive care units among people younger than 14 during the pandemic. There have been no deaths among those aged 14 and under.
One Sydney boy, aged 15, died with meningitis and COVID-19 last month, the only death of any Australian under 20. Of the 1006 deaths from the virus in Australia to August 31, two were among people aged 20 to 29, compared with 924 among those aged 70 and over.
Treasurer Josh Frydenberg said the advice from medical experts showed the need for caution with children but this did not mean halting the national plan to ease restrictions in two stages when the vaccination rate reaches 70 and 80 per cent of those aged 16 and over.
Mr Frydenberg cited warnings from former Australian of the Year Patrick McGorry, a mental health expert and professor at the University of Melbourne, about the "shadow pandemic" placing pressure on all Australians, including the young.
"It is the one about kids really struggling from being out of the classroom and kids who are really struggling from not being with their grandparents or not being with their friends," Mr Frydenberg said.
With Ms Palaszczuk's remarks intensifying the debate over the risks to children, the federal government called a press conference in which Home Affairs Minister Karen Andrews denounced the Premier's remarks as "scaremongering" because it was at odds with advice from health experts.
The federal attack centred on the fact no country had begun vaccinating children aged under 12, which meant it was not reasonable to delay the national plan to wait for a vaccine to be tested and approved for this age group.
"Clearly everyone is concerned about Australia's children but there is no country in the world that is vaccinating anyone under 12 years of age," Ms Andrews said.
"The Queensland Premier is quite clearly doubling down on 'let's keep Queensland closed' and the federal government is of the view that Queensland should be open."

We deserve a better plan

Full text: Shutting down entire cities and towns every time there is a single case of Covid-19 is not a sustainable long-term policy going forward THE Top End has survived its latest Covid scare relatively unscathed. One case of the highly contagious Delta variant didn’t translate into widespread community transmission, even though the man who contracted the virus spent several days active in the community in Darwin and Katherine.
The three-day Darwin lockdown (four days for Katherine) no doubt helped stop the spread of the virus and the government has maintained its reputation as being best-in-class when it comes to managing the pandemic.
But the measures that were taken to combat a potential outbreak can’t be maintained forever.
Shutting down entire cities and towns every time there is a single case of Covid-19 is not a sustainable long-term policy.
Nor can we continue to shut our borders every time there is a coronavirus outbreak interstate.
As Tourism NT chair Michael Bridge revealed last week, that brief shutdown cost the industry $12m.
But that’s just a fraction of the damage that has been done to the Territory’s tourism business because of this pandemic.
Operators in Central Australia have been the hardest hit. Already cut off from the lucrative international tourism market, they’ve now been shut off from their two biggest domestic markets – Sydney and Melbourne – because of hotspot declarations.
Local initiatives such as tourism vouchers can only make up a fraction of what is being lost, and they come at the cost of increasing the government’s growing debt.
If the situation continues for too much longer, by the time our borders reopen there might be no tourism industry left.
It’s not just business being punished by constant lockdowns and border closures. This week a woman told Mix FM her harrowing story of being stuck in mandatory quarantine in Alice Springs.
She’d travelled home to the Territory from Melbourne where she’d been having medical treatment in the hope she could see her dying mother one last time before she passed away.
The woman was fully vaccinated and had returned several negative Covid tests but was still not permitted to leave quarantine.
She’d asked for one final solitary hour with her mother, but her request was denied.
The pain caused by that decision will no doubt last with her the rest of her life.
This situation is not sustainable.
The Territory, like the rest of the nation, needs a concrete plan for reopening. When the pandemic began, most people would have believed we’d be past the worst of it by now, especially if we’d developed an effective vaccine.
But more than 18 months on our lives are still in limbo.
Businesses don’t know if they’ll be open or shut from one week to the next, tourism operators can’t tell if they’ll be booked out or empty, and people can’t visit dying loved ones.
This is despite several effective vaccines being developed.
At the beginning of the pandemic our brightest medical minds told us of the measures we would need to take to suppress the virus.
The goal was to control numbers so our hospital system would not become overwhelmed.
But that strategy has been replaced with the utopian goal of eradication. We’ve managed to largely achieve that in the Territory for now, but it will be near-on impossible in the future, unless we plan to permanently close our borders.
That might be an option for Western Australia – as a jurisdiction that receives about 50 cents in GST revenue for every dollar it puts in, it’s in a position of strength when it comes to bargaining on this issue.
The Territory can’t exist in the long-term on a policy of closing its border to New South Wales and Victoria when our very existence – including the funding of home improvement schemes and local tourism vouchers – relies on revenue from those states.
This week the Doherty Institute released modelling to support a potential reopening when vaccination rates reach between 70 and 80 per cent.
It notes the importance of learning to live with the virus, rather than trying to eradicate it.
The institute notes the importance of improving public health measures so we can achieve this goal with minimum impact.
But it also provides some important context in a country that has become obsessed with reporting daily case numbers and deaths.
“In an average year of influenza, we would roughly have 600 deaths and 200,000 cases in Australia,” the institute says.
“Any death is a tragedy, but our health system can cope with this. In the Covid-19 modelling, opening up at 70 per cent vaccine coverage of the adult population with partial public health measures, we predict 385,983 symptomatic cases and 1457 deaths over six months. With optimal public health measures (and no lockdowns) this can be significantly reduced to 2737 infections and 13 deaths.” The institute says there is light at the end of the tunnel.
“Covid-19 won’t go away but it will be easier to control in the future,” it says. We need a solid plan for that future now.

Full text: Nearly one in 10 residents in the small western NSW town of Wilcannia have tested positive to Covid as the federal government faces tough criticism over its patchy vaccine rollout to vulnerable communities.
The rural town of less than 1000 residents, three-quarters of them Aboriginal, is home to another concerning cluster in the state's worsening Delta outbreak, with Wilcannia's tally climbing to more than 50 in just a few short weeks.
Federal National Party member for Parkes Mark Coulton said communities were being supported, but the recent outbreak had ramped up the urgency.
"I am concerned, and we have been concerned all the way along," Mr Coulton said.
READ ALSO: 'Staggered plan' for face-to-face learning announced "There's been a bit of misinformation on social media, a bit of hesitancy and a bit of trepidation at some of the [vaccines'] side effects that have slowed the uptake.
"We are seeing massive numbers now in Dubbo and the other western towns being vaccinated.
"It's been a bit piecemeal in a way, but bit by bit we're getting it covered."
READ ALSO: City's DREAM Festival succumbs to COVID-19 for the second year in a row The small western NSW town facing its first Covid outbreak Wilcannia Aboriginal Land Council leader Michael Kennedy, who is one of the small town's Covid cases, said things were different on the ground.
Mr Kennedy and his wife are both fully vaccinated but still contracted the virus along with their two children.
The region's Indigenous vaccination rates have fallen far behind the rest of the state. Less than 7 per cent of the Indigenous population in western NSW is fully vaccinated. The vaccination rate for the non-Indigenous population sits at 26 per cent.
Many of the town's Aboriginal residents have chronic diseases, Mr Kennedy said, making them among the first eligible for vaccinations.
But six months into the rollout, there was still hesitancy among the community and little support from those in government.
"It seems like they're winging it every day," Mr Kennedy said.
"There should have been a plan put in place a long time ago around these smaller communities.
"We always felt like we've been left behind and alone out here and it's no different now."
A national plan for vulnerable Indigenous communities The outbreak across NSW, which recorded more than 1000 cases on Thursday, has seen other Indigenous communities in rural and regional parts of the state affected.
Minister for Indigenous Australians Ken Wyatt told Parliament 34 per cent of Indigenous Australians had received their first jab, with 18 per cent being fully vaccinated.
Misinformation about vaccine side effects and its supply had been a challenge to increasing that rate, he said.
Labor's Indigenous Affairs spokeswoman, Linda Burney, argued the government needed to work harder to address the issues.
"There has to be, in my view, a national plan for vulnerable, Indigenous communities," Ms Burney told 2GB on Thursday.
Labor wants to bolster local vaccination resources and see localised data released on vaccination rates and supply, to identify areas of risk and need. Confusion and misinformation among the community would also need to be addressed.
The lag in rural and regional vaccination rates hasn't dampened the rhetoric over Prime Minister Scott Morrison's national cabinet-backed plan to peel back lockdowns and restrictions once the nation hits the first vaccination target of 70 per cent.
A modelling report released by the Doherty Institute has conceded there will still be Covid cases and deaths, but asserts health authorities could manage the response.
Mr Coulton said he'd love to see his predominantly rural electorate at even higher vaccination rates, but he had faith in the existing plan.
"The outbreak in western NSW has certainly focused people on getting vaccinated and I have no doubt that when the time comes, they'll be up there with the rest of the state," he said.
"If I could have 100 per cent of my people covered, that would be ideal. But we've got to have faith in the [health] advice that we're given, and if the advice says 80 per cent, then I'm happy to go with that."
Mr Kennedy is one of the lucky ones in Wilcannia. He's fully vaccinated and his family has avoided serious illness so far.
His concern remained focused on the rest of his community, which he felt had been an afterthought during the government's 18-month response to the pandemic.
"On an overall scale, [the government] needs to deal with these situations a lot better," he said.
"Wilcannia is not going to be the last small community to go through something like this."

Full text: THE Bulletin put the following questions to Premier Annastacia Palaszczuk after she backed away from the country’s reopening plan agreed at National Cabinet, which meets again on Friday.
■Once a 70 per cent vaccination target is reached, will you commit to Phase B which means lockdowns will be “less likely” and eased border controls?
■ Once an 80 per cent vaccination target is reached, will you commit to Phase C with no lockdowns, no caps on returning vaccinated travellers, increased student entry, extended travel bubbles to Singapore and Pacific nations?
■If you are no longer committed to those pre-agreed plan phases at 70 and 80 per cent vaccination rates, why not? And what’s the alternative?
■ You’ve been accused of removing people’s hope for an end to debilitating pandemic restrictions by appearing to pull away from the National Cabinet’s agreed reopening plan – your response?
■You’ve been accused of cruelling efforts to accelerate the vaccination rollout by not giving people goalposts for what will happen once 70 and 80 per cent vaccination rates are achieved. Your response?
■ What is being done – given the extreme hardship now evident for southern Gold Coast/northern NSW borderline businesses – to force the issue on moving the Tweed-Coolangatta dividing line further south to the Tweed River? Have you held talks with NSW counterparts on this? Is there any movement? Could we see change here within the next few weeks?
PREMIER PALASZCZUK’S REPLIES: “The Doherty modelling was predicated on an outbreak of just 30 cases. In NSW alone, on Thursday we’ve seen more than 1000 new cases and tragically, three deaths.
“The goalposts have shifted. That’s why the Federal Government has commissioned new research.
“I’ve been asking for the modelling all week. We need to see the modelling. “The latest Delta outbreak in NSW is having a huge impact on our community. “We’re working our hardest to contain Covid-19, keep people safe and deliver economic support for local businesses.
“Gold Coasters should have hope. It won’t be like this forever. “I urge all Queenslanders to please, get vaccinated. These are uncertain times. “But one thing is certain – having a vaccination is the single most important thing that people can do to hasten the end of the pandemic.”

Reinvigorated PM turns the tables on recalcitrant premiers

Full text: Scott Morrison is at his best when he is campaigning. And now he has a campaign. The Prime Minister has tapped into the anger that had been directed at him only weeks ago and has now turned it back on the premiers.
Any sense that the country was adrift has been arrested with Morrison’s strident performances this week.
Having appeared powerless against the premiers, who had been calling the shots, and vulnerable to federal Labor’s tactical attacks, he is now dictating terms to them.
Ironically, in the vaccine rollout he has now found a platform for the national leadership he had been accused of lacking.
It is one of the few domains of the commonwealth available to Morrison to re-establish some authority over the national cabinet.
In hindsight, it was remarkable that the state and territory leaders signed up to the national plan, given it would refocus the political attention back on them.
It is they, not Morrison, who will have to explain to their citizens why they remain locked down when a majority of people are vaccinated.
For the past 18 months, the politics of the pandemic have been about telling people what they can’t do. The political dynamic has shifted since the NSW outbreak, with almost 60 per cent of the country in lockdown.
Morrison has separated himself from the old thinking and aligned himself with what he believes will become an irresistible majority of people by the end of the year.
He will claim further vindication of his position on Friday when the revised Doherty modelling is presented to the premiers.
The Australian understands this will show that the national plan to reopen the country at 70-80 per cent vaccination rates remains sound at whatever level the case numbers may be.
It will show that the number of deaths from Covid-19 won’t be materially different if there are few cases or high case numbers.
This extinguishes the argument of the recalcitrants who want to keep shifting the goalposts on the national plan.
The same applies to the inclusion of 12 to 15-year-olds in the total vaccination rate.
Again, the Doherty modelling will show this doesn’t materially change the parameters.
In other words, another red herring by those seeking to crab-walk away from reopening out of fear that their public health units won’t cope. The election is still at least seven months away, but Morrison this week showed signs of a renewed confidence that has left Anthony Albanese dodging the big question while trying to bundle up a critical mass of the aggrieved in the hope of turning them into a constituency.

'They're winging it': Indigenous communities left behind in Covid outbreak

Full text: Nearly one in 10 residents in the small western NSW town of Wilcannia have tested positive to Covid as the federal government faces tough criticism over its patchy vaccine rollout to vulnerable communities.
The rural town of less than 1000 residents, three-quarters of them Aboriginal, is home to another concerning cluster in the state's worsening Delta outbreak, with Wilcannia's tally climbing to more than 50 in just a few short weeks.
Federal National Party member for Parkes Mark Coulton said communities were being supported, but the recent outbreak had ramped up the urgency.
"I am concerned, and we have been concerned all the way along," Mr Coulton told The Canberra Times.
"There's been a bit of misinformation on social media, a bit of hesitancy and a bit of trepidation at some of the [vaccines'] side effects that have slowed the uptake.
"We are seeing massive numbers now in Dubbo and the other western towns being vaccinated.
"It's been a bit piecemeal in a way, but bit by bit we're getting it covered."
The small western NSW town facing its first Covid outbreak Wilcannia Aboriginal Land Council leader Michael Kennedy, who is one of the small town's Covid cases, said things were different on the ground.
Mr Kennedy and his wife are both fully vaccinated but still contracted the virus along with their two children.
The region's Indigenous vaccination rates have fallen far behind the rest of the state. Less than 7 per cent of the Indigenous population in western NSW is fully vaccinated. The vaccination rate for the non-Indigenous population sits at 26 per cent.
Many of the town's Aboriginal residents have chronic diseases, Mr Kennedy said, making them among the first eligible for vaccinations.
But six months into the rollout, there was still hesitancy among the community and little support from those in government.
"It seems like they're winging it every day," Mr Kennedy said.
"There should have been a plan put in place a long time ago around these smaller communities.
"We always felt like we've been left behind and alone out here and it's no different now."
A national plan for vulnerable Indigenous communities The outbreak across NSW, which recorded more than 1000 cases on Thursday, has seen other Indigenous communities in rural and regional parts of the state affected.
Minister for Indigenous Australians Ken Wyatt told Parliament 34 per cent of Indigenous Australians had received their first jab, with 18 per cent being fully vaccinated.
Misinformation about vaccine side effects and its supply had been a challenge to increasing that rate, he said.
Labor's Indigenous Affairs spokeswoman, Linda Burney, argued the government needed to work harder to address the issues.
"There has to be, in my view, a national plan for vulnerable, Indigenous communities," Ms Burney told 2GB on Thursday.
Labor wants to bolster local vaccination resources and see localised data released on vaccination rates and supply, to identify areas of risk and need. Confusion and misinformation among the community would also need to be addressed.
The lag in rural and regional vaccination rates hasn't dampened the rhetoric over Prime Minister Scott Morrison's national cabinet-backed plan to peel back lockdowns and restrictions once the nation hits the first vaccination target of 70 per cent.
A modelling report released by the Doherty Institute has conceded there will still be Covid cases and deaths, but asserts health authorities could manage the response.

"The outbreak in western NSW has certainly focused people on getting vaccinated and I have no doubt that when the time comes, they'll be up there with the rest of the state," he said.
"If I could have 100 per cent of my people covered, that would be ideal. But we've got to have faith in the [health] advice that we're given, and if the advice says 80 per cent, then I'm happy to go with that."
Mr Kennedy is one of the lucky ones in Wilcannia. He's fully vaccinated and his family has avoided serious illness so far.
His concern remained focused on the rest of his community, which he felt had been an afterthought during the government's 18-month response to the pandemic.
"On an overall scale, [the government] needs to deal with these situations a lot better," he said.
"Wilcannia is not going to be the last small community to go through something like this."

Parents, don't panic about Delta

Publication info: The Age ; Melbourne, Vic. [Melbourne, Vic]. 27 Aug 2021: 13.

Full text: EXPLAINERWhat does the evidence say about the Delta variant's threat to children?
If the pandemic has had a silver lining up until now, it has been children. For reasons scientists still do not fully understand, they have been largely spared the ravages of COVID-19.
Some 986 Australians have died of COVID-19. Just one of those deaths was in a person 19 or younger.
But Delta, the virus variant no one saw coming, has changed the shape of the pandemic. Countries that thought their vaccine programs had defeated the virus now face a new wave of infections they are struggling to control.
The anecdotes are scary: children in hospital with COVID-19 in the US hit a record number of 1900 last week, although that's only a tiny fraction of the 11,521 Americans admitted to hospital every week. Nearly one in five new infections in the US is now in children. Hospitals in several US states report they are running out of paediatric intensive-care beds.
Meanwhile, Australians under 15 who do not have an underlying vulnerability remain ineligible for a COVID-19 vaccine.
A mood of panic has crept into the community, says Associate Professor Margie Danchin, paediatrician and immunisation expert at the Royal Children's Hospital in Melbourne. "It's important to get this data out there. There is this groundswell of panic among parents."
In general, COVID-19 is a very mild illness for children.
"They can catch infection easily but most cases have no or mild symptoms. You might not even know you've had COVID-19," says Robert Booy, professor of child health at Sydney's Children's Hospital at Westmead.
Of 393 children who presented to hospitals with COVID-19 in 2020 in Australia, just 44 were admitted and the rest were sent home. More than a third had no symptoms. In 4 per cent of cases, a medical intervention was necessary.
Which brings us to Delta.
More children are becoming infected with Delta, experts say. This is because it is a more infectious variant: everyone is more likely to be infected by it.
However, the evidence remains the same: for children, COVID-19 is a mild illness.
"In terms of ICU admission and deaths, there is no indication in the data," says Professor Danchin.
"Overall, parents need to know that kids still mostly get mild disease with a sore throat, runny nose and fatigue mostly, like a nasty cold, but they are very unlikely to get sick."
In November, a month before Delta was detected in the US, 1.8 per cent of people hospitalised there with COVID-19 were children. Cut to this month, and that has risen to 2.3 per cent.
"Data from the UK and other countries such as India also show the same - no increases in ICU admissions and deaths with Delta, and much lower rates than in adults," says Professor Danchin.
One infant is in hospital with COVID-19 in Victoria, the state government said on Monday. In NSW, between June 16 and August 7, there were 41 people aged 17 or younger in hospital with COVID-19 out of a total of 759.
All this adds up to the conclusion of the Doherty Institute's modelling for reopening Australia: in the first six months after we reopen at 80 per cent vaccination, of 762 deaths predicted (most of whom will be unvaccinated), 25 will be in children under 16. However, this model assumes that no one under 16 will be vaccinated, which is not the case, with vulnerable children aged 12 to 15 already eligible and a rollout still to happen for all 12-15-year-olds.
The Delta variant is about 60 per cent more infectious than the Alpha variant, which in turn was about 50 per cent more contagious than the strain of the virus that emerged in Wuhan. That means everybody is more likely to get sick - more adults, more children.
"There will be more infections in children and young people who are unvaccinated. There is no evidence, as yet, that Delta is making children more sick," says Professor Fiona Russell, a paediatric infectious diseases epidemiologist and spokeswoman for the Murdoch Children's Research Institute.
At the same time, vaccine programs are progressing around the world. These programs have typically prioritised the people most vulnerable to the virus: the elderly. Some 88.7 per cent of Americans over 75 have been vaccinated versus just 17.6 per cent of those under 18.
While vaccines are not 100 per cent effective at preventing infection, they substantially cut the risk of catching COVID-19. By giving them to adults, we dramatically cut their risk of catching COVID-19. So, simple statistics tell us that children will make up a bigger proportion of cases now than they did earlier in the pandemic because they make up a bigger proportion of unprotected people.
But this does not mean Delta is making kids sicker. The US data is "being taken completely out of context", says Professor Danchin.
The effect that vaccination has on making the virus look like it is targeting children can be seen in Victoria's infection data.
In July and August 2020, the peak of Victoria's second wave, people 19 and younger made up 16.4 per cent of diagnosed cases.
Between July 1 and August 23 this year, people 19 and younger made up 37 per cent of cases.
Why? In part because in July and August 2020, people aged over 70 made up 13 per cent of cases. In July and August 2021, they made up just 0.9 per cent.
This is evidence that a) the virus is more infectious and b) the vaccines cut your risk of catching it.
There is a third issue warping the situation in the US to make Delta look worse than it is for children: respiratory syncytial virus, also known as RSV.
A largely harmless virus in adults, it can cause severe infection - leading to hospitalisation - in children younger than one. About 58,000 American children are hospitalised with it every year.
RSV, like COVID-19, is a respiratory virus. That means lockdowns and masks also inhibit its spread. RSV was almost absent in 2020. When restrictions lifted, it came back with force.
Australia experienced a surge early this year, says Professor Russell, when, luckily, there was little COVID-19 around.
The US is being hit with both RSV and COVID-19 at the same time, putting the paediatric healthcare system under strain.
The protection that children seem to have to COVID-19 is unexpected. Typically, they are most at risk from respiratory viruses. Scientists are still trying to figure out why this is.
Children generally seem to possess a much more powerful innate system than adults. Work by Dr Melanie Neeland, published in Nature Communications, shows a much greater activation of the innate system in children with COVID-19 than in adults.
A second possibility: antibody studies show children "tend to display a more targeted antibody response to this virus" than adults, says Dr Neeland. This could be because adult immune systems have already had to fight off the coronaviruses that cause the common cold; memories of this virus may lead them to create less effective antibodies.
About 13.3 per cent of adults with COVID-19 have symptoms for at least four weeks, and 4.5 per cent for at least eight weeks.
In children, only 4.4 per cent have symptoms past four weeks, and just 1.8 per cent past eight weeks, according to a Lancet study.
"Our findings should be broadly reassuring," wrote the paper's UK authors. "For most children, COVID-19 is a short-lived illness."
The evidence on how much children pass the virus on remains very contested - so much so that a large study by Professor Booy published in JAMA Pediatrics in February found the evidence was too weak to draw any conclusions.
The Murdoch Children's Research Institute concluded that children over 10 transmit the virus at similar rates to adults; modelling by the Doherty Institute for the federal government concluded that vaccinating those under 10 would have almost no effect on slowing transmission of the virus.
Although the evidence is weak, it suggests transmission at schools is very low, the Murdoch institute concluded. Outbreaks at schools tend to be driven by outbreaks in the community, not vice-versa.
One answer is vaccination. In March, Pfizer claimed its vaccine was 100 per cent efficacious in children aged 12 to 15, based on an unpublished clinical trial. The vaccine is approved by the Therapeutic Goods Administration for children 12 years and older in Australia. The federal government has said children older than 12 will be vaccinated at some point but is awaiting scientific advice.
At this stage, there is not enough clinical data about the safety and efficacy of COVID-19 vaccines to offer them to children under 12.
While children remain unvaccinated, several experts say the best way to protect them is to ensure the adults around them are vaccinated. "It is the best thing people can be doing now, if they are concerned about their children - getting themselves vaccinated," Professor Danchin says.

Full text: The Prime Minister has tapped into the anger that had been directed at him only weeks ago and has now turned it back on the premiers.
Any sense that the country was adrift has been arrested with Morrison’s strident performances this week.
Having appeared powerless against the premiers, who had been calling the shots, and vulnerable to federal Labor’s tactical attacks, he is now dictating terms to them.
Ironically, in the vaccine rollout he has now found a platform for the national leadership he had been accused of lacking.
It is one of the few domains of the commonwealth available to Morrison to re-establish some authority over the national cabinet.
In hindsight, it was remarkable that the state and territory leaders signed up to the national plan, given it would refocus the political attention back on them.
It is they, not Morrison, who will have to explain to their citizens why they remain locked down when a majority of people are vaccinated.
For the past 18 months, the politics of the pandemic have been about telling people what they can’t do. The political dynamic has shifted since the NSW outbreak, with almost 60 per cent of the country in lockdown.
Morrison has separated himself from the old thinking and aligned himself with what he believes will become an irresistible majority of people by the end of the year.
He will claim further vindication of his position on Friday when the revised Doherty modelling is presented to the premiers.
The Australian understands this will show that the national plan to reopen the country at 70-80 per cent vaccination rates remains sound at whatever level the case numbers may be.
It will show that the number of deaths from Covid-19 won’t be materially different if there are few cases or high case numbers.
This extinguishes the argument of the recalcitrants who want to keep shifting the goalposts on the national plan.
The same applies to the inclusion of 12 to 15-year-olds in the total vaccination rate.
Again, the Doherty modelling will show this doesn’t materially change the parameters.
In other words, another red herring by those seeking to crab-walk away from reopening out of fear that their public health units won’t cope.
The election is still at least seven months away, but Morrison this week showed signs of a renewed confidence that has left Anthony Albanese dodging the big question while trying to bundle up a critical mass of the aggrieved in the hope of turning them into a constituency.

Full text: EXCLUSIVE THE Covid-19 Delta strain doesn’t affect children as badly as adults, preliminary research has shown, with kids more likely to fall ill with other viruses such as the RSV.
Paediatrician Professor Fiona Russell of the Murdoch Children’s Research Institute said children exhibited similar flu-like symptoms to adults but few have become seriously ill, even with the Delta strain. Long Covid also affected kids less, she said.
And new data from the federal Health Department has revealed that children were being treated in hospital in relatively low numbers.
Of the 11,672 Covid cases recorded nationwide between January 1 and August 20, just 3504 were under 20.
Just 2.85 per cent of infected under-20s were treated in hospital and 0.17% in ICU, compared to 17.74% in hospital and 2.47 per cent in ICU for those aged 20-plus.
The Murdoch is working with the Doherty and Burnet institutes on modelling on the health impact on children.
Prof Russell said she expected that childhood Covid case numbers would stay low. “When we look at common things that there aren’t any vaccines for, such as RSV – the Respiratory Syncytial Virus – which is a respiratory virus, we see 6000 hospitalisations in Australia every year in children under five but we don’t ever see anybody worrying about that and I mean we should be and we should be getting a vaccine for that of course.’’ Australian deputy chief medical officer Professor Michael Kidd said a higher proportion of children under 16 had emerged among Covid cases compared to last year.
“This is due to the increased transmissibility of the Delta variant, the rapid spread of Covid-19 among household members, but it also reflects the protection provided by vaccination to older people, especially those aged 60 years and above,’’ Prof Kidd said.
“By age group, the proportion of people hospitalised or admitted to ICU is much lower in children aged less than 14 years, compared to older age groups.
“The data continues to show that, thankfully, our children are at much lower risk than other Australians.’’ Murdoch Institute paediatrician Dr Shidan Tosif said research had shown that children’s innate immune system had enabled them to avoid the worst effects of the virus.
Although many children are infected at home, Prof Russell said, one way to rein in infections was to make schools and childcare safer. That meant improved ventilation, cleaning and ensuring teachers were vaccinated.
“We do know that Delta is transmissible and it’s highly transmissible in every age group.’’ Prof Russell said she expected the vaccination of healthy children from age 12 to start later this year. Of the 34 Victorians reported in hospital on Tuesday, one is an infant while 22 are under 40.

Jeannette Young says masks could stay even as other Covid-19 rules are relaxed

Full text: Queensland recorded six new cases on Tuesday but restrictions are still on track to ease, with 100 people to be allowed in homes, 100 per cent capacity at stadiums and one person per two square metres at indoor venues.
From Friday at 4pm, masks will only be mandatory when worn at stadiums and airports, but Dr Young said that could change between now and Friday.
“The one thing I do want to turn my mind to between now and Friday, depending where we are, is masks,” Dr Young said.
“Because we know how essential they have been so we just might need to look at whether there needs to be an extended period to some mask wearing.”
Infectious disease expert Dr Paul Griffin said it's a good idea to “get used to wearing masks” while the Delta virus remains on our doorstep.
“Masks will likely be part of our strategy for the foreseeable future, they’re not a perfect intervention, they don’t stop all transmission but as a part of a suite of comprehensive mitigation strategies they are very useful,” Dr Griffin said.
“It’s really a matter of when, not if, we will have cases … masks have probably been a really big part of how we stopped community transmission with previous incursions and they have limited the impact of our recent cluster.
“I suspect that (the outbreak) would have been much worse had we not already had masks in the community.”
People in South East Queensland must carry a face mask at all times outside the home and masks are mandatory at schools, stadiums, airports and on public transport.
You must also wear a mask if you can’t socially distance indoors or outdoors.
It comes as the New South Wales chief health officer Kerry Chant said masks could be kept around for years.
“In terms of the Doherty modelling, what they’re saying is around 80 per cent you have options and choices,” Dr Chant said.
“It’s not to say you’re not going to have to calibrate and respond your level of restrictions, what you permit – it may be that we actually have indoor mask-wearing for years in certain settings.”
Mr Griffin said other countries who faced diseases in the past have adopted masks without them being mandated.
“It’s the mentality we should be looking at here, is that someone of these basic mitigation strategies will become learnt behaviour it’s a basic behavioural change we should encourage,” he said.

Easing of border restrictions now up in the air as QLD Government strives to keep Covid out

Full text: NSW Deputy Premier John Barilaro gave hope for restrictions easing soon in the regio at a press conference today.
“I hope, fingers crossed, all going well, we can lift restrictions in the regions later this week,” he said.
Weekend protests and a Covid case at Ballina have done nothing to give the QLD Government cause to ease border restrictions however.
The QLD Government expressed sympathy for people who live in border regions, but did not apologise for making it a priority to stop Covid-19 from crossing the border.
Escalating Covid number in NSW and the failure to heed stay-at-home orders put previous plans to ease restrictions when vaccination rates hit 80 per cent in jeopardy.
QLD Deputy Premier Steven Miles said the four-stage plan for easing restrictions based by vaccination rates was “endorsed before the NSW outbreak”.
This comes in contrast to the message from Prime Minister Scott Morrison today, who insisted exploding case numbers in NSW do not change the vaccination milestones for easing restrictions and lockdowns
But the QLD Premier Annastacia Palaszczuk said national cabinet had also agreed the extra modelling needed to be done based on the current situation.
“They have commissioned more research because the goalposts have changed. It was premised on there being 30 cases in the community and now there are thousands,” the Premier said of the Doherty research.
She called protesting at the QLD/NSW border yesterday, “very disappointing”.
Ms Palaszczuk said while she understood the difficulties people were facing, it was the “kind of behaviour that puts people at risk”.
“NSW has stay-at-home orders for a reason. If you have a stay-at-home order, stay-at-home,” she said.
And those orders applied to QLDers coming into NSW for work.
The QLD government said it had done all it could to make life easier for those who worked on either side of the border.
A proposition to move the border checkpoint south to the Tweed River, that made “commonsense” in keeping the community together, had been “flatly refused” by the NSW Government Ms Palaszczuk said.
“We have tried,” she said, before urging people to lobby their local government representatives to support the move.
The NSW Deputy Premier John Barilaro claimed working with the Queensland Government to ensure NSW residents are not affected in their daily lives had been a hard task.
“The language that I am hearing from the Queensland Government, regardless whether we are in lockdown or not in that part of the state, I’m not convinced you will have any access across the border under the current situation,” Mr Barilaro said.
“The Queensland government has its own rules, and it’s probably one of the tougher borders to work with,” he said.
“Premier Palaszuck has been quite blunt about what she wants to see in that border, on vaccinations, movement of people and that makes it very difficult.
“We would negotiate via the cross border commissioner with other governments about access for authorised workers and health workers, emergency and health workers, which are important, but that doesn’t necessarily mean that you get the outcome that we want in NSW.”
Personnel from the Australian Defence Forces will join police on Wednesday to check people are complying with public health orders, and are permitted to enter QLD.
QLD Police said of the 1739 vehicles that tried to cross the QLD border yesterday, including 1060 freight vehicles, only 154 were refused entry for not having the required passes.
They said 210 essential workers had crossed the border, and they all had the required documentation.
Lynne Weir, acting chief executive Northern NSW Local Health District, said NSW Health was helping people who needed to cross the border get vaccinated.
“So essential workers - which are really medical practitioners - they need one dose but anyone who’s a critical worker, who may be a cleaner, caterer, administration, they need to be fully vaccinated to cross the border,” Ms Weir said.
“That’s the regulation at this stage, as you know they are changing.”
“We have vaccines available at Tweed particularly for those who need to be having their doses to cross the border.
“Last week we vaccinated our staff, ambulance and police to ensure people were ready to cross the border on Saturday.
Ms Palaszczuk reiterated the importance of strict border control, saying a person who tried to cross the border but was turned away, later tested positive to Covid-19.
She said her goal was always to suppress the virus and so there would be some limited and specified restrictions and lockdowns going forward.
“This is a book that hasn’t been written, folks,” she said.
“This is uncharted territory.”

Coalition's story shift political, not epidemiological

Full text: E ven as COVID-19 case numbers in NSW and Victoria rise dramatically, the federal government and its Coalition counterparts in NSW are seeking to change the narrative. Under their preferred storyline, the focus should not be on daily case numbers, which have increased with alarming speed in the past week, but on a new "normality" - a way of living with COVID-19 that accepts it is ever-present in the community.
Prime Minister Scott Morrison says case numbers "are not the whole story", but concedes "we need to suppress the virus as best as we can" while getting vaccination rates up. NSW Premier Gladys Berejiklian says she accepts "getting to zero across the nation ... will be an impossible task", and NSW Health Minister Brad Hazzard suggests "normality" may be just "weeks away" (read: October or November) if the good citizens of NSW keep up their work in getting vaccinated.
Their pitch is for us all to look to the horizon to see the hope of a more normal society and economy. It's an understandable political manoeuvre: the federal government must call an election before May next year and after a sluggish vaccine rollout, many backbenchers are rightly worried about their prospects. They want something to make it look like Australia can snap straight back into action by Christmas or earlier.
Lockdowns, such as those now in place in NSW and in Victoria, where restrictions are augmented by a nightly curfew, are immensely frustrating and are clearly testing community patience. This was evident on Saturday when protestors, some with malign intent, defied health orders.
There is a risk that civil obedience and trust in the authorities will crumble if hard lockdowns look to continue indefinitely. And with each tightening of restrictions, there are consequences for people's mental health and ability to earn an income. Ultimately, this also hurts the economy.
To deal with this dilemma, the federal government is pinning much of its messaging on the Doherty Institute modelling, which sketches a staged shift out of harsh restrictions. The modelling suggests the nation could transition to a lighter suite of pandemic restrictions, with only intermittent use of hard lockdowns, once 70 per cent of the population above 16 years of age is vaccinated.
But the analysis is highly conditional. The shift to easier restrictions - the "normality" Mr Hazzard talks about - is predicated on an optimal level of testing, contact tracing, isolation adherence and quarantine. It is based on a daily caseload in the tens of cases, or the hundreds. If cases are "in the 1000s or beyond", then the efficacy of testing, tracing, isolation and quarantine diminishes, and prolonged lockdowns would still be "likely", it says.
Mr Morrison says he has seen further advice about that modelling, which, he suggests, confirms the 70 per cent vaccination target still works even if we hit it carrying much higher case numbers. He has not shown that advice to the world. The state premiers appear split on the politics and practice of lockdowns, with Daniel Andrews in Labor-held Victoria continuing to push aggressively for suppression.
For now, the Herald believes he is right to do so. Vaccination certainly is the way out of this pandemic. But it will not work immediately. Restraining social contact, imposing mask mandates, limiting community movement until the rate of vaccination is very high are fundamental strategies towards adequately containing the spread of cases.
We cannot have politicians falsely venerating the 70 to 80 per cent vaccination threshold as the ultimate trophy, the sole and final hurdle. Unfortunately for all of us who are heartily sick of lockdowns, suppression still needs to be aggressive for now so that in October or November, when it's expected the nation will hit 70 per cent vaccinations, we will be in a position of strength to know where Australia goes next.

Suppression still vital in virus exit strategy

Full text: As COVID-19 case numbers in NSW and Victoria rise dramatically, the federal government and its Coalition counterparts in NSW are seeking to change the narrative. Under their preferred storyline, the focus should be less on daily case numbers, which have increased with alarming speed in the past week, than on a new "normality", a way of living with COVID-19 that accepts it is ever present in the community.
Prime Minister Scott Morrison says case numbers "are not the whole story", but concedes "we need to suppress the virus as best we can" while getting vaccination rates up. NSW Premier Gladys Berejiklian says she accepts that "getting to zero across the nation ... will be an impossible task", and NSW Health Minister Brad Hazzard suggests "normality" may be just "weeks away" (read October or November) if the good citizens of NSW keep up their excellent work in getting vaccinated.
Their pitch is for us all to look to the horizon to see the hope of a more normal society and economy. It's an understandable political manoeuvre: the federal government must call an election before May next year, and after a sluggish vaccine rollout, many backbenchers are rightly worried about their prospects. We all need a sense that we can eventually return to something resembling normal.
Lockdowns are immensely frustrating and are clearly testing community patience. This was evident in Melbourne on Saturday when thousands of people, some with malign intent, surged through the city in clear defiance of health orders.
There is a risk that civil obedience and trust in the authorities will crumble if hard lockdowns look like continuing indefinitely. And there is no doubt that with each tightening of restrictions there are consequences for people's mental health, for their ability to earn an income and, ultimately, for the economy. To deal with this problem, the federal government is pinning much of its messaging on the Doherty Institute modelling, which sketches a staged shift out of harsh restrictions. The modelling suggests the nation could transition to lighter restrictions, with only intermittent use of hard lockdowns, once 70 per cent of the population above 16 years old is vaccinated.
But the analysis is highly conditional. The shift to easier restrictions - the "normality" Mr Hazzard talks about - is predicated on an optimal level of testing, contact tracing, isolation adherence and quarantine. It is based on a daily caseload in the tens or the hundreds. If cases hit "the thousands or beyond", the efficacy of testing, tracing, isolation and quarantine diminishes, and prolonged lockdowns would still be likely, it says.
Mr Morrison says he has seen further advice about that modelling, which he suggests confirms the 70 per cent vaccination target still works even if we hit it carrying much higher case numbers. He has not shown that advice to the world. While all states are enforcing hard lockdowns where necessary, the state premiers appear divided on the politics. Daniel Andrews in Labor-held Victoria focuses his rhetoric aggressively on suppression and Ms Berejiklian on driving vaccine uptake.
For now, The Age believes suppression remains our most powerful tool. Vaccination certainly is the way out of this pandemic. But it will not work immediately. Restraining social contact, imposing mask mandates, limiting community movement until the rate of vaccination is very high are fundamental strategies towards adequately containing the spread of cases.
Unfortunately for all of us, who are heartily sick of lockdowns, suppression still needs to be aggressive for now so that in October or November, when it's expected the nation will hit 70 per cent vaccinations, we will be in a position of strength to know where Australia goes next.

'Lockdown is working': ACT records eight new Covid cases, all in isolation

Full text: The ACT has recorded eight new cases of COVID-19, bringing the territory's outbreak to 102 total cases.
All the new cases were linked and none were infectious in the community, but the territory's chief health officer conceded a shift in the territory's reporting systems made Saturday's figure "artificially low".
Two people are in hospital, but they are there for unrelated issues. More than 14,600 people in Canberra have been identified as close contacts.
ACT Chief Minister Andrew Barr said the news showed the territory was turning the corner, but warned against complacency.
"This is the lockdown working, but we are however starting to see exposure sites post the start of the lockdown," he said.
"This is a general warning to the community to please be careful when you're outside your home. The lockdown has significantly reduced the risk around new exposure sites, but there will still be some."
But Mr Barr warned the ACT's lockdown, due to expire in early September, would not end until the outbreak was crushed entirely.
"We would require day after day of zero cases and people not infectious in the community," he said.
The territory, which recorded 4683 tests on Friday, has also adjusted its reporting cut-off period to 8pm.
Chief health officer Kerryn Coleman conceded the shift made Saturday's cases artificially low. She expected Sunday's case numbers to return to where they were on Friday.
"[But it] gives us more time to analyze the data and give you more understanding about whether they were in quarantine or not and whether they were linked. This will help us see where the transmission chains continue to occur," she said.
"This is just a realignment; we will not be hiding or not reporting cases."
Dr Coleman revealed there were two cases yet to be traced to their source, including the first reported infection and a Downer Community case.
"We know that someone was infectious, and there has been spread to other cases. We don't know how that was introduced, it must be someone who was at that location at the time," she said.
"We're not interested in telling people off, what we really want these people to do is come forward [to get tested].
"It may be that there are two introductions from NSW, it may not be ... just the one ... It doesn't matter. What we want to stop is all of the ongoing chains of transmission."
The government also announced that Floriade and Nightfest would not go ahead this year, given the risk.

"Our aim is to get this support to businesses as soon as possible, recognising the financial pressures that are being experienced," he said.
Doherty modelling flagged a staggered reopening once Australia vaccinates 70 and 80 per cent of the over 16 population. But Mr Barr said he raised concerns at National Cabinet over a sudden reopening once those thresholds were met, given the jab took weeks to become effective.
"When the nation hits 70 per cent, I want Canberra to be closer to 80 [per cent] in it. And when the nation hits 80 [per cent], I really want Canberra to be closer to 90 [per cent]. We will do everything we can to achieve that," he said.
"Our jurisdiction continues to be a nation leading vaccination jurisdiction. I'm hoping that Canberra will exceed the national vaccination targets."
It comes after NSW recorded another 825 locally-acquired cases on Saturday, as the state government faced criticism over its delayed Sydney lockdown.
Mr Barr said the outbreak, which has skipped the ACT border, was proof "you need to take this seriously from the outset".
But he claimed regional lockdowns showed NSW was belatedly improving its approach.
"What is emerging is a very different approach. The NSW government, it would seem, is not repeating the Sydney mistake in regional NSW. That's a great thing, and that helps us," he said.
A number of new post-lockdown Covid exposure sites were identified in Canberra late on Friday night, including a number of shops at Westfield Belconnen. There are now more than 290 exposure locations in the ACT.
ACT Health named a number of shops in the Belconnen mall as casual-contact exposure locations during the first Sunday, Monday and Tuesday of the lockdown.
The shops include, Gift n Lotto Xpress, New Guardian Pharmacy, The Reject Shop, Coles, Aldi, the Food Forum, Woolworths and BWS. Aldi is also listed as close-contact site for Thursday, August 12.
The exposure site update includes close-contact listings for Chapman Primary After School Care on August 10 and 11.
There is a close-contact warning for Ginninderra Early Childhood Centre on August 17.
Easi Mart on the Kingston Foreshore has been listed for casual contact on Monday, August 16.
The arrival of 50,000 vaccination doses next week is set to bolster the ACT's campaign against Covid as the pandemic crisis escalates in the nation's two largest cities.
Dr Coleman expressed cautious optimism on Friday, one week into Canberra's lockdown.
"These cases that we have been seeing are what we would be seeing if we had not locked down anyway," Dr Coleman said on Friday.
"Now is the time at which we start seeing the impact of the lockdown."

Full text: Victoria is now unlikely to be able to eliminate the Delta variant of COVID-19, according to one of the country's leading epidemiologists, with continued restrictions and higher vaccination the state's best chance of getting out of lockdown.
The warning came as Victoria initially recorded 61 new cases (with a further 16 reported over the course of the day), regional areas locked down and all children aged five and over urged to wear masks outside the home.
Professor James McCaw, an epidemiologist at the University of Melbourne who advises the federal government, said lockdowns, intensive contact tracing and vaccination would be required to merely flatten the curve of the outbreaks in NSW and Victoria because the ability of the virus to spread had drastically changed in the past year. He said the situation was so "fundamentally different" with the Delta strain that not only were continued lockdowns required in Australia's most populous states, these restrictions would have to be bolstered with quarantine, contact-tracing and vaccination to stop the number of cases from increasing.
But amid signs that the national agreement over how to open up the country is fraying - along Liberal-Labor lines - Victorian Premier Daniel Andrews yesterday insisted that "the plan is the plan" and that his state was still committed to the 70 and 80 per cent vaccination targets in the Doherty Institute modelling "with very low case numbers".
"If you don't actively suppress this virus then when you do open up, we will have scenes the likes of which none of us have ever experienced in our hospitals," he said.
"That is why [at national cabinet on Friday], far from a sense of easing or a sense of moving away from the plan, there was an agreement ... about the need to update the Doherty modelling because [it] is not predicated on 10, 12, 15, 20,000 active cases ... it is in fact predicated on very small numbers of cases."
Victoria's stance echoes that of West Australian Premier Mark McGowan's and has the backing of the Queensland government.
However, NSW Premier Gladys Berejiklian - on the same day her state recorded a national record of 825 cases - said she was "heartened" by the conversations at national cabinet, though she could not "disclose too much" about a "change in attitude" among the premiers.
"In the last couple of days I've noticed a change in attitude amongst all of us," she said.
"We accept the Delta is here. We accept getting to zero across the nation, especially once you open up and live freely, will be an impossible task - no other place on the planet has done it."
The federal government backed in NSW's stance yesterday and said it could reopen on its current vaccination targets, regardless of daily case numbers and despite pushback from other states.
The Sunday Age can reveal that despite the 825 new cases in NSW, the Doherty Institute has reinforced its advice to the federal government - and national cabinet - that it is still possible for NSW to begin reopening when the state and country reaches the nationally agreed target of 70 per cent double-vaccinated citizens, even if it has hundreds of daily cases.
The institute's original modelling for government required that all states had at least 70 per cent of residents double-vaccinated.
The modelling assumes that case numbers will continue to increase and the reproduction rate of the virus will remain above one at 70 per cent but that hospitalisations and ICU admissions will decrease, as happens with influenza.
A spokesman for the federal government said that national cabinet had asked the institute to continue its work to model various reopening scenarios.
"However when we reach the 70 per cent and 80 per cent thresholds, the findings are clear that we can move forward with our reopening plan regardless of case numbers because there will be far less serious illness for our health system to manage."
But Professor McGaw said: "If we let the virus spread, we would have overwhelmed the hospital system in NSW weeks ago ... We're just keeping it in control and now it's an absolute race, and has been for some months, to get vaccination coverage."

Vaccines vital but they won't solve everything

Full text: We once hoped that if enough people were vaccinated against COVID-19 we would reach herd immunity - the point at which so many people were immune that outbreaks would no longer be able to circulate. In this scenario, the vaccine would have been the silver bullet. The pandemic would be over and, with luck, we would be rid of the virus altogether. Then along came the Delta variant.
Far more infectious than the original virus, it has been a game changer. It is now considered more likely we will only see the end of this crisis when nearly everyone, through vaccination or by being infected, gains strong enough immunity that COVID-19 loses its deadly sting and moves to being endemic, similar to other coronaviruses behind some strains of the common cold. The challenge is how to get to that point of blanket immunity while minimising hospitalisations and deaths along the way.
At the moment, with just over a quarter of eligible Australians fully vaccinated, the only way to contain the number of COVID-19 infections is to continue with strict lockdowns. But even at higher vaccination rates, large numbers of people, those who remain unvaccinated, will still have no immunity to the virus, and Delta has proven highly effective at spreading in those groups.
Israel is the most obvious case in point. A world leader when it came to rapidly getting the jab to its population - about 78 per cent of those 12 and older are now fully vaccinated - it is finding itself facing a fourth wave of infections and a rising death toll (more than 230 people have died so far this month) after it largely abandoned social distancing restrictions. It is now offering booster doses to further protect already vaccinated people and has reintroduced a range of restrictions.
The lessons for Australia are obvious. And the Doherty Institute modelling that underpins the national strategy for opening up supports this view. Reaching a high rate of vaccination is an absolute necessity, but it is not the cure-all sometimes cited by our political leaders. A double dose of vaccine may protect an individual from ending up on a ventilator in a hospital, but high rates of vaccination alone will not fully protect society. And recent studies show that while vaccines keep people out of hospital, their ability to prevent infection weakens over time.
As a result, the Doherty modelling shows clearly that if there is a high rate of infection in the community, even at an 80 per cent vaccination rate, we will still need a mixture of mask wearing and restrictions to keep the infection rate from growing. Which means, while we "learn to live with the virus" a range of levers including vaccinations, boosters, masks and further restrictions will be needed. Given that people are already well past sick of being locked down, some of those levers are going to be difficult to pull.
Overseas examples are not encouraging. In the United States, which is considerably more vaccinated than Australia, there have been more than 620,000 deaths in total and nearly 1000 people are dying each day. And yet there is still resistance from many to accept vaccination or to follow even simple rules such as wearing a mask.
Sound and sensible political leadership is going to be more important than ever as we navigate the path back to normality. Each of us will also need to recognise that while getting vaccinated is imperative, our success may well depend on us still doing
much more.

Full text: Teachers and childcare workers could be required to vaccinate and undergo daily rapid antigen testing for Covid-19 as part of the Northern Territory’s reopening plan.
The Top End jurisdiction is wrestling with safely putting an end to lockdowns without endangering vulnerable populations such as Indigenous people and children.
The Territory has a much younger demographic than the Australian average. No vaccines have yet been approved for children, so an 80 per cent penetration rate among eligible adults could mean vaccinating only about half of the people in some areas.
Chief Minister Michael Gunner said there could be “no exit from lockdowns unless we have a plan for our kids.” “When we hit 80 per cent vaccination rate among the eligible population, and the national plan says open up, our most vulnerable will be those who can’t be vaccinated — every child under 12,” he said.
“Options we need to consider range from mandatory vaccines if you work with our children to daily Covid testing for all staff at childcare centres, preschools, and primary schools. At this early stage, nothing should be off the table.” Michael Toole, a professor of epidemiology at the Burnet Institute, said the Territory might need to push for higher vaccination rates in areas with many youngsters. “We don’t know yet what overall level of vaccination we need to be able to ease restrictions and open up without having large outbreaks,” he said.
“If we reached 70 per cent (national) vaccine penetration tomorrow, we couldn’t do anything (because there are currently too many active cases in the community).” The Doherty Institute modelling used as a base for Australia’s national reopening plan examined how small outbreaks might be managed under different levels of vaccine penetration.
The strategy plan was predicated on low daily case numbers as a starting point. The news comes as the Territory recorded no new corona­virus cases on the second day of a snap three-day lockdown triggered by an infection in a man from the US who had close or casual contact with several hundred people in the community.
Mr Gunner said close to 2000 Covid-19 tests had been conducted and virtually all of his contacts identified. Authorities still did not know the source of his infection. He had declined to reveal his vaccination status. Professor Toole said even countries such as Iceland and Malta that had achieved high rates of vaccine penetration were still experiencing large corona­virus outbreaks. He said allowing Covid-19 to spread was not viable because it would inevitably mutate to become more infectious. “Vaccination will eventually get us out of this mess, but it’s not a case of in one day you open up and get back to normal life.”

Business anger as state goes it alone on borders

Full text: West Australia Premier Mark McGowan’s declaration that he reserves the right to impose border restrictions and lockdowns even when an 80 per cent vaccination rate is reached has angered business leaders.
Mr McGowan doubled down on his eradication approach at the weekend, saying his state would not tolerate any Covid-19 cases or deaths.
He also signalled he would mandate vaccinations in some sectors such as the mining and port industries.
His statement puts him at odds with Scott Morrison, who said there would be no requirement to make Covid-19 jabs compulsory unless governments’ health advisers advocated for a mandate in a specific industry.
Mr McGowan’s comments on an elimination strategy come just weeks after national cabinet agreed to a plan that Australia would open up when 80 per cent of the eligible population was fully vaccinated. The plan, based on Doherty Institute modelling, outlined that at an 80 per cent target, lockdowns would almost entirely end and international travel would restart.
Australian Chamber of Commerce and Industry chief executive Andrew McKellar said the nation’s business sector was desperate for a nationally consistent approach for reopening the country. “We would really urge all leaders to stick to the plan and not pre-empt the situation that we may face in two or three months time. ” he said.
Mr McKellar said the primary focus should be boosting the vaccination rate, with only 25 per cent of eligible Australians fully vaccinated against Covid-19. “That’s the message business is looking for – that people have to get vaccinated,” he said. “It’s the right thing to do and the best thing if you want to be able to go about your everyday life.” Business Council of Australia chief executive Jennifer Westacott said an elimination strategy was “simply unrealistic” if the ­nation wanted to return to normality. “It’s critical we tie greater freedoms to vaccination,” she said. “We can’t have premiers saying an 80 per cent vaccination target will be meaningless. What is the purpose of national cabinet’s decision and the Doherty modelling, which gave very clear milestones?” Mr McGowan said states retained the right to put in place border restrictions and lockdowns but they would be eased once the vaccination rate increased. “When you get to 70, perhaps 80, if there is a lockdown it might be a lesser area rather than the entire metropolitan area. It might be a country town rather than an entire region,” he said. Mr McGowan also predicted WA would have a “strong border” in place with NSW until the end of the year and could maintain border restrictions with the state even after it passed its 80 per cent threshold. “When they get down to zero or minimal spread, then we can look forward to opening the border,” he said.

Full text: Earlier this month, national cabinet backed the vaccination target in order to move to the next phase of reopening. Under phase B of the national plan, Australians would be rewarded with greater freedoms, but the detail has yet to be worked out.
Speaking with Nine’s Today on Tuesday, Health Minister Greg Hunt said Australians could still expect to face lockdowns despite higher vaccination rates.
“The Doherty modelling has indicated if we have 70 per cent of full vaccination in Australia, the need for lockdowns is less, but it's not an absolute end to them,” he said.
The honest admission comes as the government faces pushback from the business community over its position on workplace vaccination.
Mr Morrison on Monday ruled out the government offering an indemnity to employers who vaccinated their workforce.
“The vaccination service is free and it is not mandatory. That’s an important principle. We are not going to seek to impose a mandatory vaccination program by the government by stealth,” Mr Morrison said.
He previously said employees could make a “reasonable” directive to staff to get vaccinated, but any decision to do so must remain consistent with legislation.
“We do not have a mandatory vaccination policy in this country,” he told reporters following national cabinet on Friday.
“We do not have that. We’re not proposing to have that. That is not changing, but an employer may make a reasonable directive to staff, and if they do so, they will have to stay consistent with the law and particularly in dealing with a situation where an employee may be in direct contact, potentially become infected and acquire the virus.”
Australian Industry Group chief executive Innes Willox warned the government’s inaction left businesses out on a lurch.
“It leaves employers in a very difficult position where they know if they take an action towards mandating or requiring vaccines from customers and the like then they will inevitably be open to legal challenge, either through Fair Work or through the courts,” he told ABC’s RN.
“Businesses would much rather prefer that the government give the directive through a public health order which allows businesses, where appropriate, to mandate vaccines. It would make it much simpler.”
Mr Hunt on Tuesday defended the government’s position, telling Sunrise such a mandate is not “something to be done lightly”.
“We have set out, nationally, that the position is that vaccination other than in exceptional circumstances is a voluntary process,” he said.
“In certain workplaces, where either the worker or their clients are at risk and considered to be vulnerable, then in that situation it is regarded as being a reasonable direction.
“It is something which is not done lightly to mandate because it is so important to have the confidence of the public.”

Bosses vital to attain vaccination surge

Full text: Washington: One of US President Joe Biden's former top advisers says employer mandates are better than than financial incentives in helping countries such as Australia achieve vaccination rates high enough to move past COVID-19 lockdowns.
Andy Slavitt, who served as Biden's senior pandemic adviser until June, said the highly contagious Delta variant had made it imperative for governments and businesses to set more ambitious vaccination targets and implement more aggressive policies than they would have just months ago.
"Delta has moved the needle on what we need to get done - we need to get many more people vaccinated," Slavitt told the Herald.
"If you needed 70 to 80 per cent of the population vaccinated before, you need 80 to 90 per cent vaccinated now to keep the prevalence of the disease at a low level."
The Morrison government on Tuesday released Doherty Institute modelling that said fully immunised Australians could avoid most lockdown restrictions once the vaccination rate reached 70 per cent and that international travel could resume at 80 per cent.
Labor has called for payments of $300 for Australians who are fully vaccinated against COVID-19 by the end of the year, and Biden has encouraged US states to offer $US100 ($135) payments to people who get vaccinated.
Slavitt said financial incentives such as cash payments, gift cards and lottery tickets had only had a "mild" impact at encouraging reluctant Americans to get the jab.
He said requirements by public and private sector businesses for workers and students to be vaccinated would be the "next big thing" in the battle against the virus.
"Employers, universities and others requiring people to be vaccinated or to demonstrate a negative test result - those are the things we are going to have to look at seriously," he said.
American employers have so far been slow to adopt vaccine mandates, partly because the vaccines have still not received full authorisation from federal regulators.
But that is beginning to change. Tyson Foods, America's largest meat processing company, announced this week that it will require its 120,000 workers to be vaccinated by November.
Firms such as Google, Facebook and Morgan Stanley have also implemented vaccine requirements for their office workers.
Biden last week announced that US federal government workers and contractors would have to attest to being vaccinated against the virus, or agree to wear masks at all times and submit to regular COVID-19 testing.
California and New York City will require all government employees to get vaccinated or face weekly testing.

Full text: Washington: One of US President Joe Biden's former top advisers says employer mandates - rather than financial incentives - are the key tool that will help countries such as Australia achieve vaccination rates high enough to move past COVID-19 lockdowns and return to something resembling pre-pandemic normality.
Andy Slavitt, who served as Biden's senior pandemic adviser until June, said the Delta variant had made it imperative for governments and businesses to set more ambitious vaccination targets and implement more aggressive policies to encourage vaccinations than they would have just months ago.
"Delta has moved the needle on what we need to get done, we need to get many more people vaccinated," Slavitt said.
"If you needed 70 to 80 per cent of the population vaccinated before, you need 80 to 90 per cent vaccinated now in order to keep the prevalence of the disease at a low level in the community."
The Morrison government on Tuesday released Doherty Institute modelling that said fully immunised Australians could avoid most lockdown restrictions once the vaccination rate reached 70 per cent and that international travel could resume at 80 per cent.
Labor has called for one-off payments of $300 for Australians who are fully vaccinated against COVID-19 by the end of the year, and Biden has encouraged US states to offer $US100 ($135) payments to people who get vaccinated.
Slavitt said financial incentives such as cash payments, gift cards and lottery tickets had only had a "mild" impact at encouraging reluctant Americans to get the jab.
He said requirements by public and private sector businesses for workers and students to be vaccinated would be the "next big thing" in the battle against the virus, both in the US and around the world. "Employers, universities and others requiring people to be vaccinated or to demonstrate a negative test result, those are the things we are going to have to look at seriously," he said.
American employers have been slow to adopt vaccine mandates, partly because the vaccines have still not received full authorisation from federal regulators.
But that is beginning to change. Tyson Foods, America's largest meat processing company, said this week that it would require its 120,000 workers to be vaccinated by November.
Firms such as Google, Facebook and Morgan Stanley have also implemented vaccine requirements for their office workers.
Biden last week announced that federal government workers and contractors would have to attest to being vaccinated, or agree to wear masks at all times and submit to regular COVID-19 testing.
California and New York City will require government employees to get vaccinated or face weekly testing. New York mayor Bill de Blasio said yesterday proof of vaccination would be required to enter the city's bars, restaurants and gyms, the first such mandate in the country.
Slavitt acknowledged that, after successfully containing the virus last year, Australia's vaccine rollout had been slower than other comparable countries.
"The Australian government made the decisions they made about which vaccines to back and how much to buy," he said. "They're decisions that have to be lived with. Here our priority was buying enough vaccines and distributing them quickly and efficiently and evenly. That's the task ahead for the Australian government: to secure enough supply of vaccine and they should have every opportunity to do that."

Our resilience has silenced Covid prophets of doom

Full text: You are more resilient than you think. The message from mental health experts is that life in lockdown has been hard for most and misery for some. But the Covid pandemic has done its worst and humanity has survived. Developed nations where the virus took hold early are reaching high levels of vaccination, which should mean an end to the most restrictive public health containment policies. While Australia is playing catch-up, vaccination rates are rising as state governments allow younger people to access vaccines. All of this is good news for thumping Covid and giving hope where mutual suspicion has reigned for too long.
It takes a Christian with chutzpah to bet on Christmas. But the Prime Minister has set his sights on opening the country in time for Santa. On Friday, he met with the national cabinet to hatch a plot against Covid’s grip on power. Armed with modelling from the Doherty Institute, cabinet set vaccination thresholds for charting a path out of the pandemic. When 70 per cent of the population is fully vaccinated, lockdowns will become less likely, some international arrivals will be permitted and vaccinated residents will enjoy greater freedoms such as reduced quarantine requirements.
At about 80 per cent, lockdowns will be “highly targeted”; vaccinated residents will have greater freedom of movement and be permitted to travel internationally. The travel bubble will be extended to other “safe” countries and inbound citizens who have been fully vaccinated will enjoy reduced requirements for re-entry.
The long-awaited end to Covid winter is in sight. Yet psychologists have warned that mental health can deteriorate as societies move out of pandemics. For The Atlantic, the Covid mind is a tale of two stories. The first ran in July 2020. Jacob Stern marshalled research and experts who warned about an impending mental health disaster. Stern observed that a third of Americans were already feeling severe anxiety. Texts to a federal emergency mental health line had increased 1000 per cent.
It was widely believed that people were at risk of post-traumatic stress disorder. There was historical precedent; in the four years following the SARS pandemic, more than 40 per cent of survivors in Hong Kong were found to have a psychiatric illness. There were “delirious patients” in America with “chilling hallucinations”. Stern contended that: “A wave of psychological stress unique in its nature and proportions is bearing down on an already-ramshackle American mental healthcare system.” A year on, The Atlantic was emerging from dystopia. Psychology professors Lara Aknin, Jamil Zaki and Elizabeth Dunn reported on their efforts to quantify the psychological effects of the pandemic. They examined studies from nearly 100 countries that measured variables such as life satisfaction, anxiety, depression and deaths by suicide.
While there had been an initial and dramatic increase in reported levels of anxiety and depression, including clinically significant forms of psychological distress, recovery began during 2020 “as spring turned to summer”. The researchers found that life satisfaction had remained stable in the year. In some countries, the rate of suicide had declined. The professors cautioned that the studies were limited by methodology, but suggested: “People are more resilient than they themselves realise.” In Australia, too, researchers have found that, generally, people adapted and found ways to cope with the external shocks brought about by the pandemic. As lead researcher of the Australian Unity Wellbeing Index, Associate Professor Delyse Hutchinson, reported, despite the challenges, personal and national wellbeing scores remained largely within the average range. She attributed it to “the resilience of the Australian community (and) our adaptive capability as a society”.
It is good news for everyone except those seeking to capitalise on Covid-induced psychological distress. Time might heal most wounds produced by the pandemic, but an increase in mental health suffering justifies demands for increased government funding.
However, emerging research indicates that instead of a blanket approach to mental health funding, governments might be better advised to increase funds for specific groups such as the unemployed, people with pre-existing mental health conditions and more serious psychological illness.
The pandemic brought an avalanche of predictions about mental health. The short story was that lockdowns would lead to a mass psychological crisis with long-term effects. In retrospect, it might simply be that, like the rest of society, the media was panicked by the pandemic. But before long, little acts of defiance began appearing on suburban streets like green shoots butting their heads against concrete to greet the sun. Teddy bears were propped up on windowsills to delight children on their Covid-compliant walks. People made friends with neighbours. New communities formed online. And if you tried to buy a breadmaker during lockdown, you soon learned that baking had made a comeback like the 1950s had never gone out of fashion. Australia’s experience of the pandemic has been relatively benign; we have huddled in the shadow of the beast, not under its scythe. But, like the rest of the world, we have learned human beings are a creative, adaptive and resilient lot. For everyone, there will be a memory from the pandemic of the spirit triumphant. Mine is the moment when tenor Maurizio Marchini took to his balcony to serenade Florence with Puccini’s Nessun Dorma as the pandemic waltzed its danse macabre through the shuttered houses and shattered hospitals of Italy. Nessun dorma: none shall sleep. At last, we can put the prophets of doom on notice. Covid’s days are numbered and Santa Claus is coming to town.

Full text: The head of the Australian Medical Association says the message to get vaccinated against COVID-19 has hit home for Sydneysiders amid rapidly increasing risk of contracting the virus, but needed to be reinforced in other states.
Speaking at the AMA National Conference on Saturday, Omar Khorshid said poor delivery and quickly changing messaging around vaccination had been a barrier in uptake, but the imposing threat of the Delta strain in Sydney shifted the goalposts.
He said there were still improvements to be made in getting clear and consistent vaccine communications to all Australians.
People who had been prepared to wait for a vaccine while Australia's Covid caseload was low, now saw the impact Delta could have and were lining up for the jab, Dr Khorshid said.
Another 210 cases were reported in NSW on Saturday. Two thirds of those are people under the age of 40.
The Australian Technical Advisory Group on Immunisation has advised people living in locked down parts of NSW amid the surging caseload, to get any vaccine available to them as the benefits outweigh the risks.
Dr Khorshid wanted to see the messaging around the risk of COVID-19 portrayed to other states not living with outbreaks, to fight vaccine hesitancy and see more people step forward.
He said there had been "examples of governments doing too little, too late" throughout the pandemic, but resolved listening to medical experts had reaped success.
"Good decisions are those based in science and advised by experts," he said.
Speaking at the event, Labor shadow minister for health Mark Butler said the four-stage plan released following National Cabinet with the vaccination rates needed to open up, was an "important moment to life the nations' spirits".
The Prime Minister Scott Morrison announced a national COVID-19 vaccination target of 80 per cent will be required for Australia to reopen the nation.
Before that, the target that will trigger the start of the graduation easing of restrictions has been set at 70 per cent of vaccinated eligible Australians.

Full text: The head of the Australian Medical Association says the message to get vaccinated against COVID-19 has hit home for Sydneysiders amid rapidly increasing risk of contracting the virus, but needed to be reinforced in other states.
Speaking at the AMA National Conference on Saturday, Omar Khorshid said poor delivery and quickly changing messaging around vaccination had been a barrier in uptake, but the imposing threat of the Delta strain in Sydney shifted the goalposts.
He said there were still improvements to be made in getting clear and consistent vaccine communications to all Australians.
People who had been prepared to wait for a vaccine while Australia's Covid caseload was low, now saw the impact Delta could have and were lining up for the jab, Dr Khorshid said.
Another 210 cases were reported in NSW on Saturday. Two thirds of those are people under the age of 40.
The Australian Technical Advisory Group on Immunisation has advised people living in locked down parts of NSW amid the surging caseload, to get any vaccine available to them as the benefits outweigh the risks.
Dr Khorshid wanted to see the messaging around the risk of COVID-19 portrayed to other states not living with outbreaks, to fight vaccine hesitancy and see more people step forward.
He said there had been "examples of governments doing too little, too late" throughout the pandemic, but resolved listening to medical experts had reaped success.
"Good decisions are those based in science and advised by experts," he said.
Speaking at the event, Labor shadow minister for health Mark Butler said the four-stage plan released following National Cabinet with the vaccination rates needed to open up, was an "important moment to life the nations' spirits".
The Prime Minister Scott Morrison announced a national COVID-19 vaccination target of 80 per cent will be required for Australia to reopen the nation.
Before that, the target that will trigger the start of the graduation easing of restrictions has been set at 70 per cent of vaccinated eligible Australians.

"We need that detail ... we deserve that detail," he said.
"We want a full debate about this."
The Prime Minister, addressing the conference, said medical experts were listened to "every step of the way" through the pandemic response.
"We have given a keen ear to their advice, not just on the medical issues but how we can actually ensure that the vaccines and the other issues can be delivered and disseminated right across the population."

Vaccination key to ending lockdowns

Publication info: Sydney Morning Herald ; Sydney, N.S.W. [Sydney, N.S.W]. 31 July 2021: 6.

Full text: People who have been vaccinated will be able to avoid lockdown restrictions once 70 per cent of the eligible adult population have had two doses, and international border rules will be loosened to allow more people to come home.
Once the national total hits 80 per cent, broad lockdowns will not be used in major cities, caps on returning Australians will be abolished and all restrictions on vaccinated travellers leaving the country will be removed.
Prime Minister Scott Morrison said national cabinet had agreed to the plans yesterday afternoon after considering scientific modelling from the Doherty Institute and economic advice from Treasury.
"So if you get vaccinated, there will be special rules that apply to you. Why? Because if you're vaccinated, you present less of a public health risk. You are less likely to get the virus. You are less likely to transmit it," he said.
Mr Morrison said lockdowns would continue to be used to deal with COVID-19, but the national plan would give Australians a clear path out of the restrictions. Under the plan, states will have to individually hit the target vaccination levels as well as the nation.
The Prime Minister said the lesson from dealing with the Delta strain was that "early and stringent lockdowns" are necessary to deal with outbreaks, and that would be kept in mind during the suppression phase.
But once the vaccination targets were hit, Mr Morrison said states would open up.
"I can tell you there is no state or jurisdiction in the country that wants to apply a lockdown or hold Australians back," he said.
Mr Morrison had previously praised NSW Premier Gladys Berejiklian for refusing to lock down during a Delta outbreak that has now spread around Sydney, but now said he didn't have "perfect hindsight".
"People were acting on the information they had. No one has perfect hindsight ... and the Delta strain is a strain that we've sought to understand and learn and react to and respond to," he said. "We've all humbly learned from these things, and then we make the adjustments and get on with it."
University of Melbourne professor of epidemiology Tony Blakely backed the idea of a vaccination target as a way to motivate people, but said the country could not ease all restrictions once the target was reached.
He said some of the modelling was "the right answer to the wrong question", because governments would have to offer vaccines to everyone, including children, and adjust their settings in light of the results.
A vaccination target of 80 per cent was a likely goal, he said, but new variants and further breakouts would mean that no vaccination rate was likely to allow Australia to open its borders without restrictions.
"We talk about opening the borders, but it won't be to all countries all of the time," he said.
Professor Blakely said Australia would need a vaccination rate of 90 per cent of the population to reach herd immunity, while a rate of only 50 or 60 per cent would not be high enough to avoid further lockdowns.

The health advice: a sword and shield for needling doubt

Publication info: Sun Herald ; Sydney, N.S.W. [Sydney, N.S.W]. 18 July 2021: 24.

Full text: In the absence of medical certainty, the risk/reward ratio has been guiding the decisions and recommendations of the vaccine experts, writes Michael Koziol.
Of all the pandemic's catchphrases - "stay safe", "lives and livelihoods" - the politician's favourite is probably "based on the health advice". It covers all manner of sins, is largely unquestionable and pre-emptively spreads the blame (or credit) for whatever happens next.
Plus, there is something of a compact between leaders and their health advisers: a united front where neither undermines the other in public.
That compact frayed a little last week when Prime Minister Scott Morrison appeared to push some of the blame for Australia's delayed vaccine rollout on to the Australian Technical Advisory Group on Immunisation (ATAGI) for its "very cautious" approach to the use of the AstraZeneca vaccine.
"That had a massive impact on the rollout of the vaccine program. It really did," Morrison told 2GB radio on Wednesday. "It slowed it considerably and it put us behind, and we wish that wasn't the result but it was. Those decisions are made independent of government, and should be."
Morrison was criticised for his remarks, including by former ATAGI consumer representative Debra Petrys, who told The Guardian the comments were "disappointing".
The Prime Minister has significant reason to seek to shift the blame - the country does not have enough mRNA vaccines, which is our major problem.
But he is not the only one asking whether ATAGI has taken the right approach, all things considered. And given the high stakes - more than 12 million Australians are in lockdown this weekend - it's reasonable to at least consider whether things could be done differently.
The PM expanded on his observations the next day, indicating he thought ATAGI had based its vaccine advice on an assumption the risk of contracting COVID-19 would remain low.
"I'm simply saying that we received medical advice that has changed on two occasions. And that medical advice is, as I made very clear to ATAGI at the time, was based on an assumption that the cases in Australia would remain low. Now, I never made that assumption," he told ABC radio.
"Now, when the case numbers increase, as you've seen from ATAGI now, their advice changes. People have understood that, but I think it has created some confusion in the public."
To be clear, ATAGI modelled three scenarios based on a low, moderate and high level of COVID-19 exposure, where "low" is similar to the infection rate of the national first wave, "moderate" is similar to Victoria's second wave and "high" is similar to Europe's January 2021 conditions.
The danger of COVID-19 is then compared with the real but extremely rare danger of thrombosis-with-thrombocytopenia syndrome (TTS) associated with the AstraZeneca vaccine, which is more common in young people. This modelling is publicly available.
Australia had very low infection rates in April when ATAGI changed its advice to make Pfizer the preferred vaccine for under 50s, and in mid-June, when that changed again to under 60s. Now the situation has changed, at least in Sydney. Consequently, ATAGI updated its advice last week to stress that in an outbreak area where access to Pfizer is constrained, people under 60 "should reassess the benefits to them and their contacts" from getting vaccinated with AstraZeneca.
ATAGI also reduced the recommended interval between AZ doses for people in an outbreak area; from 12 weeks to between four and eight weeks. People who had their first dose more than four weeks ago should arrange their second dose "as soon as possible".
The debate is whether ATAGI's initial approach should have given more weight to the likelihood of this kind of outbreak occurring, and therefore prioritised wider, faster vaccination - even if that ran the risk of more cases of TTS.
Associate Professor Chris Berg, an economist at RMIT University, argued that ATAGI's risk model was "woefully inadequate".
"They seem to be just taking a snapshot of exactly where we are right now and the likelihood of getting COVID exactly right now and the danger of the vaccine exactly right now," he said.
That might have made sense when thinking about the risk of the flu, which is relatively static, he said, but not in the context of the rapidly evolving coronavirus pandemic.
"You can model an economy in equilibrium or you can model an economy that is changing," Berg said. "It seems like they've just taken this static equilibrium without calculating the actual risk, which is: will there be an outbreak in 12 weeks or not?"
Changing the advice once there's an outbreak is "nonsensical", he said, because the outbreak has already happened and there will be a long lag before anyone caught up in it gets the protection of both jabs.
Professor Michael Sherris of the University of NSW school of risk and actuarial studies, notes that in general risk modelling "you do need to be forward looking and you can't just assume that because something hasn't happened it's not going to happen".
Professor Terry Nolan, who heads the Doherty Institute's Vaccine and Immunisation Research Group, chaired ATAGI from 2005 to 2014. He acknowledges the shifting AstraZeneca advice has affected people's confidence in the vaccine - including people over 60 for whom AZ is still the preferred jab.
"I don't think that's ATAGI's fault though," Nolan says. "You don't [avoid] a recommendation because you're frightened it's going to harm confidence. This sort of recommendation was very similar to the ones made elsewhere."
Nolan says ATAGI is doing its best and the root cause of our woes, "boring as it is", is that we don't have enough Pfizer vaccines. "They may have made mistakes in terms of judgment, [but] from my point of view I don't think they've done anything seriously wrong," he says.
In Nolan's view, which he has expressed before, when it became clear Australia's Pfizer supplies would be crunched, ATAGI and the government should have changed tack to deliver as many first doses to people as fast as possible, instead of holding back second doses.
"The English and the Canadians made a decision early on [to] get as many people under one dose as they could quickly. That in retrospect was a very good decision ... we should just learn from them," Nolan says.
"As a country we possibly got it wrong early this year in taking it too easily, believing we'd be OK, we'd be safe. Increasing the pace with which we tackle all of this ... would have helped us."
ATAGI chair Allen Cheng - an infectious diseases physician, professor of epidemiology and until recently Victoria's deputy chief health officer - makes several points in response. First, ATAGI's advice applies nationwide and has to best fit the national situation at the time. The risk calculus in Geraldton, for example, hasn't really changed compared with the calculus in western Sydney.
There were a lot of unknowns in April and it was "difficult to frame" the advice accordingly. Cheng also says the calculus is slightly more nuanced than just risk of TTS versus risk of COVID-19.
"The question is: between now and when you would otherwise get access to Pfizer, what is that risk [of an outbreak]? One of the unknowns is 'when is that point in time?' We think it's probably the last couple of months of the year, but we don't know for sure."
ATAGI's advice on AZ puts a premium on individual circumstances and individual risk assessment. To critics, this undermines the broader community goal of getting out of the pandemic quickly. But Cheng says it is important to let people decide themselves, with assistance from their GP, given the "material risk" of TTS.
"If the risk was really very small then I don't think we'd have any hesitation in recommending for the benefit of the community that everyone get vaccinated fast," he says.
Cheng says ATAGI considered the change advocated by his predecessor Terry Nolan to delay second Pfizer doses to the six-week maximum and get more first jabs into arms. "We did think about that," he says. "[But] in the context of a Delta outbreak you want that second dose protection."
English studies have indicated the second Pfizer dose massively increases protection against symptomatic infection by the Delta variant. The same data showed the second AZ dose also significantly increased protection.
As for Morrison's comments about ATAGI's changes delaying the rollout, Cheng says there have been a number of factors in the relatively slow uptake of vaccines in Australia. He concedes the many changes to the medical advice have reduced public confidence in the AstraZeneca vaccine.
"We knew that at the time," he says. "But we're trying to provide the best advice we can to make sure that we're doing this as safely as we can."
Australian Bureau of Statistics research published on Wednesday found 15 per cent of unvaccinated Australians named "wanting a different vaccine to what is available to them" as one of the factors affecting their ability to get the jab.
That figure rose to 35 per cent for people aged 50 to 69, and 26 per cent for those aged over 70.
One of the nation's foremost vaccine communication experts, University of Sydney professor Julie Leask, says ATAGI acted impeccably and took all of the relevant factors into consideration in its decision-making.
"They weighed the very real, known effects on hesitancy in the population that would come, as well as the impact on Pacific Island country neighbours where there was more COVID and this could also trigger hesitancy," Leask says. "In a sense they took a middle ground. They didn't say AZ was banned. They kept the option open. They were careful to say this is based on a particular context and that context could change."
As Leask points out, ATAGI gives the technical advice, politicians announce it - as Morrison and his Health Minister, Greg Hunt, did at a dramatic 7.15pm media conference in April.
"The message about AZ not being banned for under 50s was never clearly communicated from there on," Leask says. "That meant that when the PM said 'by the way when you're under 40 you can have the vaccine' - that was always the case. The question was whether the GP or hub would offer it if you were under 40."
Leask also cautions that the effect of the advice changes on hesitancy should not be overestimated.
"It's not as big an impact as everybody assumes," she says.
"We're often going on the stories and anecdotes of people who are spooked by these announcements, and they're highly available to the media."

Even Gladystan is not immune from hysterics

Full text: GLADYS Berejiklian’s fall from grace has seen her go from the “gold standard” to Premier of locked down “Gladystan”, lecturing her constituents about the ills of “browsing”.
So much for a proportional, rational response to coronavirus. “Browsing is not allowed,” scolded Berejiklian. She was echoing the sentiments of chief health officer Kerry Chant who said: “This is not the time for browsing.” Like Victoria, the police in NSW have enthusiastically overstepped the mark, with assistant commissioner Tony Cooke warning the citizenry officers will carefully scrutinise their shopping to ensure they have left home for an essential reason. “The question will be … what’s your reasonable excuse for being here? You don’t need that pair of shoes today,” he said.
For more than 15 months Berejiklian was the sensible antidote to the hysterical bed-wetting from every other state leader, Labor and Liberal, but sadly she is now pursuing an eradication model that could see Sydney and surrounds locked down for many more weeks.
NSW reported 89 news cases on Tuesday, but 59 of these are household contacts. Surely, if we’re going to continue to be hysterical about each single case, then it would be prudent to send infected individuals to hotel quarantine (at the state’s expense) instead of home to infect the household.
Berejiklian claims the Delta variant is a “game changer”, but that has not been the experience in other advanced nations that have reopened or are reopening and doing so without reaching anything close to the vaccination thresholds being considered in Australia.
On Tuesday Premier Dan Andrews said even a vaccination rate of 75 per cent wouldn’t be sufficient to return to normality given that would leave millions unvaccinated.
“It’s a pretty big number of people, and if it runs through there – and a percentage of them get really unwell – then that’s the hospitals full,” he said.
Only that has not been the case in the advanced world. One look at Florida which has been open all year would dispel fears of hospitals unable to cope. Florida is known as “God’s little waiting room” for having the second oldest population in the US but despite being fully open for months the hospital system has not been overwhelmed nor has the death rate soared.
Even the states that locked down the longest and hardest, such as New York and California, have reopened. Indeed 48 US states are open for business despite less than 50 per cent of the country being fully vaccinated. The UK will lift remaining restrictions such as masks, social distancing, legal limits on gatherings on July 19 with 65 per cent of its adult population (around 52 per cent of total population) fully vaccinated, despite new daily cases of more than 30,000.
The surge in Delta variant infections is not reflected in a similar surge in hospital admissions and deaths thanks largely to the high vaccination rate of those at greatest risk of Covid-19.
And there is more good news from the UK, with the most comprehensive study of children with Covid concluding that the risk of serious illness or death is extremely low, far lower than influenza, with a survival rate of 99.995 per cent.
Australia is suffering from a failure of leadership, at both state and federal level, with our elected representatives relinquishing their power to unelected, unaccountable health bureaucrats.
Scott Morrison was listening to the “best health advice” when he began Australia’s vaccine program later than much of the world and he was dutifully echoing Brendan Murphy when he repeated the health department secretary’s line about the rollout not being a race. As I wrote back in March, the “it’s not a race” mentality was holding Australia back and was the product of a gutless political class and health bureaucrats who have a narrow focus of what constitutes success.
It is imperative the Prime Minister does not handball the most crucial decision about reopening the country to the health bureaucracy or the Doherty Institute, whose modelling has, at times, been wildly wrong including the prediction that under a best-case scenario, with strict isolation and social distancing, we’d need 5000 intensive care beds for Covid cases.
The Doherty Institute will provide recommendations to the PM and state and territory leaders on vaccine thresholds to be met for the four-phase reopening of the country. It would be politically expedient, though ruinous for the country, to set a benchmark of 80 per cent or more.
Targets for lifting Covid restrictions and fully reopening should be based on vaccine availability rather than the actual percentage of people immunised.
By now everyone who is in a high-risk category should be vaccinated, they’ve had since February to get their jabs. We cannot keep Australia isolated to “protect” people unwilling to be immunised.

IN SHORT Covid-19 vaccine ads from France to New Zealand are about restoring freedom and normality but in Australia we’ve opted for fearmongering. The ad of a terrified young woman gasping for air in hospital is odd given the average age of Covid deaths is 86.

Full text: FOR my last Rural Notebook column for the year, it's probably a good time to glance back at the year that's gone and think of a few highlights:
At this time last year, COVID-19 meant nothing to most of us and the blue smoke from bushfires covered our region. The long drought started to break before Easter and farmers have enjoyed one of their best ever harvests that will overflow silos and fill hay sheds. Trade wars with China have rattled many exporters and the problems are not solved, with much diplomacy being urgently needed. Huge government debts have been incurred that may never be fully repaid. Had interest rates on these loans been at long-term median rates (instead of .01 per cent), the problems would be impossible to solve. Modelling provided to our government in February 2020 told of a probable total of Australian deaths to COVID-19 of 150,000 people. While the world battled with the virus and its financial implications, the Bathurst community spent much time debating the construction of a go-kart track. Region's cool comfort THE wind-down to Christmas has come down to its last eight days and an early summer has refused to warm up.
When we think of the bushfire smoke that clouded our region at this time last year, with visibility down to about 400 metres every day, we appreciate the coolness and the green grass that is still very obvious.
We must be thankful to all of our country's leaders, health officials and medical staff who have put in a huge effort to keep our country safe.
We know that COVID-19 cost Donald Trump his presidency because he took the virus too lightly and the new vaccine came too late to provide hope for his Republican Party.
In our country, we know that strict lockdowns were very costly, but very effective.
What's ahead? TO stare into a crystal ball for 2021, we look to the forecast of a La Nina weather event with possible flooding until Easter at least.
Of course, this is just a forecast, but it may happen.
China's tariff policies will decide the viability of grain, wines, red meat and wool markets for the medium term and our iron ore exports will probably give our country its most significant bargaining tool.
The JobKeeper and JobSeeker stimuli measures will ease back and the anticipated financial shocks may not be so severe as they may have been as many of our hospitality businesses seem to have come back to life quickly.
Income tax write-off provisions are a big hand up to retail businesses with tractor, machinery and light truck sales reaching high points.
If several good seasons are to follow, we should see livestock numbers across our state build up gradually from a very low base.
With high livestock and red meat values, high stocking rates are now a memory and lighter stocking rates result in much better groundcover over the long term.
Can't be too careful HARVEST operations will continue over the Christmas, new year break in our lovely Central Tablelands and all involved are urged to be extra careful of every job and to concentrate on everything we do.
Accidents happen in the blink of an eye and much of the harvest work is done in the poor light of early morning and dusk.
Market movements BEEF and lamb markets have held fairly firm as the festive season comes closer.
The early months of the new year will hold the key to meat markets, with China's trade strategies and the prospect of a La Nina rain event in North Queensland being key factors.
Cattle markets have maintained high levels right through 2020 and breeders of Highland and Belted Galloway cattle have found lucrative niche markets.
These breeds used to be shunned by butchers in saleyard pens, but they are now regarded as showpiece, front paddock cattle.
Some on-property auctions have had total clearances of large numbers of stud stock and returned excellent prices.
Studmasters Tom Bull (Lambpro), Nigel Kerin (Kerin Poll), Steve Phillips (Yarrawonga) and Ross Thompson (Millah Murrah) have led the way as hard-working marketers for the genetics of their studs.
Names and faces A BIT of history: 1977 was the first meeting of the amalgamated Turon, Abercrombie shires and Bathurst City Council.
John Matthews was mayor, Les Wardman and Max Hanrahan went on to be mayors, and only four aldermen still live in Bathurst: Norah Taylor, Phil Smith, Graeme Spurway and John Seaman.

Engineer Peter Gannon was absent on the day.
And just finally A FEW thank yous to end a year that won't be forgotten.
To my readers, I hope this column was of some value and provided a few smiles; to the farming community, I hope that your year has been profitable and that your family stays happy and healthy.
To the editor and staff of the Western Advocate, Oberon Review and Blayney Chronicle, thank you for providing space for Rural Notebook each Thursday.

Wool report THIS week's market, the second-last before the Christmas recess, produced upward trends in all wool types.
All merino types were up 60 to 70c/kg and the crossbred wools were up around 20c/kg.

Full text: FOR my last Rural Notebook column for the year, it's probably a good time to glance back at the year that's gone and think of a few highlights:
At this time last year, COVID-19 meant nothing to most of us and the blue smoke from bushfires covered our region. The long drought started to break before Easter and farmers have enjoyed one of their best ever harvests that will overflow silos and fill hay sheds. Trade wars with China have rattled many exporters and the problems are not solved, with much diplomacy being urgently needed. Huge government debts have been incurred that may never be fully repaid. Had interest rates on these loans been at long-term median rates (instead of .01 per cent), the problems would be impossible to solve. Modelling provided to our government in February 2020 told of a probable total of Australian deaths to COVID-19 of 150,000 people. While the world battled with the virus and its financial implications, the Bathurst community spent much time debating the construction of a go-kart track. Region's cool comfort THE wind-down to Christmas has come down to its last eight days and an early summer has refused to warm up.
When we think of the bushfire smoke that clouded our region at this time last year, with visibility down to about 400 metres every day, we appreciate the coolness and the green grass that is still very obvious.
We must be thankful to all of our country's leaders, health officials and medical staff who have put in a huge effort to keep our country safe.
We know that COVID-19 cost Donald Trump his presidency because he took the virus too lightly and the new vaccine came too late to provide hope for his Republican Party.
In our country, we know that strict lockdowns were very costly, but very effective.
OTHER RECENT RURAL NOTEBOOK COLUMNS:
Cheque out the reward for sticking it out Given just a taste of the power of summer We have to be careful not to spark concerns Many hands will make light work before trial shearing What's ahead? TO stare into a crystal ball for 2021, we look to the forecast of a La Nina weather event with possible flooding until Easter at least.

Full text: MELBOURNE is on track to be reopened by October 19, in time to celebrate the AFL Grand Final.
Extensive new modelling shows Melburnians are well ahead of projections for overcoming Victoria’s second coronavirus wave, with the citywide lockdown expected to be lifted a week earlier than previously forecast.
Premier Daniel Andrews on Sunday confirmed Melbourne was tracking to open by October 19, which would allow ­people to gather in limited numbers to watch the October 24 Grand Final in outdoor settings at pubs and restaurants.
“In the modelling, we think that between broadly 12-17 October we will meet our targets,” Mr Andrews said.
“However, as I said, many, many times, actuals always prompt the assumptions in any model. One event can change that.
“It’s three weeks. If we stay the course, if we deal with, if we take what has been safely given today, nothing that’s been done today or announced is unsafe.” Despite vastly improving projections under the latest modelling, health officials would need at least three weeks to assess the impact of the partial easing of restrictions announced on Sunday.
To take the next step and end the lockdown, Melbourne must reach a rolling 14-day ­average of fewer than five new cases and fewer than five “mystery” cases over a fortnight.
New modelling released by the Department of Health and Human Services revealed its internal calculations placed Melbourne’s Reff number at .69 last week, while Doherty Institute modelling placed the Reff at .75 — both are ahead of schedule and would allow restrictions to ease if maintained.
The all important Reff number is the rate at which coronavirus is considered to be spreading and any number below one signals the virus ­retreating.
While those rates would allow opening in time for the Grand Final weekend, Victoria’s Deputy Chief Health Officer Allen Cheng called for vigilance and warned that a ­superspreading, such as the recent Casey cluster, could easily knock the city off course.
Professor Cheng said there was “wiggle room” in the five-daily-case average, particularly if most new cases were in settings such as aged care homes or hotel quarantine.
“Victorians have demonstrated themselves to be pretty good at this, so they understand what it means not to want to do this all again,” Professor Cheng said.
The need to maintain restrictions has been reinforced by modelling by the Burnett Institute, which showed easing the lockdown immediately — by opening up bars, clubs, workplaces and public gatherings — would come with a 41 per cent chance of a third ­coronavirus wave sweeping through Melbourne within four weeks.
Vice-president of the AFL Fans Association Cheryl Critchley said footy fans were excited by the prospect of watching the Grand Final outside with friends and family on October 24.
“Fans are so rapt that they might have the option to watch the final in groups,” Ms Critchley said. “It’s a tradition in Melbourne for fans to gather no matter where they are to watch the final, so I would say it’s a big win for them if the restrictions do ease.” Ms Critchley said fans may have to get creative with their outside viewing options, but is sure they will find a way to adapt to watching the Grand Final in a way they never have before.
“If you have a small group you could watch on an iPad or phone,” she said. “It may be a bit hard to organise the logistics of it ­however.” grant.mcarthur@news.com.au EDITORIAL, PAGE 20

Full text: Victoria has passed the peak of its second wave of coronavirus, modelling suggests, and new case numbers are expected to drop
over the next week if Victorians remain vigilant.
Chief Health Officer Professor Brett Sutton said yesterday that for the first time since June, every positive COVID-19 case in Victoria was infecting less than one other person on average.
After 466 new cases and 12 more deaths yesterday, Professor Sutton said the state's effective reproduction rate was about 0.9, meaning every 10 cases will infect nine others on average.
Coupled with stage four restrictions introduced in Melbourne last week, he said Victoria should soon push down
its seven-day average of 520 cases a day.
"I think we're headed in the right direction," Professor Sutton said. "That 0.9 [reproduction rate] really needs to be 0.5. I think stage four restrictions will head us in that direction. How far we can get is a matter for all of us as community members and our behaviours."
Professor James McCaw, an epidemiologist from the Doherty Institute whose team prepares the state government's modelling, said Victoria was in its most promising position since its second wave began in late June.
"We believe we've got to that turning point and we're on our way to a better place," Professor McCaw told The Age.
"We saw continued improvements in the public's compliance with stage three restrictions and there are early signs of really good compliance with stage four. I'm confident we are just past the peak or right on it, but there's a long way to go. If you take your foot off the accelerator for a second, you come to a halt with this virus."
Professor McCaw said the full impact of stage four restrictions would likely show over the next 10 days, after an 8pm curfew and five-kilometre movement restriction were imposed in Melbourne last Sunday.
Tighter limits on workplaces took effect over the week.
Mitchell Shire remained on stage three restrictions while the rest of regional Victoria re-entered stage three on Thursday.
A man in his 30s and six aged care residents were among 12 deaths yesterday, taking Victoria's total to 193.
Healthcare workers contributed 140 of yesterday's 466 new infections and make up about one in eight of the 7808 active cases.
With stage four restrictions in place until at least September 13, federal Treasurer Josh Frydenberg called on the Premier to contribute more to Victoria's economic recovery.
Mr Frydenberg said the federal government had committed $314 billion in response to the pandemic nationwide, compared to $45 billion from all states and territories. "The states can do more, and the states do need to do more, including here in Victoria," he said. Premier Daniel Andrews said yesterday revelations in The Age that the government had hired security guards under a "social inclusion" policy were inaccurate but refused to elaborate.
Mr Frydenberg said Victorians deserved answers on the state's botched hotel quarantine program. "There needs to be accountability, there needs to be an explanation," he said.
Victoria's "mystery cases" of COVID-19 with an unknown source grew by 130 yesterday, bringing the total since last Saturday to 743.
Professor Sutton said those community transmission cases remained a concern but had reduced from a peak of 26 per cent of cases in mid-July to about 17 per cent of Victoria's cases at the moment, suggesting tighter restrictions were working.
Professor McCaw said anonymous data from Facebook, Google and Apple showed that thanks to stage four restrictions, residents in Melbourne had only this week reduced their movement to similar levels as stage three restrictions in March. He said that indicated Victorians were not fully adhering to stage three rules in July's second wave.
"It's not surprising," he said. "There's no blame, it's just a fact: if you ask people to do the same thing twice, the population won't respond as well because we're fatigued, we're stressed."
Professor McCaw added that Victoria would build momentum if it pushed down new cases in the next 10 days because the state's overwhelmed team of 2000 contact tracers would be able to improve its efficiency.
The Victorian government said yesterday it would invest $1.6 million to make kindergarten in Victoria free for term three and support online resources for children learning from home.

Contact tracing delays prove costly

Full text: Victorians with coronavirus are waiting more than a week to be interviewed by health officials, stymieing efforts to contain the disease and threatening the success of costly lockdown measures.
Contact tracing is meant to be initiated within 24 hours, but the long delays are leading GPs to instruct their patients to call their close contacts themselves and urge them to be tested.
"It's dire," said Dr Mukesh Haikerwal, a former Australian Medical Association president who runs a respiratory clinic in Altona North.
"There's a lot of early intervention that is being stymied."
The AMA in Victoria says the problem needs to be urgently addressed for the state to avoid repeated hard lockdowns, and resurging cases when it moves out of stage four restrictions.
"We need to have all of these problems solved now, or when we are faced with outbreaks in the future we will not be able to contain them," said the AMA's emergency representative, Dr Sarah Whitelaw.
Modelling highlighted in a recent parliamentary committee report said contact tracing should be done within two days of a positive test to be most effective, but several GPs said it was not unusual to wait more than a week to be interviewed.
Dr Haikerwal said some positive cases were called by the department for contact tracing within three to five days, but it was also common for people not to have received a call by day 11 of their quarantine.
He had spoken to others who still had not been contacted by day 18 or 21.
The GP said that left him with the job of providing confused patients with public health advice on quarantining and requirements for testing of their family, including telling people that their close contacts needed to be tested and then tested again at day 11.
Dr Whitelaw said she understood the state government recently formalised this work, by routinely notifying people's regular doctor when they tested positive at screening clinics.
The government is yet to confirm this.
The Health Department said its 2000-strong contact tracing team had been recently bolstered by defence force and Health Department staff performing checks on people at home.
Victoria's Chief Health Officer Professor Brett Sutton said yesterday that he did not know the average time between testing and initiation of contact tracing, but he would look into it.
The department's newly appointed Deputy Chief Health Officer, Professor Allen Cheng, confirmed earlier in the week that he was one of the new experts now working on contract tracing, after his predecessor Annaliese van Diemen shifted to non-COVID duties.
A Health Department spokeswoman said "every single positive case is interviewed by the contact tracing team within 24 hours and close contacts are followed up as soon as possible, either via phone calls or text message".
Stewart Taylor, however, begs to differ. He first received a call on Friday last week from a doctor confirming he had coronavirus, three days after he had been tested.
"It was a very quick conversation because she told me that someone from the department will be in contact with you in the next 24 hours and I was waiting for that call to come, but it never came," he said.
The 26-year-old from South Yarra said he was not interviewed about his close contacts for another four days, and that was only because he called the coronavirus hotline himself, waiting more than two hours until he was able to speak to someone.
Burnet Institute epidemiologist Professor Mike Toole blamed the intense workload for reported delays and called upon the government to accept extra help from groups such as community health services, GPs and maternal child health nurses. "Just today there are 450 [new] cases," he said yesterday. "Just those cases need at least 4500 phone calls."
Professor Toole said if health authorities were able to reduce the time from onset of symptoms, being tested, receiving results and contact tracing down to a total of three days or less, modelling showed you could achieve an 80 per cent reduction in transmission.
"If any one of those steps reaches three days, then you can only reduce transmission by 10 per cent," he said. "Time is of the essence - it's the crux of the whole strategy."
Two GPs working in virus hotspot locations, who didn't want to be named, said they were routinely seeing delays of more than a week for people with coronavirus being contacted by the department.
One doctor said it used to take them hours to get through to the department to notify them of a coronavirus case, where the person on the end of the phone would write the information down.
"They keep saying they are ramping up the numbers, but on the ground I don't see the contact tracing as improved whatsoever."

Full text: Lockdown fatigue, cold weather and outbreaks among the city's most vulnerable have undermined Melbourne's attempts to contain the second wave of COVID-19.
As new government analysis showed nearly nine out of 10 people were not self-isolating when they started experiencing COVID-19 symptoms, some Australian infectious disease experts suspect restrictions are becoming less effective as time wears on.
The lockdown has stopped Victoria from recording thousands of new cases a day - as initial modelling predicted - but it has failed to produce the very sharp changes in behaviour among some people seen in the city's first round of restrictions or curb dangerous levels of community spread.
"It's much harder to bring people with you the second time," said Doherty Institute epidemiology director Professor Jodie McVernon.
Victorian Premier Daniel Andrews previously said it would be two weeks before results of the second lockdown were seen.
Yesterday, 14 days into lockdown 2.0, Victoria had 484 new cases, its highest daily total so far.
Australian Medical Association president Julian Rait has called for a stage four lockdown and mandated face masks across the state, saying "harsher and swifter" measures are needed to prevent the movement of people.
Professor Rait said the Premier had failed to explain how the government would drive behavioural changes. "There is a large backlog on cases under investigation, so the [government] is really flying blind when it comes to the granular community level information that is required," Professor Rait said.
"There were a lot of unanswered questions, and apparently with no other strategy ... with nearly 500 new cases today, we must move swiftly to get this situation under control."
Victoria's first wave of coronavirus infections mainly involved returned travellers, but the second surge has hit some of the state's most vulnerable.
Many new patients speak English as a second language, live with large families in high-density areas, fuelling transmission, and face barriers in accessing medical support when they fall sick.
The virus is also spreading as people huddle inside through winter. Scientists suspect cold weather might be fuelling the spread.
"There is good evidence to suggest the virus can remain viable for longer when exposed to the wintry weather," Dr Robert Moss, a University of Melbourne epidemiologist and part of the government's epidemic-tracking team, said.
There are also signs the second lockdown has been less effective in changing people's behaviour than the first, which produced dramatic and quick results.
"When the [first] orders came in, there was already a lot of fear," said Professor McVernon, one of the key figures providing regular modelling to the government.
"The public was kind of ready for the lockdown."
Without a vaccine, the best weapon authorities have against COVID-19 is getting people to change behaviour - to keep their distance and stay indoors. Some scientists fear restrictions may become less effective over time as people suffer "lockdown fatigue".
Almost every day, government scientists review mobility data from Facebook, Google and Apple as well as population surveys of people's movements.
Worryingly, early data shows lockdown 2.0 has been unable to reproduce the dramatic behavioural changes observed in March.
"We're definitely seeing we're not perhaps as restricted in our movements as we were in the first lockdown," Dr Moss said. "You can point fingers and say people are being complacent. But for a lot of people, it's a very difficult process to go through again."
A national study by a team from Griffith University found that after five weeks of lockdown, more than 50 per cent of people surveyed reported social contact with people who did not live in their house.
As the lockdown lengthened, the rate of non-compliance increased.
This presents a major challenge to policymakers because no data exists on how much the effectiveness of lockdowns falls over time.
Dr Moss is hoping that it is not too much.
"You have to try to predict how much people are going to behave two months from now. And, God, that's a hard problem," he said.
As Victoria becomes the test case for mandated face masks, Associate Professor James Wood, an applied mathematician at the University of NSW's School of Public Health and Community Medicine, predicted infections will plummet in the next 10 days.
But he said how quickly that drop occurred was the key to containing the virus.
"What Victoria needs to do is get down to tens not hundreds of cases per day, because when you're in the hundreds, it's very hard to bring those cases down and stop new infections occurring," Associate Professor Wood said.

Full text: Lockdown fatigue, cold weather and outbreaks among the city's most vulnerable have undermined Melbourne's attempts to contain the second wave of COVID-19.
As new government analysis showed nearly nine out of 10 people were not self-isolating when they started experiencing COVID-19 symptoms, some Australian infectious disease experts suspect restrictions are becoming less effective as time wears on.
The lockdown has stopped Victoria from recording thousands of new cases a day - as initial modelling predicted - but among some people it has failed to produce the very sharp changes in behaviour seen in the city's first round of restrictions or curb dangerous levels of community spread.
"It's much harder to bring people with you the second time," said Doherty Institute epidemiology director Professor Jodie McVernon.
Premier Daniel Andrews previously said it would be two weeks before results of the second lockdown were seen.
On Wednesday, exactly 14 days into lockdown 2.0, Victoria recorded 484 new cases, its highest daily total.
Australian Medical Association president Julian Rait has called for a stage four lockdown and mandated face masks across the state, saying "harsher and swifter" measures are needed to prevent the movement of people.
Professor Rait said the Premier had so far failed to explain how the government would drive behavioural changes.
"There is a large backlog on cases under investigation, so the [government] is really flying blind when it comes to the granular community level information that is required," Professor Rait said.
"There were a lot of unanswered questions, and apparently with no other strategy, with nearly 500 new cases today, we must move swiftly to get this situation under control."
Victoria's first wave of coronavirus infections mainly involved returned travellers, but the second surge has hit some of the state's most vulnerable.
Many new patients speak English as a second language, live with large families in high-density areas, fuelling transmission, and face barriers in accessing medical support when they fall sick.
The virus is also spreading as people huddle inside through winter. Scientists suspect cold weather might be fuelling the spread.
"There is good evidence to suggest the virus can remain viable for longer when exposed to the wintry weather," Dr Robert Moss, a University of Melbourne epidemiologist and part of the state government's epidemic-tracking team, said.
There are also signs the second lockdown has been less effective in changing people's behaviour than the first - which produced dramatic and quick results.
"When the [first] orders came in, there was already a lot of fear," said Professor McVernon, one of the key figures providing regular modelling of the epidemic to the government. "The public was kind of ready for the lockdown."
Without a vaccine, the best weapon health authorities have against COVID-19 is getting people to change their behaviour - to keep their distance and stay indoors.
Some scientists fear restrictions may become less effective over time as people suffer "lockdown fatigue".
Almost every day government scientists review mobility data from Facebook, Google and Apple as well as population surveys of people's movements. Worryingly, early data shows lockdown 2.0 has been unable to reproduce the dramatic behavioural changes observed in March.
"From mobility data, we're definitely seeing we're not perhaps as restricted in our movements as we were in the first lockdown," Dr Moss said.
"You can point fingers and say people are being complacent. But for a lot of people, it's a very difficult process to go through again."
A national study by a team from Griffith University found that after five weeks of lockdown, more than 50 per cent of people surveyed reported social contact with people who did not live in their house.
As the lockdown lengthened, the rate of non-compliance increased.
This presents a major challenge to policymakers, because no data exists on how much the effectiveness of lockdowns fall over time.
As Victoria becomes the test case for mandated face masks in Australia, Associate Professor James Wood, an applied mathematician at the University of NSW's School of Public Health and Community Medicine, predicts infections will plummet in the next 10 days.
But he says the speed of that drop is the key to containing the virus.
"What Victoria needs to do is get down to tens not hundreds of cases per day, because when you're in the hundreds it's very hard to bring those cases down and stop new infections occurring," he said.

Full text: Predicting disease outbreak has been compared by more than one weary scientist over the years to weather forecasting. You don't know exactly how big the storm will be or when it will hit, but you know it's coming.
In late 2019, the hurricane came to shore: a new kind of coronavirus quickly morphed into the world's worst pandemic in a century. Now it seems the skies are clearing, cases are easing and the world is waking up from lockdown. It's time, as the Prime Minister says, for Australia to come out from under the doona.
Yet experts warn the storm is far from over.
The global case count is still accelerating, expected to reach 6 million by June. While science is moving at its own record speed, there is still no vaccine or known treatment for COVID-19. And fears are growing that countries inching out of hibernation to rescue their economies could trigger a dreaded second wave of infections, such as the resurgence seen during the 1918 Spanish flu.
In Australia, Deputy Chief Medical Officer Professor Paul Kelly is on his guard but says our success so far in cutting off outbreaks quickly means we might see "ripples rather than a tsunami", particularly with borders still closed for "the foreseeable future".
Health Minister Greg Hunt warns the biggest threat now, as states roll back restrictions, is complacency . "We remain an island sanctuary ... but the world is not out of the woods yet."
How prepared is Australia for a second wave?
Right now, Australia's coronavirus wards are quiet. One of them, a pop-up hospital built in just 37 days on a cricket pitch in Canberra, may even be quietly dismantled without ever seeing a patient.
The disaster mapped out in early epidemiological models three months ago has not come to pass in Australia - at least, not yet. Professor James McCaw is among the experts at the Doherty Institute in Melbourne working on such models and says while Australia has so far avoided the devastating crush of COVID-19 cases seen in other countries, he winces when he hears an Australian speak of the pandemic in the past tense: "We are still at the very start of this."
The danger has become as invisible as the virus, notes epidemiologist Dr Craig Dalton, because state and federal leaders acted on those models. Just weeks earlier, that curve had looked very different, with cases doubling every three to four days.
"People can't see what [was avoided], they would have been even more fatigued by shutdowns if they happened earlier," Dalton says. "But I think probably if we left it even a week later, it could have been much, much worse."
The measures have bought Australia time. Stocks of life-saving ventilator machines have tripled. Extra staff are being trained in intensive care. Testing has been ramped up. And Australia now has an army of disease detectives finding and isolating cases mostly imported from overseas. Even large clusters, such as those spawned by the Ruby Princess cruise ship debacle in Sydney or the Cedar Meats outbreak in Victoria, have been stopped before they could spiral out of control.
Of course, Australia's low infection rates could make it a victim of its own success, Kelly says, with a population more susceptible, to the pathogen if a second wave takes hold. "But I'm more hopeful now that won't happen."
How is the pandemic expected to unfold?
In the US, top infectious disease expert Dr Michael Osterholm often says that a virus has its own "gravity" or momentum. If left to its own devices, it would burn through cities until enough of the world's population had recovered with virus-fighting antibodies in their blood to ward off another infection. This is known as "herd immunity" and the magic number is about 60 per cent - generally more than half of a population needs to be exposed to a pathogen before transmission slows. No country is there yet. Even those now overrun with the virus, such as the US, have reached only about 20 per cent.
During the great plagues of the past, humanity had little choice but to let their immunity to disease build naturally. Now we have medicine and vaccines to speed things up - but even the most optimistic estimates put a COVID-19 vaccine discovery and rollout at between 12 and 18 months away.
Osterholm and other experts predict the pandemic will last between 18 months and two years. But the virus is likely to hang around longer - to be beaten back through vaccinations or perhaps to persist as a seasonal illness.
"Viral gravity" also means that, like the ocean, outbreaks can play out in waves - a surge of cases might peter out only to peak again then crash back in another torrent.
The last time the world faced a pandemic of this scale, it was reaching the end of World War I. But it was the second wave of that strange 1918 influenza, known as Spanish flu, arriving months later that claimed the most lives. For Australia, the third wave in January 1919 proved the most deadly.
During influenza pandemics since, experts point out that all of them saw a resurgence about six months later, regardless of the season. Many, such as the 1957 flu pandemic and most recently swine flu in 2009, were even bigger than the first wave. This is our worst-case scenario for COVID-19.
"If we relax restrictions too much, we could get a huge second wave," McCaw says. Still, he remains hopeful for the "slower burn" scenario that Kelly is banking on, in which outbreaks flare up in smaller and smaller numbers and are put out by contact tracers.
This virus is more than 10 times deadlier than seasonal flu and we will need to be on our guard in a "COVID-safe world" for some time. "For us, eternal vigilance may be the price of survival - as my surgery tutor used to tell me," Kelly says. "At least until we get a vaccine."
But if humanity doesn't get its shot of immunity before the pandemic burns out, Osterholm's research also envisions a third scenario - of more pronounced flare-ups or "mini-waves" that will likely require countries to restore social restrictions.
Are we already seeing the start of a second wave?
Early success stories, such as Singapore, Germany, Japan, South Korea and even the Chinese city of Wuhan where the virus emerged, have seen fresh clusters break loose again when rules were relaxed.
But the World Health Organisation warns we are still in the first wave. If a second surge does come, experts expect it to arrive about the end of the year.
During the 1918 Spanish flu, San Francisco acted fast, shutting down while other US cities were overrun. But when cases receded, it opened up. A second wave hit but San Francisco resisted restoring the restrictions. By the end of the pandemic, it ranked among the worst-hit cities. Likewise, when the third global wave reached Australia, NSW lifted its shutdowns too early and delayed reinstating them, as cases climbed.
Resurgence is common in the pandemic records but Kelly says the fear of a larger second wave is still tied to 1918.
Some experts argue that virus mutated between its first and second wave to become more infectious. This coronavirus is more stable than influenza and it behaves differently.
At first, McCaw says, disease modellers looked to the other two dangerous coronaviruses, SARS and MERS. But while both strains are more lethal, they are also less infectious. Critically, Kelly notes, they are not known to spread undetected, without symptoms, in the way the new coronavirus can.
While some question the scale of the disaster first predicted for Australia, McCaw says data suggests there would have been a catastrophic outbreak without controls. "This is the same virus. We've seen what it can do."
How do we know it's safe to reopen?
In the vast jungle of data growing around COVID-19, Kelly is watching one number in particular - the reproduction rate, which measures how many other people on average each patient will infect. If we can keep it below one in Australia (as it is right now), the virus will eventually die out.
Then there's who is getting infected and why - 50 new cases arriving from overseas is not as big a concern for Kelly and his team as 50 cases without a clear source. "That means it's circulating in the community somewhere," he says.
At the Grattan Institute, Stephen Duckett is working on new modelling to try to measure tipping points - when a cluster could break through containment efforts. Both Duckett and Dalton are especially concerned about large workplaces. Kelly agrees good ventilation as well as hand hygiene will need to come more to the fore. Work rosters could also be staggered, Duckett suggests, with one cohort of staff cycling through the office on alternative weeks and deep cleans in between.
Public transport may be all that stands between us and the traffic jams of our nightmares but in the era of COVID-19, how do we avoid the peak-hour crush without handicapping the whole network? Some experts suggest we follow the lead of Europe and the US and make masks mandatory on board, but Kelly says solutions around ventilation, passenger limits and staggered timetables would be more effective because masks are so often worn improperly.
Dalton says relaxing the rules in relatively "low-risk" settings such as cafes with customer limits or outdoor dining is one thing. "But places like nightclubs, aged care, religious institutions, that's where we've seen things go wrong [overseas]."
Will shutdowns come back if cases climb again?
Minister Hunt says it is unlikely states will bring back restrictions. Instead, "ring fences" of containment can be rapidly set up around an outbreak, putting a local area into its own lockdown.
But some experts say Australia needs a well-spaced and specific framework in which to measure the impact of reopenings, similar to Germany's "emergency brake" that considers restoring restrictions if cases reach more than 50 per 100,000 people over seven days.
Bringing back wider lockdowns in Australia can't be taken off the table, Kelly says, but it's not part of the plan - which is to mostly reopen Australia by July. "But we're going slow so we don't have to say in a month, 'whoops, it's out of control'," Kelly says. "[So] we don't have to take out the sledgehammer again."
States are easing restrictions at different paces, but "none are going dangerously fast", he says. Some have enjoyed consecutive days without recording a new case.
Australia did not opt to try for total elimination of the virus as New Zealand did with its own tougher lockdown across the ditch, but Kelly says it's possible the virus could be wiped out if our national borders stay up (to all, perhaps, but our Kiwi neighbours under a mooted Trans-Tasman bubble of safe travel).
Kelly "can't imagine any time into the future we'll be getting back to business as usual" at the borders but, at some point, Australia will have to open back up to the world.
And the longer our lives are disrupted, the more likely another "wave" of health problems beyond just COVID-19 will build, including suicide. On the economic side of things, at least, analysis by MIT researchers suggests that social restrictions could actually help countries recover long-term. US cities that locked down early and for longer periods during the 1918 flu had both fewer deaths and healthier economies when it was over, as local industries bounced back faster.
McCaw says our leaders listened to the experts in imposing shutdowns and it saved thousands of lives. " If it's between locking down again or having a runaway outbreak, I know what I'd pick."

Full text: But any plan must be dropped in an instant if the coronavirus reignites in the community.
The proof of Australia's success so far in the coronavirus crisis is that children will soon be going back to school. The ferocious political debate about the return to the classroom is now mostly about how to make the change - and not so much about whether that change should come.
But there is one fundamental fact that is too easily lost in the highly emotional arguments among politicians, parents, teachers, unions and everyone else with an opinion about when students must be back at their desks. "This is like a spot fire during a bushfire - until everything is out, anything can happen," says James McCaw, an epidemiologist at the University of Melbourne.
In other words, any plan should be dropped in an instant if the coronavirus ignites again in some part of the community. This will be deeply frustrating to parents who want to plan for the term ahead, or teachers preparing lessons, but there is no point demanding certainty when this virus allows none.
McCaw is a professor of mathematical biology who works with colleagues at the Doherty Institute on the modelling that helps guide national cabinet in its response to this crisis. He believes there is a better case for resuming school classes than some of the other options over the weeks ahead.
Every option involves risk. What should be allowed: large weddings, football games, house parties or eat-in restaurants? It is impossible to reopen everything because that would put us on the path to copying Italy, so it is about choosing one option over another.
There is a powerful case for making schools the priority. The disruption to school education has been severe and parents are not the only ones paying the price. "Early on parents were pushing for schools to be closed," says a federal government backbencher. "Now a lot of parents have home-schooling fatigue."
The greatest cost is to the children, and especially those who do not have large homes with speedy Wi-Fi and patient parents. The greatest damage from an extended period of online learning is to those who need the classroom more than most.
So there is a compelling case for a staged return to school in the timeframe set out by NSW Premier Gladys Berejiklian, with classes from May 11.
First, a study in The Lancet concluded this month that school closures alone would prevent only 2 to 4 per cent of deaths, much less than other social distancing interventions. Second, the COVID-19 figures in Australia show the small scale of the threat to children. Of the 1337 cases in Victoria, only 58 involve patients under the age of 20. All of them have recovered except for one male teenager. Of the 2971 cases in NSW as of Wednesday night, only 121 were under 20.
Peter Collignon, an infectious diseases physician, a professor at the Australian National University and the executive director of ACT Pathology at Canberra Hospital, is one of the experts who thinks schools should reopen with strict controls. "I accept the evidence is incomplete, but all the evidence in Australia at the moment is that the risk of transmission is low," he says.
While schools could be called "petri dishes" for influenza because children spread the disease, Collignon says the science on COVID-19 so far suggests it is very different. Put simply, children do not appear to be major spreaders.
Mary-Louise McLaws, a professor of epidemiology at the University of NSW, backed the school closures in March and is cautious about reopening. She believes schools must stop contact between parents - there will be no time for talking at the morning drop-off - and safeguard teachers.
This means parents have to stay away from each other, teachers have to minimise contact with each other and those who are most vulnerable to the virus - older teachers, or those with health conditions - have to be able to stay home.
While Berejiklian is in a fight with the main teachers' union about her plan, the nature of the argument is a sign of progress despite the intense rhetoric. NSW Teachers Federation president Angelo Gavrielatos wanted kindergarten and year 12 to resume first, rather than the Premier's approach of resuming all classes for all children for one day a week, then two days a week, and so on. Interestingly, Gavrielatos is not objecting to the May 11 deadline.
Will it be safe to return to school from the middle of May? "It should be being considered right now as a reasonable and possible timeline," says McCaw. "We will know in a couple of weeks if it is still reasonable to consider."
There is an essential but unpalatable proviso in McCaw's comment. Only when a school reopens could the medical experts really know if it is safe. The moment a COVID-19 breakout occurs, the approach has to change.
There are no options without risk but the priority should be to return children to their classrooms and end the inferior education of the computer screen.

Full text: A long-term strategy to ease ­social-isolation restrictions and expose Australians to COVID-19 in manageable doses, without overwhelming the public health system, is being considered by health officials and some NSW government ministers.
As infection rates continue to fall across the country, The Australian has learned suppression strategies may eventually be eased — if only slightly, and in a staggered form — as part of an ­effort to expose healthy Australians to the disease to lift immunity rates.
Some NSW government ministers are agitating for the state to recalibrate social-distancing measures currently in force. Some believe that not only are they damaging the economy, but they are viewed as unsustainable if the virus were to continue through the rest of 2020.
Last Wednesday, NSW Health Minister Brad Hazzard and NSW Chief Health Officer Kerry Chant held a conference call with a large number of NSW MPs in which the pros and cons of suppressing the virus were weighed up.
One MP said they were told that if the state were to try to contain the virus entirely, as some states have attempted to do by shutting their borders, it could leave the NSW community at a disadvantage.
“If that was the approach, we’d end up with a large portion of the population who are still susceptible, with no immunity,” the MP said, citing remarks made by Mr Hazzard and Dr Chant.
A senior NSW health official told The Australian that controlling the spread of contagion ­remained an absolute priority to prevent hospitals and intensive care units being overrun by ­patients, particularly during the Easter holiday period.
But eventually increasing ­levels of community immunity through exposure to the virus could provide an answer for ­society to return to a state of normalcy, particularly given the uncertainty about when or if a vaccine can be developed for COVID-19.
“People have to get sick for this to pass,” said a senior government MP. This could involve partial lifting of social-distancing restrictions for people known to be less vulnerable to the virus, such as schoolchildren, or young people less likely to die from the illness.
“We do need it to go through the community at a gentle pace,” the official said. School-aged children and young adults were “the least ­likely to have symptoms — it would start to increase the herd immunity for the country”.
NSW Premier Gladys Berejiklian said on Tuesday that ­although restrictions could be eased in the future, social distancing was the new “way of life’’ until a vaccine could be developed.
Since social-distancing restrictions were put in place, NSW has been buying time to enhance its healthcare capacity to prevent a rush on facilities — infection rates have been dropping steadily, reaching lows of 49 reported cases on Monday night, while intensive care capabilities have been lifted.
Health funding has been increased through stimulus packages provided by state and federal governments. In NSW, which has the highest concentration of COVID-19 cases, the government has been working to quadruple the number of intensive care beds from its current 874 capacity, including 730 with ventilators.
Australia has recorded a total of 5908 COVID-19 infections and 48 people have died. There are currently 305 people in hospital with the illness, with 93 in intensive care units nationwide, 37 of them requiring ventilators.
The usual capacity of intensive care units around the country is approximately 2200 beds, but the federal government has set a goal of having 7500 ventilator-equipped ICU beds in public and private hospitals. Even at that level of capacity, infections would need to be kept under tight control in order not to overwhelm hospitals.
The NSW official said: “The issue for us in Australia is that at some point you’ve got to start weighing up the consequences. If this goes on for six to 12 months, that could do much greater destruction to our economy and lifestyle than the virus is doing to us in the real terms.” Infectious disease physician and microbiologist Peter Collignon said social-distancing ­measures could not continue ­indefinitely, and governments were going to have to grapple with the question of how many people they were prepared to let the virus infect. “If we flatten the curve too much and have no immunity in the population, we might be in a worse position than the US or Italy come six months’ time,” he said.
“But the trouble with the idea of building up herd immunity, which I think Sweden seems to be following, is you’ve got to get to 60 or 70 per cent of the population infected.
“The trouble with that is that with the mortality rate of this virus, that’s an awful lot of deaths. So I’m actually not sure I think that’s the best idea.” Professor Collignon, from the Australian National University, said he did not think it was a good idea to lock down everybody to the degree that was being experienced in Victoria or NSW.
James McCaw, an infectious disease modeller with the Doherty Institute, said that if social-­distancing measures were relaxed, the numbers of infections would skyrocket. “We know that our population is still largely susceptible, and so if we relaxed and went back to normal we would see a rapid and explosive resurgence in epidemic activity,” he said.
Professor McCaw acknowledged that keeping the current stringent level of social restrictions was not feasible in the long term.
The Doherty Institute’s modelling found that in an uncontrolled epidemic, even if the number of ICU beds were to be doubled nationwide, only between 10 and 30 per cent of critically ill people with COVID19 would be able to access an ICU bed.
“An unmitigated COVID-19 epidemic would dramatically exceed capacity of the Australian health system over a prolonged period,” the modelling said.Case isolation and quarantine of close contacts of infected people would also be insufficient to constrain the number of cases to a level in which the health system could cope. However, if social distancing were to reduce transmission of the virus by either 25 or 33 per cent, together with a doubling or tripling of ICU capacity, all critical cases would be able to be accommodated in ICUs.

Health experts call for mass testing

Full text: STRATEGY Experts have called for mass testing for coronavirus in Australia as NSW’s Chief Health Officer warned 1.5 million people in the state are likely to be infected.
The number of confirmed COVID-19 cases in Australia rose to 155 on Thursday, the numbers of diagnoses doubling each week.
The biggest rise in cases was in NSW, where the count stood at 78 on Thursday night, with several new cases of unknown origin.
Chief Health Officer Kerry Chant told a budget estimates hearing that modelling indicated one in five people in NSW would be infected with COVID-19 in the “first wave” of the spread.
It was expected the numbers of people requiring intensive care beds would double at the peak of the epidemic, Dr Chant said. “At the moment, we have asked the system to go for two times (current capacity), and an increase in ventilator capacity for twice that.” The growing evidence of community spread of COVID-19 prompted NSW Premier Gladys Berejiklian to foreshadow cancelling major events.
“It is not business as usual,” she said. “We’re asking everyone to consider how they move around.
“Some of the cases are yet to trace the source of where they contracted the virus, and for that reason NSW will continue to review all of our policies in relation to mass gatherings and where there are large numbers of people congregating.” The Victorian government continued to insist on Thursday that it was safe for mass events such as the Formula One Grand Prix to go ahead.
It comes as immunologists pointed to the success of countries such as Singapore, Hong Kong and South Korea in stemming the spread of COVID-19. One of the keys to containment in those countries was mass testing of the population, said University of Queensland virologist Ian Mackay on Thursday.
“What seems to have worked well is lots of testing, finding the ­infected people, isolating them, finding their contacts, keeping them quarantined and also social distancing measures to keep people apart,” Professor Mackay said.
Emeritus professor John Dwyer from the University of NSW this week called for random testing of people in the community so that health authorities could properly determine how widely COVID-19 had spread in the ­community.
With many people who contract the disease asymptomatic, wider testing could allow health authorities to plan for the likely impact of the pandemic.
The head of the biosecurity unit at UNSW’s Kirby Institute, Raina MacIntyre, said only increased testing would yield true information about the disease’s spread.
“What we can’t count is how many asymptomatic cases there are in the community who may ­infect others … unless the availability of data is increased,” she said.
The director of Victoria’s ­Doherty Institute, Sharon Lewin, said it was not feasible to test too many people because of resource ­constraints.
The Doherty Institute has carried out thousands of coronavirus tests in the past six weeks.
She also said there was a limited global supply of the chemicals ­required in the testing process.
Tests are either done using a test kit, or a “home brew” of chemicals is used. “You need specialised chemicals that you’ve got to buy,” Professor Lewin said. “There is a concern globally that we could run out of tests.“We’re protecting against that by stocking up on reagents. We’re making sure we’ve got enough chemical reagents to last for many months.”
