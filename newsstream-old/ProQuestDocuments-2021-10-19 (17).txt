Full text: Scott Morrison says state and territory leaders must hold their nerve on the national plan to help people “invest, employ and move on”, as new polling revealed ­almost 80 per cent of Australians supported an end to border closures and lockdowns when vaccine targets were achieved.
After the country reached more than 40 per cent fully vaccinated adults on Wednesday, the Prime Minister said the national cabinet’s reopening plan was a deal with Australians to end “the fear of future lockdowns”.
A report released by the Business Council of Australia on Friday, outlining the next steps required to lift Covid-19 restrictions, said inter­national border closures and lockdowns were costing the economy $4.3bn a week.
Pressure from business and industry groups for state leaders to stick with the plan came as the Nat­ional Skills Commission on Thursday said labour market conditions were easing, with one in four NSW employers standing down staff in August.
Mr Morrison said state and territory leaders must “hold your nerve” as millions of Pfizer and Moderna vaccines arrive in coming weeks, ensuring that by mid-October the country would have enough vaccine supply to double-jab all eligible Australians.
With Western Australia Premier Mark McGowan saying he would not reopen the state until vaccine thresholds reached between 80 and 90 per cent, potentially delaying the lifting of domestic travel restrictions until April, Mr Morrison said it was time for the country to “live with the virus”.
“The next stage will be hard. We’re about to see that in NSW and Victoria. As they ease up, both states know hospitals will come under pressure, we’ll see case numbers rise, and that will be challenging,” he said.
“If you want to live with the virus, you inevitably have to pass down that tunnel.
“My advice to WA is get vaccinated and get ready - get your hospital system ready, get your health system ready and push through, and we can all reconnect and be one again.” The BCA - representing the nat­ion’s largest employers - said before achieving the 70 and 80 per cent vaccine targets, governments needed to adopt the UK model of rapid antigen tests in workplaces and homes and prepare health systems for capacity surges during outbreaks. It released polling showing strong support - ranging from 71 and 77 per cent - for opening state borders and phasing out lockdowns when vaccine thresholds were met.
As the nation moves out of the suppression phase to stage two of the plan, the BCA said home quarantine should be introduced, ­arrangements put in place for the return of international students and skilled workers and digital proof of vaccination systems prepared to allow fully vaccinated Australians greater freedoms.
BCA chief executive Jennifer Westacott called on states and territories to follow NSW Premier Gladys Berejiklian’s lead in releasing freedom road maps to “put the nation first and start planning to rejoin the rest of the world … We can either move forward as one nation or risk standing still as a collection of divided states.
“Based on the national plan and informed by expert Doherty ­Institute-led modelling, this is a plan to end the friction that makes it too difficult to plan and do business,” Ms Westacott said.
“This isn’t just about the staggering economic cost of lockdowns, it’s about letting Aus­tralians see their loved ones again, meet up with friends and just get on with their lives.” NAB chief executive Ross McEwan said businesses needed “clarity to plan for the future”, including more detail on exempting vaccinated residents when restrictions lift at 80 per cent vaccinated.
“European countries have provided this by implementing a vaccine pass, which gives people freedom to attend restaurants, sporting events, major concerts and domestic travel,” Mr McEwan said.
“Australia needs its own ­national vaccine pass, providing similar freedoms, ready to launch when we reach 80 per cent.
“This should be developed alongside existing plans for an international vaccine passport for Australians to prove their immunisation status overseas and on their return to Australia.” Ms Westacott said any delays in reopening would be a “risk to our international reputation as a good place to do business, invest, visit and create jobs”.

Barr leads national cabinet push on childhood vaccines

Full text: There are plans under way to vaccinate as many children as possible across Australia before the end of the year, the ACT's chief minister said.
Andrew Barr pressed national cabinet on Friday about childhood vaccinations, saying state and territory leaders needed to consider the safe rollout of a vaccine for children aged 12 to 15.
Mr Barr also confirmed the ACT was working to open vaccination registration for people aged 16 to 29 but said the announcement eligibility would be expanded nationally did not mean extra doses.
It came after Prime Minister Scott Morrison on Thursday announced eligibility for the Pfizer vaccine would be expanded nationally to people aged between 16 and 39.
Mr Barr said the prime minister's announcement, which he labelled a "captain's call", was intended to mean bookings could begin from August 30, "not that vaccinations would be able to be administered".
Before national cabinet on Friday, Mr Barr said one of his main priorities was to push for a vaccination program for children after Canberra's outbreak had disproportionately affected school-aged children.
"I'll take the opportunity to raise a series of concerns at that meeting. Most particularly about our nation's plans to protect and vaccinate children and young people from the virus," he said.
Following the meeting, Mr Barr confirmed all jurisdictions were working on vaccination plans for children aged 12 to 15, but this was dependent on supply.
"[This is] with a view to vaccinate as many children as possible before the end of the school year in December," he said.
Pfizer is the only vaccine that has been approved for this age group, and is currently only available to children with an underlying health condition.
Mr Barr also demanded clarity from his national cabinet colleagues about vaccination targets drawn from the Doherty Institute modelling. He said he wanted to ensure the targets referred to the point at which vaccines became effective, rather than when they were administered.
"We know, and every chief health officer around the nation has been saying this repeatedly, but maybe not enough politicians have been saying this: the vaccine is not immediately effective once it's jabbed into your arm," he said.
"It takes several weeks for it to reach effectiveness; that applies to both the first and the second dose. So when we talk about 70 or 80 per cent, we must talk about when the vaccines become effective, not just the moment the jab goes in your arm. Targets are not reached on the day of vaccination. It takes time. There are a range of very significant issues that need to be considered here. There won't be outcomes on this from today's meeting, but it is a very important issue that we know is on the minds of so many Canberrans and Australians."
Mr Barr said improved treatments for COVID-19 were an important factor in considering how restrictions would be used in the future.
"If we can treat people and avoid severe illness, combined with protecting them from getting the disease in the first place, that combination of factors can make a big difference to the public health settings you have in place," he said.

Deal for 1m more Pfizer doses 'just not enough': premiers

Publication info: The Canberra Times ; Canberra, A.C.T. [Canberra, A.C.T]. 16 Aug 2021.

Full text: Most premiers and chief ministers are yet to learn when their populations will receive a share of million extra Pfizer Covid doses that Australia's federal government has purchased from Poland.
Only NSW Premier Glady Berejiklian was given a timeline for her state's share - 530,000 doses - which are due to be distributed next week to the 12 local government areas hardest hit by the Delta outbreak.
Chief Minister Andrew Barr said the ACT's 14,000 or so extra doses were helpful but not a game-changer, equivalent to an extra week's supply for the territory.
Mr Barr said it would have little effect if the extra doses were prioritised for young people, currently ineligible for Pfizer vaccinations.
"It's just not enough to make any inroads, any significant inroads, in the cohort that's approaching 80,000 Canberrans. So to double-dose, you'd need 160,000 doses," he said.
Victorian Premier Dan Andrews said the extra doses were good news, but supply remained the primary limiting factor for getting people in his state vaccinated. He urged people to take advantage of bookings already available for AstraZeneca doses.
"No one should delay on the basis that more is coming. Yes, there is more coming but when that occurs - who knows," he told reporters in Melbourne.
"That can be highly variable and the more people that are protected faster, the greater the benefit to all of us."
Across Australia, 5.3 million people are fully vaccinated, or a little over 26 per cent of eligible people over the age of 16. Almost 10 million people have received at least one dose, or 47.7 per cent of the eligible population. The government is no closer to a plan to vaccinate children under the age of 16.
Prime Minister Scott Morrison said the extra doses heading to NSW were purchased in a "straightforward transaction" with the Polish government and earmarked for 20- to 39-year-olds identified in the Doherty Institute modelling as peak transmitters of the virus.
This younger cohort has largely been ineligible for Pfizer doses, but the NSW state government has been running drives, including one at Sydney University on Sunday, to get more uptake of the AstraZeneca vaccine, which is available.
The first shipment of the extra Pfizer doses left Warsaw on Saturday following commercial negotiations with the Polish government that began several weeks ago, Mr Morrison said.
"A key factor in being able to secure these doses from our Polish friends has been that we have had a significant outbreak in our largest city," he told reporters in Canberra on Sunday morning.
Mr Morrison went on to confirm he had spoken with the head of Pfizer, Dr Albert Bourla, to secure authorisation for the government-to-government purchase that the Polish government said was made on a non-profit basis.
The deal does not relate to the existing 40 million doses purchased directly from Pfizer, the majority of which are scheduled to arrive in the final months of 2021.
Poland has offered to provide its surplus doses to low and middle-income countries, especially in its region. Australia is the first high-income country to be added to that list.
These doses come from the Pfizer plant in Belgium where Australia's existing order of Pfizer doses are also coming from, and are already approved by the Therapeutic Goods Administration.
Mr Morrison thanked his Polish counterpart Mateusz Morawiecki.
In a statement, the Polish embassy in Canberra said it hoped the provision would support Australia's efforts to ramp up its vaccine rollout at a critical moment, and commended Australian authorities for the first joint deal of this kind.

Vaccine hesitancy is rife among year 12s

Full text: The Berejiklian government’s vaccination push for year 12 students is in danger of being derailed by high levels of vaccination hesitancy among the cohort, coupled with a large number of students opting against the jab in protest against the HSC ­examinations.
The indications of significant hesitancy by students come as new Doherty Institute modelling released on Tuesday found vaccination of young people was a key component needed to move away from lockdowns, with young ­people being the cohort most likely to transmit the virus.
Nearly 20,000 year 12 students from Sydney’s eight hardest hit areas are scheduled to be vaccinated with Pfizer from Monday as the NSW government pushes to return them to face-to-face learning in time for their exams.
An informal survey conducted among year 12 students suggests many of those eligible may choose not to have the jab.
A survey of 4507 students within a private year 12 Facebook group with more than 36,000 members found 40 per cent of respondents would not take up the offer for the Pfizer vaccine.
By comparison, an Australian Bureau of Statistics survey released earlier this month found 73 per cent of Australians would get a Covid-19 vaccine when it was available and recommended for them; just 11 per cent said they would not get one.
Vaccine hesitant responses littered several separate posts in the group, with students raising questions over its efficacy and safety.
“There is no way I’m getting that vaccine. It’s not safe, they need to do more research before they want to give it to people,” one student wrote.
Another one said: “I’m not getting that vaccine and that’s final. If it stops me from getting the same education as everyone else, the government is dumb.” The survey’s organisers, Greystanes High School students Henley Warner, 17, and Luca Kent, 18, hope to present the results to the Minister of Education, Sarah Mitchell. Henley said she was surprised by the high levels of students opting out of the vaccine, and more needed to be done to target education about the vaccine to school children.
NSW year 12 students’ final year at school has been riddled with chaos, with the city lockdown forcing them to learn from home for six weeks, and many finding it difficult to concentrate.

Full text: The Berejiklian government’s vaccination push for Year 12 students is in danger of being derailed by high levels of vaccination hesitancy among the cohort, coupled with a large number of students opting against the jab in protest against the HSC ­examinations.
The indications of significant hesitancy by students come as new Doherty Institute modelling released on Tuesday found vaccination of young people was a key component needed to move away from lockdowns, with young ­people being the cohort most likely to transmit the virus.
Nearly 20,000 Year 12 students from Sydney’s eight hardest hit areas are scheduled to be vaccinated with Pfizer from Monday as the NSW government pushes to return them to face-to-face learning in time for their exams.
An informal survey conducted among Year 12 students suggests many of those eligible may choose not to have the jab.
A survey of 4507 students within a private Year 12 Facebook group with more than 36,000 members found 40 per cent of respondents would not take up the offer for the Pfizer vaccine.
By comparison, an Australian Bureau of Statistics survey released earlier this month found 73 per cent of Australians would get a Covid-19 vaccine when it was available and recommended for them; just 11 per cent said they would not get one.
Vaccine hesitant responses littered several separate posts in the group, with students raising questions over its efficacy and safety.
“There is no way I’m getting that vaccine. It’s not safe, they need to do more research before they want to give it to people,” one student wrote.
Another one said: “I’m not getting that vaccine and that’s final. If it stops me from getting the same education as everyone else, the government is dumb.” The survey’s organisers, Greystanes High School students Henley Warner, 17, and Luca Kent, 18, hope to present the results to the Minister of Education, Sarah Mitchell. Henley said she was surprised by the high levels of students opting out of the vaccine, and more needed to be done to target education about the vaccine to school children.
NSW Year 12 students’ final year at school has been riddled with chaos, with the city lockdown forcing them to learn from home for six weeks, and many finding it difficult to concentrate.
On Wednesday, Premier Gladys Berejiklian signalled that Year 12 HSC students might not return to classrooms on August 16, as previously announced.
With the return to school hinging on higher vaccination rates, some students are adopting an anti-vaccination stance to persuade the government to cancel the HSC altogether.

Full text: New data released by the federal government shows the Southern Highlands and Shoalhaven is ranked second in the state in vaccine take up just behind the North Sydney and Hornsby area.
In the Southern Highlands and Shoalhaven region, 50.5 per cent of people aged 15 and over had received their first jab compared to 51.9 per cent in North Sydney and Hornsby.
And 22 per cent of those over 15 in the Southern Highlands were fully vaccinated, almost 5 percentage points less than North Sydney and Hornsby.
In the capital region, which holds the Far South Coast and sits between the Shoalhaven, the ACT and the Victorian border, 46.8 per cent of people aged 15 and over had received at least one dose and 17.9 per cent had received both doses.
South West Sydney, which is the worst area impacted by the virus, was ranked last in NSW with 33.1 per cent of its population having been given their first dose while only 14.6 per cent were fully vaccinated.

The data did not show the average age of people in an area or the supply rates of vaccines which may have caused rankings to skew in favour of areas with a higher percentage of people who had been eligible for the vaccination.
Over 12 and a half million vaccine doses had been administered in the country with over one and a half million coming from NSW state administered clinics and about seven million coming from commonwealth clinics.

The state recorded 233 new cases on Wednesday with Premier Gladys Berejiklian announcing a man in his 20s had died in his home from the virus.
The Premier has maintained 80 per cent of the adult population in NSW would need to be vaccinated for there to be no more lockdowns.
"It's really in our hands how we deal with the cases coming down, but also vaccinations," Ms Berejiklian said.
"Both vaccines are working very effectively. We still don't know of anyone in intensive care who has received both doses."

The Prime Minister on Friday announced Australia would need to fully vaccinate 70 per cent of its eligible population before restrictions begin to ease. The next phase, essentially eradicating lockdowns, would kick in at 80 per cent.
Federal opposition leader Anthony Albanese wants to pay $300 to every Australian who is fully vaccinated by December 1.
Labor on Monday called for $300 to be paid directly to any Australian over 18 fully-vaccinated by December 1.
Prime Minister Scott Morrison blasted the move as a "vote of no-confidence" in Australians.

MORE WEEKEND JABS

Full text: STATE and federal leaders have agreed that more people need to be vaccinated at weekends as the number of pharmacies offering jabs is set to more than triple by the end of the month.
After the national cabinet met on Friday, Prime Minister Scott Morrison said that while Thursday had been a record day with 175,000 vaccinations nationwide, the number lagged at weekends.
Last Saturday, just 83,000 shots were administered, with 50,000 on Sunday. “On the weekend, jabs go right down as you don’t have as many GPs, offices and clinics­ open,” Mr Morrison said.
“The state clinics are open in many places, but the states and the commonwealth are looking for ways to increase availability and points of presence­ for people to get their vaccines on the weekends.” Mr Morrison said that in just three days this week 500,000 doses of vaccine had been administered across the country. The government expects the number of pharmacies ­giving jabs will jump from 65 to 350 by early August.
The PM said the increase in the rollout points was dependent on the increase in vaccine supplies.
The number of Pfizer jabs arriving in Australia is set to reach one million a week from the middle of next week.
“There is no point having more points of presence with a static amount of supply – that just increases the logistical difficulty,” Mr Morrison said. “So as the supply ­increases, we can have more pharmacists come online.” Victoria’s Covid commander Jeroen Weimar said the state had more than 12,000 first-dose Pfizer appointments available over the next 10 days at 78 clinics.
There are 27,000 spots available for those eligible for second Pfizer doses. “If you are eligible for Pfizer, I urge you to make an ­appointment,” he said. The NSW outbreak has passed 1000 cases, with another 97 confirmed on Friday, three-quarters of them in Sydney’s southwest.
A senior government source said the commonwealth was analysing which clinics were doing the biggest jab numbers at weekends with an eye to ­encouraging more GPs, pharmacists and state clinics to emulate them.
The source said the expectation was that GP clinics and state clinics would need to stay open longer on Saturdays and Sundays to bring weekend vaccination totals closer to the weekday numbers.
Vaccination boss Lieutenant General J.J. Frewen addressed national cabinet on the progress of the rollout and planning under way to expand vaccination sites for aged-care workers and the wider community through pharmacies. The meeting was also briefed on the progress of the four-step plan to reopening and the Doherty Institute’s modelling on safe vaccination levels needed before the country could fully unlock.

Half a vaccinated nation is enough for MPs

Full text: Liberal MPs have identified ­national vaccination rates as low as 50 per cent as the threshold to clear the first phase of the Morrison government’s “new deal” road map to normality as epidemiologists try to determine the “magic number”.
National cabinet agreed to a four-step blueprint on Friday for a phased easing of restrictions once Australians have met the new vaccine thresholds, which will be set using scientific modelling from ­epidemiologists at the Doherty ­Institute in Melbourne.
Sydney MP Jason Falinski said the two key trigger points to opening up should be all residents having been offered a jab and half of all adults having received both jabs.
“I think once everyone has had the opportunity to be vaccinated and we reach a threshold of 50 per cent, we should move to a staged opening over three months where restrictions are eased gradually,” he said.
“That would build confidence in the community to ensure the health systems can handle it.” Health Minister Greg Hunt on Monday said the government would continue to follow the ­advice of medical experts when it came to determining the “magic number” for reopening, but warned that if new more virulent variants emerged those reopening targets may be revised.
“It’s likely that these thresholds will be enduring, but if the medical device changes because of a new strain, because of new learning, then we have to give ourselves the honest position of saying we’ll adapt to the global circumstances and adapt to the medical advice,” he said.
Mr Hunt’s Liberal colleague, Tim Wilson, told Sky News a threshold of 60 per cent would be sufficient to clear the first hurdle.
“Frankly, we’re going to move past the first stage, it’s going to be somewhere around 60 per cent,” Mr Wilson said.
“From there the objective should clearly be that people have a responsibility for themselves, a responsibility to their fellow citizens, and as they meet that threshold then the cost ratio moves in favour of getting vaccinated for those who are more aware.” Since announcing its path to “normality” the Morrison government has come under pressure to specify what level of vaccination coverage would be required to ­enable the country to ease restrictions and limit the use of lockdowns.
NSW Premier Gladys Berejiklian, who has previously identified a target of 80 per cent as being sufficient to reopen international borders, on Monday said supply ­issues were still hampering the state’s ability to get jabs in arms.
NSW Health Minister Brad Hazzard warned the rollout had become “the hunger games” as authorities raced to vaccinate as many people as fast as possible and as the state’s Covid-19 outbreak surged to 312 cases.
Mr Hazzard said the state’s priority was vaccination as he called on the federal government to rollout more Pfizer doses to more GPs.
“We will continue to have ­effective The Hunger Games going on here in NSW,” he said.
“I think the focus should be at the moment, and the federal government appears to be doing this, to try to roll out as much vaccine as they have available.” Mr Hazzard said until the federal government effectively ramped up the number of locations to deliver vaccines, the challenges would remain.

Full text: The wonder of digging up the past Opining on what profession we might choose if we had our time over again, few could ignore the calling of forensic archaeology after reading my favourite story of the day in The Daily Telegraph (Frozen in time: Victims of Vesuvius unearthed, 23/11).
A Jeffery Archer imagination might also be helpful as clues are shuffled in a speculative jigsaw puzzle of the ages.
The frustration might be the reality that speculation is not fact and our ingenious perceptions are filtered by our own past experiences, innately blinding us and distorting objectivity.
Uncertainty arises when a woollen jumper is worn when cold but also as protection against hot ash. A winter eruption is suddenly less certain in the debate over Vesuvius’ deadly eruption.
With volcanoes erupting over the eons, one might assume thousands of Pompeii-like villages await discovery.
Brilliant word craft and analysis in your article could only light the fire of discovery in the hearts of a new generation of archaeologists.
Alan Sexton, North Parramatta
How can commanders be absolved over SAS actions?
Congratulations to your columnist Andrew Bolt on his brilliant article on the alleged crimes of the Australian SAS forces in Afghanistan (A safe war for some, 23/11.
The special inquiry’s finding that there is no evidence that the commissioned officers involved including the Joint Task Force commanders, who included the ADF Chief General Angus Campbell, had no knowledge of the alleged crimes, should not mean that the commanders should be fully exonerated from all responsibility.
In the first place, the Task Force commanders permitted these troops to undertake numerous repeated tours of duty of the most gruelling and traumatic warfare against a non-uniformed terrorist enemy when this should not have been permitted. There should have been a maximum tour limit imposed of no more than two or possibly three tours and they, the commanders, failed totally in this regard.
In addition, why was the debriefing process so deficient that no evidence of any of these alleged crimes was uncovered by the commissioned officers?
Finally, it is obviously most appropriate that, if the service medals of all SAS troops who served in Afghanistan from 2009-2013 should be revoked, then the DSC medals awarded to the Task Force commanders should likewise be revoked.
Peter N Dunlop, Kincumber
Collective guilt unjust The alleged war crimes by Australian soldiers in Afghanistan will cause incalculable damage to the Australian psyche if proven to be true. In that event it will take much in deeds, action and time to repair the damage.
It is therefore imperative that Prime Minister Scott Morrison devotes all necessary resources to bring the issue to a conclusion in the shortest possible time — meaning months, not years.
Just as important is that only those found to have acted unlawfully should be considered to be stripped of awards or citations (Don’t punish our son, 23/11).
Collective punishment for the sins of a few will damage morale unnecessarily. Gary Bryant, Gladesville
Bordering on cruelty The Queensland government and their health leaders are acting like a cruel and shameful lot.
Another heartache with the Collins family, one of many stupid decisions made by a state government which is ripping the heart out of families (Cruel one day, heartless the next, 23/11).
When will this abuse of power be removed from Annastacia Palaszczuk and her team?
Surely it’s time the commonwealth steps in; after all, the Wuhan virus is a national pandemic, requiring a national response for the good of all Australians.
Peter Cattlin, Freshwater
Fear of future mars policy I think a question that should be put to some of Australia’s state premiers in regards to their handling of the coronavirus is, are they imposing restrictions in response to situations happening now or are they imposing restrictions based on fears of situations that may or may not happen in the future?
While taking precautions is important, premiers should not make decisions in response to situations that haven’t occurred.
B Thompson, Cowra
Roadmap to economic ruin Matt Kean’s $32bn “roadmap” to power NSW is both ill-conceived and delusional (Fears ‘flawed’ plan will lift power price, 23/11).
Kean never explains how replacing coal base-load power with wind turbines and solar power is going to provide NSW with reliable, available and affordable power.
Tomago alone would probably use most of the power generated by renewables, not to mention what happens when the sun doesn’t shine and the wind doesn’t blow.
The facts are Kean is only interested in pushing his own idealist barrow. He doesn't appear to care if electricity prices go much higher or you can’t afford to pay the quarterly electricity bill.
Let us have a bit of reality in this argument and make sure we have plans to replace base-load power with more base-load power, otherwise this is a plan for economic and social disaster.
John Kelly, Koolewong
Kean for green power It’s great that Matt Kean is seeking to increase cost-effective power supply at a time when there is a need to replace ageing coal-fired power plants (Fears ‘flawed’ plan will lift power price, 23/11).
There is plenty of independent modelling by respected experts to show new renewable energy (vs new fossil fuel facilities) is the least-cost path for generating electricity.
Anne O’Hara, Wanniassa, ACT
An age-old dilemma A Tele story shows how costs have climbed for petrol, beef, furniture and household appliances etc yet the government has determined pensions need not rise as inflation was negative, that is after taking into account a reduction in childminding costs (Price hikes to leave Aussies short in retirement, 23/11).
Looks like my wife and myself better get busy to produce some more children just to take advantage of this negative inflation impact on our old age pension.
Alex Uren, Canowindra
Two true blue roos It is good to read about buying Australian-made, but what about Aussie made and owned (Triple A call for Oz goods, 22/11).
If two products were on the shelf next to each other and one was owned by an overseas company and the other Australian, I know which one I would buy.
It would not be that hard to work it out — Australian-made leave the kangaroo gold on a green background or Australian made and owned make a green kangaroo on a gold background.
William Dawes, Koonawarra
Briefly … It looks like Donald Trump won’t believe any recount unless it is in his favour. He should just recount the votes himself since he is doing nothing till 20th of January next year apart from creating more division and confusion.
Sam Saidden, Parramatta ●● ● Great to hear teachers will get mandatory training in mental health — how about making it mandatory for parents (We can talk now, 22/11).

Not only will we see offenders antics from within the vehicles on FB, but also from above. Pity the drones couldn’t be equipped with air to ground guided missiles.
JEFF, CONDON.
Scott Stewart the only drones up here are you Harper and Coralee O’Rourke. What a complete waste of money this. Your story on page 7 in Monday’s paper is a joke. More strings in the government bow! Hooning is not the problem. It’s just plain theft. And why have these drones not been available before now? I would hate to believe that the upcoming election has anything to do with this. Your catch and release is the problem. I want to know what will happen when/if you catch these criminals? The whole thing is a basket case. The youth detention centre is unsafe for the staff. This has been well documented but not addressed. Why have they lost half their staff? The voters are not dumb like you think we are. You’re my elected MP and I’ve never seen or heard from you. At least try to get out amongst the people. Or is that what your afraid of?
GLENN 4810 So, Scott Stewart, do you make any apologies at all to the long-suffering citizens of Townsville after none of the many “strings in your bow” has had the slightest effect on stopping these recidivist kiddie-crims from running amok on our streets? Do you really think drones are going to stop them? You and your other Stooges have to be dreaming.
LAWRIE 4812.
Soon the police will be able to apprehend more hoons, at enormous expense, using drones. They’ll be taken into custody, sent before a magistrate, and set free with a warning. Nothing will change except the cost.
AGS HERMIT PK Drones to be implemented now. Yahoo! As usual just before an election but wait, there’s more … just wait for ALL the goodies to come, those just held back for this special occasion. Politics and politicians are now the in thing. Make up your mind who to vote for because it’s for four years.
M J REYNOLDS MT LOUISA Nels 4811. How would making the little criminals who stole the vehicles and destroyed the newly revamped Heatley Park sweep gutters and clean toilets to pay off the damage bill achieve anything and act as a deterrent? Wouldn’t it be more beneficial if they were given six months behind bars to think about their actions?
RON KELSO.
JO Kirwan, are you serious? Ask people who know Troy Thompson and he wasn’t the CEO of any international company. He isn’t going to do anything as One Nation will always be powerless. Don’t waste your vote on him.
PETE KIRWAN I have lived in the seat of Mundinburra for a long time and know Les Walker as he is my local councillor. He would be my pick for the job. He has plenty of experience and is a very good community advocate. He has helped me out heaps of times.
MEL V. 4811 Les Walker, mate you’re a nice bloke but your council and your party don’t want you. Save yourself the heartaches and walk away from Mundingburra.
MAX, CRANBROOK Relocate NRL club. Who are these people? It was not their game to sell, a club’s supporters are it’s strength. Manly, Cronulla , best leave it alone or lose a lot of NRL following to Netflix.
CRIS WULGURU.
Les Walker for Mundingburra. Labor will be back on track in Mundingburra with a well known and popular Labor member with an extensive law & order background to be our candidate.
PF AITKENVALE Les Walker, the good people of Mundingburra have been messed around enough, to quote that great Aussie character Aunty Jack “make up your bloody mind, especially you stupid.” PEDRO CRANBROOK The wordsmiths down south have switched from “Covid Hotspots” to “acceptable risks”. We are all equal in this country (aren’t we?) so we all should share the risk! About one covid infection per family sounds about right and fair to me... eh?
DODDY KELSO Meatloaf’s new song is for the Cowboys. one out of ten’s not bad. PAT 4820 Being someone who does not trust the Queensland Labor Party or the chief health health officer who admitted that she lied and there was no need to close schools it was done just to scare people. Could the Queensland government please release all its modeling.
BILL 4850 I wonder what the opposition leaders in Queensland and Victoria are saying in their prayers before going to bed. Probably something like thank heaven I am not in power so I can say anything about the direction of the state government in these difficult times.
TED, CONDON.
Mr Harper can you please supply the numbers of crimes that have been committed by juveniles in each of the last five years in Townsville under your watch. Prove to the rest of us that your party’s policies on juvenile crime are working and the numbers are going down . You seem to go missing when it comes to this subject but yet you still expect our votes. Come on, do you take us for fools?
BLU KIRWAN Thomas West End, please put your shoes in Coralee’s and I’m sure you would do the same. Why put yourself through criticism every day and be suffering in silence. All the best Coralee get your health back for you and your family.
BARB T, MT LOUISA.
The inauguration of Sweden’s HYBRIT pilot plant for fossil-free steel puts the writing on the wall for coking coal. With thermal coal already outcompeted by renewables in most of the world, we need to plan for the inexorable decline.
STEVE, BELGIAN GARDENS I disagree with the closure of our borders and agree that we should carry on with our lives as normal so as not to destroy our economy any further. What I strongly object to is the closure of them and the granting of exemptions for sporting codes, boxing matches, car racing and so on. Its either one rule for all or none at all.
RON KELSO.
John Hathaway you’ve got my vote! To have Labor in government for another four years will kill Queensland. I love beautiful Queensland, it’s in my heart. I want Queensland to thrive and get jobs for my kids and my friends. Thanks mate.
MICK PIMLICO It appears Dan Andrews has a plan. He is touted as a very intellegent man so he must be able to see that his practices don’t work. Maybe this is the best way to ruin the economy and split people as Marx said.
COL ROSSLEA Very hypocritical for federal government and business leaders to call for state borders to be opened when they keep the international borders closed. If there is nothing to worry about, just ignore the scientific evidence and let the death toll soar.
JOHN TOLGA Anyone know who makes the speed zone signs on the main highway. I was thinking about buying some shares in the company. Counted about 25 different speed zones and I stopped counting at Rollingstone. It’s like a real jigsaw puzzle at the moment with all the roadworks and the impatience drivers are scary.
SAM 4850 Please name one country that genuine Australian citizens are fleeing to to avoid the virus and jump on the welfare gravy train offered, not one exists. How stupid are our government officials.
DOC CONDON RE Article (TB 6.9.20) where Bob Katter claims five broken noses from rugby league. I suppose repeated severe head trauma could explain some of his ridiculous behaviour and outrageous statements.
LC, CARDWELL So the ratepayers will fork out (again) to repair the damage done to parkland by juvenile crime. Well, we can’t make the kiddies do it because that could be traumatic. When identified, the parents/carers should be charged with child neglect and sentenced to community service maintaining the parks. If the offenders are wards of the state, the politicians and senior bureaucrats responsible for this mess should do the work in their own time. If they were all personally inconvenienced, the problem would be swiftly resolved.
JEFF, CONDON Crime in Townsville is out of control and costing taxpayers millions in damage as well as mental health toll – we are living in fear. We need to address the problem at its rotten roots – these young people have nothing. They were born into a system of unfairness and they know it. Australian CEOs receiving bonuses of half a million and more during a recession while their workers are on JobKeeper. Australia is no longer the land of “The fair go”. Young people at risk are acting out because they know the system is built against them. Fix it. Get them rehabilit­ated. Get them set up for a good life. We clearly have the money. It’s just in the wrong (and greedy) hands.
CBD WORKER 4810 If we can get the AFL grand final to Brisbane then let’s have a crack at getting the Melbourne Cup to Townsville.
BARNEY BELGIAN GARDENS.
NB 4717, if your radio station doesn’t have local announcers, I suggest you do as I did. Walk away and find one that does.
JAMES,CONDON Well done, Cowboys. It was a long time coming but hard work and perseverance has done you well. Best wishes for your final three games. DOT FROM DOUGLAS.

Full text: The Great Australian Bight has been spared – for now. But can this pristine wilderness hold out forever against the hunger for its resources?
At the Head of Bight, on Australia's remote southern coast, the grandeur and the loneliness of nature are on conspicuous display. Behind you stretches the broad semi-desert of the Nullarbor Plain; ahead, the billiard table of the continent falls, as if sliced with a knife, into the heaving Southern Ocean.
From the top of the 100m-tall Bunda Cliffs, looking out over the blue-green vastness, you fancy you can see the Earth's curvature. Due south, next stop is Antarctica.
This is the Great Australian Bight, hundreds of thousands of square kilometres of ocean bordering a crescent of raw, wind-lashed coastline running from east of Esperance, in Western Australia, to the tip of South Australia's Eyre Peninsula. One of the world's most pristine marine environments, with more biodiversity than the Great Barrier Reef, the Bight is a haven for endangered species including southern right whales, which calve off the Head of Bight in winter. The chilly, nutrientrich waters also produce some of the nation's most highly-prized seafood, including southern rock lobster, Coffin Bay oysters and the sashimi-grade tuna fattened in pens off Port Lincoln.
Then there are the untapped riches thought to lie deep beneath the seabed: billions of barrels, potentially, of crude oil. For the past decade, a battle has raged over this submerged black gold, pitting fishermen, surfers, councils, tourism operators, environmentalists and traditional owners against the oil industry and its government proponents. Three multinationals have eyed up the Bight, then pulled out - most recently, in February, Norway's state-owned Equinor, formerly Statoil.
Opponents hailed Equinor's departure as a historic win, rivalling the victorious campaigns to prevent Tasmania's Franklin River being dammed and construction of a gas hub in the Kimberley at James Price Point. The Federal Government is still pushing for the Bight to be exploited, however, linking its reserves to fuel security. Meanwhile, the small, isolated communities dotted along the coast have been left bruised by the years of strife. While "Fight for the Bight" crusaders are convinced a catastrophe has been averted, others rue the lost economic opportunities for a struggling, often overlooked region.
Over a video call, Trina Spitzkowsky is rifling through a crowded rack of Southern Ocean marine life costumes. "Look, here's our leafy seadragon," she exclaims, donning an iridescent green, papier-mache head. "And this is SAD SOB the seagull. He was our mascot."
SAD SOB (Stop All Drilling Save Our Bight) is the group co-founded by Spitzkowsky in Penong, a community of 300 people on South Australia's far west coast. This is an area so thinly populated, it has no local government. For Spitzkowsky, "it's beautiful - but you've got to be prepared for 46 degrees, and a plague of mice, and to have a snake come through your lounge room". The closest town to the Head of Bight, Penong relies on tourism: fishermen, and surfers drawn by nearby Cactus Beach's world-famous swells. "Tourists are 40 per cent of our business," says Phil Laws, owner of Penong's Comet Cafe. "If something went wrong out in the Bight, it would destroy the town."
Like other groups established along the Bight, SAD SOB was co-ordinated out of a modest home with a dodgy internet connection. It took years for the issue to gain momentum. "We felt like the forgotten people down here," recalls Anna Taylor, who set up Unite the Bight in Elliston, on the western Eyre Peninsula. In Ceduna, east of Penong, seven people took part in Breony Carbines' first beach protest in 2014. "We started our Clean Bight Alliance not knowing there was a broader campaign emerging," says Carbines.
"Down the track, the dots got connected."
The biggest fear of these communities was the potential for an oil spill that would pollute the clean waters, wipe out birds and marine life, wreck commercial fisheries and tourism, and disfigure bays and beaches. Their first adversary was BP.
When the resource industry contemplates the Great Australian Bight, it sees one of the world's last frontier basins, tantalisingly underexplored. As well as oil, the seabed is believed to contain huge reserves of natural gas. Woodside tried its luck there in 2003, to no avail. In 2011, BP was awarded four exploration permits. Months earlier, its Deepwater Horizon rig had exploded in the Gulf of Mexico, causing the largest marine oil spill in history.
Peter Owen, director of the Wilderness Society South Australia, was "gobsmacked" to learn BP was planning to sink four wells 370km offshore, in the middle of a network of marine parks. Owen thought it "absurd to be opening up new fossil fuel basins" - and, in the Bight, extremely dicey. BP would be drilling in ultra-deep waters of up to 2500m, meaning higher costs and greater risks.
Based on its own modelling, oil from any uncontained spill would reach Elliston and Coffin Bay in as little as nine days, Kangaroo Island and Port Lincoln in 15 days, and Adelaide in 20 days. More than 4000km of coast, from Western Australia to southern NSW, could be affected.
Ceduna, a socially disadvantaged town of about 2000 people, was designated BP's helicopter base.
The company built a hangar, distributed community grants and sponsored the popular Oysterfest.
Bruce Zippel, an oyster farmer in nearby Smoky Bay, viewed BP's critics as an "emotionally driven lynch mob". He remembers the outrage that greeted the appearance of oyster lines and baskets in bays in the late 1980s. "There was a Coffin Bay action group, growers were hassled, there were claims it would destroy local fishing and tourism," he says. "Thirty years on, I saw the same thing happening, only this time fuelled by social media.
Many people were frightened to speak out because of the intimidation they faced. Businesses were worried about being boycotted."
Yet Zippel's own industry was deeply divided over drilling. Says Garry Seidl, another oyster farmer: "There was no economic benefit - it was all risk, for every seafood producer, every tourist operator and everybody that lives along the coast."
Sean Doherty, a surfing journalist and Bight campaigner, recounts: "These little towns got torn apart by those who wanted it and those who didn't. Everyone was bluing." One vocal opponent of Big Oil tells of receiving two phone calls in the night, two weeks apart. Each time he picked up, all he could hear was the sound of gunshots.
Even over Zoom, Bunna Lawrie's low, warbling rendition of his people's whale song gives you goosebumps. The Mirning elder and musician, whose country borders the western Bight, is relating the story of Jeedara, his whale ancestor.
"The whales are our family," he explains, "and we have this uncanny gift that we can communicate with them." A few years ago, Peter Owen accompanied Lawrie to the Head of Bight; he watched as Lawrie stood at the cliff edge and slowly waved his clap sticks back and forth - and two whales, a mother and calf, emulated his gestures in the water below. "They literally went up and down in front of him for about an hour," he says.
In 2016, anti-drilling groups formed the Great Australian Bight Alliance. Its leaders - Owen, Lawrie, former Greens leader Bob Brown and Sea Shepherd Australia's managing director, Jeff Hansen - decided to make a documentary showcasing the Bight. Their expedition took them to jewels such as the Pearson Isles, which Hansen calls "Australia's Galapagos", and where "our welcoming party was endangered Australian sea lions rushing out to meet us". A South Australian government scientist pronounced the adjacent marine ecosystem "as pristine as we're going to see". Meanwhile, a four-year, $20 million study of the Bight, funded mostly by BP for the environmental plan it had to submit to the industry regulator, was nearing completion. The new research underscored the global significance of the Bight's habitats and migration pathways for creatures including great white sharks, 36 different whale and dolphin species, New Zealand fur seals, turtles and numerous birds.
BP maintained it had the experience and technology to operate safely, using semi-submersible rigs stabilised by GPS. Detractors argued that the Bight's deep waters, combined with year-round ferocious winds and mountainous swells, made exploration exceptionally hazardous. Moreover, cleaning up a spill would be near-impossible, they contended, pointing to the hostile conditions, the cliff-lined coast and the remote location. Andrew Hopkins, an ANU professor and international expert on industrial safety, labelled BP's plans to plug a spill "a long way short of industry best practice".
In September 2016, a violent storm pummelled South Australia, blacking out the entire state.
Dunes and cliffs were reclaimed by the ocean, and century-old jetties demolished. Days later, BP withdrew from the Bight, citing a reassessment of its investment priorities. But for Penong's Trina Spitzkowsky, "it was like Mother Nature saying, 'No, you can't do this'".
With their fountains, colonnades and acres of Italian marble, Port Lincoln's waterside mansions flaunt the wealth of the "tuna barons" - the mainly Croatian migrants who started catching migrating fish out at sea and towing them into the Spencer Gulf to be farmed. Worth about $130m annually, and employing nearly 1200 people, tuna remains the flagship for Port Lincoln, home to the southern hemisphere's largest commercial fishing fleet.
Brian Jeffriess, the Australian Southern Bluefin Tuna Industry Association's influential CEO, supported offshore exploration at first - oil, like tuna, was a natural asset, he reasoned. In Port Lincoln's other seafood sectors and the growing ecotourism industry, some fretted about the region's clean image. Others appraised the opportunities.
In late 2017, Chevron, which also held permits, followed BP out of the Bight. Statoil, soon to restyle itself Equinor, was now the leading protagonist. By mid-2018, 11 coastal councils were formally opposing its plans and, with others yet to take an official position, the issue was convulsing Port Lincoln.
City councillors narrowly rejected an anti-oil motion, prompting a backlash so fierce that a public meeting was convened, attended by 300 people.
A second anti-drilling motion succeeded, amid allegations one councillor was "bullied" into changing her vote. "We were divided, and it divided the community," says then mayor Bruce Green, who - like his Ceduna counterpart - welcomed the resource companies to town.
By then, Jeffriess had switched his stance to being anti-exploration and, claims oyster grower Bruce Zippel, "the tuna industry snapped its fingers and some of the other seafood sectors came on board". With a chuckle, Jeffriess dismisses that as far-fetched, given resentment of tuna's "millionaires' club". His industry had concluded the risks were simply too great. "Even the Japanese longline fishermen, who are very strong characters, are scared out in the Bight," he observes. "They regard it as the roughest seas by far in the world."
With Equinor poised to begin drilling in late 2020, beach protests were swelling all along the coast. Another dozen councils passed motions.
Eight women - including Trina Spitzkowsky, dressed as a seagull - trekked the 220km from Penong to the Head of Bight. Placard-waving activists picketed Equinor's meetings, and paraded in their costumes at Oysterfest. Trevor Gilmore, a former lobster fisherman from Streaky Bay, branded them "alarmists". "There are so many humpbacks in the Bight, we're going to have yachts running into them soon," he says.
A 2018 report commissioned by industry group APPEA (Australian Petroleum Production and Exploration Association) forecast oil would add at least $6 billion annually to the South Australian economy over 40 years and create up to 1500 jobs.
Initially, these would mostly be roles on the rigs for fly-in, fly-out workers. But once production started, APPEA insisted, some of those workers would relocate to nearby communities. There would be jobs for locals at the airport and helicopter base, and in catering, logistics and safety monitoring. Infrastructure would be upgraded. Fewer young people would leave. "If you look at towns in Norway and Western Australia close to these offshore developments," says Bruce Green, "there's a very substantial lift in economic activity."
Nevertheless, with Port Adelaide as the marine supply base, many of the associated jobs would be in the state capital. In Ceduna, a BP executive reportedly told one local, "basically it will be the bakery, filling the pie warmer [at the hangar], and maybe one of the cleaning businesses". Meanwhile, fishing, aquaculture and tourism provide about 5000 jobs. For the little towns, "there was nothing in it - nothing but risk", says Elliston's Anna Taylor. Spitzkowsky reflects on the use of the South Australian outback for nuclear and rocket tests, and now, to be situated at Kimba on the Eyre Peninsula, a nuclear waste dump. "They think it's just wasteland down here," she says. "Do you think they'd drill in Sydney Harbour?"
Yet there is little dispute about the region's need for economic growth. Andrew Beer, executive dean of the University of South Australia's Business School, who conducted a socio-economic study of the Eyre Peninsula and west coast, says: "This is a landmass twice the size of Wales with a tiny population which has been poor in jobs for a very long time. They're on the edge of the continent, with the desert behind them and a bloody great ocean in front. There's this sense of an invisible fence separating them from the rest of society."
In March 2019, about 2000 people converged on Cosy Corner Beach in Torquay, Victoria, and paddled out to form a huge circle offshore. In surf culture, paddle-outs usually honour the dead; this one was about protecting the Bight. As local surfer Damien Cole surveyed the chanting, splashing crowd, he "realised this had struck a chord". Over the following months, paddle-outs were staged around the country. As Cole recalls: "We told people, 'You don't have to be a surfer - this is for anyone that's had sand between their toes.' We had families, grandparents, little kids - everyday Australians standing up for what we love."
In May 2019, campaigners took their fight to the Norwegian company's home turf. Former pro surfer Heath Joske, now a prawn trawlerman in Streaky Bay, led a paddle-out in Oslo's harbour.
Bunna Lawrie addressed Equinor's AGM, crowned with feathers, a whale tail painted on his chest. He recounts: "I looked those Equinor people in the eye and I said, 'You're not welcome in our country.'" Back home, a "national day of action" in November saw 57 paddle-outs around the country, from Kalbarri in Western Australia to Townsville and Darwin. After that, events moved quickly.
Just before Christmas, Equinor cleared a crucial hurdle when the regulator approved its environmental plan. In January, the Wilderness Society launched a Federal Court challenge. And in February, Equinor quit the Bight, declaring the venture "too expensive".
Today, the Great Australian Bight remains a vast, empty expanse - no drilling platforms on the horizon, no tankers transporting oil to distant refineries. While several smaller companies still hold permits, it's unlikely another big player will emerge soon, given rock-bottom oil prices and demand slashed by Covid-19. Besides, public opposition may have scared off overseas investors, who "thought these projects looked like too much trouble, with all the focus on surfboards and placards and social media", says one industry source.
Amid a pandemic-inspired debate about sovereign capability, however, the federal Minister for Resources, Keith Pitt, is still spruiking the Bight as "a frontier opportunity". Once, local oil production met Australia's needs; now, about 90 per cent of fuel used in transport, mining and manufacturing comes from imported oil. There are warnings, too, of looming gas shortages in the south-eastern states as domestic production declines. Pitt tells The Weekend Australian Magazine: "We need to ensure we're self-sufficient in a post-corona world.
So we need to find the opportunities for business to come in and open up new fields." So, for now, the communities beyond that invisible fence are in limbo. "How can you invest with that uncertainty hanging over your head?" asks Brian Jeffriess. For campaigners, the next goal is to obtain World Heritage listing for the Bight - the only way to permanently safeguard it, they believe. "It's one of the last beautiful places on this planet," says Bunna Lawrie, "and once it's gone, it's gone forever."

Full text: Recent events have focused some long overdue attention on the products available right on our doorstep, writes Robyn Willis
We all love the idea of buying Australian-made products. In fact, many of us have watched the decline of local manufacturing in recent decades with dismay. And the arrival of COVID-19 has brought our dependence on imported goods into sharper focus in recent months.
So if you’re thinking now is the time to start supporting the local economy, from the designers and manufacturers through to the retail sector, there’s a few things to consider. For larger companies, look for the Australian Made green and gold logo. Products carrying the logo have been through a rigorous third-party accreditation system to earn the right to use it.
A little research on a company website will also reveal whether they are Australian owned and operated, using Australian materials and employing local staff. Smaller businesses will often offer more transparency, but if you want to be absolutely sure, deal directly with the maker.
Aside from indulging in a little homegrown patriotism, there’s plenty of reason to buy locally made products.
Even with larger firms, you can often customise the product to suit you and, as long as it’s in stock, delivery times are slashed. If you’ve engaged a maker, you can see the process close up and enjoy a stronger connection to the finished product. You may pay more to reflect wages, but enjoy the end result — a far superior product that will save you in the long run.

TABLE SERVICE Tableware manufacturer Mud Australia was established in Sydney in 1994 and has a faithful following thanks to its colourful ranges of plates, bowls, vases and even lighting, with pieces that look delicate but are surprisingly robust. There are 80 shapes, or silhouettes, in the collection available in 19 bespoke colours. Colour is added directly to the clay, which is imported from Limoges in France, at the slip stage and shaped using the slip cast method. Each piece will pass through at least five sets of hands before it is finished in the clear glazed interior and raw exterior for which the company has become known. All glazes and porcelain bodies are non-toxic and the ceramics are oven, dishwasher, microwave and food safe, making them easy to integrate into everyday living. Mud Australia has stores in Sydney, London and Los Angeles, but can also be found online. Look out for sales at the Marrickville studio to grab a bargain but make sure you come early — queues often go around the block.

CABINET TALKS Furniture designer and maker Ross Thompson draws inspiration from Japanese, Bauhaus and mid-century design to create beautifully-refined pieces that have a timeless quality. The Tambour door media cabinet (pictured) is a perfect example, with sliding doors that open fully and adjustable compartments. Ross comes from a family of makers and uses traditional and contemporary joinery techniques to create his furniture. He is formally trained in furniture making and is happy to customise to suit a client’s needs. This means no two pieces will be exactly alike — unless that’s what you want. He is based in South Geelong, Victoria.

BENCH BEAUTY It may be a household name but you may not know that surface supplier Laminex manufactures 95 per cent of its products, including their modern laminates, engineered stone, acrylic surfaces and timber panelling products in Australia. While it still represents great value for money, in recent years the locally-owned and operated company has gained a reputation for creating stylish surfaces that echo the beauty of natural products like stone without the maintenance issues. In addition, the company has also made a stronger commitment to sustainability, looking to reduce potentially harmful chemicals in the water-based resins used to produce its high pressure laminates.
