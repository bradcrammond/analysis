Full text: The hospitality industry has been warned to expect Covid cases at their venues after Melbourne opens up on Friday.
Covid commander Jeroen Weimar said the city’s reopening could be a “daunting moment” and urged businesses to follow Covid-safe measures and “bubble” workplaces in the event a cohort is forced into isolation.
“Maintain those important Covid-safe principles, the segregation or bubbling of your workplaces and workforces, so you can manage the impact because there will be positive cases in circulation,” he said.
“We have 22,000 positive cases in circulation in Victoria, it is exceptionally likely come Thursday there will still be 22,000 positive cases in the state.
“There will be cases in hospitality settings and it will be down to those systems to impact the imposition on people around them at the time.”
He hinted that tight isolation rules could be eased on a case-by-case situation after successfully easing quarantine requirements in supermarkets.
“There are alternative things we can do — we have done work with the supermarkets, we are not seeing significant numbers of workplace transmission taking place because we have principles around good ventilation, good workforce arrangements, good distancing, making sure the staff are vaccinated and keeping the distance and wearing a mask,” Mr Weimar said.
“Those things are making a difference and that has allowed us with supermarkets to reduce quarantine for primary close contacts and reduce the number of close contacts.”
It comes as Victoria recorded 1903 Covid cases and seven deaths overnight, days from the lifting of lockdown in Melbourne.
Outdoor trading has been given a $54.5 million boost as the state emerges from lockdown.
Minister Jaala Pulford said the investment was aimed at businesses as they prepared to recover and rebuild, but also for local councils to support businesses post-lockdown.
“The package will support a broad range of businesses, broader than the support last year, which was focused predominantly on hospitality,” she told reporters on Monday.
“So retailers, hair and beauty, dance studios and gyms, among others, will be able to explore new options to take some, if not all, of their trade outdoors.
“This is in addition to the bars, cafes and restaurants who were part of last year’s successful outdoor eating and entertainment program.”
A $14.5 million Covid-safe outdoor activation voucher program would also provide more than 7000 Victorian businesses, community organisations, not-for-profit and trader associations with $2000 grants when they spend at least that amount to support outdoor trading initiatives.
VICTORIANS ALLOWED IN QLD FOR CHRISTMAS Queensland’s borders are set to be fully reopened in time for Christmas after Premier Annastacia Palaszczuk today released her long-awaited Covid road map.
Ms Palaszczuk has set a target of December 17 for the borders to be fully reopened, but it could happen sooner if vaccination rates increase.
All arrivals from hotspots will be allowed to quarantine at home from November 19, when 70 per cent of the population over 16 have been fully vaccinated.
Once the 80 per cent target is reached, which is expected on December 17, fully vaccinated travellers will not have to quarantine.
Read the full story here.

SLOW VACCINE UPTAKE IN MELBOURNE SUBURBS Health authorities have identified about 25,000 people they would like to see get the Covid-19 jab as Victoria nears its vaccination targets and its reopening date.
Mr Weimar said if those individuals got their first doses, health officials would have greater confidence in community protection.
He also said there were a number of northern and inner suburbs where vaccine take-up was lower than other parts of Melbourne.
“The range of reasons is around individual groups not wanting to come forward and get vaccinated,” he said.
“As we see the rest of the city go beyond 85 and go to 90 per cent (first dose) those remaining islands of lack of vaccine uptake are becoming identified and becoming clear.
“That is why we have been driving at those locations with pop-ups and other community-based pop-ups, we will keep doing that because we want everyone to have no excuse not to get vaccinated over the days and weeks ahead.”
Fully vaccinated Australians will be able to download an international vaccination passport from Tuesday.

END OF ROLLING LOCKDOWNS Premier Daniel Andrews vowed Victoria will not endure another lockdown, and consigned hotel quarantine to a “thing of the past” for fully vaccinated travellers.
Appearing on breakfast TV on Monday to spruik his fast-tracked easing of restrictions, the Premier said there would be no further statewide or citywide lockdowns once lockdown ended on Thursday.
“That is what the national plan says, that is what I am determined to deliver,” Mr Andrews told the ABC.
“And because these vaccination rates are so high … we can be optimistic about the future.”
Asked to explain why hospitality venues could open to patrons from Friday but retail stores could not, Mr Andrews said the health advice had warned against it.
“If we could open everything at the same time and not have our health system overrun, of course we would do that,” he said.
“And I’m very sorry that we can’t do everything at once.”
The Premier also took a swipe at federal treasurer Josh Frydenberg over criticism that Victoria was dragging its feet in opening up.
“I would just say to Josh, this is not about you, and your breathless political rants don’t work against this virus,” he said.
“His endless criticism and negativity, I just don’t think goes down very well in Victoria because it doesn’t work against this virus.”
Speaking on Channel 7’s Sunrise Mr Andrews said Victoria’s hotel quarantine program would be “a thing of the past” for vaccinated travellers.
Mr Andrews said Victoria would introduce home quarantine for fully vaccinated travellers, with a quarantine period less than 14 days.
“We want to get open, and open to the world, as fast as we can,” he said.
Close to 70,000 test results were received overnight, while more than 32,405 vaccine doses were administered at state hubs.
There are currently 22,337 active cases across the state, with 66 per cent of eligible Victorians fully vaccinated.Vic Locally-acquired Covid-19

WHERE LATEST CASES, DEATHS OCCURRED A man in his 50s from Brimbank in Melbourne’s west has died with coronavirus.
A woman in her 60s and another in her 90s from Whittlesea in the city’s north also died in the past 24 hours.
So too did a woman in her 70s from Moreland, along with a man in his 70s from Baw Baw, a woman in her 80s and another woman in her 90s from Casey.
There are 851 people in hospital with Covid-19 across Victoria — 155 of those are in ICU and 103 are on a ventilator.

BIG CHANGE TO ISOLATION RULES Fully vaccinated people who visit tier 1 exposure sites will only need to quarantine for a week as part of a major overhaul of the strict isolation rules.
The changes will come into effect when the state reaches its 70 per cent double dose vaccine target at 11.59pm on Thursday.
It follows a growing recognition that thousands of people would be plunged into isolation, as the number of exposure sites is expected to surge as the state reopens.
It also comes a week after businesses pleaded for an urgent overhaul of the rigid “close contact” rule after mass staff shortages crippled public transport, parcel deliveries, GP clinics, supermarkets and other businesses.
The overhaul will only apply to non-household primary close contacts and workplace contacts that are fully vaccinated. They will be required to return negative test results on days one and six to be freed from a week’s quarantine.
Unvaccinated Victorians and household contacts of a known positive case will be required to continue to isolate for 14 days.

DIRE HEALTHCARE PREDICTION DOWNGRADED Victoria’s supercharged vaccine rollout has halved the number of people expected to die from Covid-19 before the end of the year, as new modelling shows a much lower risk of the hospital system being overwhelmed.
The Burnet Institute on Sunday updated its modelling – used to inform Victoria’s road map – also predicting a much lower hospital admission rate than first forecast.
It found that although case numbers were likely to peak at a seven-day average of 3850 in mid-December, the chances of the healthcare system becoming overwhelmed has dropped from 63 per cent to 23 per cent.
Experts said that was in part due to younger people being infected, as they tended not to become as sick and spent less time in hospital.
Chief health officer Brett Sutton said on Sunday the fast vaccination rate had also played a big role in reducing pressure on Victorian hospitals.
“With high vaccination coverage the health system will have significant challenges but it will cope,” Prof Sutton said.
Initial modelling from mid September predicted 2202 Covid patients would die between July and December but that has been revised to 1212.
As of Sunday, 144 Victorians had died with the virus this year.
“In the weeks and months ahead, we will see a peak in cases and we will see a peak in the number of people who are in hospital,” Premier Daniel Andrews said.
“And we will see people lose their lives to this … They’re not numbers, they’re people.”
Mr Andrews said it was “positive” that while case numbers were higher than authorities would have liked, the average length of hospital stays and the “acuity of illness is substantially less”.
It comes as new data shows the average age of Victoria’s latest wave of Covid-19 has fallen from 85 last year to 74 this year. And despite an 85 per cent drop in fatalities overall this year, more people aged 40-49 and 50-59 died of Covid in 2021.
Prioritising elderly Australians early in the vaccine rollout has been fundamental to reducing death rates, and the average age of victims, following disastrous nursing home outbreaks last year.
However, experts say the continued rates of death and severe illness among younger Victorians highlight the ongoing threat of Covid, even after the 80 per cent vaccination target is reached.
University of Melbourne Professor of Epidemiology Tony Blakely said Covid was increasingly spreading among younger people because “they’re not vaccinated yet, or just getting vaccinated, and they’re out there sick of complying” with restrictions.
He said modelling showed that even at 90 per cent vaccination coverage, the virus will spread “quite easily” if all restrictions such as density limits in venues and masks on public transport are lifted.
“You simply can’t get to a level with this virus, and the vaccines we currently have, where transmission is stopped. It’s just impossible,” he said.
While restrictions will be further eased at 70 per cent than originally planned, the Burnet Institute modelling showed if all freedoms planned for 80 per cent were brought forward, cases could peak at 4900 on December 12.
It would also increase the chance of the hospital system being overrun to 40 per cent, and the number of deaths would increase to 1373.National – 2021 – Covid Vaccination Stats

MORE ‘FREEDOMS’ ON WAY AT LAST Melburnians will finally be allowed visitors at home and travel across the city as the lockdown ends on Friday.
With 70 per cent of Victorians 16 and over due to be fully-vaccinated — well before the predicted October 26 — Premier Daniel Andrews on Sunday issued a revised road map.
By Friday, Melburnians will have endured 263 days under strict stay-at-home orders since the pandemic began, making it the most locked down city in the world.
Promised freedoms including an end to the controversial 9pm curfew and part-time school returns for years 3-11 will be brought forward to 11.59pm Thursday.
After intense pressure, Mr Andrews also detailed extra freedoms, with up to 10 visitors allowed to homes, outdoor gatherings of 15 people and pubs, cafes and restaurants able to host 20 vaccinated people indoors.
But in a major disappointment for long-suffering retailers, rules restricting them to outdoor trade remain unchanged. It comes despite indoor retail, bigger outdoor gatherings, the reopening of gyms, indoor pools and cinemas all being permitted in Sydney when NSW hit the 70 per cent vaccinated target.
Masks were also ditched outdoors in Sydney.
Under the revised Melbourne road map, residents will also be able travel freely across the metropolitan area with the 15km limit scrapped, and proposed 25km restriction shelved. Regional Victoria remains off limits.
Authorities have “strongly recommended” gatherings be limited to fully vaccinated people, but Mr Andrews admitted “that’s not something that we can necessarily enforce”.
He praised the five millions Victorians who turned out to get a vaccine in “record speed”.
Restrictions that will change
“I could not be more proud of our community for coming forward and making these decisions to protect themselves, to protect the people they love, and to protect all of us against this global pandemic,” he said.
“To be this closely aligned to NSW, to be only just a couple of weeks behind NSW when we know and understand just how much vaccine went there, it’s a credit to every single Victorian.”
Josh Frydenberg on Sunday repeated his calls for restrictions in Victorian to be aligned with NSW
“Some progress today, but a long way to go before Victorians, who have given up so much, get the same freedoms as NSW,” the Treasurer said.
Opposition Leader Matthew Guy said the outdoor mask mandate, retail closures and work from home edicts needed immediate review.
“It is important and positive that the government is starting to move, but I think we can do more,” he said.
“We’ve got a government that doesn’t necessarily keep to what it says it’s going to do – it chops and changes. We’re all looking for a date when this madness ends and we finally get out of this and start to live again.”
Responding to criticism he had not gone further, Mr Andrews said the government had “tried to be as fair as possible”. “When you do more, you can’t do everything … whenever you write lists, there’ll always be some people who are on the wrong side of the lines or not on the lists,” he said.
Mr Andrews pointed to even greater freedoms due to kick in at the 80 per cent double dose threshold, a target NSW met at the weekend.
Victoria is due to reach that mark later this month or early next month, with 90 per cent of people 16 and over projected to be fully vaccinated by November 9.
Chief health officer Brett Sutton warned: “The reality is a lot of people are going to be exposed to Covid-19 in coming months. Victoria on Sunday recorded another 1838 cases and seven deaths. There are currently 23,376 active cases across the state.

NO LIMIT ON A CITY HOLIDAY Melbourne’s holiday hot spots are bracing for an influx of visitors when city travel limits are lifted.
In an early reprieve, the travel limit will be lifted from Friday. With Melburnians still banned from the regions, Mornington Peninsula businesses are planning for a bumper weekend.
Penny and Graeme Hart, who run Hart’s Farm in Shoreham, began receiving bookings for visits to their apple orchard and farm gate soon after Sunday’s announcements.
“We’ve just had someone call to book a night just as I opened up the calendar for bookings,” Ms Hart said.
Mornington Peninsula Shire mayor Despi O’Connor said small businesses “couldn’t be happier” to reopen. “We’re working really hard to find the goalposts again,” she said.
Travel across the state will resume when 80 per cent of Victorians aged 16 and over are fully vaccinated.
Victorian Tourism Industry Council chief executive Felicia Mariani said it was “critical the state powers towards 80 per cent”.

CALL TO RELAX RULES ON NURSING HOME VISITS Aged care groups are demanding visitor restrictions at nursing homes be eased so people can be reunited with their loved ones.
In Victoria, residents can have two visitors a day without a time limit. But Councils on the Ageing chief executive Ian Yates says some centres had taken a cautious approach.
“The damage done in nursing homes, by being cut off from people, is going to rival the damage that was done in Victoria last year,” Mr Yates said. “Particularly to people with dementia, who can’t understand why they have been cut off.”
Aged care groups are developing a new industry code to advise how visits should look once lockdowns end.
The availability of rapid antigen testing is expected to enable greater certainty that people – such as children under 12 – who are not vaccinated do not have Covid-19 if they visit a loved one in care.
Mr Yates said if centres enforce a vaccination policy on visitors, residents not being able to see their grandchildren was “not going to fly”.
“(Grandparents) know that they don’t have a long time to go, you don’t go into a nursing home if you’ve got plenty of time left,” he said.
Victoria is due to review the restrictions on visitors to aged care centres when it hits the 80 per cent double dose vaccination target.

EASIER TO GET GROUPS TOGETHER Regional Victorians will be able to gather in slightly bigger outdoor groups than their metropolitan counterparts.
From 11.59pm on Thursday, public gatherings of 20 – compared with 15 in Melbourne – will be allowed.
Indoor settings – such as restaurants, cafes, cinemas and gyms – will also increase from 10 to 30 people per venue, if every guest is fully vaccinated.
Outdoor venues – currently subject to caps of just 20 people – will be able to welcome up to 100 fully vaccinated people.
If the vaccination status of someone is unknown, the venue will only be allowed to operate with 20 people.
Under the 70 per cent reopening, Melburnians are not permitted to enter regional Victoria unless they have a permitted reason.
Travel between Melbourne and regions will resume at the 80 per cent milestone, and Premier Daniel Andrews urges patience.

Modelling gets NSW Covid-19 hospitalisations peak wrong

Full text: But as case numbers rise, there is likely to be a corresponding rise in hospitalisations despite the high level of vaccine coverage.
That’s the assessment of biostatistician and epidemiologist Adrian Esterman who successfully predicted the rise in case numbers throughout the Delta wave of infections in NSW and Victoria.
NSW’s total number of cases is closely related to the number of hospitalisations, unlike in Victoria where hospitalisations have remained lower compared to the number of cases.
“What we’re seeing in NSW is that the number of hospitalisations pretty much parallels the number of cases, unlike in Victoria where there is a clear decoupling of cases and hospitalisations,” Professor Esterman said.
“So if cases start to go up in NSW there’s a good chance that hospitalisations will also go up. But as time goes on, because we’re getting such high rates of vaccination, then you’re probably going to see a more of a decoupling of cases and hospitalisations in NSW as well.”
Professor Esterman said the closer connection between hospitalisations and case numbers in NSW may be to do with the age range of those being infected. For instance, if more older people are being infected in NSW than Victoria, the hospitalisation rate will be higher.
There were 769 Covid-19 cases admitted to hospital in NSW on Monday, with 153 people in intensive care. The number of people in intensive care has decreased steadily from September 21 when 244 people were in ICU.
The number of hospitalisations is currently significantly less than the peak predicted in modelling. NSW government modelling indicated that there would be 3434 hospitalisations by late October and 560 people with Covid-19 in ICU. Burnet Institute modelling predicted peak hospital demand of between 2286 and 4016 cases.
The rate of increase in hospitalisations as cases start to rise in NSW is likely to be moderated by high vaccination coverage, with more than 90 per cent of people having had a first dose in NSW and 74 per cent fully vaccinated.
And because case numbers were reduced to below 500 by the end of lockdown, the rise in cases will be slower with easing restrictions. Because cases rise exponentially, the fact NSW is coming off a lower base of 496 cases rather than 1500 means cases will not rise as high now that lockdown has ended.
“The bigger the number of cases you have, the greater the increases you get,” Professor Esterman said. “So if you’re starting off at a lower base, then the rate of increase would also would also definitely be lower.”
But Professor Esterman said it was extremely difficult to predict what would happen with NSW case numbers now lockdown had ended.
“We see countries like Norway which a week ago relaxed all restrictions and their case numbers have halved versus the Netherlands which relaxed restrictions and case numbers tripled,” he said. “Someone would have to be really brave to say that there would be X number of hospitalisation on a given date.”
But there is good evidence to show hospitalisations can remain low even with high case numbers in countries with high vaccine coverage such as the United Kingdom, which has about 40,000 cases recorded a day but only around 800 a day hospitalised with Covid-19.

Modelling, data: how outbreak is tracking

Full text: Victoria's COVID-19 case numbers continue to follow - perhaps slightly exceed - the Burnet Institute's projections for reopening, with the growing effect of vaccination counteracted so far by increases in movement among the population.
However, data suggests Victoria is unlikely to have as many hospitalisations and deaths as there were in NSW because the state is further advanced in its vaccine rollout than NSW was when it had similar case numbers.
Modelling commissioned by the Victorian government and released alongside the state's road map to reopening forecast new cases would reach about 2000 a day on October 10 before plateauing, then jumping again when lockdown lifted at the end of October. The end point of the Burnet Institute's projections are troubling: peak hospital demand of 3150 patients, peak ICU demand of 706, and a better than one-in-two chance of overwhelming the healthcare system.
Although it is early, Victoria is so far tracking on that path - or indeed slightly above the predicted daily case numbers. "Everything seems to be occurring within anticipated ranges so far. But, of course, the further out we go, the more we expect some deviations due to changes in policy or behaviour that were unexpected or unknown a few weeks ago," said the Burnet's head of modelling and biostatistics Dr Nick Scott.
As cases rise, so do the number of vaccines in arms; Victoria now has 84 per cent of adults with at least one of their two required doses of vaccine. This successfully helped bend the curve in Sydney, where infections are now tracking down.
Federal government modelling suggests the increase in vaccination is currently responsible for a 25 per cent reduction in virus transmission potential in Victoria - versus 35 per cent in NSW. "The transmission potential has remained fairly steady - it just so happens that over the past few weeks the small reduction due to vaccination has balanced out by the small increase due to more mixing," said University of Melbourne Professor James McCaw, who supplies outbreak modelling to the federal government.
The effect of vaccines is most evident on Victoria's hospitalisation statistics.
Vaccines from AstraZeneca and Pfizer are about 93 per cent effective at preventing hospitalisation and death. They have also been taken up in greater numbers by people who are more likely to be hospitalised from COVID-19, like the elderly.
In the second wave, a rise in new infections was mirrored closely by a rise in new hospitalisations about two weeks later; it generally takes one to two weeks for an infected person to end up needing to go to hospital. While hospitalisations are rising in the current outbreak, they are not mirroring new infections as closely.
However, there are substantially more people in the ICU. During the second wave, there was a peak of 45 people needing an ICU bed on August 18. With the current outbreak, there have been more than 45 people in ICU beds each day since September 14. There are currently 114 people in ICU.
This is further illustrated by comparing Victoria's hospitalisations to NSW's.
NSW's hospitalisations rose in lockstep with their cases, yet Victoria's substantially diverged.
This is likely because Victoria is more advanced on its vaccine rollout than NSW was at a similar point in its outbreak.
As of yesterday, 66 per cent of Victorians in hospital with COVID-19 had not received a vaccine dose. Across the state's total population [including children], 31.61 per cent have not yet received their first dose.

Full text: And Tasmanian businesses and unions want federal support for casual workers to get vaccinated.
Labor member for Franklin Julie Collins said the party’s plan of a $300 payment to everyone who has had the Covid jab by December 1 would be a further encouragement and help the economy.
“With the Premier [Peter Gutwein] proposing an ambitious target to reopen borders, reunite families and help our tourism industry, it’s time to further encourage Tasmanians to get vaccinated,” Ms Collins said.
“We cannot leave any part of our state with low vaccination rates so we should be doing anything possible to help.”
Labor announced its $300 one-off cash payment in August arguing it would help businesses and workers struggling from lockdowns. It is estimated it would cost $6bn or about $180m in Tasmania.
Ms Collins said the government needed to do more to encourage more Tasmanians to get the jab.
“We know how important it is to increase vaccination rates. It is the key to making sure our hospitals and health system don’t get overloaded, and get our economy moving again,” she said.
Mr Gutwein said the best incentive for vaccinating was people knowing they were protecting “themselves, their loved ones and their community from Covid”.
“I believe the vast majority of Tasmanians are incentivised by these goals and I encourage them not to hesitate to get vaccinated,” he said.
Liberal Senator Eric Abetz rejected a $300 cash payment, describing it as a “bribe”.
“Labor’s answer to everything is to throw money at it,” he said.
“Tasmanians will make up their own mind whether or not they want to get the vaccine and don’t need a bribe to do so.”
Senator Abetz was confident Tasmania would reach 90 per cent of people vaccinated.
“But I’m concerned about setting timelines and I think mandating vaccinations for some employment is untenable,” he said.
Tasmanian Chamber of Commerce and Industry CEO Michael Bailey was worried about access to the vaccine for casual employees.
“I don’t think health decisions should be based on cash incentives,” he said.
“I think there is a need for the government to support casual employees to get vaccinated because not all businesses can afford to be without their casual staff.”
Unions Tasmania secretary Jessica Munday commended Labor’s push to try to make up for the federal government’s failure to “execute a consistent message on the need to be vaccinated”.
“The best use of support would be paid vaccine leave for casuals to allow them to get vaccinated and time to recover,” Ms Munday said.
“Tasmania has the highest rate of casual employees in the country and if someone makes an appointment to be vaccinated that means they have to tell the boss they can’t work that shift.
“A lot of Tasmanians are living in poverty and they have been thrown to the wolves because of Covid.”
Tourism Industry Council Tasmania chief Luke Martin said it was probably too late for a cash incentive.
“If you need a financial incentive you might need to take a deep, long hard look at yourself,” he said.
“You should be vaccinated to protect yourself, your family and friends and kids who work in hospitality or retail.
“Just look at the economic cost of the lockdowns in Sydney – I don’t think Tasmanians need more incentive than that.”

Saturday, October 2, 2021: A Tasmanian government minister, who has cancelled a trip to Queensland to see family, is urging parents to vaccinate their children.
Jane Howlett, the Minister for Small Business, Sport, Women and Racing, was due to fly to Brisbane on Sunday afternoon but cancelled the trip on Saturday for fear of lockdowns.
“I was going to head to Queensland to see my son and his family tomorrow afternoon but I’ve just made the decision to cancel the trip and push it out,” Ms Howlett said at a press conference on Saturday.
“I can’t afford to go into two weeks quarantine returning home, we’ve got parliament coming up.
“Unfortunately it was one of those decisions like many Tasmanians have had to make.
“We know how things change every day – just look at the (Covid) numbers in Victoria today – it’s terrible.”
Ms Howlett said parents should get their children aged over 12 vaccinated.
“We’ve got one week of school holidays left and I’d just like to encourage all families [to] grab their children, go to your nearest pharmacy and get vaccinated,” she said.
For Tasmanians already holidaying in Queensland, she urged them to check the Public Health website for updates on any lockdowns or hot spots.
Vaccine Locator

Friday, October 1, 2021: PREMIER Peter Gutwein has delivered a stern message to Flight Centre, which is preparing to mount a legal challenge against internal border closures if the state does not reveal “reasonable” plans to rejoin the nation in coming weeks.
The tourism giant has accused Tasmania, Queensland and Western Australia — who all have a hard stance on border closures — of costing the company $100 million a month.
“My first priority and the priority of people in this room is Tasmania’s health,” Mr Gutwein said.
“To be frank I couldn’t care less if the head of Flight Centre or any other business wanted to take Tasmania to court because our position will always be the health and safety of Tasmania.”
Tighter travel restrictions with Victoria will come into place at midnight tonight after the mainland state recorded more than 2500 cases in the past two days.
Tasmanian Premier Peter Gutwein said this was “an alarming rise”.
“In response to that increase from midnight tonight 12:01 tomorrow morning, Tasmania will be introducing increased travel restrictions with Victoria, the local government area of Hume,” Mr Gutwein said.
National – 2021 – Covid Vaccination Stats
“Importantly as well there are further additional 18 government areas that have been identified as high-risk. If you have been in one of those government areas you will not be able to enter Tasmania.”
The premier said the new high-risk LGAs would be listed on the coronavirus website, with the rest of Victoria remaining high risk level 2.
As of today, 72.6% of Tasmanians have had first dose and 58.4% are fully vaccinated
For those undertaking home quarantine, you will have to be double vaccinated.
Mr Gutwein said if people had travel planned from Victoria after midnight any G2G passes will be cancelled and you will need to apply to identify if you’ve been in those level 1 locations.
He also gave an update on Tasmania’s border reopening plan.
“Our planning remains on track to open borders before Christmas,” Mr Gutwein said.
“Our aim is to reach 90% of over 16s by the first of December.
“We will be releasing the modelling along with our border opening plan. This modelling will be released in mid-October the week beginning the 18th of October so that Tasmanians have confidence in knowing what the risks are and how we plan to manage them and the risks of opening borders up.”

Thursday, September 30: PREMIER Peter Gutwein will take his defiant stand on border closures to Friday’s national cabinet meeting as federal colleagues urged him to stick to the plan for reopening.
The Tasmanian government won’t consider fully opening borders until the state hits 90 per cent vaccination rate and 100 per cent of people having access to jabs.
Mr Gutwein also wants fresh modelling and to see the trend in case numbers in NSW and Victoria before making a decision.
On Wednesday, Mr Gutwein claimed Tasmania would suffer “upwards of” 14,900 cases, 590 hospital admissions, 97 ICU admissions and nearly 100 deaths over six months.
But the Doherty Institute modelling on which his assumption is based is a national outbreak which infects nearly 750,000 people within six months.
Australia has experienced 105,000 infections in the 18 months of the pandemic so far.
The Doherty Institute stressed “the deliberately artificial nature of our assumption that Australia’s population would experience a uniform national epidemic”.
The national plan agreed to by all states allows for the easing of state and national border restrictions once vaccination rates reach 80 per cent.
These include an exemption from domestic travel restrictions for vaccinated people and the gradual reopening of international travel with “safe countries”.
Minister for Senior Australians and Aged Care Services Richard Colbeck urged Mr Gutwein to stick to the plan.
“Under the consolidation phase of the National Plan, 80 per cent of adults aged 16 and over will be fully vaccinated,” he said.
“This will allow residents of all states and territories, including Tasmania, to live with the virus like any other infectious disease, while minimising serious illness and death.
“We know from extensive modelling and the experience of other nations, that high rates of vaccination offer a pathway to normality.
“As previously stated, I am confident any decisions made by Premier Gutwein will based on the ongoing advice of National Cabinet and the AHPPC and serve the best interests of all Tasmanians.”
Senator Eric Abetz said he was confident the Premier would make the right decision, as he had throughout the pandemic.
“We can’t force people to be vaccinated and we can’t live with lockdowns, border restrictions, mental health issues, huge government debt, and jobs losses forever,” he said.
“The rest of the world is moving forward with their lives and eventually we need to as well.”
Data from Tuesday shows Tasmania at 75.8 per cent first dose rates and 57.8 per cent fully vaccinated. The state is expected to reach 90 per cent by December 1.
More than 3000 doses are being administered daily and the rate is increasing.
Nationally 77.3 per cent of eligible people have had their first dose and 53.4 per cent have had their second dose.
An announcement on when the state will would relax border restrictions is expected to be made before Christmas.
Tasmania remains in a state of emergency.

Full text: A HIGH-profile public health institute known for its alarmist modelling and predictions about the pandemic is refusing to return nearly $5 million in JobKeeper subsidies, despite raking in an annual surplus last year of $60 million.
According to the 2020 annual report of the Melbourne-based non-profit Burnet Institute, taxpayer subsidies of $4,558,000 “enabled the ­institute to maintain a high level of productivity and a pipeline for research discoveries and important laboratory capacity to respond to Covid-19 initiatives”.
At the same time, the Institute also netted $56 million from the sale of property, as well as an $8 million profit from the sale of Biolabs 360, in which it held a 75 per cent stake. The Burnet Institute’s pandemic modelling, which has informed both NSW and Victorian government ­responses, has come under ­increasing scrutiny some of its dire predictions have failed to come true.
On August 2, Burnet Institute modelling claimed that Sydney would reach 8000 cases per day by the end of the month.
On August 19, Burnet chief executive Brendan Crabb (pictured) told the Today show that NSW was “in a steam train that is heading towards a cliff, not heading towards a station” and that cases would have to get back to “zero or close to zero” before restrictions could be lifted.
“The best outcome (for NSW) is lockdown until Christmas, keeping a lid on numbers like they are now,” he said. A spokesman for the organisation said that the institute “has always been a not-for-profit research organisation, which means we don’t make profits. Any surplus goes to helping improve the health of vulnerable people, not to shareholders”.

Victorian paramedics under ‘huge stress’ with highest number of triple-0 calls in years

Full text: One of the state’s top paramedics said ambulance and hospital services were the busiest they had ever been, urging people to call triple-zero only in an emergency.
Ambulance Victoria executive director of clinical operations Mick Stephenson said paramedics were taking about 150 Covid-positive patients to hospital each day, all of whom need to be screened, slowing down hospital admissions.
“It’s absolutely fundamental that only those who are seriously unwell go to hospital and all others receive care as they can in the community,” he told reporters on Wednesday.
“What we know at the moment is we’re getting a lot of calls from patients with Covid-19 who are anxious or are concerned about having Covid-19 and are calling an ambulance for those reasons, but not because they’re sick.”
Triple-0 operators have been inundated with calls, with an almost record-breaking 3250 ambulance requests made on Monday - levels not seen since the deadly 2016 thunderstorm asthma event.
A video posted to social media on Monday night showed long queues of ambulances ramping at Northern Hospital in Epping, which is the closest hospital to the epicentre of Melbourne’s outbreak.
Authorities have launched an investigation into the time spent on hold to triple-0 by the family of a three-year-old girl who died in Central Victoria during a cardiac arrest that same night.
Victoria’s triple-0 service, the Emergency Services Telecommunications Authority, said the call was answered within 1 minute and 41 seconds, outside ESTA’s target range, because of the almost unprecedented demand.
“ESTA sends our deepest condolences to the family involved. Our triple-zero operators care deeply about the service they provide and the community they serve,” a spokeswoman said.
“ESTA will continue to investigate the call.”
Ambulance Victoria said several emergency ambulances were dispatched “without delay” after they were called to the cardiac arrest at 6.29pm.
An advanced life support crew was the first to arrive at 6.43pm. They loaded the patient and were met by a specialist crew while en route.
“Sadly, despite the best efforts of our paramedics and those on the scene, the patient did not survive,” Acting Loddon Mallee regional director Trevor Weston said.
“We offer our sincerest condolences to the patient’s family at this difficult time.”
Victorian Health Minister Martin Foley said emergency departments, hospitals and paramedics were under “huge stress” with demand from both Covid-19 cases and other emergency presentations.
“The truth of the matter is we are facing unprecedented levels of demand and we need to continue to work hard to build a surge capacity,” he told reporters on Wednesday.
“It is why we are working through Ambulance Victoria to create a surge workforce capacity to meet the projected demand, as the Burnet (Institute) modelling makes clear is only going to increase in October.”
There are 371 Covid cases in Victorian hospitals, with 81 people in intensive care.

Vaccinating kids ‘would slash hospitalisations’

Author: Robinson, Natasha

Publication info: The Australian (Online) ; Canberra, A.C.T. [Canberra, A.C.T]. 28 Sep 2021.

Full text: That’s the assessment of epidemiologist Tony Blakely, who says vaccinating children would reduce the number of days that states would need to remain in lockdown to halt the spread of the virus.
Younger teenagers have been taking up vaccination at an astonishing rate, with 30.8 per cent now having received at least one dose since vaccines were first made available to the 12 to 15-year age group two weeks ago,
The take up of vaccination among 12 to 15 year olds in the past two weeks has been highest in NSW, where an impressive 44.46 per cent of this age group has had one dose. This is followed by the ACT with 41.76 per cent and Victoria with 37.08 per cent.
Almost 29 per cent of 12 to 15 year olds have had at least one dose in the Northern Territory while in Queensland it’s 19.45 per cent. The rates are lowest in South Australia at 12.91 per cent, Tasmania at 12 per cent, and WA at 10.76 per cent.
Professor Blakely said if Australia began to open up at 80 per cent of everyone aged over 16 vaccinated, hospitalisations from Covid-19 would be about 4000 a year. If 80 per cent of the population aged over five years were vaccinated, hospitalisations would reduce to 1000. With 80 per cent of those over 12 vaccinated, the number of hospitalisations might be about 3200. All of those models were predicated on density limits on hospitality venues and social distancing and mask wearing remaining in place.
Even though young teenagers are being vaccinated, Australia’s public reporting of its percentage of the population vaccinated is only for those aged over 16, in contrast to the way numbers are reported in many other countries.
“I think we should definitely be including 12 to 15 year olds in the reporting,” Professor Blakely said.
“Should we be changing the targets? I don’t think so. I think the targets at the moment work to ­incentivise the population to be vaccinated.
“For next year when we’re trying to reach that goal of living with the virus, yes, we should be including all five-plus year olds in our vaccination targets.”
Paediatric intensive care doctor Greg Kelly, a spokesman for the group OzSAGE, said he believed children should be included in vaccination targets.
“Should we include children in our percentages? I think the answer to that is we absolutely should, for a few reasons,” Dr Kelly said.
“One, it’s transparent and honest. The second reason is it makes international comparisons possible. Australians, because we are just a little bit behind in the time curve, have the advantage of being able to look overseas and say, well, we want to be more like Denmark or Singapore and less like the UK in terms of the spread of the virus.
“But if everyone’s measuring their percentages differently, it makes it really impossible to ­decide.”
Dr Kelly said it was a controversial area as to whether vaccinating young teenagers and children made a significant difference to the spread of the virus.
Doherty Institute modelling indicates it makes only a small amount of difference.
“What we now know, in contrast to earlier, is that children can definitely get Covid, they can definitely spread it to other kids and to their families and to teachers,” Dr Kelly said. “The question about how much they contribute to spread is an active one.”
University of Melbourne clinical epidemiologist Nancy Baxter said she agreed that children should be included in vaccination reporting and targets.
“I think we should be reporting a percentage of the whole population. That would be more in line with other countries,” she said.

Full text: This outcome was predicted in the Burnet Institute modelling and will continue until vaccinations reach a sufficient level to turn the growth rate down.
Having been optimistic nearly two months ago that Victoria had the right solution by locking down hard and fast, the government is now preparing for the health system to be slammed during October.
Lockdown 6.0 has not worked the way it might have.
There are worrying signs that the virus has leaked substantially again into regional Victoria and that the government still doesn’t know what effect home-based grand final celebrations might have on future numbers.
TAUS iframed Victorian Daily Cases
In some ways it’s an entirely academic debate because it will be vaccinations that fix this problem and not much else. Greater compliance to the health orders is not an option.
In early November, Victoria will be hoping to have 80 per cent of the community double vaccinated.
The more people who are double vaccinated, the greater the opportunity to bend the infection curve.
NSW is better placed on vaccination rates in part because of the extra supply sent its way as its wave spiked.
But Dan Andrews will still have to face political heat principally because he forced the state into another hard lockdown with the expectation that the lockdown would work.
We now know that fewer people than Andrews would like are actually listening to him.
This means that the Victorian Premier is losing some of his authority among a deeply fatigued audience.
The end result is that the health system is already facing significant pressure and somehow the Victorian government must find a way to alleviate it.
The Victorian daily caseload has more than doubled in a fortnight and it will be about the start of the second week in November before the 80 per cent double vaccination point is reached for those aged 16 and older.
NSW is poised to reach that vaccination point about the middle of next month, giving the state a significant head start in the current climate.
With Australia so close to meaningful vaccination levels, it seems a glib and pointless debate about who got where, first.
But it will be invaluable in the medium term to determine, preferably via a proper independent inquiry, what can be done better and why the various states performed the way they did.

Full text: Vaccination is working to reduce the number of people requiring hospitalisation and ICU treatment with Covid-19, and now the pressure on the hospital system looks set to be markedly less than predicted by government-commissioned modelling.
At current lockdown settings in NSW, government modelling predicted there would be 560 people suffering Covid-19 in intensive care units across the state by late October. However, the number of people in ICU has been decreasing over the past week.
There were 244 Covid-19 patients in ICU in NSW on September 21, and on Monday that figure had dropped to 214. There were 1286 people in ­hospital with Covid-19 in NSW a week ago, and that number now stands at 1155.
If the plateauing in hospital­isations continues or those in ­hospital continues to decrease, numbers will have peaked well below the predictions contained in modelling commissioned by the NSW government.
Victoria’s hospitalisation rates are also well below modelling estimates. On Monday, Victoria had 8538 active cases and 363 people in hospital with Covid-19, of whom 75 were in ICU, amounting to a 4.25 per cent hospitalisation rate. Accounting for a lag between diagnosis and hospitalisation and using the 5673 active cases seven days earlier, the hospitalisation rate is 6.4 per cent. That’s well below the 10.57 per cent hospitalisation rate seen during Melbourne’s second wave last year.
The differences between the two waves in Melbourne are even more stark when deaths are considered, with 25 deaths during Victoria’s current outbreak so far compared with 161 in the second wave to August 7, 2020.
However, Victorian Premier Daniel Andrews said he believed modelling predicting a 10 per cent hospitalisation rate was “holding up”.
The Andrews government’s road map for reopening, announced just over a week ago was based on Burnet Institute modelling which predicted daily case numbers – now at a seven-day average of 723 – would reach 1400 to -2900 between October 19 and 31, with 2202 deaths expected between July 1 and December 31.
Asked whether Victoria’s trajectory resembled that predicted by the modelling, Mr Andrews said: “I think it’s at the more positive end of the scale.” Australian National University microbiologist and physician Peter Collignon said he believed that modelling from the Burnet Institute – which has been a vocal proponent of “Covid zero” – was too pessimistic. “It does look like the case numbers and the hospitalisation numbers are quite different to the modelling,” he said.
“A lot of the modelling is very pessimistic. The people who are making the worst predictions are the ones that are pushing zero Covid the most.
“My view is we should be looking at real-world data, with vaccination rates in England being the best place to look, and just use that to predict what’s going to happen here in three or four months time rather than use models with lots of assumptions which have frequently been wrong.” The NSW government’s modelling released in early September predicted a peak of 3434 hospitalisations in late October. Further modelling undertaken by the Burnet Institute predicted peak hospital demand of between 2286 and 4016 cases across greater Sydney.
NSW Premier Gladys Berejiklian maintained that October would be the worst month for Sydney but highlighted the difference between hospitalisation numbers and government modelling.
“Pleasingly, the hospitalisation rate has not been as high as we had seen in the modelling and the ICU admissions have been a bit lower as well but it doesn’t mean we are out of the woods in terms of overwhelming our hospitals,” Ms Berejiklian said.
“Technically, we are still looking at our system being overwhelmed in October and I ask people to exercise caution.
“We know that once we start reopening at 70 per cent double dose, the case numbers will go through the roof but what will protect us is the fact that so many people have received at least the first dose of the vaccine and those people will have that extra layer of protection against ending up in hospital or worse.” Epidemiologists said the strong and rapid take-up of vaccination in NSW was likely to have kept the numbers of those being hospitalised at the low end of estimates. Almost 86 per cent of people in NSW have had at least one dose of a Covid-19 vaccine and 60.4 per cent are fully vaccinated. “It does look like hospitalisations are starting to plateau,” said Deakin University epidemiologist Catherine Bennett. “That’s what we expect to see with high levels of vaccination.”

Full text: The Herald Sun can reveal state and federal authorities are considering relaxing isolation requirements for those who are fully vaccinated, while aiming contact tracing resources at controlling outbreaks in high-risk areas.
The Doherty Institute, which is modelling the effect of new containment models, has backed the shift and told national cabinet to move away from the existing “zero tolerance” tracing approach.
Experts say this is crucial to avoid the chaos seen in Britain, where an estimated 1.7 million people – in a country of 67 million – were forced to isolate after they were caught at exposure sites when restrictions were eased.
Britain’s so-called “pingdemic”, fuelled by its Bluetooth tracing app, caused widespread workforce shortages before the government scrapped the isolation rule for those who were fully vaccinated and instead encouraged them to be tested.
Victorian authorities are already allowing fully vaccinated healthcare workers who are exposed to Covid-19 to return to work if they return a negative test after five days, with daily saliva tests and two more PCR tests also required.
Under existing rules, Victorians who visit Tier 1 exposure sites must isolate for 14 days, and are only released after two negative test results.
In its latest report to the national cabinet, the Doherty Institute said tracing and isolation measures would shift to target “transmission reduction, allowing a lesser focus on casual and place-based contact tracing outside high-risk settings”.
Institute epidemiology director Professor Jodie McVernon said once vaccination thresholds were met, it was time to scale back “low yield” tracing measures designed to find every last case, and instead implement “more efficient and sustainable processes”.
Deakin University epidemiology chair Professor Catherine Bennett said authorities “don’t have to find every case in the future” and should make tracing in high-risk settings the priority.
She said secondary contacts at exposure sites could be asked to have a test instead of isolating for 14 days.
A spokeswoman for federal Health Minister Greg Hunt said the national medical expert panel was examining revised leave requirements for health workers, while a state government spokesman said they would have “more to say soon” about revised rules.

Gold Coast Covid border reopening: Dramatic changes needed for tourism industry to survive

Full text: University of Queensland tourism expert Associate Professor Judith Mair anticipates industry, worth more than $6 billion pre-Covid, will continue to experience “pain points” in the short term as border closures and the risk of lockdowns remains “all too apparent”.
COURAN COVE: THE INSIDE STORY
$800M MEGA TOWERS TO REPLACE COAST SHOPPING CENTRE
Speaking at a tourism forum on the Gold Coast on Saturday, she said operators would need to adapt to changed circumstances.
“Flexibility with booking and cancellation policies, as well as refunds will be key to give consumers confidence to make bookings, but, once the interstate and international borders are open, I think the future for tourism on the Gold Coast is very positive,” she said.
“The Gold Coast has always been popular with Australians from the southern states, and I see no reason why these traditional visitors wouldn’t return.
INSIDE STORY OF ONCE-ELITE SUBURB’S DOWNFALL
SHOCK CLOSURE OF POPULAR GOLD COAST BUSINESS
“There will be ups and downs once people get the opportunity to travel overseas – a boost in demand for overseas travel for Australians is likely to lead to a small downturn in domestic travel in the short term, but this should be balanced by the gradual return of the international visitors.”
Assoc Prof Mair said innovation would be needed to give the city an edge going forward.
“There will be several areas where it will be important for the Gold Coast to take the initiative, first of which will be, a widely accepted Covid accreditation for the tourism, hospitality and events sectors which will be important to maintain consumer confidence relating to health and safety,” she said.
‘DISASTROUS’: WHAT WENT WRONG IN EXCLUSIVE COAST SUBURB
“Secondly, it will be important to innovate to keep up to date with market trends.
“This might mean changes to the way a tourism product (like a hotel or a visitor attraction) is marketed by recognising new market segments and promotional opportunities using social media.
It comes as Gold Coast tourism leaders welcomed a $70 million boost from the federal government’s previously announced $600 million rescue package.
It includes:
* Grants of up to $4 million for major tourism businesses including theme parks t o remain viable
* Grants of between $15,000 and $50,000 for small, medium and large businesses across the state which have experienced a reduction in turnover of at least 70 per cent between July 1 and September 30.
Destination Gold Coast welcomed the funding boost which McPherson Karen Andrews said was designed to keep doors of struggling businesses open.
“It has been devastating to see our hotels, attractions, restaurants and shops suffer through another school holiday period,” she said.
“We know visitors – from Sydney, Melbourne and beyond – will head straight for the Gold Coast when borders re-open.”
GC ‘ABYSS’ IF BORDERS DON’T REOPEN AT 80 PER CENT VACCINATED A GOLD Coast tourism boss is urging the Queensland Government to stick to a National Cabinet deal to reopen borders once 80 per cent of people are vaccinated for Covid.
Destination Gold Coast chairman Paul Donovan’s plea comes as it emerged on Monday Queensland may not reopen to Australia until it hits a 90 per cent vaccination rate.
It’s understood the Queensland Government Cabinet has endorsed the 90 per cent threshold, after Premier Annastacia Palaszczuk and WA refused to sign up to national cabinet’s 80 per cent. Labor insiders are claiming that a 90 per cent threshold is being weighed up.
Despite NSW and Victoria outlining a road map to opening up, based on an 80 per cent double vaccination rate, Queensland is yet to commit to any blueprint going forward, even with the population likely to hit 80 per cent double jabs by December 5.
Mr Donovan said sticking to the National Cabinet’s 80 per cent and a roadmap were needed: “I appreciate the Premier’s position by trying to make sure we are safe but critically we really need a roadmap out and the 80 per cent level is key.
“I urge all Gold Coasters to get the jab because it’s the only way out of this economic abyss.”
Chief health officer Dr Jeannette Young and Ms Palaszczuk have shifted in the past week to the 90 per cent figure as their preferred threshold to opening up. This is despite Queensland having the worst vaccination rates in the country.
Quizzed about the 90 per cent, Ms Palaszczuk said she would rely on the Doherty Institute modelling to determine when borders would reopen – and it was too early to speculate on vaccination threshold rates to determine border reopening.
But she expected to have that Doherty modelling within two weeks to guide a decision.
“We are waiting on updates – Doherty institute modelling – in two weeks before we can make those decisions,” she said.
The decision on 90 per cent vaccination rates is being driven by Labor polling which shows Queenslanders don’t want to be opened up if it means a mass Delta variant outbreak, like NSW and Victoria.

The polling makes two key findings. The first is that Queenslanders are angry at the so-called exemptions unit, which is regarded as “heartless’’, for refusing to allow Queenslanders back into the Sunshine State, but it gives special treatment to the wives and girlfriends of footballers.
The key finding, however, is that Queenslanders love their liberty and freedoms, and the fact that coronavirus is under control and that is a key driver in the Palaszczuk Government’s thinking.
Tourism industry leaders are incensed at the prospect of Queensland being closed for the Christmas-New Year holidays.

Full text: The Burnet Institute modelling underpinning Victoria's roadmap out of lockdown only looks at metropolitan Melbourne, casting doubt on the scientific basis of the government's regional roadmap.
When he announced the roadmap last Sunday, Premier Daniel Andrews said it was "developed based on expert modelling from the Burnet Institute", but the researcher who led the modelling has told The Standard regional Victoria wasn't included in the analysis.
"The regional roadmap plan was developed independently to us," the Burnet Institute's Dr Nick Scott said.
"We provided modelling for the metropolitan one and the reason our focus was on the metropolitan one was that was where the cases were to model."
It raises questions about how the government decided on Victoria's regional roadmap and current restrictions, particularly in light of the negligible changes flagged for country areas before the end of October.

The Department of Health confirmed the Burnet Institute modelling did not consider regional Victoria.
The department said it was necessary to keep regional areas tightly restricted, arguing there was a high risk of super spreader events until 80 per cent of Victorians over 16 were fully vaccinated, but didn't provide specific data.
"A large amount of information was used by the Department of Health when developing the roadmap including how to safeguard the statewide health system and protecting against the increased possibility of seeding cases in regional areas," a spokesperson said.
Chair of epidemiology at Deakin University Professor Catherine Bennett said it was "very weird" the Department of Health hadn't asked for modelling of regional areas.
"I would've thought you would factor that in because you might open up certain areas earlier," she said. She also said there was a risk of underestimating the second peak in cases in December if regional areas weren't modelled.
The Burnet Institute modelling provides a wealth of data to back up specific restrictions in the metropolitan roadmap. Dr Scott explained small changes such as allowing five more people inside hospitality venues made a big difference to potential outbreaks in the model.
The scientific basis for equally specific restrictions in the regional roadmap is less clear. Opposition Health spokeswoman Georgie Crozier said the government needed to justify the ongoing regional restrictions.
"Regional Victorians deserve to understand what modelling and advice the Andrews Labor government is basing their decisions on. If no modelling has been done then they also deserve to understand why not?"
Professor Bennett said the government was taking an extremely cautious approach to regional areas, even though the ability to contain outbreaks in regional areas was much better than in a big city. She pointed out last year regional Victoria was allowed to exit lockdown more easily than Melbourne, whereas this time the reverse was true.
"They actually don't know how to handle Melbourne and the regions in a way that makes sense," she said. "We just need to hope we get through this next phase quickly. Slow means the damage is bigger."
On Friday Health Minister Martin Foley announced Victoria would miss its first target date under the roadmap. The state was forecast to hit 80 per cent first doses this Sunday, but is now expected to hit the milestone later next week.

Coronavirus: Premier Annastacia Palaszczuk casts doubt on opening Queensland borders

Full text: Ms Palaszczuk did not say what level of Covid-19 vaccination would be needed to safely reopen to NSW and Victoria, adding a national reopening plan had “not been finalised”.
“If you look at the national plan, the 80 per cent actually takes you backwards and I do not want that for Queensland, so we’re probably going to see a difference for Western Australia and Queensland because at the moment we have freedoms,” she said on Thursday.
Her comments came as NSW recorded 1063 new infections – and six deaths – while Victoria had 766 cases. There are fears that the virus could spread more widely in Melbourne after a man who attended a protest at the Shrine of Remembrance on Wednesday tested positive and was taken to hospital.
Queensland Premier Annastacia Palaszczuk has dashed hopes of interstate family reunions even if vaccine targets are met. She was tight-lipped on whether the border to New South Wales and Victoria would reopen and has refused to outline what freedoms would be available at 80 per cent vaccination. She also dismissed talk of when international travel might resume despite the federal government assuring Australians they may be able to go abroad by Christmas. Ms Palaszczuk said the reopening plan for the state would not be finalised until further discussions at National Cabinet.
The Victorian government began easing restrictions on vaccinated residents stuck in Canberra and NSW, and will allow them to return home provided they have tested negative.
Queensland industry groups and tourism operators reliant on interstate travel criticised Ms Palaszczuk’s comments, and said they needed clarity to prepare for the coming summer holiday season. Ms Palaszczuk, asked about lifting health restrictions, said she would need to see additional health modelling.
“At the moment, Queenslanders have more freedoms now than Victorians will when they reach 80 per cent vaccinated,” she said. “In NSW, you have a massive Delta outbreak, so you have to go and ask the NSW government what is their plan for Christmas?”
State and territory leaders in July agreed to a pathway to freedom based on vaccination rate thresholds recommended by the Doherty Institute. Under the plan, fully vaccinated Australians would be exempt from “all domestic restrictions” once 80 per cent of the population older than 16 was vaccinated.

But on Thursday, Ms Palaszczuk said Queenslanders would enjoy more freedoms at home than “if they hopped on a plane and went to Tokyo”.
“Where are you going to go? Are you going to go to India? In Tokyo, you have to sit in perspex screens with masks on and if you remove your mask you can’t talk while you’re eating,” she said.
Queensland Tourism Industry Council chief executive Daniel Gschwind said the state needed “a path to re-engage with the rest of Australia and the rest of the world”. “We know Queenslanders are very protective of the excellent health situation here and nobody wants to put that at risk,” he said.
“But at some point we have to make a leap of faith and trust in the vaccine protecting us alongside other health measures – tracing, testing social distancing.”
Cairns Adventure Group owner Roderic Rees said 90 per cent of his customers were locked out of the state. “We had 75 on the payroll in June and last week we paid 23 people,” he said.
Mr Rees supported limiting freedoms for unvaccinated people if it meant borders could reopen to those who had been fully vaccinated against Covid-19.
“National cabinet has set that 80 per cent vaccination target and Queensland should stick to their guns on that and let people know what is going to change when we get there,” he said. “We need to have the borders open and people travelling before Christmas – that needs to happen.”
Premier Annastacia Palaszczuk says she "doesn't understand" the constant criticism "of Queensland doing well".
The latest vaccination figures show 74.1 per cent of adults have had at least one dose, while 49.3 per cent are fully vaccinated.
NSW will reach 80 per cent coverage for adults in mid-October, with Victoria following in November. Queensland is expected to reach that vaccine coverage level in December.
When asked whether she could give regional businesses more clarity after national cabinet meets next week, Ms Palaszczuk said: “If we get a Delta outbreak here, we’ll be in lockdown and all businesses will be closed. Do you want that?
“I don’t understand this constant criticism of Queensland doing well.”
LNP MP Amanda Camm, whose northern Queensland electorate covers the Whitsunday Islands popular with tourists, said operators feared the state would remain closed while international travel restarted for other states.
“The goalposts keep moving,” she said. “People want to see their family on the other side of the country at Christmas. We need a clear plan with clear targets so people are incentivised to go out and get vaccinated.”
In a push to increase the state’s lagging vaccination rollout, the state government teamed up with the NRL to offer free tickets to people receiving vaccinations.
It was scrapped hours after its launch when the Therapeutic Goods Administration deemed it non-compliant with its rules.
Health Minister Yvette D’Ath said the decision was “bureaucracy gone mad”, although she admitted to not having read the rules on offering incentives.
“Are we supposed to be vaccinating people against Covid in this country or not,” she said.
Queensland Premier Annastacia Palaszczuk says 13,899 COVID-19 tests have been conducted in the state in the past 24 hours. "So once again, thank you Queensland for coming out and getting tested," Ms Palaszczuk said during a media conference on Thursday.

Full text: The research team whose work underpins Australia's pandemic exit strategy believes the Delta strain of the virus is significantly more deadly than they assumed when the national plan was adopted.
While the science has been settled for a while about Delta being more infectious than previous variants of concern, at the time a Doherty Institute-led team was commissioned to provide COVID-19 modelling for national cabinet it was less clear whether it was also likely to cause more severe illness.
That debate appears at an end, with both the Doherty and the Burnet institutes adopting the findings of a Canadian study showing unvaccinated people infected with Delta are nearly twice as likely to end up in intensive care and one-and-a-half times more likely to die as people who caught the Alpha variant.
The Doherty modelling, prepared in July and updated last month, assumed Delta was no more virulent than Alpha.
University of Melbourne professor James McCaw, a member of the Doherty team, confirmed that assumption would be ditched.
"At the time the Doherty work was done it was very clear that Delta spread more quickly and that is incorporated in the work, but the evidence that Delta was more severe in terms of clinical outcomes was either scant or certainly, unsettled in the international community," he said. "As scientists we update our understanding based on available evidence. It is now far more clear that Delta is more severe and so work and forecasts of potential hospitalisations, when we get to that stage, would account for the increased severity of Delta."
Implications of this for the national plan, which advocates staged lifting of lockdown restrictions once 70 per cent and 80 per cent of the population are fully vaccinated, are yet to be worked through.
The changed assumption about Delta, the COVID-19 strain driving current outbreaks in NSW and Victoria, is already reflected in Burnet Institute modelling released on Sunday by the Andrews government showing that, even with a cautious easing of lockdown, demand on hospital and intensive-care beds could outstrip supply and up to 3000 people may die from the virus.
Burnet Institute deputy director Margaret Hellard said she felt "comfortable" referencing the Canadian research, which was consistent with evidence emerging on the ground in Sydney and Melbourne hospitals.
"I am not saying we are absolutely right or absolutely wrong," Professor Hellard said. "We have used the most reasonable information available to us."
Although the overall death rate from COVID-19 in Australia is lower this year than last year, that is due to the high levels of vaccination.
The Canadian study by University of Toronto epidemiologists David Fisman and Ashleigh Tuite looked at the outcomes of more than 200,000 people in Ontario infected with COVID-19 in the first half of this year. At the time, Delta was not yet the dominant strain of the North American epidemic.
The study found that people infected with Delta were twice as likely to end up in hospital, three times as likely to require intensive care and 2.32 times more likely to die from COVID-19 than people infected with the original strain of the virus.
The study also compared the health outcomes of people with Delta to those infected with other variants of concern, such as the Alpha strain. The results showed people with Delta were 1.49 times more likely to be admitted to hospital, 1.86 times more likely to end up in ICU and 1.51 times more likely to die.
The Doherty team considered the newly published Canadian research when it was preparing its modelling for national cabinet but at the time, chose not to adopt its assumptions.
"Given recent emergence of Delta variants, there is presently very limited evidence of their severity relevant to antecedent strains," the Doherty report noted.
"While early reports from Scotland and Canada suggest clinical outcomes might be worse than for Alpha variants, it is important to note that infections in these settings are skewed towards unvaccinated population groups in which other risk determinants may also differ, potentially confounding and inflating early estimates of severity."
Dr Freya Shearer, a member of the Doherty research team, confirmed Canadian assumptions about the virulence of the Delta strain would be built into future modelling.
"That specific paper is part of an evidence review we have done in the last month that we would be incorporating into our analyses going forward," she said.

Full text: Updated modelling for transitioning out of COVID-19 restrictions recommends that jurisdictions with thousands of infections keep medium level preventative measures in place until an 80 per cent vaccination threshold is met.
This means states like NSW and Victoria are recommended to maintain medium public health and social measures to minimise the likelihood of a rapid spread of the disease.
Director of epidemiology at the Doherty Institute Professor Jodie McVernon said medium level preventative measures included staying home except for work, study and essential purposes, retail and hospitality open with density restrictions, indoor recreational venues closed, small numbers of household visitors allowed and a closed or graduated return to schools.
"Those that are coming into the 70 per cent mark with thousands of infections should aim to keep case numbers as low as possible by continuing to suppress epidemic growth," she said.
"Medium restrictions would continue to do that until they got to at least the 80 per cent threshold.
"So the obvious conclusion that mapped back to our original recommendations is that jurisdictions should look at the situation they're in, they should look at how their infections are being controlled with the measures they've got in place."

COVID case under investigation in Moira Shire NSW records more than 900 cases, four deaths ACT records seven new COVID-19 cases as Barr warns of 'extreme pressure' to come The new modelling showed likely outcomes if there were hundreds and thousands of cases already in the community, whereas the original modelling was based on what would happen if there was only 30 cases of community transmission.
Professor McVernon said the original modelling was "robust", but since then the situation had changed in NSW and Victoria.
"At the 70 per cent threshold, starting off with thousands of cases, meant that in this window ... between 70 and 80 per cent ... there was the opportunity for cases to grow more rapidly," she said.
"The ultimate size of the epidemic was bigger in that situation."

Full text: Among state leaders, Victorian Premier Daniel Andrews’ rating for handling the pandemic well has dropped from 85 per cent to 63 per cent. NSW Premier Gladys Berejiklian’s rating for handling the pandemic has fallen from 77 per cent to 56 per cent. Queensland Premier Annastacia Palaszczuk’s rating has fallen from 72 per cent to 67 per cent.
Mr Andrews and Ms Berejiklian have warned in recent days that residents of the two most populous states must expect a rise in Covid-19 cases and possible fatalities when restrictions are eased. Mr Andrews said Victoria’s health system would face intense pressure but he insisted the state would be able to pass through the reopening spike to a position where it could live with the virus. “We cannot perennially or permanently suppress this virus,” he said.
Ms Berejiklian cited the Doherty Institute modelling underpinning national cabinet’s plan for reopening when she said Australia needed to prepare to see high case numbers when her state reopened after reaching 80 per cent. “I say to all my colleagues that even when you get 80 per cent double dose and start opening up, you will get Covid-19 in your community. So please accept that and get ready for that,” she said on Sunday. “Numbers might be higher than we have ever seen. In fact, the Doherty report predicts that the case numbers that we will see are likely to be the highest cases we have seen in Australia.”
The Doherty Institute on Monday detailed the results of revised modelling that showed if restrictions were eased at 70 per cent vaccination with thousands of cases in the community, there would be a spike in infections to tens of thousands of people. As coverage increased beyond 80 per cent for double-vaccinated people, the epidemic came under control. As a result, Doherty recommended that case numbers continued to be strongly suppressed until 80 per cent coverage was reached.
There is a lot riding politically on what happens to case numbers and health outcomes when restrictions are eased, and greater domestic and international travel is resumed. If things go badly, leaders will be punished for acting too quickly and putting voters in danger. If things go well, the pandemic will recede quickly as an issue for leaders who have been brave enough to face it. State leaders outside NSW and Victoria also will have a lot riding on how things go. Whatever the outcome, however, the best strategy for all leaders remains to get as many of their citizens fully vaccinated as quickly as possible.

Full text: Residents of the City of Greater Geelong, the Surf Coast and Mitchell Shire entered a seven day lockdown from midnight on Sunday because of rising Covid-19 case numbers in their areas.
Among them is Kilmore retailer Raylene Murphy, who has had to close the doors to her shop Booteek Shoes for what she hopes is the final time.
“It was probably inevitable it was going to happen … I think a lot of the locals were expecting it,” she told NCA NewsWire.
“But even though you're expecting it, it still doesn’t make it any easier.”
Twenty-three active cases have now been identified in Mitchell Shire, which borders Melbourne’s northern fringe, including one new infection recorded on Monday.
Geelong is home to 21 active cases and there are two active cases in the Surf Coast Shire, according to data from the Victorian government.
Mrs Murphy said even retailers who could access government financial support were struggling with the rolling lockdowns.
“I did get some subsidy - that has been fantastic, I think. As I’m a sole trader it is a little bit more difficult sometimes,” she said.
“Once the doors are closed there isn’t any stock moving. It’s made it very hard in my sort of industry.
“I’m looking at next winter’s ranges and I’ve still got this winter’s because of the lockdowns.”
Victorian authorities announced the new lockdowns on Sunday as they unveiled their highly anticipated plan to begin easing Covid-19 restrictions when the state has fully vaccinated 70 per cent of the eligible population.
Retail in regional Victoria will be allowed to reopen at the 70 per cent double dose threshold, with density limits in place.
But most retailers in metropolitan Melbourne will have to stay closed until Victoria hits 80 per cent of people aged 16 and older fully vaccinated, which is expected in early November.
The Victorian government’s plan has attracted criticism from business lobby groups, who have questioned why indoor retail will not be allowed to reopen at a 70 per cent double dose target as it will in NSW.
The governments of both states have based their road maps on modelling by the independent Burnet Institute.
The Australian Retailers Association said the likely seven week wait until non-essential stores could reopen in Melbourne would deliver at least another $6bn blow to the industry.
Mrs Murphy hopes Mitchell Shire’s lockdown will only last the week and says she doesn’t know how other retailers will survive until November.
“November does seem a long time away,” she said.
“I don’t know how those other businesses will cope with that. Even though the government is doing what it can to financially support some, it’s not the same.”
Earlier this week, Ballarat entered a lockdown expected to last until 11.59pm on Wednesday.
Victoria on Monday recorded 567 new Covid-19 cases and one death.

Gold Coast Covid border reopening: Anna Palaszczuk dithers

Full text: Destination Gold Coast chairman Paul Donovan’s plea comes as it emerged on Monday Queensland may not reopen to Australia until it hits a 90 per cent vaccination rate.
It’s understood the Queensland Government Cabinet has endorsed the 90 per cent threshold, after Premier Annastacia Palaszczuk and WA refused to sign up to national cabinet’s 80 per cent. Labor insiders are claiming that a 90 per cent threshold is being weighed up.
Despite NSW and Victoria outlining a road map to opening up, based on an 80 per cent double vaccination rate, Queensland is yet to commit to any blueprint going forward, even with the population likely to hit 80 per cent double jabs by December 5.
Mr Donovan said sticking to the National Cabinet’s 80 per cent and a roadmap were needed: “I appreciate the Premier’s position by trying to make sure we are safe but critically we really need a roadmap out and the 80 per cent level is key.
“I urge all Gold Coasters to get the jab because it’s the only way out of this economic abyss.”
Chief health officer Dr Jeannette Young and Ms Palaszczuk have shifted in the past week to the 90 per cent figure as their preferred threshold to opening up. This is despite Queensland having the worst vaccination rates in the country.
Quizzed about the 90 per cent, Ms Palaszczuk said she would rely on the Doherty Institute modelling to determine when borders would reopen – and it was too early to speculate on vaccination threshold rates to determine border reopening.
But she expected to have that Doherty modelling within two weeks to guide a decision.
“We are waiting on updates – Doherty institute modelling – in two weeks before we can make those decisions,” she said.
The decision on 90 per cent vaccination rates is being driven by Labor polling which shows Queenslanders don’t want to be opened up if it means a mass Delta variant outbreak, like NSW and Victoria.

The polling makes two key findings. The first is that Queenslanders are angry at the so-called exemptions unit, which is regarded as “heartless’’, for refusing to allow Queenslanders back into the Sunshine State, but it gives special treatment to the wives and girlfriends of footballers.
The key finding, however, is that Queenslanders love their liberty and freedoms, and the fact that coronavirus is under control and that is a key driver in the Palaszczuk Government’s thinking.
Tourism industry leaders are incensed at the prospect of Queensland being closed for the Christmas-New Year holidays.

Full text: Extreme positions on COVID-19 are still being staked out in the medical establishment, academia and parts of the media, writes Michael Koziol.
A week after Victorian Premier Daniel Andrews gave up on "zero COVID" and said vaccination would be the way to end lockdowns in his state, the head of the Victorian branch of the Australian Medical Association, Roderick McRae, made the case to lock down certain areas even harder.
He argued all essential services, including supermarkets, should be closed for seven days (except for medical). People would get a couple of days' warning to stock their shelves and prepare. "This would not be a typical lockdown, it would be a freeze to minimise movement and reduce transmission," McRae said. "What we have done so far is not working."
The idea gained little traction. But it shows the extreme positions on COVID still being staked out in the medical establishment, the academy and parts of the media - even as governments and the public recast the virus from something we must keep out to a feature of life we can live with.
While the prospect of eliminating COVID-19 lost much of its appeal and relevance with the arrival of the Delta variant and the advent of highly effective vaccines, as a concept and principle it is still very much alive under new guises and slogans.
Last week News Corp newspapers published commentary by respiratory health researcher Dr Igor Gonda advocating pre-planned "regular nationwide lockdowns" for two weeks every two months to help curtail cases.
On social media, commentators still advocate elimination and rail against what they portray as a government-led attempt to inflict COVID on the community. University of NSW adjunct professor Bill Bowtell regularly claims to his 35,000 Twitter followers that the NSW government deliberately let the Delta variant circulate in order to emulate Britain (despite the NSW government putting Sydney in lockdown for 12 weeks and counting).
The AMA has campaigned for tougher and faster lockdowns in response to outbreaks, and it is concerned about the NSW plan to start reopening when 70 per cent of the adult population is fully vaccinated - a few weeks away - despite a high caseload.
In Victoria, McRae says restrictions should not be eased until two weeks after 80 per cent of the 12+ population is double jabbed. Only then should we "see where the wind is blowing", he says.
The AMA's federal council has taken a slightly different approach. Its latest communique, published today, broadly backs the Doherty Institute's modelling for opening when 70 and 80 per cent of the 16+ population is fully vaccinated. But it says the plan must be approached with caution - that a high caseload, as in Sydney, should mean easing restrictions at a slower pace to ensure hospitals and contact tracers can keep up.
AMA president Omar Khorshid pitches the communique as a "middle ground" approach between strong views. One side is "pushing too hard" to open up now, he says, while on the other side there are "Chicken Littles" who want to wait until the country reaches extreme levels of vaccination.
"What we're saying is if you do the right things, if you follow the Doherty report properly and not just pick the bits you like, there is a path out of this," Khorshid says. "If we follow the science, there is a safe way forward."
The latest cautionary voice to enter the debate is OzSAGE, which formed in August to proffer "well researched and robustly debated independent expert advice" among what it recognises as a sea of competing views about managing the next phase of the pandemic.
The group has significant academic and clinical heft. Its 11-person executive includes University of Melbourne professor Nancy Baxter, Burnet Institute deputy director Professor Margaret Hellard, UNSW economics professor Richard Holden, field epidemiologist Kamalini Lokuge and University of Sydney public health professor and deputy vice-chancellor Lisa Jackson Pulver.
Another executive member, Professor Lidia Morawska of Queensland's University of Technology, was last week named among Time magazine's 100 most influential people of 2021 for her work "recognising the importance of aerosol transmission [of COVID] and marshalling the data that would convince the World Health Organisation and other authoritative bodies to do the same".
Other big names have also signed up as OzSAGE members, including ANU vice-chancellor Brian Schmidt, Burnet Institute chief executive Brendan Crabb, epidemiologist Tony Blakely, Medical Journal of Australia editor-in-chief Nick Talley, former MP Kerryn Phelps and dozens more.
Among the group's seven principles is that Australia should "aspire to elimination" of COVID, as with measles, where occasional incursions are contained without significant community spread. It says this can be achieved through booster jabs and other health measures, while continuing our normal lives.
One of the group's core arguments is that vaccination is not enough to curb the Delta variant. It wants other provisions in place: improved ventilation in public spaces, especially classrooms, enhanced contact tracing and prolonged, widespread use of masks. It calls this suite "vaccines-plus".
One of OzSAGE's executive members, Melbourne doctor Benjamin Veness, says the group is not against reopening but wants a plan that does not lead to the health system being overwhelmed. "We'd really like to avoid that boom and bust cycle of lockdowns and instead have a path to reopening that's sustainable from the outset," he says.
That concern is not without foundation. OzSAGE members have spent the past week pointing to the rising number of cases in Canada's Alberta province, where 71.5 per cent of the population over 12 is fully vaccinated. Premier Jason Kenney declared a public health emergency on Wednesday, warning the province could run out of ICU beds and staff. He also reimposed restrictions including vaccine passports and a work-from-home order. (There were 896 people in hospital in Alberta on Friday, and 222 in ICU, from a population of 4.4 million. Paediatrician Greg Kelly, another member of the OzSAGE executive, tweeted in all-caps that the province was "Collapsing before our eyes".)
OzSAGE urges Australia to model its plans more closely on Singapore, where 90 per cent of over 12s are now vaccinated. Even that country is grappling with a rising number of cases, although the proportion of people becoming seriously ill is low due to the highly effective vaccines.
Amid this, NSW has announced one of the world's most cautious reopening plans. Only those who are fully vaccinated will be able to visit venues and events, and home gatherings will initially be limited to five vaccinated people. Schools will return under a staggered start; masks, QR code check-ins and contact tracing will remain.
OzSAGE has been quick to warn the NSW and national plans to open up when 70 and 80 per cent of the 16+ population is fully vaccinated are too fast and too risky, but it has been less willing to offer a different number.
While nobody disputes the aim of vaccinating as many people as possible, as long as the country's two biggest cities are in long, harsh and unsustainable lockdowns, the key question is when and how to make them end.
"Ending these kinds of lockdowns will take vaccination plus other measures, especially improved ventilation," Veness says. "I think the answer is you can't just sit there and say 'X, Y and Z are definitely going to happen'. You have to treat it a little bit like a dance; you relax a bit and see what happens."
OzSAGE has quickly attracted critics. Daily Telegraph political editor James Morrow branded it "the umbrella group for the COVID alarmist wing of the country's scientific community", overly cautious and puritanical about crushing the virus.
Former deputy chief medical officer Nick Coatsworth said the group was on the extreme end of the risk spectrum. "I think there is a genuine concern among OzSAGE that the morbidity and mortality of COVID-19 is not over," he said. "They are genuinely worried about the potential for further waves in the Australian community. However, the position of their academics on risk has consistently overplayed the consequences of COVID spread, underplayed the negative effects of COVID restrictions, and frankly their thinking belongs in 2020."
Veness says OzSAGE has shared its advice with governments but is yet to brief any leaders. The group, based on Britain's Independent SAGE, has courted some mainstream media coverage, generating 23 mentions in print and online so far this month, according to media monitor Streem.
Many of its members are prominent COVID commentators; Streem found Blakely, Baxter and Crabb have each been mentioned more than 200 times this year in major print and online titles (this doesn't include radio and TV).
UNSW epidemiologist Mary-Louise McLaws, who had 740 mentions and is well known for her cautious approach to COVID, declined an offer to join OzSAGE. "I think it's a great initiative but I just don't have the time," she says.
McLaws shares many of the group's concerns about hospital capacity, vaccine coverage and quarantine facilities but places more emphasis on the need for Australia to embrace rapid antigen testing as a tool to help reopen quickly and safely. And while she thinks Australia should aim for 95 per cent vaccination, she says it's not possible to keep society locked down until then.
"You do need to get people out of lockdown," McLaws says. "Even from my perspective of where I was - I was fully supportive of the government's elimination [strategy] - but this is Delta now, and we've got rapid antigen testing and we've got good masks."
McLaws is also wary of the barrage of modelling from various groups - the Doherty Institute, Burnet Institute, Grattan Institute and OzSAGE among them - that is being used to justify positions or prognostications. She says modelling is most useful when several models are compared and interpreted by an outbreak manager who understands the "granular context". "Models should not be used to dictate how we deal with the pandemic steps," she says. "They help to catastrophise and work out what happens if we don't do certain things ... how many beds do we need, how many staff do we need, how many deaths will we have if we do nothing."
Schmidt, the ANU vice-chancellor, said his involvement with OzSAGE was motivated by a desire to better connect leaders with a range of COVID-19 experts and quality research. He said there was a lack of transparency in the evidence underpinning government decisions. "My involvement in OzSAGE is not exclusive, nor is it an endorsement of any of the work produced by the group unless I explicitly endorse it."

Full text: Top-ranking detectives have been forced into isolation over a COVID-19 cluster linked to police headquarters.
Several members based at Melbourne West police station on Spencer St tested positive to coronavirus on Friday.
One of the infected members visited a coffee shop located inside the Victoria Police Centre.
The coffee shop has been deemed a tier 1 site, forcing a significant number of police off the beat and into 14 days isolation.
The Victoria Police Centre is home to the force’s most elite police members, including the homicide squad, missing person squad and armed crime squad.
In a second blow to the force, Coffee Rush, located next to police headquarters, has also been deemed a tier 1 site.
“Given the close proximity of the Victoria Police Centre to the site all staff have been notified and anyone who attended the location on 15, 16 or 17 September will get tested immediately and quarantine for 14 days in line with public health advice,” a Victoria Police spokeswoman said.
“For operational reasons we will not be providing numbers on how many employees are on unplanned leave, including those currently in quarantine either as a precautionary measure or if anyone was to test positive to coronavirus.
“The community can be assured that service delivery to the public will remain unaffected during this time.”
The force is already stretched thin with hundreds of police redeployed to various coronavirus operations, including hotel quarantine and enforcement of lockdown restrictions.
It comes as upmarket food retailer Boccaccio Cellars in Balwyn North told customers it is a Tier 1 exposure site.
The news signals the spread of the virus to the eastern suburbs, which have recently been relatively covid-free since an outbreak at Trinity Grammar some months ago.
The family-owned IGA supermarket has announced a delivery driver who has since tested positive visited the store last Tuesday and Thursday and had close contact with a staff member on Friday who has also now tested positive.
Anyone who visted the store on Tuesday, September 14 between 1pm and 1.30pm, Thursday, September 16 between 12pm and 12.3pm or Friday, September 17 between 7am and 4pm should get tested and isolate for 14 days.
An instagram message from the store reads: “DHHS will contact you via text message if you were in store and what to do. We closing now for a deep clean and reopen tomorrow as per usual. All staff that have been contact with the positive case will be isolating for two weeks. Once we have any further updates, we will let our customers know. Thank you for all the support during this time.”

‘NO ISSUE’ WITH PFIZER SUPPLY Australia will receive more mRNA vaccine doses in October than September, with Health Minister Greg Hunt maintaining there is no issue with the nation’s Pfizer supplies.
Speaking after Victorian Premier Daniel Andrews raised concerns about next month’s Pfizer deliveries, Mr Hunt said an issue was discussed at last Friday’s national cabinet meeting about one shipment due in October.
“We’ve been able to resolve that over the weekend,” Mr Hunt said.
About 10 million doses of Pfizer and Moderna will be available in September, with more than 11 million due to arrive in October.
Mr Hunt said every state would receive their promised allocation, and that all contracted deliveries were expected in full.
It comes after Premier Daniel Andrews flagged a potential looming shortfall of Pfizer jabs.
Mr Andrews encouraged people to avoid the possible shortage by coming forward for whatever vaccines were available.
“On Friday, at the national cabinet, it was indicated that there is a problem ... I don’t know how big the problem is, but there is an issue with Pfizer vaccine supply in October,” he said.
“That is not the federal government’s fault, I’m not blaming anyone, I’m just making a point.”
The Premier urged people not to wait for their vaccines of choice.
“As I’ve said so many times, don’t wait for something that has not arrived yet. Please don’t wait and defer for something that may not happen,” Mr Andrews said.
“There may be an international global supply chain problem, there could be all sorts of variables.
“AstraZeneca is available now. AstraZeneca is safe for the vast majority of people who will go through that process and the Moderna vaccine is available from later this week also and there is a lot of it.”
A spokesman for Operation Covid Shield said October deliveries were currently being finalised with Pfizer.
“(We) will be releasing an updated Allocations Horizons once October deliveries are confirmed,” he said.
Meanwhile, Victorians will still be living under tough restrictions even after 80 per cent of the state is fully vaccinated.
The state’s plan has been dubbed a “roadmap of roadblocks”, with Melbourne’s lockdown to continue for another five weeks, until at least October 26.
It comes as 567 new Covid cases were announced on Monday, along with one death.
There are 5675 active cases in the state and nearly 40,000 vaccines were administered on Sunday.
At present, 72 per cent of eligible Victorians have received a Covid vaccine, with 43.9 per cent fully vaccinated.
Premier Daniel Andrews said 85 per cent of Monday’s cases were aged under 50.
The single death recorded is a woman in her 70s from Moreland.
There are 209 in hospital, with 59 in intensive care and 40 people on a ventilator.
A total 86 per cent of those in hospital are not vaccinated. Only three are fully vaccinated.
There are now 50 cases linked to the Fitzroy Community School, with day 13 testing for many to be done on Wednesday.

LA TROBE UNI TO MAKE JABS MANDATORY One of Victoria’s biggest universities will make vaccinations mandatory for all on-campus visitors as part of a two-stage plan to reopen.
La Trobe University is giving eligible staff and students until early December to get vaccinated or risk being banned from campus.
Stage one of the plan will see the university continue to support and encourage staff and students to get vaccinated until the end of November.
Staff will be offered leave to get the jab while a vaccination hub is scheduled to open at the university’s Bundoora campus, in partnership with Austin Health.
The university is exploring similar on-campus vaccination hubs for their regional locations, which include Shepparton, Mildura and Albury-Wodonga.
Stage two of the vaccination plan will commence in early December and will require anyone attending campus, including staff, students, contractors and visitors, to be fully vaccinated.
Head of La Trobe Public Health Department associate professor Melissa Graham said vaccination is the “most important thing” staff and students can do to protect themselves and the community.
“Our university’s two-stage plan is consistent with public health principles and will help keep us all safe when we return to campus,” Ms Graham said.
La Trobe University vice-chancellor Professor John Dewar said staff and students who remained unvaccinated by choice may not be able to have special arrangements made for them, which could impact their work and study.
“This is to enable the university to discharge its health and safety obligations to those on campus, and to reassure staff and students who are already vaccinated that they will not be placing their health at risk by coming onto campus,” Mr Dewar said.
“The university leadership believes these measures are essential to the safe reopening of our campuses so that we can return to the campus experience that our staff and students love so much, and that we have all sorely missed.”
The university will continue to monitor the pace of the vaccine rollout and adjust these dates if necessary.

MODERNA PRIORITY SUBURBS REVEALED Five pharmacies in Covid hotspots will be the first to receive deliveries of the Moderna vaccine on Monday.
As the rollout of the new mRNA jab begins, pharmacies in Altona, Braybrook, Sunshine, Cairnlea and Deer Park will be prioritised.
They will receive between 100 and 500 doses a week, depending on how many they have ordered.
Nationwide, 1800 pharmacies will receive Moderna supplies this week, with another 1800 coming online next week.
More than 700 of those are in Victoria, including 230 in hotspot areas.
The first pharmacies are:
• Chemcare Wellness Pharmacy
• Chemist Warehouse Braybrook — Home Co
• Terrywhite Chemmart Sunshine
• Priceline Pharmacy Cairnlea
• Deer Park Pharmacy

WHERE TODAY’S CASES EMERGED • 87 per cent of all cases are in Melbourne’s northern and western suburbs
• 357 cases across the north in locations including Craigieburn, Roxburgh Park and Broadmeadows
• 137 in the western suburbs in locations including Tarneit, Truganina and Altona North
• 45 cases in the south-eastern suburbs in Dandenong, Rowville and Pakenham
• 12 cases in the eastern suburbs including Doncaster at Ringwood North
• 14 cases in regional Victoria

SPOTSWOOD BUILDING SITES ON ALERT Outbreaks in regional Victoria are believed to be linked to construction sites in Melbourne.
A significant building site at Spotswood in Melbourne’s west has been linked to five cases in recent days.
There are about 80 primary close contacts from the site, as well as overlaps with another worksite at Lara, near Geelong.
Two significant rail construction sites — one in Gunnawarra — have had 13 positive cases.
It’s also connected to a major rail construction site at Lilydale, where there have been four linked cases.
A construction warehouse in Craigieburn has identified nine positive cases. There are 32 primary close contacts, a number of whom are in the Mitchell shire.
There are 14 cases in regional Victoria and two more cases are expected to be confirmed on Monday afternoon.
Five cases are in Ballarat, which now has 17 cases. Four of those cases are from one household connected to a Lilydale construction site.
Two cases in Moorabool, just outside of Geelong, are being investigated.
In Mitchell Shire, there are three new infections, bringing the cluster to 22 active cases.
There is also a case at Mt Alexander, which is related to a western suburbs worksite, and a single case in the Moira shire in the state’s north, believed to be connected to Ballarat.
Two cases are under investigation — one at South Gippsland and one in the Macedon Ranges.

PHARMACIES READY FOR RAMP-UP Victorian Pharmacy Guild president Anthony Tassone said from this week, more than 400 pharmacies would receive supplies of the Moderna vaccine to administer.
“It’s the same eligibility as other RNA vaccines that we have for Australia’s, being the Pfizer vaccine, 12 to 59 years old,” he said.
“This is great news for patients and another option for families to protect themselves in the community.”
“We’ve got a game plan now, we’ve got the targets.”
Mr Tassone challenged the energy of grand final week to hammer home the message.
“We know what we need to do — we need to get vaccinated. Don’t wait,” he said.
“Take the first option. Kick a goal for Victoria this week.”

VICTORIA’S ROADMAP OUT OF LOCKDOWN Premier Daniel Andrews on Sunday unveiled the long-awaited plan to freedom, which will delay the reopening of classrooms for most students, force retailers to operate outdoors and limit pubs and cafes to “restrictive” customer caps.
The state will only begin to open gradually once restrictions in metropolitan Melbourne and regional Victoria align at 80 per cent vaccination coverage – expected to be November 5.
And in a further blow, people in NSW will be able to visit family and friends in their home at 70 per cent double dose, while Victorians will have to reach 80 per cent to do the same.
But Mr Andrews insisted his plan was about opening up the state.
“Make no mistake, we are opening up, no doubt about that, and there will be no turning back,” he said.
“We have got to normalise this, we have got to pass through and beyond this pandemic. We cannot permanently suppress this virus.”
The Burnet Institute modelling – which drove the roadmap – predicted the state’s case numbers would peak at 4500 on December 15, with the total Covid-19 related deaths to reach 2200 by January.
Mr Andrews said a “catastrophic” number of people would become very ill if the state opened too soon.
NED-4588-VIC-roadmap-out-of-lockdown
“These are sobering numbers,” he said. “The notion of opening this place up very quickly at 70 per cent or 60 per cent, or today, simply cannot be done.”
NSW used the same modelling but allowed more freedoms at 70 per cent, while Victoria is waiting to reach 80 per cent.
Sydney’s Everest race will run in front of up to 5000 fans, while a crowd is not guaranteed for the spring racing carnival. This is despite Victoria on Sunday recording 507 new Covid-19 cases and one death, while NSW had 1083 cases and 13 deaths.
Lord Mayor Sally Capp said Victorian traders would be “looking longingly” at the “more generous freedoms” given to NSW, while Opposition Leader Matthew Guy said the measures appeared to be “too harsh for too long”.
“To have no real path back in any meaningful time … is unfathomable for many families in this state,” Mr Guy said.
Federal health minister Greg Hunt said Victoria’s plan was a “very cautious road map”.
“I know there will be differing views,” he said.
Assistant treasurer Michael Sukkar, another Victorian frontbencher, said that “36 more days of lockdown and ongoing harsh restrictions thereafter” did not provide the hope Victorians needed.
“Families are suffering, businesses are hanging on by a thread and our children need to be back at school,” he said.
Vaccinate target chart
Victorian Chamber of Commerce and Industry chief executive Paul Guerra questioned the “fundamentally different” plan for each state.
“Every Victorian business was looking for a path to prosperity but what we got delivered was a roadmap of roadblocks,” Mr Guerra said.
“We need a path out of this and today’s announcement has not given the clarity, the certainty or the hope we need to get out of the current situation.”
A supercharged vaccination program would be the only way to end lockdown early, but the Premier warned Australia’s Pfizer supply was “uncertain” next month.
Vic Locally-acquired Covid-19
Victorian nurses’ union boss Lisa Fitzpatrick welcomed the roadmap.
“We are reassured the roadmap can be paused to prevent Covid patients overwhelming our health system and our workforce so that we are not making impossible decisions about who gets a hospital bed,” she said.
Chief health officer Professor Brett Sutton said the roadmap provided a “tightrope between ensuring our health system is not overwhelmed (and protecting) us from those other harms that come from lockdown”.
Melbourne theatre producer and artist Katie Rowe said her sector faced a more uncertain future. “I think it won’t be until 2022 when things properly start, which is devastating,” she said.

HOW SCHOOLS’ COVID TIMETABLE WILL WORK Most students won’t return to the classroom until late October — and only on a part-time basis. These are the days your child will be allowed at school.
Meanwhile, fully vaccinated parents can send their children to childcare from October 26, but others will have to wait until November 5, according to the roadmap announced by the Premier on Sunday.
The milestone 80 per cent double-dose vaccination, which is expected to be reached on November 5, is the trigger for the full reopening of early learning.

NED-4591-Back to school

REGIONS LOCKED DOWN, BEACH TOWN SPLIT Geelong, the Surf Coast and Mitchell Shire were plunged back into lockdown after new Covid cases emerged on Sunday.
The snap seven-day lockdown began at 11.59pm on Sunday with a 10km travel limit and four hours of exercise and outdoor social interaction allowed each day.
Unlike Melbourne, a curfew was not put in place.
The decision has split the beachside town of Point Lonsdale in two, leaving some unlucky residents locked down while neighbours across the road enjoy their freedom.
The Borough of Queenscliffe and City of Greater Geelong’s border runs down the centre of Point Lonsdale, splitting the town in half after lockdown restrictions were introduced in Geelong but not Queenscliffe.
“It’s a bit of bad luck,” said Joanne Wurfel, who lives on the locked-down side of town. “I am hoping it’ll be enough so we can be free soon and join the rest of town.”
Premier Daniel Andrews announced the lockdown after four cases were identified in Geelong and the Surf Coast and seven in Mitchell Shire.
Supervisor of the Sphinx Hotel in North Geelong Rochelle Anderson said she wasn’t surprised by the announcement.
“A lot of rumours were going about but it doesn’t make it easier,” she said. “I’m over it, the mental health side of it is so hard for so many.”
It comes as the state government announced its road map plan for interstate and regional Victoria, that will allow it to open up faster than ­Melbourne.
Groups of 20 fully vaccinated people will be allowed to meet outside when 70 per cent of the state is double-dosed, while Melbourne will be capped at 10.
Pubs and cafes will also welcome greater numbers of vaccinated Victorians than their city counterparts at this level, with caps of 30 indoors and 100 outdoors.
National – 2021 – Covid Vaccination Stats
Current restrictions mean Melburnians and residents of other locked-down areas cannot travel to the regions until the state meets its 80 per cent fully vaccinated target, while regional Victorians can travel to other parts of the state.
At 80 per cent fully vaccinated – expected on November 5 – restrictions between Melbourne and the rest of state will align with interstate travel to resume for all.
At that point, vaccinated people could be exempt from domestic border restrictions, provided a national cabinet agreement is made, paving the way for Christmas reunions.
Overseas holidays could also be back on the cards, with revised quarantine arrangements for returning Australians subject to the national plan.
It comes as Mr Andrews said opening borders was not a priority.: “Repatriating Victorians is high on my priority list but interstate travel is not”.
The chief health officer declared 66 NSW municipalities will be moved from extreme risk to a red zone under Victoria’s permit system allowing Victorians stuck in NSW to quarantine at home.
NED-3889-Melbourne-lockdown-restrictions

CITY’S UNWELCOME LOCKDOWN TAG Melbourne is now guaranteed to become the most locked-down city in the world by a long margin, with stay-at-home orders extended for at least another month.
If lockdown ends as planned on October 26, Melbourne will have spent 267 days in hard lockdown since March last year – a total of nearly nine months.
It will beat the next most locked-down city in the world, Buenos Aires, by 22 days.
Previous records showed Buenos Aires had been locked down for 234 days. However, the city was plunged back into lockdown for a total of 11 days in recent months, taking its total to 245 days.
Melbourne will surpass the Argentinian city’s record as the world’s most locked-down city on Monday, October 4.
DAYS IN LOCKDOWN
The number of days each city has spent in lockdown around the world is hard to monitor as each city has different definitions of stay-at-home orders, however, the numbers are based on the best available data.
While Buenos Aires last year endured 234 straight days of lockdown, from March until November, Melbourne’s six combined lockdowns will total the longest period in the world. Melbourne’s current lockdown will have lasted 82 days – just shy of three months – if it ends on time, compared to 111 days in the city’s second lockdown last year.
Behind Melbourne and Buenos Aires are Dublin at 227 days in lockdown and London at 207.
London marked “freedom day” on July 19, with a near complete reopening of businesses at full capacity.
At the time, 68 per cent of Britons had received two vaccination doses.
Melbourne’s lockdown has been among the strictest in the world. It contributed to the city sliding six places to eighth in the list of the world’s most-liveable cities this year.
Deoples COVID-19 Victorian Exposure Sites Table

PEAK PRESSURE ON OUR FRONTLINE Victoria faces a peak of more than 4500 daily cases of Covid by Christmas and 2200 deaths in the new year, after restrictions are eased over the next seven weeks.
But epidemiologists behind the modelling that has guided the roadmap out of lockdown, say if Victorians “make an extra effort” to follow the rules over the next two months, the burden on the healthcare system could be significantly less.
On Sunday, Premier Daniel Andrews announced details of the staggered return of freedoms starting next weekend when 80 per cent of Victorian will have received their first vaccination dose.
More substantial restrictions are due to be lifted on November 5 when 80 per cent of eligible Victorians are fully vaccinated.
The roadmap, based on modelling by Melbourne’s Burnet Institute, shows the peak seven-day average is ­expected to be reached on ­December 15. By the end of the year, 3150 people will be in ­hospital, with more than a quarter of those in intensive care.
“These are sobering numbers,” Mr Andrews said.
“There are going to be some very difficult days and weeks, perhaps longer, in our health system. We will stand with you and support you, and we will ­monitor very closely … that ­impact on you, on your ­patients, on our health ­system.”
Burnet Professor Margaret Hellard, one of the authors of the modelling, said Victorians could “individually make a difference” to the projections, based on the choices they made.
The modelling shows if the roadmap is accompanied by increased testing of vaccinated people with mild symptoms, the peak number of cases could be almost halved and about 1000 fewer people would die.NED-4476-Covid-19-Vaccine-Rates-Melbourne
“There is fatigue, but we shouldn’t be pessimistic. We should instead be going ‘it’s the final quarter, and we’ve really got to run hard for the ball’,” Prof Hellard said. “If Victorians wear their masks, meet outdoors and don’t go to each other’s houses, if we get ­vaccinated, if we get tested when we need to, if we try our best to do all the things we’re being asked to do, we can change that.
“If the health system gets overwhelmed, people die. We don’t get to rewrite the story then, but we have the chance to rewrite it now.”
AMA Victoria president Roderick McRae said while the easing of restrictions was “premature”, it was reassuring the load on hospitals would be monitored carefully.
Australian Nursing and Midwifery Federation (Victorian Branch) secretary Lisa Fitzpatrick said the plan was sensibly “cautious”.
“It will be the number of ­unvaccinated Victorians that will determine whether our health system can cope or not,” Ms Fitzpatrick said.

NO FORCED JAB FOR 200 IN AGED CARE More than 200 Victorian aged care workers have been given a medical exemption from a mandatory Covid-19 vaccination.
New figures also reveal that 270 federally funded nursing homes across the state hit the 100 per cent staff vaccination rate by last Friday’s deadline.
About 97.2 per cent of Victorian residential aged care workers have had at least one vaccination, while 80 per cent are fully vaccinated.
“To date, 833 exemptions have been reported nationally, of which 208 are reported from Victoria,” an Operation Covid Shield spokesman said.
More than 1300 aged care homes nationwide report vaccination rates between 90-100 per cent, and 421 of those are in Victoria.
From this week, those who have a booking to receive a Covid-19 vaccination before October 1 must wear protective equipment while working.
All workers must be fully vaccinated by November 15.

FEDS’ PFIZER SUPPLY HITS A SNAG Victorians are being urged to book an AstraZeneca vaccination as Premier Daniel Andrews casts doubt on the federal government’s Pfizer supply arriving in October.
Mr Andrews said national cabinet on Friday was told there were “some issues”.
“I’m sure the Commonwealth government is working very hard to resolve that,” Mr Andrews said. “But it is a bit uncertain exactly how much Pfizer will come to our country, and of course, our state next month.
“That is another reason to go and book AstraZeneca today. It is available.”
The federal government’s Covid-19 vaccine taskforce is confident the nine million Pfizer doses expected in October will still arrive. However, vaccine rollout chief Lieutenant General John Frewen is understood to have told leaders Pfizer’s head office was yet to confirm exactly how many would arrive each week.
The figures, now due, mean states are unable to plan and announce bookings with certainty until the weekly allocations are updated.
Pharmacies will this week begin offering appointments for the Moderna vaccine.

Full text: It shows anywhere between 1455 and 3152 virus deaths in Victoria in the last half of the year and that number potentially soaring by the end of January 31.
These estimates exclude the 820 who died in Victoria in the 2020 second wave.
Let’s assume the Burnet Institute’s most conservative estimate of 1455 fatalities by December 31 is right rather than the more pessimistic 3152.
Either way, you would still have a lot of people checking out two years into a pandemic that has witnessed mixed policy responses federally and from the states.
Remember, a federal election is due by May 2022 and the last thing the Prime Minister needs is to saddle up for a campaign lined with coffins.
While Morrison will like the fact Victoria is welded on to opening up, he will be quietly hoping the Burnet Institute’s case and fatality numbers are wildly inflated.
Which they may prove to be.
Although the Burnet numbers overshadowed his road map launch, the Victorian Premier had a Road to Damascus moment on Sunday.
Not only is he now sold on progressively ending the lockdown, he’s denying he ever was a Covid-zero zealot.
Andrews has always presented as a member of the Covid-zero club even if he had his own interpretation of what that meant.
The important development to start the week is that even suppressing the virus to nominal numbers is out of the question.
This is, and has been for a while, a commonsense position.
It left Andrews insisting: “We are opening this place up.”
This is a big step forward from where the Victorian government has been throughout the pandemic and Andrews was emphatic in his warnings to the unvaccinated.
Indeed, he is blunt about the prospects of those who avoid the vaccine, making clear that failing to get the jabs will expose people to the strong possibility of illness.
Only 1 per cent of people in hospital in Victoria with the virus is fully vaccinated, the rest having no protection or just the one dose.
By vowing to open up, Andrews has given the Victorian community an opportunity to breathe and plan for the future.
It is not too much to say that the community has been choking under the weight of hundreds of days of lockdowns, which lost their sheen roughly five days in.
The road map, while not binding, offers millions of people the opportunity to dream of a largely normal Christmas.
We will see, of course … and we will remind the Burnet Institute if it has got things right or wrong.
The slow pace of reopening has outraged the hospitality sectors and there will be many others who will feel the same way.
You can’t blame businesses for wanting a decent run at Christmas or for being victim of the pandemic’s whims.
Unfortunately, like everywhere else in the world, it is Delta that has won.

Prepare for worse as we reopen, warn premiers Daniel Andrews and Gladys Berejiklian

Full text: Premier Daniel Andrews insisted Victoria’s health system would face intense pressure but the state would be able to pass through the reopening spike to a position where it could live with the virus.
NSW Premier Gladys Berejiklian cited the Doherty Institute modelling underpinning national cabinet’s plan for reopening in saying Australia needed to prepare to see high case numbers when her state reopens after reaching 80 per cent.
“I say to all my colleagues that even when you get 80 per cent double dose and start opening up, you will get Covid-19 in your community. So please accept that and get ready for that,” she said on Sunday.
“Numbers might be higher than we have ever seen. In fact, the Doherty report predicts that the case numbers that we will see are likely to be the highest cases we have seen in Australia.”
Mr Andrews unveiled a road map by which Melburnians will be locked down for at least another five weeks until 70 per cent of those 16 and over are fully ­vaccinated.
The most substantive relaxations – including the reopening of indoor dining and non-essential retail – are not expected to occur until the 80 per cent target is reached on about November 5.
Mr Andrews framed his road map — based on modelling from the Burnet Institute — as balancing the need to ensure the health system was not overwhelmed with the imperative to reopen.
He said Victoria would closely watch the reopening in NSW, which was a couple of weeks ahead of it in vaccination rates because it had received greater supplies, to adjust its modelling based on real world experience.
“If … we open steadily, gradually, but open, as we get to 70 and 80 per cent double dose, then our nurses, doctors, our ambos, they’ll come under intense pressure … it will be incredibly difficult in our health system, but we will be able to pass through a gateway, an important gateway. We will be able to normalise this,” Mr Andrews said on Sunday.
“We cannot perennially or permanently suppress this virus. Lockdowns have been about buying time to get to 70 and 80 per cent vaccination. We are fast ­approaching those milestones.
“At that point we have got to open the place up, because remaining closed forever has its own cost in every sense of that word.”
Mr Andrews acknowledged the easing of restrictions would likely see thousands hospitalised and hundreds die, with the Burnet model predicting 2202 Covid deaths in Victoria between July 1 and December 31 (there have so far been 11 Covid deaths in Victoria this year), and a peak in December of 3150 hospitalisations and 4543 daily cases.
As of Saturday, 82.23 per cent of those aged 16 and over in NSW had received a first dose of Covid vaccine, and 52.65 per cent had received a second.
This compares with 71.97 per cent first dose and 43.85 per cent second dose in Victoria, and a ­national average of 71.67 per cent first dose and 46.67 per cent for the second.
New Covid infections in NSW dropped to 1083 – the lowest number since August – but the state also recorded its deadliest day in the pandemic with 13 deaths.
NSW Health’s Jeremy McAnulty said the figures were “very encouraging” but urged caution.
“We don’t want to jump the gun … we do like to see several days before we can call it a trend but certainly cases overall have stabilised and appear to be dropping in some areas … where we have had rapidly increasing vaccination uptake as well as good compliance,” Dr McAnulty said.
Under the Victorian road map, Melburnians get their first small reprieve when an 80 per cent first dose target is reached on September 26, with outdoor facilities opening for contactless recreation such as golf and tennis.
School reopens from October 6 for year 12 students, with preps to return three days a week from October 18, and grades 1 and 2 for two days a week. Bigger changes come at 70 per cent double dose on October 26, when the 9pm to 5am curfew and lockdown will be lifted, and the travel limit increased to 25km.
Students in grades 3-6 and 8-10 will return to the classroom for two days a week, and those in years 7 and 11 will be back full-time, while childcare will fully reopen for children of double-dosed parents.
Vaccination will ultimately be mandatory for authorised workers, teachers, childcare workers, parents of children in childcare, hospitality workers and hospitality patrons.
Hospitality venues will reopen for outdoor service for the fully vaccinated, subject to a one person per 4sq m density limit, when 70 per cent full vaccination is reached.
Non-essential retail will not reopen until 80 per cent full vaccination is reached.
Visits to private homes will still be banned at 70 per cent, with up to five visitors permitted at 80 per cent, although Mr Andrews did say the government was aiming to allow 30 visitors to the home on Christmas Day.
Masks will continue to be mandatory outdoors until the 80 per cent full vaccination rate is reached, and will still be required indoors even after that point.
Premier Gladys Berejiklian says police believe compliance with the public health orders has been improving throughout New South Wales.
The slow pace of the reopening prompted Victoria’s peak industry body VECCI to dub it “a road map of roadblocks” and the Australian Hotels Association to deem it “unviable”.
Victoria’s 507 new cases and the death of a man in his 90s from Moreland in Melbourne’s north also represented a stabilisation of daily case numbers, following a peak of 525 on Saturday, 510 on Friday and 514 on Thursday.
Asked whether the Burnet modelling was too pessimistic in its prediction that case numbers would reach 1400-2900 cases between October 19 and 31, Mr Andrews said: “I absolutely hope so.”
He said he would be open to a discussion with health bureaucrats about speeding up the reopening road map should the Burnet predictions not eventuate, but indicated the approach would remain cautious.
“Even if you were lower than Burnet’s, even their median, let alone their worst forecast, that won’t be an easy day on any ward in any hospital. That’ll be really, really tough,” he said.
Amid rising case numbers, the regional Victorian LGAs of Geelong, Surf Coast and the Mitchell Shire joined Melbourne and Ballarat in lockdown as of Sunday night for at least the next week.
Premier Daniel Andrews has announced the details of Victoria’s roadmap out of the pandemic with the lockdown due to end at 70 per cent double doses – which is predicted to be reached on October 26.

Covid Australia: Push for 90% vaccination rate to prevent deaths

Full text: Doherty Modelling shows that, even with 80 per cent of the eligible population fully vaccinated, there will still be an estimated 9669 hospital admissions, 2075 in ICU and 1281 deaths, including 29 children, in the first six months out of lockdown with established community transmission of the Delta strain.
The modelling shows the difference between a 70 per cent vaccination rate and an 80 per cent vaccination rate would save an estimated 702 lives in the first 180 days.
At 70 per cent fully vaccinated, the modelling estimates 1983 deaths in the first six months out of lockdown.
The modelling also estimates 45 of those deaths would be in unvaccinated children under the age of 16.
At an 80 per cent fully vaccinated rate, the estimated death rate drops to 1281 people, with 29 of those children under the age of 16.
Additional, updated modelling shows the importance of maintaining track, trace isolation and quarantine (TTIQ) with an estimated total of 1457 deaths for 70 per cent vaccinated with partial TTIQ and 761 deaths with 80 per cent vaccination rate.
Professor Terry Nolan, paediatrician and head of Vaccine and Immunisation Research Group at the Doherty Institute said we needed to aim higher than 80 per cent to minimise the deaths predicted.
“People, including governments need to raise their ambitions. For children we have got used to aiming for 95 per cent (vaccination rate for all vaccines),” Prof Nolan said.
“Ninety per cent is what the real target should be, 80 per cent is an artificial number in the sense it is the minimum threshold, in all the assumptions, to have some sort of reasonably tolerable impact on the health system and the number of deaths that will appear on the front pages of the newspapers.
“The NSW Premier (Gladys Berejiklian) has started to introduce the 90 per cent words, 80 per cent is reasonable enough target but, given Delta, it’s not going to be enough.
“When you remove the gloss, they modellers haven’t lied, even at 80 per cent you are still just scraping the bar without having very severe public health measures and there is a big caveat that says this assumption only works if you have contract track and trace, isolation and quarantine and you cannot have that if the system is swamped with big numbers.
“We are talking hundreds, maybe thousands of deaths.”
Doherty Covid Modelling
Professor Marylouise McLaws, epidemiologist and Covid Adviser to the World Health Organisation said the Doherty Model underestimates the worst case scenario.
“I think the community needs to brace itself for more deaths, absolutely,” Prof McLaws said.
National - 2021 - Covid Vaccination Stats
Children aged 12-15 have now been approved for vaccination as of last Monday.
According to NSW Health there are currently five children aged under 18 in ICU, two of those under the age of nine.
“Why wouldn’t you vaccinate children who can be protected from a vaccinatable disease?,” Prof McLaws said.
“An 80 per cent vaccination rate will not cut it. If all you are trying to do is protect people from hospitalisation and death then a 70 per cent may improve the run on the health system and death but it is not going to prevent transmission.
“We need to aim for 95 per cent.”
A recent survey by the Australian National University found 94 per cent over 18 were already or willing to get vaccinated.

Full text: Premiers Daniel Andrews and Gladys Berejiklian have teamed up in national cabinet to pour cold water on the plan by their Queensland counterpart Annastacia Palaszczuk’s to give Pfizer vaccines to the over 60s, arguing they need to stick to AstraZeneca.
Instead the pair argued that they would wait at least another fortnight while other priority groups are given Pfizer, sources familiar with the meeting said.
The refusal is in contrast to Queensland’s plan to make Pfizer available immediately to people over 60, a move that has been criticised because it will see AstraZeneca vaccines go to waste.
Friday afternoon’s national cabinet meeting ticked off on a national code on boarding school Students which will allow them and their parents and carers as well as boarding school staff travel across borders between school and home.
Minister for Regionalisation, Regional Communications and Regional Education Senator Bridget McKenzie called on all jurisdictions to quickly implement the plan to help 23,000 boarding students and their families travel during the Term 3 school holidays.
“While border closures and intrastate travel restrictions have helped contain the spread of COVID-19, it has unintentionally left some boarding students isolated and unable to receive the support and care of family, causing additional stress and anxiety during what is already a difficult time,” she said.
“Today’s decision is a win for commonsense. The National Code takes a clear, compassionate and practical approach to supporting the travel needs of boarding school students.”
national cabinet also received an update from the Doherty Institute’s Professor Jodie McVernon of the Doherty Institute and top bureaucrat Phil Gatejens in modelling on reopenings. The modelling again confirmed Doherty’s analysis the Delta variant can be managed when between 70 per cent and 80 per cent of the population over 16 have been double jabbed when combined with testing, tracing, isolation and quarantine regimes.
The modelling leaves a place for limited restrictions to stay in place along with precautionary measures such as face masks to reduce spread and prevent the health system from melting down.
The modelling presented to national cabinet showed that even in an outbreak with Doherty’s sensitivity analysis showed that, even if an outbreak starts with hundreds or thousands of cases it should not change plans to begin relaxing restrictions at vaccination rates between 70 per cent and 80 per cent.
When cases are at a higher level however the modelling does still allow for “medium” restrictions in areas of concern.
At current vaccination the gap between 70 per cent and 80 per cent vaccination rates is likely to be bridged within two weeks.
Given the pace of the vaccination roll out, the transition from 70% to 80% by jurisdiction is modelled to take around two weeks.
Professor Mcvernon told the meeting the impact of COVID-19 on children is already incorporated in the Doherty’s previous modelling and the setting of targets.
The meeting also agreed all jurisdictions will work to integrate people’s immunisation history into state and territory check-in apps which can be used to comply with public health orders.
VICTORIA’S BIG VACCINE MILESTONE Seventy per cent of eligible Victorians have received the first dose of the coronavirus vaccine as Melburnians prepare to enjoy a minor easing of restrictions.
The Department of Health made the announcement on Twitter, saying the milestone meant some lockdown rules could now ease.
“Let’s keep the momentum going!” the tweet read.
It comes as the state recorded a total of 510 local cases from coronavirus in the past 24 hours.
However, a woman in her 50s has died from the virus.
Health Minister Martin Foley offered his deepest condolences to family and friends at this “very sad time”.
There are now 208 Victorians in hospital with the virus, with 49 in intensive care and 32 needing ventilation.
Mr Foley said 87 per cent of the Covid patients in hospital were not vaccinated, 12 per cent were partially vaccinated and two had received both doses.
Nine people have now died with Covid during the latest outbreak, with 829 lives lost since the start of the pandemic.
Of the latest infections, 124 have so far been linked to known cases and outbreaks.
One case was recorded in hotel quarantine.
More than 69.3 per cent of eligible Victorians have now had their first vaccine dose.
In total, 43,993 vaccines were administered and 55,476 test results received.
The state now has 4,697 active cases.
DOCTORS, NURSES BEG FOR RULES TO STAY Victoria’s nursing union and the Australian Medical Association have pleaded with the state government to consider the impact that reducing restrictions will have on the healthcare system.
Lisa Fitzpatrick, state secretary of the Australian Nursing and Midwifery Federation, on Friday said it was “absolutely critical” the state did not open up too early, as hospitals braced for an influx of Covid-19 patients.
“It’s not about getting on the beers too early because there won’t be beers to be had whilst you’re in hospital in an ICU bed,” Ms Fitzpatrick said.
“We want our politicians here in Victoria, irrespective of what the national cabinet decides to put Victorians first.”
The AMA’s Victorian branch president, Roderick McRae, said hospitals were already “stressed” as healthcare staff worked overtime hours and without leave to make up for furloughed workers.
“Be aware of the numbers you are hearing on your news bulletins over your breakfast cereal, there is a steady increase (of hospitalisations),” he said.
“Understand that the capacity to deal with all of these medical problems has been under-invested in for decades, and now we have this crisis of healthcare.”
Dr McRae warned ICU beds were quickly filling up and healthcare staff were fatigued after battling the pandemic for 18 months.
“It doesn’t matter if the Premier, (or) the Health Minister … says ‘great you can get out there’, the strongest advice that the organised medical caring professionals can state is do not do that,” he said.
“All of the healthcare unions are together to advise the politicians making decisions, and also the public.
“The unspoken message is, do not move around … (so we can) minimise the transmission of this virus.”
Speaking to reporters at the Royal Melbourne Hospital, frontline ICU staff said they held grave concerns about rising case numbers and hospitalisations.
“We’re actually nearing full (capacity), we’re having to plan and shift patients outside of the ICU to other hospitals,” ICU nurse Steven Moylan said.
“We do have bed plans in place but they stretch our resources and we can open up but there’s only so much staff that can staff those beds – especially in intensive care.”
ICU doctor, Yasmine Ali Abdelhamid, said healthcare resources were “finite” and contingency plans were being put in place to deal with an expected rise in Covid patients.
“I’m definitely worried about what’s ahead. It’s been a long 18 months, healthcare workers are tired, parents are tired, community members are tired … but the time for patients is still now,” she said.
WHERE THE LATEST CASES EMERGED Victorian’s Covid-19 commander Jeroen Weimar revealed 95 per cent of the state’s new cases on Friday were from the northern and western suburbs.
He said 276 cases were in the north, including suburbs such as Craigieburn, Roxburgh Park and Broadmeadows.
Another 185 infections were detected in the western suburbs, including Truganina and Hoppers Crossing, while 38 cases were from the southern and eastern suburbs in areas like Cranbourne North, Pakenham and Dandenong.
Overall, Mr Weimar said 91 per cent of the active cases were from the northern and western regions of Melbourne.
Three further cases were also recorded in locked down Ballarat.
NEW MELBOURNE AREAS OF C ONCERN Victorian health authorities are growing increasingly concerned over the growth of Covid-19 cases in Melbourne’s eastern and southeastern suburbs.
Health Minister Martin Foley revealed 38 of Friday’s 510 new infections were from the region, and there was now 329 active cases across the southern and eastern suburbs.
“We want to make sure that everyone in those areas gets tested at the first signs of symptoms,” he said.
Previously, the northern and western suburbs of Melbourne were the areas of most concern.
Mr Foley revealed a new vaccination clinic would be set up at Dandenong’s Palm Plaza and a pop-up site at the Hallam mosque.
A new clinic will also open at the Eastland shopping centre in Ringwood starting at 300 does a day before scaling up to 1200 doses a day by next week.
NEW HOPE FOR BUSINESSES Melbourne businesses could be allowed to reopen under a plan to trial vaccine passports from as early as next week.
City of Melbourne councillors will on Tuesday vote to lobby the state government to immediately roll out the passport scheme at selected venues across the CBD.
Some of Melbourne’s most renowned hospitality, arts and entertainment venues – including Garden State Hotel, Cherry Bar, San Telmo and Asado – could open their doors to fully vaccinated Victorians.
It would make the city one of the first municipalities in the state to pilot the temporary scheme, which has so far only been proposed in regional Victoria. Only fully vaccinated Victorians – including staff at the participating businesses – would be eligible to participate in the proposed health pass.
The Night Time Economy Advisory Committee (NTEAC) – made up of leaders from the sector – is championing the pilot program, and has called on the Victorian government to let them reopen ­sooner.
NTEAC chair James Young said trialling a health pass system would minimise health risks and help get struggling businesses open sooner.
“An opt-in trial in the City of Melbourne is the perfect opportunity to identify and resolve issues in partnership with industry and government,” Mr Young said.
“It would require streamlined technology and processes to minimise the compliance burden on businesses and venues of all sizes, and to ensure the system is rolled out quickly and effectively.”
Lord Mayor Sally Capp said the City of Melbourne had been doing “everything it can” to get more Victorians vaccinated in a bid to reopen the city.
“Nowhere in Australia has been hit harder by devastating lockdowns than Melbourne, and our businesses should be the first in line to reopen safely,” Ms Capp told the Herald Sun.
“They’re prepared to do whatever it takes.”
City Activation portfolio lead Roshena Campbell said now was the time to explore options that could safely reopen city businesses and protect livelihoods.
“Our city’s businesses have been crippled after six lockdowns and the earlier businesses can reopen, the quicker our city can recover,” Ms Campbell said.
The scheme would only operate until vaccination levels are sufficient to lift health restrictions.
Councillors will vote on whether they will advocate for the health pass at the Future Melbourne Committee on Tuesday September 21.
TRADIES IN SMOKO PROTEST Melbourne’s tradies have taken to the streets in a bizarre way on Friday morning to protest against the closure of tea rooms on construction sites.
Premier Daniel Andrews revealed tea rooms on work sites needed to close due to the increasing risk of Covid-19 transmission within the construction industry.
On Friday, workers took their smoko and lunch break to the street to protest against the new rule.
Workers set up an outdoor break room at the intersection of A’Beckett and Elizabeth streets in Melbourne’s CBD, blocking cars and holding up traffic.
Similar protests were also held outside construction sites in Spencer St and in Richmond.

Vaccinate target chart
National – 2021 – Covid Vaccination Stats
SMALL FREEDOM FOR FULLY JABBED Fully vaccinated Melburnians will be able to gather in larger groups under new ­freedoms that will, for the first time, be given exclusively to those who have received both doses.
People yet to be vaccinated – or those who have had just one dose – can only gather with one other person under a slight easing of the city’s ­lockdown.
Premier Daniel Andrews gave the green light to picnics and outdoor social interaction for groups of two from Saturday, after the state was set to hit its 70 per cent first-dose vaccination target.
But Melburnians who have received two doses will be able to gather in groups of up to five, plus dependants, from two households.
For everyone, the 5km movement restriction will ­extend to 10km, people will be able to spend up to four hours outside per day, and outdoor gyms and skate parks will ­reopen.
“We know this is what the community is craving – the notion of being able to see the people they love and care for,” the Premier said. “These are modest (changes) … but they are not unimportant. They are ­meaningful.”
CHANGES TO LOCKDOWN RULES FROM 11.59PM, SEPTEMBER 17
Victoria on Thursday ­recorded its highest daily case figure since August 4 last year, with 514 local cases, ­including 366 mystery infections.
While fully vaccinated Melburnians – along with double-dosed people living in locked down Ballarat – would gain slightly greater ­freedoms, Mr Andrews said the larger gatherings would be subject to an “honour ­system”.
Mr Andrews confirmed police would not patrol parks to question a person’s vaccination status.
Despite picnics being permitted, there would be no changes to current laws that make it illegal to remove a mask to drink ­alcohol outside the home. But the Herald Sun ­understands police would not ­actively seek to enforce that direction.
“We are not going to have police in every park. We are not going to have police out there requiring people to prove they have been vaccinated,” Mr Andrews said.
“There’s a degree of good faith in this. I’m asking people to do the right thing.
“We can’t literally have a situation where we are going park by park, picnic by picnic. That’s not an invitation to break the rules.”
Melbourne will continue to live under a curfew, with Mr Andrews maintaining he had received no health advice to lift the controversial measure, despite NSW scrapping it.
“The curfew works … it’s proportionate to the challenge we face,” he said.
Friends Isabella Jenkins and Cylina Tran will be among Melburnians toasting the small step out of lockdown, saying it was a welcome reprieve from spending most of the time indoors.
And Andy Marriner said his daughter, Neave, 4, was thrilled she could return to the skate park, having only picked up skateboarding a few months ago. “We’ve got some lessons booked in now for next week,” he said.
Meanwhile, restrictions in regional Victoria – except for Ballarat – will ease further, with gyms, outdoor and indoor pools to reopen.
Mr Andrews will on Sunday unveil a highly awaited roadmap to more freedoms, which will be tied to vaccination rates, including a 70 per cent double-dose target.
He said the state was due to hit that milestone about October 26, and 80 per cent fully vaccinated as soon as “a matter of weeks later”.

VAX FOR ENTRY BACKED Two in three Australians believe fully vaccinated people should be allowed to attend public events and activities without any restrictions.
But almost a quarter disagree with excluding those who haven’t had their Covid jab.
A new Melbourne Institute survey released on Thursday reveals most Australians (57 – 68 per cent) agree with denying unvaccinated people access to certain public events and activities.
But when asked whether the government should require businesses to deny service to unvaccinated customers, support dropped to 50 per cent of respondents, and more than a quarter disagreed.
The survey of 1200 Australians aged 18 years and over also found vaccine hesitancy has reached a low of 14.4 per cent in Victoria, paving the way for the state to reach the magic 80 per cent double vaccinated target.
The figure is made up of 9.4 per cent of respondents, who say they are not willing to be vaccinated, and 7.3 per cent who are still unsure.
It’s the biggest drop in Australia, falling from a previous high of 20.2 per cent on August 20.

BACKLASH OVER CONSTRUCTION JAB RULE Construction workers are scrambling to get the jab and worksites are bracing for disruptions as new coronavirus restrictions are imposed on the industry.
Under rules announced on Thursday, every worker on a Victorian construction site is required to have their first vaccine by September 23.
Movement of construction workers between Melbourne and regional Victoria will also be banned in an effort to limit outbreaks similar to the one unfolding in Ballarat.
Deliveries of materials will be allowed but the policy will be strictly enforced for anyone who works on site.

STRAIN SAPS TEACHERS Teachers are facing burnout with increased workloads amid the ongoing demands of remote learning.
The Herald Sun has seen an email exchange between a teacher and a principal from a high school in Melbourne’s southeast, with the teacher saying she was under “incredible stress” and was “unable to cope” with the demands of remote learning.
Another teacher, from a school in Melbourne’s east, told the Herald Sun she was thinking of leaving the profession due “ongoing stress”.
“It’s been so challenging, I am having to work at least an extra 15 hours a week just to keep up,” she said.
Australian Education Union Victorian Branch president Meredith Peace said Victorian teachers, principals and education support staff had done a remarkable job rising to the remote-learning challenges.
A Department of Education spokesman said: “The Victorian government has invested more than $51m to support the health, safety and wellbeing of Victorian government school staff as part of the Safe and Well in Education Strategy, and the department will continue to support teachers in their work and wellbeing”.
NED-4292-Percentage-of-eligible-population-fully-vaccinated-by-state
REGIONS STILL BOOMING Melbourne’s exodus to sea and tree-change areas is tipped to continue, with demand for regional property “on steroids” as a result of ongoing lockdowns.
The number of people leaving the city accounted for 47 per cent of Australia’s net internal migration total in the last financial year, with 26 per cent of those metro-leavers settling in regional locations nationwide, according to data from Commonwealth Bank and the Regional Australia Institute.
The June quarter Regional Movers Index revealed the local government areas recording the biggest growth in migration from city dwellers were all within a three-hour drive from the CBD.
They include Moorabool, which had a 68 per cent increase, Mansfield, 62 per cent, and Corangamite, where population surged by 52 per cent.
The Murray River area, located in NSW, was next in line (48 per cent), followed by Alpine region (47 per cent).
Greater Geelong also saw a significant influx of Melburnians, with an increase of 26 per cent during the year to June 2021.
VICTORIA THE ONLY SHRINKING STATE Victoria shrunk by 42,900 people last year, the Australian Bureau of Statistics has revealed.
The only state not to grow, Victoria’s population decline was equal to losing a city the size of Wodonga.
Queensland saw the highest growth, with an extra 43,900 people, while other states saw low or modest increases – with NSW’s population increasing by 11,700 people and WA by 15,000.
Australia’s population grew by 35,700, to an estimated 25.7 million. The 0.1 per cent increase is the lowest since WWI.
The data reflects the first full year of the pandemic’s impact on the country’s population, with overseas migration negative for the first time since 1946.
The ABS also revealed Victoria’s unemployment rate fell to a record low as fewer people looked for work during lockdown.
The bureau released its latest monthly employment figures on Thursday, revealing the jobless rate fell to 4.1 per cent in August.
However the figure does not reflect the reality of the job market, as underemployment rose to 9.1 per cent as thousands of people with jobs worked reduced or zero hours.
Nationally, the jobless rate fell to 4.5 per cent – the lowest since the global financial crisis in 2008.
The low jobless figure was driven by a 0.8 per cent drop in the participation rate, which includes people with a job or looking for work.

Full text: Doherty Modelling shows that, even with 80 per cent of the eligible population fully vaccinated, there will still be an estimated 9669 hospital admissions, 2075 in ICU and 1281 deaths, including 29 children, in the first six months out of lockdown with established community transmission of the Delta strain.
The modelling shows that the difference between a 70 per cent vaccination rate and an 80 per cent vaccination rate would save an estimated 702 lives in the first 180 days.
At 70 per cent fully vaccinated, the modelling estimates 1983 deaths in the first six months out of lockdown.
The modelling also estimates 45 of those deaths would be in unvaccinated children under the age of 16.
At an 80 per cent fully vaccinated rate, the estimated death rate drops to 1281 people, with 29 of those children under the age of 16.
Additional, updated modelling shows the importance of maintaining track, trace isolation and quarantine (TTIQ) with an estimated total of 1457 deaths for 70 per cent vaccinated with partial TTIQ and 761 deaths with 80 per cent vaccination rate. With optimal ‘gold standard’ TTIQ, deaths are predicted to drop back substantially with zero deaths in children with 80 per cent fully vaccinated.
Professor Terry Nolan, paediatrician and Head of Vaccine and Immunisation Research Group at the Doherty Institute said we needed to aim higher than 80 per cent to minimise the deaths predicted.
“People, including governments need to raise their ambitions. For children we have got used to aiming for 95 per cent (vaccination rate for all vaccines).
“90 per cent is what the real target should be, 80 per cent is an artificial number in the sense it is the minimum threshold, in all the assumptions, to have some sort of reasonably tolerable impact on the health system and the number of deaths that will appear on the front pages of the newspapers.
“The NSW Premier (Gladys Berejiklian) has started to introduce the 90 per cent words, 80 per cent is reasonable enough target but, given Delta, it’s not going to be enough,” Prof Nolan said.
“When you remove the gloss, they modellers haven’t lied, even at 80 per cent you are still just scraping the bar without having very severe public health measures and there is a big caveat that says this assumption only works if you have contract track and trace, isolation and quarantine and you cannot have that if the system is swamped with big numbers.
“We are talking hundreds, maybe thousands of deaths.”
Professor Mary-Louise McLaws, epidemiologist and Covid Adviser to the World Health Organisation said the Doherty Model underestimates the worst case scenario.
“The Doherty Report has to be adjusted for what is happening now because during that modelling there was the assumption case numbers would be lower and it didn’t include a R of six (reproductive number of Covid) it was obviously done prior to Delta,” Prof McLaws said.
Children aged 12-15 have now been approved for vaccination as of last Monday.
According to NSW Health there are currently five children aged under 18 in ICU, two of those under the age of nine.
“Why wouldn’t you vaccinate children who can be protected from a vaccinatable disease?
“An 80 per cent vaccination rate will not cut it. If all you are trying to do is protect people from hospitalisation and death then a 70 per cent may improve the run on the health system and death but it is not going to prevent transmission.
“We need to aim for 95 per cent.”
A recent survey by the Australian National University found 94 per cent over 18 were already or willing to get vaccinated.

Full text: Modelling by a new scientific lobby group projects that NSW's road map to reopening may lead to all the state's intensive care unit beds being full for five weeks over Christmas and more than 1000 people dying from COVID-19.
The modelling is the first release from OzSAGE, a group of high-profile scientists who have come together to call for Australia to change course on reopening.
OzSAGE's membership includes some of Australia's best-known scientists including leading epidemiologist Tony Blakely, Burnet Institute head Brendan Crabb, the Grattan Institute's Stephen Duckett, Kirby Institute biosecurity program head Raina MacIntyre and ANU vice-chancellor and Nobel prize winning astronomer Brian Schmidt.
It calls for Australia to achieve COVID-19 "elimination", similar to polio or measles, in which there is no sustained community transmission and outbreaks are rare.
Australia's national reopening plan calls for a lifting of restrictions and a shift of focus from preventing transmission to preventing death as vaccination rises.
OzSAGE's model projects ICU capacity will be exceeded in NSW for five weeks in December and January. Between June 7, 2021 and February 1, 2022, it projects 1169 deaths, including the 184 people who have died in the current outbreak.
Said Professor MacIntyre, who led OzSAGE's modelling: "When those restrictions are relaxed, there will be a second peak because the virus can spread faster. Once you can't provide ICU care to people who need it, the death rate starts to go up. That's exactly what we saw in Europe last year."
But that scenario was unlikely to eventuate as the government would impose new restrictions once the health system began to buckle, Professor MacIntyre said.
Modelling by the Doherty Institute - on which the national reopening plan is based - projects ICU capacity will not be exceeded within six months of reopening.
Burnet Institute modelling, commissioned by the NSW government, does not show a spike in hospitalisations in December or January. However, it assumes restrictions will be maintained, though NSW plans to lift lockdown for the vaccinated when it hits a 70 per cent vaccination rate.
Professor MacIntyre said the OzSAGE model showed an overwhelmed health system because it started with almost 2000 daily cases when NSW reopened, whereas the Doherty's model started with only 30.
The Doherty Institute says the number of cases at reopening does not materially alter its projections. NSW recorded 1257 new cases of COVID-19 yesterday.
The OzSAGE modelling covers NSW only.
OzSAGE says it is concerned with the pace of Australia's reopening, the risk COVID-19 poses to children, and Australia's 80 per cent national vaccination target, which it believes is too low, given the true rate will be lower in some groups such as Indigenous people.
Said OzSAGE member Lisa Jackson Pulver, deputy vice-chancellor of Indigenous Strategy and Services at the University of Sydney: "If you open up when vulnerable people have got such low rates of double-shot immunisation, the chances of having a catastrophic outbreak in a locale or building are very, very high.
"The risk profile of the 70 and 80 per cent is not high enough. I think we need to be very cautious about what reopening, under the current mechanisms, will be like."

Australia's national reopening plan calls for a lifting of restrictions and a shift of focus from preventing transmission to preventing death as the vaccination rate rises.
Last month, Prime Minister Scott Morrison compared opponents of reopening to cavemen. "COVID is a new, different world, and we need to get out there and live in it. We can't stay in the cave."
OzSAGE's model projects ICU capacity will be exceeded in NSW for five weeks over December and January. Between June 7 this year and February 1, 2022, it projects 1169 deaths.
"When those restrictions are relaxed, there will be a second peak because the virus can spread faster," said Professor MacIntyre, who led OzSAGE's modelling. "Once you can't provide ICU care to people who need it, the death rate starts to go up. That's exactly what we saw in Europe last year."
But that scenario was unlikely, as the government would impose new restrictions once the health system began to buckle, she said.
The modelling adds to a collection of conflicting projections about what will happen when Australia reopens. Modelling by the Doherty Institute - on which the national reopening plan is based - projects ICU capacity will not be exceeded within six months of reopening.
Burnet Institute modelling, commissioned by the NSW government, does not show a rise in hospitalisations in December or January. However, it assumes restrictions will be maintained, when in fact NSW plans to lift lockdown for the vaccinated when it hits a 70 per cent vaccination rate.
Professor MacIntyre said the OzSAGE model showed an overwhelmed health system because it started with almost 2000 daily cases when NSW reopened, whereas the Doherty's model started with only 30.
The Doherty Institute says the number of cases at reopening does not materially alter its projections. NSW recorded 1257 new COVID-19 cases yesterday. OzSAGE modelling has yet to model the outcome of eased restrictions in Victoria.
Former deputy chief medical officer Nick Coatsworth said the group represented scientists who found themselves on one extreme of the risk spectrum.
"They say 'nobody left behind'... But it would mean you'd have to extend restrictions," he said. "There would be a significant imposition on people's freedoms - who have done the right thing and are vaccinated - based on this philosophy we can't possibly open up until we've spent the next six to 12 months vaccinating everyone who hasn't been vaccinated."

Full text: The professor behind a model provided to the WA government that predicted scores of coronavirus deaths in that state if restrictions were relaxed too soon says the Doherty Institute modelling on which the national reopening plan is based is "perhaps too optimistic".
University of Western Australia Professor George Milne's modelling, given to the WA Health Department a fortnight ago, paints a far more pessimistic picture about what will happen when Australia reopens compared with Doherty Institute modelling commissioned for the national cabinet.
The model forecasts 13,390 cases, 1373 hospitalisations and 186 deaths in the six months after WA reopens; big numbers for a state that has recorded just 1088 cases and nine deaths over the entire pandemic.
"It tells you we're going to have lots of people becoming ill, frankly," said Professor Milne, a pioneer of agent-based modelling who is now based at the University of WA. "Our modelling results suggest we need to be about 85 per cent vaccination coverage."
Under the plan discussed at national cabinet, based on modelling by the Doherty Institute, states will begin relaxing lockdowns and restrictions when 70 per cent of the population is vaccinated. Further freedoms will be granted at 80 per cent and beyond.
On Thursday, after weeks of posturing, WA Premier Mark McGowan finally announced his state's border was likely to remain closed until at least February. The state will seek to get well above the 80 per cent vaccination mark set for moving into phase C of Prime Minister Scott Morrison's national reopening plan, and wouldn't be opening up until then.
"I suspect that comes from our documents we produced for them," Professor Milne said. "I think the Doherty data is perhaps too optimistic. It does not correlate with what we're finding."
The institute's modelling has shaped the entire national conversation on reopening; the federal government's plans rest almost entirely upon it.
But a range of models exist: some more optimistic, some more pessimistic. And the Doherty model's underlying assumptions and mechanisms - the key inputs that vary between models - are yet to be made fully public.
"It's very hard for even people like me to figure out how the assumptions differ. A lot of the values are unknown, a lot of it is kept confidential," said Professor Tom Kompas, a modeller at the University of Melbourne.
"We need a conversation where the models are clear, and the conversations are clear, so we can actually have a debate."
The Doherty Model
The institute's model - actually done by more than a dozen modellers across several institutions - projects that if Australia reopens with 80 per cent of adults vaccinated we can expect 275,918 symptomatic infections, 8720 hospitalisations and 980 deaths over the next six months.
Most will be in unvaccinated people; a small fraction will be children. Crucially, it assumes that vaccination rates will continue to rise past 80 per cent after reopening.
The model does not project beyond six months. Some projections, including daily new infections, continue to rise beyond the cut-off point - leaving the peak unclear.
"The next report will address your initial questions," an institute spokeswoman said. "The team has said it's a logical conclusion that scenarios that take 180 days to peak will do so at a far lower level than more rapidly growing scenarios."
The model assumes many virus-control measures will stay in place. It also assumes each person infected with the Delta strain of the virus will pass it on to 3.6 other people on average. This number is much lower than other models assume - some go as high as eight - but the authors say it is based on real-world data from NSW in March when few social restrictions were in place.
Crucially, for the Doherty projections to be met, contact tracing needs to operate about as well as it did in Victoria at the peak of its second wave. Authorities yesterday said they were still contacting over 99 per cent of positive cases within 24 hours of a test result as case numbers hit 392.
The Doherty projections do not model a contact tracing system overwhelmed by extremely high caseloads, said Dr Stephen Duckett, who has developed modelling at the Grattan Institute.
The model also assumes we will not vaccinate children - and that they play almost no role in spreading the virus. This may explain why Professor Milne's model is so much more pessimistic: it assumes children play a major role in spreading COVID-19. "We're assuming children transmit 50 per cent less effectively than adults. But we're still showing vaccinating kids make a huge difference because they mix much more than adults provided classes are opening," Professor Milne said.
Beyond that, independent modellers say the Doherty model is hard to critique because key mechanisms have not been made public, nor has it been peer reviewed.
"No one, let alone 25 million people, should be taking much notice of a model that does not meet this standard," said Professor Emma McBryde, a modeller at the Australian Institute of Tropical Health and Medicine.
A preprint explaining the Doherty's assumptions and mechanisms in detail was "imminent", an institute spokeswoman said.
Other futures
The most optimistic projections come from models built by the Grattan Institute and the University of Melbourne. The Grattan projects about 2000 deaths across Australia over 300 days if we reopen with 80 per cent vaccinated. Soon-to-be-released University of Melbourne modelling, provided to the Herald, projects between 390 and 1400 deaths in Australia over 12 months.
"This is much less than any comparable numbers in the Doherty Report - because we model policy dynamically. And here is the price to pay - this scenario also has us in soft or hard lockdown 41 per cent of the time to keep the numbers in check," says Professor Tony Blakely, the epidemiologist who led the modelling.
Then there are two models drawing attention for projecting very high death tolls.
Modelling led by James Cook University projects 8 million cases and 12,500 deaths. Australian National University modelling produces a headline-grabbing figure: 50,000 deaths.
But these models are very unlike the Doherty's. The James Cook model looks at how many people will be infected over the course of the epidemic; it concludes that 85 per cent of the unvaccinated will be infected if we open up at 80 per cent vaccinated.
The ANU's is even simpler. It asks: if we relaxed all restrictions and exposed every single person in Australia to COVID-19, what would happen? This is how such high numbers are produced. Both models also assume vaccination never rises above 80 per cent, and children under 15 are unvaccinated.
These models are not realistic for the next six months, their authors admit. But they do point towards the long-term consequences of reopening with 80 per cent vaccination rates - leaving 4.1 million adults unvaccinated - and allowing the virus to circulate: unless we can continue to push up vaccination rates, many unvaccinated people will fall sick and die.

Full text: Rapid antigen tests at home will be a key part of a more sustainable way of dealing with the pandemic in the coming months, but the head of the Doherty Institute says there is still potential for the coronavirus to throw more curveballs at the world.
Australia will also be a two-tier country for a while with COVID-zero and COVID-positive states taking different measures to control the pandemic, Doherty Institute director Professor Sharon Lewin says.
"There will be unexpected challenges that we would not have anticipated — just like we didn't really anticipate Delta," she said.
Professor Lewin yesterday convened a conference to bring together leading health experts and researchers to discuss the future of COVID-19. The conference, run by the Australasian Society for HIV, Viral Hepatitis and Sexual Health Medicine (ASHM), will hopefully be the first of many to unite scientists, clinical researchers and the community to discuss the latest research about the coronavirus, she said.
Professor Lewin said over the next six to 12 months she expects to see better treatments for people with the disease and more innovation in COVID testing.
"Home tests can make a big difference. We've been doing it for pregnancy forever. And we now do it for HIV," she said.
The Doherty Institute produced the modelling being used by the federal government to guide the national recovery from the pandemic, and that research informed the 70 and 80 per cent double vaccination targets set by national cabinet for restrictions to begin easing.
But Professor Lewin said home testing was an important tool to include in the pandemic response.
"We're relying really heavily on vaccines, relying still really heavily on public health measures. But if we can use some of these other approaches, it will make a big difference," she said. "There's a whole lot of ways at-home testing can really help in testing people that would not normally be tested. So we've got a long way to go on that in Australia."
The move to living with the coronavirus once vaccination targets are reached will be a big shift for the country. Professor Lewin says it will not be uniform across the nation.
"We might see Australia as a two-tier country, with COVID states and non-COVID states. We might have that for quite a while," she said.
In non-COVID states, Professor Lewin expects to see intermittent lockdowns as cases leak out of quarantine, while states with COVID will focus on risk reduction and managing the impact on healthcare.
Twenty months into the pandemic, Professor Lewin said the advances have been spectacular.
"As difficult as things are in Victoria and in NSW right now, it's very different. 2021 is not 2020 when we were in lockdown last year and really didn't know what was at the end, because we had nothing, there was no vaccine," she said.
ASHM chief executive Alexis Apostolellis said everything the organisation has learnt over the last 40 years of the HIV response was informing its work in the pandemic.
"We are pleased to be able to facilitate such important discussions on COVID-19 science and we hope this will be a model for bringing global scientific communities together to talk about COVID-19 in the future."

Full text: However, the Grand Hotel Healesville says if it becomes mandatory to enter a business with a passport, it will have no choice but to follow the law.
A post from the pub went viral this week when the owners explained that would allow all people, regardless of their Covid vaccine status, into the pub.
“Jab or no jab, everyone is welcome at the Grand Hotel Healesville,” the update read.
The post received thousands of likes and comments, with some congratulating the pub for “being on the right side of history”.
“Good on you guys. It’s such a delight to see not all are discriminating those who chose not to have a jab. I'll absolutely be there to support your amazing business,” one Facebook user wrote.
“Thank you for supporting all and not creating division,” another user posted. You are going to be a very busy pub.”
But the post wasn’t received well by others.
“This is a pub I definitely won’t visit,” a user commented.
“Your choice mate, but here’s one little duck that won’t be stopping at your place, and I’m tipping you’ll change your mind by December,” another posted.
The pub followed up with another post that said it would not discriminate against anyone.
“We are not anti-vaxxers or non-covid believers. We believe in people making the right choice for them and we will not discriminate those, for whatever reason, who choose not to get the jab,” it posted.
“If, however, the law changes and it becomes mandatory to enter a business with a passport, then we will have no choice and will abide by the law.”
It comes after Premier Daniel Andrews highlighted tough new measures for the unvaccinated, who could be “locked out” of venues and events once the state reaches its targets for reopening.
The state has forecast most freedoms for the community will return once it reaches a 70-80 per cent vaccination target.
Mr Andrews said once the target was reached, the notion of a lockdown of the whole community would be rare.
“What will become a bigger part of our response is a lockout of many venues for those who are not vaccinated,” he said.
“I am not going to lock the whole state down to protect people who would not protect themselves. If you are not vaccinated ... the chances of you booking a ticket at a sporting event, going to a pub will be very limited.”
Victorian opposition leader Matthew Guy said national cabinet should set the rule for whether vaccines should be mandatory for people entering pubs.
“It would be very silly to have a different situation in South Australia to Tasmania to Victoria to NSW,” he said.
“I don’t oppose the concept of saying you need to be vaccinated.
“If we give people a reason and hope as to why they should do it, like New South Wales is, there may be more people who will hurry up and do it very quickly.”
Mr Guy dubbed the government’s plan to ease restrictions for regional Victorian business “completely unviable”, saying the opposition would release its plan to get hospitality back on its feet in coming days.
Speaking to ABC Melbourne following the attention, publican Lisa McKay said she made the decision to speak out after concern from customers worried they would not be allowed into her pub due to the restrictions.
“I had probably about five people come through the bottle shop that day that asked what we were going to do, whether we’re going to allow unvaccinated people into the pub,” she told ABC Radio Melbourne.
“It got me pretty upset thinking that people think that’s what’s going to happen.”
Ms McKay said she wanted to take a stand against discrimination based on someone’s vaccination status.
“I don’t see why we should be separated and not be able to have a beer together,” she said.
“I think that everybody should be welcome.”

Full text: Greater Sydney's speedy vaccine rollout and months of tough restrictions have helped save thousands of lives lives and almost half a million Covid infections.
New modelling from medical research organisation the Burnet Institute has shown the 11 week lockdown weathered by Greater Sydney and a strong spike in vaccination rates has prevented a tidal wave of Covid cases and deaths.
The modelling, released last night, revealed the Delta outbreak could have become so rampant in the 12 hotspot LGAs, more than 5000 people would have died and over 500,000 infections would have been recorded.
"In the 12 LGAs of concern, without any restrictions being introduced or additional Pfizer doses there would have been an estimated 589,817 and 5,808 cumulative diagnoses and deaths respectively over Jun-Dec 2021," a statement from Burnet read.
Researchers also projected the lockdown rules and the extra Pfizer doses from Poland had played their part.
"The restrictions combined with the original vaccine roll out have averted an estimated 488,020 infections and 4,830 deaths," Burnet's statement read.
"The additional 530,000 Pfizer doses are estimated to have averted an additional 24,267 diagnoses and 254 deaths."
But on a grimmer note, the modelling estimated that cases in the hotspot areas will peak next week with a seven-day average expectedof 1,297 to 1,967 cases.
And the figures don’t look positive for Greater Sydney overall with 1,219-2046 the expected seven-day average for next week, which will lead to a peak in hospital demand with between 2222 and almost 4000 people needing hospital care in the LGAs of concern.
Across greater Sydney the hospital demand is expected to hit a peak of between 2,280 and 4,016.

Full text: Families divided by strict border closures gathered on either side of a plastic barricade in Coolangatta, where the two states meet, for emotional reunions on Sunday.
People hugged and shared meals and gifts over the border barriers while police watched on.
But Ms Palaszczuk said the gatherings put people at risk and should not have happened while NSW residents are under strict stay-at-home orders.
“Queenslanders are free to go around. That’s because we have zero cases, and we don’t have those restrictions,” she told reporters on Tuesday.
“We look forward to a time when those border communities can actually come back together. Until that time, NSW has stay-at-home orders. But Queensland doesn’t.”
She said it was up to the NSW government to enforce stay-at-home orders on the NSW side of the border.
The Queensland government maintains that its hard border closure has prevented a large Covid-19 outbreak like that in NSW or Victoria.
Under the strict rules, no one can enter Queensland from NSW without an exemption while residents in the border zone can only cross for essential purposes.
There has been some disagreement between the two states over whether to move the border south of the Tweed River and temporarily incorporate a larger “border bubble” into Queensland.
The Berejiklian government has dismissed this idea.
Regional NSW is under stay-at-home orders until at least September 10, while Queensland is free of local lockdowns.
Queensland reported no new cases of Covid-19 on Tuesday, while NSW recorded another 1220 infections and eight deaths.

Full text: Including non-Covid cases, the ICU demand is expected to peak at 947 patients, state government modelling predicts.
That will have an “overwhelming” impact on ICU operations, the modelling says.
NED-4484-Hospitalisations-by-state
At this level, “demand for critical care services significantly exceeds organisation-wide capacity”.
Patients will be moved around, treated outside usual ICU areas, and there will be a higher number of patients per staff member.
Premier Gladys Berejiklian said the state has a “surge” capacity of 1550 staffed ICU beds.
Daily case numbers are predicted to peak at up to 2,000 per day in mid September.

Covid Qld: Premier Annastacia Palaszczuk’s stance ‘damaging public confidence’

Full text: But Chief Health Officer Dr Jeannette Young defended the Premier from political fire, arguing Queenslanders needed to “understand what the risks are”.
In a highly charged parliamentary performance, Ms Palaszczuk relied on a single graph and extrapolated worst-case scenario Doherty modelling that relied on a reopening model not being proposed by any jurisdiction to warn of the impending body count.
“Doherty Institute modelling predicts that even with 70 per cent of the population vaccinated, 80 people will die each day from COVID once the outbreak reaches six months after it started,” she said.
“That is 2,240 who will die each month.”
Pointing to the situation in NSW, she repeatedly promised to protect Queenslanders, and asked LNP members if they were “on Queensland’s side or are you on the other side?”
But claims of mass death and children being left vulnerable under the national plan were blasted as “false, misleading and wrong” during a press conference with federal Health Minister Greg Hunt and Chief Medical Officer Paul Kelly.
Federal authorities say the figures used represented what would happen with no restrictions in place, but that the national cabinet plan was for restrictions, quarantine and strong test, trace and isolate measures to remain in place at a 70 per cent vaccination rate.
NED-1859 State of our borders
Dr Young defended Ms Palaszczuk’s “responsible” comments that were repeated in a Tweet to 186,000 followers, telling reporters: “Our Premier has to make sure that our population in Queensland understands what the risks are.”
“They’re the figures, you can see them on the website,” she said.
“Well I believe it is (responsible),” she added.
“You’ve got to look at the extremes.
“If you look at the extremes you can then work out what you then need to do and that’s what modelling does for you.”
Mr Hunt disagreed it was responsible.
“She is selectively misusing the Doherty modelling, it breaches good faith and damages public confidence,” Mr Hunt said.
He said the Doherty Institute made it clear that “with optimal public health measures and no lockdowns this can be significantly reduced to 2787 infections and 13 deaths”.
Doherty Institute modelling shows if the country opened up at 70 per cent and the national plan was followed, the number of deaths in the first six months of an outbreak would be 12.
If there were no low level restrictions and test and trace measures were failing, in the worst case scenario deaths would be about 1456 in the first six months - lower than the Premier’s calculations.
NED-4142-Vaccine-Stats
Meanwhile, the Doherty Institute modelling specifically took into consideration children, Mr Hunt said following Ms Palaszczuk’s fears around the vulnerability of unvaccinated young children and calls for more modelled.
“The claim that children were not considered is false, wrong and inaccurate,” he said.
Queensland LNP Senator Matt Canavan said it was disgraceful for the Premier to use children as “blackmail” to justify harsh restrictions continuing.
Using a slang terms for an entitled person who makes unjustified demands, he said Ms Palaszczuk was “fast becoming ‘the Karen’ of the coronavirus pandemic for her heartless approach”.
Chief Medical Officer Paul Kelly declined to address the Premier’s claims directly, to avoid politicisation of his role, but he said people needed to learn to live with Covid.
“There will be people that die from Covid,” Dr Kelly said.
He said there would be additional analysis around the Doherty Institute’s modelling presented at national cabinet on Friday, “looking at what we’re actually seeing on the ground in NSW”.
“For example, starting at a base of cases,” he said.

Coronavirus: Annastacia Palaszczuk pushes for delta data on children, Gladys Berejiklian urges leaders to follow national plan

Full text: The Queensland Premier said she wanted a detailed paper about the effects of the delta strain on children younger than 12 “that I can read and share with my Cabinet and share with Queenslanders”.
Federal Health Minister Greg Hunt and chief medical officer Professor Paul Kelly responded by saying no vaccination program in the world had given jabs to children under 12.
NSW Premier Gladys Berejiklian on Thursday urged state and territory leaders to follow the national cabinet plan out of lockdowns, and said people needed to accept that “unfortunately, people will die”.
Ms Palaszczuk has declared border restrictions won’t lift until children have been vaccinated.
“This is a serious issue that needs a serious discussion,” she told parliament on Thursday morning. “These are questions that I want answers to. These are questions that Queenslanders want answers to.
“So rather than everyone attacking, let’s get the answers and let’s have serious discussions.”
Ms Palaszczuk said: “If NSW is the model of what lies in store for all of us, then serious discussions are needed. Doherty Institute modelling predicts, even with 70% of the population vaccinated, 80 people will die each day six months after the outbreak. That’s 2240 who will die each month.
“I sympathise with people interstate enduring months of lockdown, but my job is to protect Queenslanders. That’s what we’ve done since the start of the pandemic and we will continue to do. That’s why I’m calling to see detailed modelling so we can give Queenslanders answers.”
Berejiklian calls on leaders to accept national plan
NSW Premier Gladys Berejiklian on Thursday urged state and territory leaders to accept the Doherty report and national cabinet’s pandemic plan, saying people need to accept “unfortunately people will die”.
“NSW has six to 800 people who die of the flu every year. If you extrapolate that across the nation … that is nearly 2500 people across the nation who die of the flu every year,” Ms Berejiklian said.
“Now, I know this is a very difficult conversation to have. This is what will get us through, this is the light at the end of the tunnel, accepting Covid is part of our lives, accepting that unfortunately people will die, but they will be less likely to die if everybody is vaccinated.”
NSW Premier Gladys Berejiklian says living with COVID is a reality, not an option, and any state premier who says otherwise is not in the "real world". The remarks come amid Thursday's COVID media conference. "We have to accept living with COVID is a reality, not an option," she said. "And any state premier who thinks it's an option, unfortunately, is not considering what the real world experience is. "All Australians have to accept that living with COVID is the future, not an option."
Health Minister rubbishes under-12s vaccine plan
Health Minister Greg Hunt said no vaccination program in the world had given jabs to children under 12.
“The entire national plan is about protecting all Australians. But it is predicated on protecting children,” he said in Canberra.
“There have been comments about vaccinating children under 12. There have been no vaccinations for children under 12 that have been approved and no national programs. of which we are aware, that have commenced (such vaccinations anywhere in the world.
“Following that health advice is absolutely fundamental.”
He accused Queensland Premier Annastacia Palaszczuk of “profound moral failure” in not allowing children without their parents and cancer patients to cross the border.
Mr Hunt blasted the Queensland Labor leader for “misusing” Doherty Institute data to claim more than 2000 people a month will die once the nation opens up under the current national plan.
He said it was morally wrong that the child and others – such as cancer patients – cannot enter Queensland like players and families connected to the NRL finals can.
“We know that league players and partners have been allowed in Queensland. The fact that beautiful young children, and patients with cancer are being denied entry, reuniting with their families, or being treated, is I think a profound moral failure,” he said.
“Misusing the Doherty Institute data breaches good faith and damages public confidence.”
Queensland and Western Australia are casting doubt on whether they will follow the national COVID-19 roadmap – and open borders. Premier Annastacia Palaszczuk is proposing restrictions will remain until children have received the vaccine. She is also suggesting the state's health system will collapse if COVID-19 is allowed back in the state. Western Australia's premier is also echoing the same message – warning borders could be closed to New South Wales and Victoria for months. Mark McGowan is accusing the federal government of trying to 'infect the public' by pressuring states to lift restrictions.
Labor MP calls for ‘full briefing’
Queensland Labor frontbencher Mark Bailey said the state government wanted to be “fully briefed” on how the delta variant affects young children despite receiving advice less than a month ago.
Advice published by Queensland Health on August 5 says “the vast majority of children with the Delta variant continue to experience a mild infection”.
Queensland Health advises about 10 per cent of babies “appear to need admission to hospital to receive oxygen, in a similar way to other winter viruses”.
“These are important and serious infections, but these babies almost all recover without needing support from intensive care. This is very different to the experience in the elderly, particularly those with existing health problems,” the advice reads.
But Mr Bailey, the state’s transport minister, said the advice was more than a month old and now 330 children were being admitted to hospitals in the United States each day with Delta.
“Well, a lot has happened in the past four weeks, you know 10,500 people have died from delta in the last week in the US.
“Let’s take the most recent information into account when it comes to making these decisions
“Let’s get real about this, this delta variant is the worst to date and that is what we are responding to and the safety of our kids is something every premier and every leader should be concerned about.”
Mr Bailey said the state had to “keep Covid out of Queensland until we get our vaccination rates up to a high level”, but could not quantify what that threshold would be.
“At the moment we are seeing a lot of the new [vaccine] supply go to NSW because they have botched it down there, they didn’t go hard and early like they should have.”

Full text: Ms Palaszczuk yesterday appealed to parents, grandparents, aunts and uncles as she declared the fate of children was “the most serious issue that our country will face” and opening up would be exposing the most vulnerable.
After committing to a National Cabinet plan to relax restrictions last month, the Premier said she now needed extra Doherty Institute modelling to show how children would fare before she could tell Queenslanders what life would look like when vaccination rates reached 80 per cent.
“Unless there is an answer on how these young people are going to be vaccinated, you are putting the most vulnerable population at risk,” she said.
“So anyone who has grandchildren, or young children, or nephews or nieces know how that plays on people’s minds.”
She added: “What’s going to happen to the children?”
Queensland LNP Senator Matt Canavan said it was disgraceful for the Premier to use children as “blackmail” to justify harsh restrictions continuing.
“Annastacia Palaszczuk is fast becoming ‘the Karen’ of the coronavirus pandemic for her heartless approach,” he said.
The term ‘Karen’ is a slang term for an entitled person making demands beyond what is considered normal, often associated with someone who “demands to speak to the manager”.

Her comments were also questioned by health experts, who said keeping borders shut to protect children was not sensible.
Veteran paediatrician and vaccine expert Professor Robert Booy, who is also a member of the national Immunisation Coalition, said Ms Palaszczuk needed to use common sense in her decision, as children were not at high risk.
Prof Booy, who described himself as a “devout Queenslander”, said he was appalled by the Premier’s stance.
“I have been a paediatrician and have worked in the promotion of vaccinations for decades,” Prof Booy said.
“If I thought young children needed urgent vaccination, I would say so.
“Keeping borders shut because of the children is not a sensible measure.”
He said young children would not be vaccinated until next year, and Ms Palaszczuk did not need to wait for new modelling.
“We know from international data around the world that unless they have existing chronic conditions they are not at high risk,” he said.
Murdoch Children’s Research Institute paediatrician Professor Fiona Russell said children exhibited similar flu-like symptoms to adults but few had become seriously ill, even with the Delta strain.
“What we do know is that Covid in kids is nothing like what occurs in adults,” she said.
Opposition Leader David Crisafulli last night called on Ms Palaszczuk to back her concerns with evidence as the business community again cried out for some certainty to be able to plan.
“If the Premier is now walking away from the national agreement that she signed up to based on the Doherty modelling then she needs to release the health advice driving that new direction and release to Queenslanders what her new plan is,” he said.
National – 2021 – Covid Vaccination Stats
That modelling shows an estimated 25 children under 16 would die over 6 months, 93 would need ICU and 135,408 would become infected should restrictions ease when 80 per cent of adults are vaccinated and measures like contact tracing and quarantine were only partially working.
But if control measures were working well, no child aged under 16 would die from Covid-19, one would need the ICU and 687 would become infected.
Federal Health Minister Greg Hunt said the Doherty Institute modelling specifically took into consideration children.
“The claim that children were not considered is false, wrong and inaccurate,” he said.
He said the Premier was being irresponsible in claiming 2240 people would die a month under the Doherty modelling.
“She is selectively misusing the Doherty modelling, it breaches good faith and damages public confidence,” Mr Hunt said.
“There was a very selective misuse of the Doherty report which undermines public confidence.”
He said the Doherty Institute made it clear that “with optimal public health measures and no lockdowns this can be significantly reduced to 2787 infections and 13 deaths’’.

Mr Hunt also said locking children out of the state through its strict border measures, like three-year-old Memphis, was a “profound moral failure”.
Chief Medical Officer Paul Kelly declined to address the Premier’s claims directly, to avoid politicisation of his role, but he said people needed to learn to live with Covid.
“There will be people that die from Covid,” Dr Kelly said.
“We need to start recognising that’s the case, particularly in unvaccinated people.”
Paul Kelly said data from the NSW, Victoria and the ACT showed 3815 children under 12 had contracted the Delta strain of Covid since January.
Of those 134 were hospitalised, most of those were for social reasons not medical reasons, just three had been admitted to intensive care and none had died.
Treasurer Josh Frydenberg said it would be “ludicrous” if the rest of Australia was able to “travel to Canada before Cairns” and if Ms Palaszczuk didn’t stick to the national plan, “businesses will close … jobs will be lost”.
“It is not realistic that you can keep your borders closed indefinitely,” he said.
Home Affairs Minister Karen Andrews slammed Ms Palaszczuk for using “every available opportunity” to shut the state down, for “scaremongering” and for recent statements that have “quite frankly not made a lot of sense”.
“The Queensland Premier is quite clearly doubling down on her ‘let’s keep Queensland closed’ (rhetoric) and the Federal Government is of the view that Queensland should be open,” she said.”
Deputy Premier Steven Miles said Ms Palaszczuk’s comments did not necessarily mean children would have to be vaccinated before Queensland opened up and lockdowns ended.
But he cautioned that if restrictions were lifted once adults were vaccinated “then the only place for the virus to move around rapidly would be among children”, the unvaccinated and the vulnerable.
“As this virus has changed, the susceptibility of children to catching it and to get sick by it has changed and we want to see consideration of what this means for young people,” he said.
Palaszczuk tweet
Meanwhile, Queensland Health’s advice to parents is that international data consistently shows the lowest rates of the virus in children.
“Preschool and primary school age children in particular appear less likely to acquire the infection and make up less than 5 per cent of reported cases in Australia and elsewhere,” the document says.
“Importantly, the published data also suggests that children tend to have less severe cases of Covid-19 than adults,” Children’s Health Queensland Director of Infectious Diseases Julia Clark said in the advice.
“In most cases the virus causes mild or moderate symptoms, which can include fever and cough, but also milder cases of pneumonia sometimes requiring hospitalisation.”
“Severe complications in children are uncommon,” Dr Clark adds.
It says infants were at an increased risk of developing severe cases compared to young children, but the rate was comparable to adolescents.
“Approximately 10 per cent of babies appear to need admission to hospital to receive oxygen, in a similar way to other winter viruses,” it says.
“These are important and serious infections, but these babies almost all recover without needing support from intensive care.
“This is very different to the experience in the elderly, particularly those with existing health problems.”

Full text: Hundreds of people descended on Elwood Beach on Thursday after temperatures hit 27 degrees, with many beachgoers maskless and drinking alcohol in breach of lockdown restrictions.
Groups were seen drinking alcohol on the sand, and dancing to music blasting from portable speakers.
Many beachgoers also disregarded other health restrictions, with people spotted on the beach not wearing masks as they soaked up the sun.
Many beachgoers also disregarded other health restrictions, with many spotted on the beach without masks as they soaked up the warm weather.
Others took a late afternoon dip while a fire twirler was seen performing for crowds on the sand.
People were spotted having picnics at the park nearby, while others watched the sunset at Point Ormond Lookout.
There was a very minor police presence at the beach, despite the large crowds.
Two police officers were seen sitting on their vehicle observing the crowds, but did not appear to enforce restrictions.
It was a different story in St Kilda, where police took a harder line against people who were flouting the rules.
One man copped a fine for not wearing a mask as he walked past six officers on the foreshore.
Asked why he wasn’t wearing a mask, the man said he didn’t need to wear one because he was exercising.
But when officers disputed his exercise claim, the man said that he didn’t have his mask because he “left it in the car”.
It comes as Victoria recorded a new spike in coronavirus infections, with 176 cases recorded in the past 24 hours.
Ninety-three of the latest cases are unlinked to existing outbreaks.
The total number of active cases in Victoria is now 1029.
It comes on a day where 48,372 people turned out for testing, while 33,720 vaccine doses were administered.
There are now 61 people in hospital with coronavirus in Victoria, 20 are in intensive care with 13 on a ventilator.
Sixty-seven of the new cases were in the western suburbs, 67 were in the northern suburbs, 22 in east and south of Melbourne, 13 in Shepparton, one in Geelong and three are under investigation.
SURGE IN MENTAL HEALTH ISSUES IN KIDS Meanwhile, the number of children and adolescents presenting to the Royal Children’s Hospital emergency department has surged between 30 and 80 per cent compared to the previous year, the hospital’s mental health director Ric Haslam said.
Dr Haslam said a range of things were behind this and some young people had few supports and were more vulnerable.
“There’s a sort of a tidal increase of demoralisation and anxiety, of worry, of irritability and frustration,” he said.
“All these things I think we can all sort of experience and recognise.
“We also have to remember that these are very common conditions, particularly in adolescence.”
Chief Psychiatrist Dr Neil Coventry said the suicide rate had not increased in the way authorities predicted. “That doesn’t mean we need to be complacent,” he said.
TESTING RULES TIGHTEN FOR WORKERS Victoria has tightened its testing obligations for workers travelling in and out of extreme risk zones in New South Wales.
Anyone who is now entering Victoria on a Specified Worker Permit will need to be tested within 72 hours of entering the state, and on days 6,7 or 8 after entry.
Health officials have also flagged that The Specified Worker List will also be reduced.
Those who can currently apply for the permit are people who perform specified work that is: urgent, essential to the operations of their employer or customer, which can’t be done in a timely way by workers already in Victoria.
The changes will come into effect from 6pm tomorrow.
BIG CHANGE TO ASTRAZENECA WAIT TIME The space between the first and second doses of AstraZeneca jabs in Victoria will be halved from 12 to six weeks.
The revised wait times will be effective immediately.
“This change and the additional supply of the Pfizer vaccine from the Commonwealth when it arrives from Victoria will help us to reach our vaccination targets faster,” Health department official Ben Cowie said.
Although Pfizer bookings are limited right now, there are still more than 52,000 available AstraZeneca appointments in the next two weeks.
Mr Foley said the widespread areas which contain cases are part of a “growing set of concerns” in eastern and southern suburbs.
WA DECLARES VICTORIA ‘HIGH RISK’ Victoria will be declared a “high risk” jurisdiction by Western Australia from Monday – after the state recorded its most coronavirus cases in a year.
Under WA’s “high risk” setting, anyone entering the state must apply for an exemption, have had at least one dose of a COVID-19 vaccine, and have received a negative test 72 hours prior to their departure.
The exemption list is limited to government officials, military personnel, transport and logistics operators, and anyone who is approved by an authorised officer.
Approved travellers will also be subject to a two weeks of self-quarantine at a suitable premises – and be required to get tested on day two and 12 of their stay.
CALL CENTRE, BACKPACKER FEARS Mr Foley highlighted two locations that emerged overnight as concerning to authorities.
Acquire call centre operations, which runs four sites, is co-located with Health Care Australia.
There are now 17 cases linked to the call centre and through that, about 400 primary close contacts have been identified.
Contact tracing is under way.
The second venue authorities are concerned about is the Base Backpackers in St Kilda, where one case has been identified.
The case has moved to hotel quarantine, but Mr Foley said authorities were working to establish a public health response to ensure residents were properly quarantined.
GRIM PREDICTION FOR IMPENDING PEAK University of Melbourne epidemiologist Professor Tony Blakely warned Victorian case numbers could hit 2000 a day in October.
“The case numbers are going up at about 5 per cent per day,” Prof Blakely said.
He said if infections continue on this trajectory, Victoria “will probably have 2000 cases a day in late October or early November when the vaccine coverage catches up”.
Melburnians are set to be locked down until the end of October, notching up a dire world record for the number of days spent under harsh stay-at-home laws.
The city will spend its 235th day in lockdown on September 23, when 70 per cent of Victorians are tipped to have had their first jab and restrictions will be eased slightly.
Buenos Aires in Argentina is now out of lockdown, but is the current record holder on 234 days.
Daniel Andrews grimly confirmed on Wednesday lockdown would continue “in some form” until the end of October when the state reaches nationally-agreed vaccination targets to end widespread lockdowns.
Vic Locally-acquired Covid-19
In a major shift in Victoria’s pandemic policy, the Premier conceded the goal of the lockdown was no longer to drive case numbers down but to stop them rising rapidly.
The state recorded 120 new infections on Wednesday – the highest daily figure in more than a year – amid warnings more undetected cases were circulating in the community.
“What we are aiming for has changed,” Mr Andrews said. “We were aiming to drive it down and have cases falling. It is now the advice of the experts that is not possible, so now we have to contain the growth of cases and the speed at which they increase.”
He said case numbers would no longer affect restrictions, with the focus now on “buying time” until more people got the jab.
“It is simply not possible to make wholesale changes, to have our ‘freedom day’ … or an opening up day in metropolitan Melbourne in the next few weeks,” he said.
“That is the difficult, but unavoidable position that we find ourselves in. We’ve got to buy time to allow vaccinations to be undertaken.”
When 70 per cent of Victorians aged over 15 have had their first dose – a milestone NSW will hit today, but Victoria won’t reach until about September 23 – the 5km travel limit will expand to 10km and the two-hour daily exercise cap will increase to three.
Construction sites will also increase to 50 per cent worker capacity, if 90 per cent on site have had at least one jab.
But regional Victoria – except Shepparton where there is an outbreak – may come out of lockdown from next week.
The only immediate ­reprieve for lockdown-weary Victorians is the reopening of playgrounds from Friday, but QR codes must be used and food and drink are banned.
In-home care will also be extended to school-aged children if both parents are essential workers.
Schools in metropolitan Melbourne will remain closed for the remainder of term 3, with a “detailed plan” for term 4 to be unveiled from next week.
“I want to take small steps forward and not have to take a step back,” Mr Andrews said.
Josh Frydenberg said the plan to ease some restrictions at the 70 per cent first dose vaccination target was a “positive step forward”, and backed Victoria’s acknowledgment that “eliminating the Delta variant is an impossibility”.
“No country has done it, and based on the best medical advice we have, we can’t do it,” the federal Treasurer said.
On Thursday, Mr Frydenberg added that he was pleased Mr Andrews had recognised the virus could not be eliminated, but that the Premier needed to provide a “road map out” of lockdowns.
Lockdown calendar
He said restrictions needed to be eased over coming weeks “in a Covid-safe way”.
“It’s enormously critical that people have hope,” the federal Treasurer told 3AW.
“We need to learn to live with the virus.”
He said the federal government would continue to help Victorian businesses deal with the “devastating” impact of the extended lockdown.
Mr Frydenberg also warned the state government should have “no expectation” of ongoing financial aid if it did not open up Victoria once 70 per cent of eligible adults were fully vaccinated.
But the state opposition slammed the road map as yet another “kick in the guts” to law-abiding Victorians.
“This is a betrayal of every Victorian,” Opposition Leader Michael O’Brien said.
“This was supposed to be D-Day. Well D stands for devastation. D stands for despair. Victorians expected some return for their sacrifice. They expected some hope. They want some light at the end of the tunnel, not an oncoming train.”NED-4486-Vic-roadmap
The state government indicated further financial business support would be provided in coming days.
But Small Business Australia executive director Bill Lang said the emotional and mental health of thousands of small businesses had been “hammered by a government with only one tool in the shed”.
“This is a government of zero account, who have closed parliament, closed debate and refuse to release the heath advice that puts the mental health of adults and children second to their Covid response,” Mr Lang said.
The Ai Group warned many businesses “will not come out of this lockdown intact or at all”.
Victorian Chamber of Commerce and Industry chief executive Paul Guerra said his members were pleading for a clear road map but instead got “a plan to have a plan”.
“We are on a Covid-19 treadmill and it’s time we got off,” he said.
Australian Retailers Association chief executive Paul Zahra said while the lockdown extension was “no surprise”, businesses needed to be able to safely reopen once vaccination targets were met.
“Lockdowns are decimating small businesses and are taking significant toll on peoples’ financial, emotional and mental health which is clearly not sustainable,” he said.
Despite the worsening mental health toll caused by heavy restrictions, the Premier admitted Victoria’s chief psychiatrist, Neil Coventry, did not sit in on crisis meetings on Tuesday night.
“Not everybody who helped Brett form his advice was on the call to convey the advice to me and my colleagues … That’d be a rather big Zoom (call),” he said.
Chief health officer Professor Brett Sutton defended the current restrictions as more important than ever.
It comes as Burnett ­Institute modelling suggested the measures taken over the last month had predicted to have prevented about 6000 cases. “We’ve got a plan to ease restrictions, but we do need to bend the curve,” Prof Sutton said.
NSW HITS NEW GRIM CASE PEAK New South Wales has recorded 1288 new locally acquired cases of Covid-19, premier Gladys Berejiklian has revealed.
There were seven deaths, Ms Berejiklian added, but ominously she reiterated that October would be even worse for infections and deaths.

National – 2021 – Covid Vaccination Stats
REAL CASES DWARF OFFICIAL STATISTICS Symptomatic Victorians with Covid are failing to come forward for testing, as authorities reveal true infection numbers are likely a third higher than official figures.
Health authorities on Wednesday renewed calls for people to get tested at the first sign of any symptoms, detailing how just 40 per cent of symptomatic people were getting tested.
Chief health officer Brett Sutton said there could be up to a third more cases than official figures show.
“Of course we can’t know what we don’t know, but I think it’s safe to assume that its maybe an additional third (of) true cases that are not yet identified,” Prof Sutton said.
It comes as Victoria recorded its highest daily case number in more than a year, a day after reporting its first fatalities since October 18 last year.
Of Wednesday’s 120 new cases, 64 were linked to known outbreaks, with 56 “mystery” infections under investigation.
Seven of the cases were detected in regional Victoria, including five in Shepparton, one in Seymour and one in Geelong, while 107 were linked to suburbs in Melbourne’s north and west.
The state’s total number of active cases reached 900, with 58 Victorians in hospital with the virus, including 21 in ICU and 14 on ventilators.

SCREAMS BEFORE VICTIM FOUND Neighbours of a Melbourne woman who died from the coronavirus in her northern suburbs home say they are “gutted” about the suburban tragedy.
Authorities have confirmed the Covid victim, aged 49, died in her Northcote home on Tuesday.
Her death was the first recorded Covid fatality recorded in Victoria in 2021.
Northcote resident Sandy Young, who lives across the road from the family, said locals called triple-0 about 2am on Tuesday following frantic screams.

REPRIEVE FOR PLAYGROUNDS Playgrounds with QR codes will reopen to children under 12 tomorrow – but parents have been told they must obey coronavirus precautions.
Chief health officer Brett Sutton on Wednesday announced young families would get a reprieve from the controversial closures, put in place when restrictions were ramped up mid-last month. But stricter rules will be put in place, with outdoor playgrounds only opened to children aged under 12.
They can be supervised by just one parent or carer, who will be required to check in through QR codes and cannot take their mask off to eat or drink.
The move comes after the Herald Sun on Tuesday that revealed medical experts believed they were unlikely places for coronavirus transmission and could be reopened safely.
Prof Sutton used one “potential” case of transmission between two children at a playground as partial justification for introducing the ban.
But on Wednesday he said his advice to shut playgrounds had come because adults were using it as a loophole to meet across households. He said authorities had “suspicions about transmissions maybe occurring in playgrounds”.
BUSINESS LEADERS REACT TO EXTENDED LOCKDOWN
MANY LOSE SPORTING CHANCE Community sports are reeling, with many seasons on a knife-edge or cancelled.
Time is running out for both indoor and outdoor adult and junior sports such as basketball, soccer, gymnastics and netball to resume before the end of the season, with the current restrictions to run until at least September 23.
Sporting associations broke the news to members online on Wednesday.
Basketball Victoria chief Nick Honey announced its VJBL, Big V and NBL1 South seasons were being cancelled, with under-12 skills days and camps postponed.
Football Victoria said a decision would be made on the rest of the soccer season as soon as possible.
Gymnastics Victoria implored members to get the jab, as the only way out of lockdown.
Netball Victoria took to Twitter to encourage their members to reach out to teammates. “First and foremost check in on your teammates and those that you’re missing seeing on and around the court,” the tweet read.

Leaders still at odds on Covid-19 vaccine threshold

Full text: Prime Minister Scott Morrison, Opposition Leader Anthony ­Albanese and premiers have spent the past week battling over their differing interpretations of the national plan to ­reopen and the Doherty Institute epidemiological modelling that underpins its recommended vaccine thresholds.
Mr Albanese has backed West Australian Premier Mark McGowan’s insistence that he is free to close borders at an 80 per cent vaccination rate, with the national plan failing to provide explicit guidance on state ­borders.
State and territory leaders have questioned whether the plan is out-of-date because the Doherty modelling was done ­before NSW recorded more than 1000 cases a day.
While the Doherty Institute has said the difference between minimal cases and hundreds of cases does not shift its current vaccine thresholds, it does provide scenarios where testing, tracing, quarantine and isolations (TTIQ) of cases are not “optimal”.
There have been concerns the current outbreaks could swamp testing and tracing in NSW and Victoria, and health systems in untouched areas such as Perth would struggle to cope with the Delta variant.
Under an only partially effective testing and tracing regime, Australia would experience 227,702 Covid-19 symptomatic infections and 761 deaths in the first 180 days of opening under an 80 per cent adult vaccination rate.
On the other hand, the nation would record only 1149 Covid-19 cases and six deaths in those same 180 days with the same vaccination rate if better testing, tracing and isolating efforts were put in place.
If the nation were to start opening at a 70 per cent vaccination rate – currently the threshold to move into phase B of the national plan – with only a partial TTIQ regime, Australia would suffer more than 300,000 cases and 1457 deaths in the first 180 days.
Even with an optimal TTIQ system in the states and territories, the Doherty modelling projects more than 2000 cases and 18 deaths when opening at a 70 per cent vaccination rate.
Premiers and chief ministers have been moving away from the 70 per cent vaccination rate in the past days, and ACT Chief Minister Andrew Barr said the phase B threshold was not safe.
“There’s all this commentary from people who obviously haven’t read the national plan,” Mr Barr said on Monday.
“Let’s stop talking about 70 because it’s not safe at 70 … there’s this glossing over in the debate of 70 to 80, but 80 is the more realistic step.”
The national plan says in phase C that vaccinated Australians should be exempt from all domestic restrictions and there should be minimal baseline ­restrictions.
In the Doherty modelling, baseline restrictions are defined – based on past use in the pandemic – as allowing interstate travel.
But the national plan, even in the final phase, makes mention only of international borders and not state borders.

Full text: A Covid-19 case has been detected in two wards of Dandenong Hospital, forcing staff and patients to get tested and isolate until a negative result is received.
The Children’s Ward and North Ward 1 were identified as Tier 2 sites from August 25-27.
An infected case attended between 10.18am on Wednesday August 25 and 11.11am on Friday August 27, including all of Thursday August 26.
Other new sites have been identified in Glen Waverley, the CBD, Altona North, Campbellfield, Ringwood, Chirnside Park, Chadstone and Shepparton.
There are now 900 venues on the exposure site list.
It comes as 73 new cases emerged in Victoria overnight, including 21 mystery infections. At least 24 of the latest cases were in isolation during their infectious period, and the state’s crippling sixth lockdown has been extended with no end date in sight.
Meanwhile, Australia has hit two tragic milestones after the first Indigenous death from Covid-19 was reported on Monday.
A man in his 50s is understood to be the nation’s first Indigenous person to die of Covid-19, as the number of deaths caused by the pandemic surpasses 1000 across Australia.
NSW also recorded yet another record daily increase, with 1290 new local Covid cases emerging overnight.NED-3869-Covid-19-Exposure-Sites-Victoria
ICU NURSE REVEALS COVID TOLL A senior nurse says her team, which has helped prevent hundreds of admissions to intensive care, are bracing for an overwhelming surge of admissions unless vaccination rates pick up.
Kylie Fisher, who works in the critical care liaison team in Western Health, on Monday painted a harrowing picture of the ward nurses who came to her “overwhelmed, in tears, bloody and worried” last year.
“I saw tears, I saw exhaustion, I saw nurses consoling nurses,” she said.
“I saw blood across the ridges of their noses and ears from wearing PPE for 12 hours at a time.
“Long shifts on their feet, kilometres and kilometres they clock up … They would come to me and say ‘it’s like nothing we have ever seen before’.
“I’m worried I’m going to have to ask them to stand up and do it again. And they will. But they shouldn’t have to.”
Ms Fisher said getting vaccinated will not only ease the workload on ICU staff, but would keep individuals, families and whole communities safe.
Of the 805 active cases in Victoria at the moment, 15 people are in intensive care, 11 of whom are on ventilators.
Ms Fisher said the high transmissibility of Delta meant she had serious fears the state’s ICU’s would become more overwhelmed.
“Last year we managed a large portion of our acutely unwell patients within the ward setting. But I’m worried that being more contagious, our ICU beds will quickly be utilised and we’ll struggle to meet the demand of … the community,” she said.
“I know that we’re confident that we’ll be able to serve our community and make beds available, but we don’t know what type of numbers we’re looking at.”
She said she understood how difficult lockdown was for the community, but patients with Delta were entering the ICU and being placed on ventilators at a faster rate than last year’s outbreaks.
“This year, I’m seeing admissions straight to the ICUs,” she said.
“Please get vaccinated. It’s the best way to keep yourself, your community, your loved ones safe and to make sure our healthcare workers aren’t overwhelmed and they can support patients when they do need our help.”
HOW VICTORIAN OUTBREAK IS STABILISING Health authorities have revealed how Victoria’s outbreak is “stabilising”, compared to how the NSW outbreak took off last month.
Victoria has recorded more than 50 local cases on nine of the past 11 days, but chief health officer Brett Sutton said the state’s number of cumulative days with 50 cases or more was “relatively flat compared to how it took off in NSW” in July.
But Prof Sutton acknowledged that Victoria was still in a very challenging position.
“We are hoping to see a trend, and maybe it’s stabilising over the last few days,” he said.
“With numbers not increasing exponentially, we are in a much better position than we may have been with exponential growth at the beginning of the outbreak.”
Prof Sutton said the stabilising numbers were a credit to Victorians following the rules and the work of contact tracers.
Mr Foley said the government hoped the outbreak had plateaued.
“There’s every indication the measures are starting to kick in,” he said.
PFIZER SUPPLIES RUN DRY FOR FIRST JABS Health Minister Martin Foley revealed that Pfizer allocations were exhausted at vaccine hubs after bookings were opened to under-40s at 7am last Monday, but said people “shouldn’t give up”.
“There are currently no Pfizer bookings available right now for first doses in that system; don’t give up because as more becomes available from the commonwealth we will put more systems in place … if we get the supply, we can get people vaccinated,” he said.
The sought-after vaccine will be available for under-40s at GPs and pharmacists from Monday, with Mr Foley urging Victorians to book in.
“Today is the day that both GPs and pharmacies will begin to open up for Victorians at 16 and above for Pfizer. That is under the rollout,” he said.
“Please, if you can’t land one today through the state-run clinics, come back and look again tomorrow or in coming days, but perhaps, even more importantly, go and inquire through the GP network or the community pharmacy network to get access to that.
“Of course, the fantastically effective AstraZeneca vaccine continues to be available at state centres and at GPs and continues to be the ATAGI-endorsed vaccine, especially for the over-60s.
“Please come forward and get the best vaccination that is available for you and the best one that is available for you is the one available today.”
Government-run clinics administered 26,702 vaccine doses, with the close to recording a major vaccination milestone.
Within the next 24 hours, a total of five million jabs will have been put in Victorians’ arms.
Vic Locally-acquired Covid-19
WHERE LATEST CASES ARE LOCATED There are 805 active cases in Victoria, including five in hotel quarantine.
Of the new infections:
• Twenty-one are mystery cases
• Nine are linked to the Shepparton outbreak
• Five are linked to the MyCentre childcare, Broadmeadows
• Five are linked to Al-Taqwa College
• Three are linked to City of Hobsons Bay
• Two to Glenroy West primary
• Two to Sunshine Hospital emergency department (household contacts)
• Two to Hoppers Crossing Chemist Warehouse
• One linked to The Royal Melbourne Hospital
• One to St Kilda East
• One to Barkly Square, Brunswick
• One to CS Square, Caroline Springs
• Twenty linked to existing cases — originally with no known acquisition source
Chief health officer Brett Sutton said the starkest difference to the 2020 outbreaks was the considerable number of young people infected.
Of the 805 active cases in Victoria, 170 are in children aged zero to nine, and 124 are aged 10 to 19.
People aged in their 20s make up 167 of the cases, and 150 cases are aged 30 to 39.
“To have fewer than a quarter of cases over 40 years of age, that’s the effect of vaccination, that’s telling a positive story,” Prof Sutton said.
MEMORIAL SERVICE FOR EASTERN FREEWAY VICTIMS POSTPONED The State Memorial Service to honour the FOUR police officers killed in the Eastern Freeway tragedy has been postponed due to coronavirus restrictions.
Leading Senior Constable Lynette Taylor, Senior Constable Kevin King, Constable Josh Prestney and Constable Glen Humphris were killed after they were struck by a truck on the Eastern Freeway in April last year.
The truck’s driver, Mohinder Singh, was high on a cocktail of drugs when he veered into an emergency lane of the freeway and crashed into the officers and their stationary vehicles.
The Cranbourne truckie was sentenced to 22-years in prison over the crash, which was the greatest single-incident loss of life in Victoria Police’s history.
A State Memorial Service was scheduled for 29 September next month to remember the officers and mark National Police Remembrance Day.
The service had previously been postponed due to COVID-19.
In a statement, the Department of Premier and Cabinet said it was currently in discussion with the victim’s families and is considering a new date.
It said the new date will be announced as soon as it is available.
PARENTS CALL OUT SHAMBOLIC VACCINE ROLLOUT Parents’ lobby group #VCEWhatsThePlanDan, is calling for urgent priority vaccination queues for year 11 and 12 students.
They also want out-of-hours vaccination sites for students and more access to GP clinics given that some doctors are only offering vaccines to existing patients.
Despite a commitment from the Premier Daniel Andrews, priority access to vaccination for VCE students is still not available and students are either not able to make bookings, or are spending up to seven hours in lines at walk-in hubs.
Read the full story here.
PLEAS FOR ROAD MAP FROM LOCKDOWN Daniel Andrews on Sunday said lockdown wouldn’t end on Thursday as had been planned but refused to say how low the case numbers would need to be for restrictions to be eased, sparking fears stay-at-home orders could drag on until mid-November, when Victoria is due to reach 80 per cent full vaccination.
Melbourne has now spent 211 days in hard lockdown and the August week-long “circuit breaker” is now in its 26th day.
With 92 new Covid cases recorded on Sunday, Mr Andrews said: “We still have too many cases that are in the community for too long for us to be able to open up.
“We acted early but I’m not here to tell people this is easy, it’s not, it’s bloody hard”.
But the opposition said the state was being held “hostage” to a zero-case strategy, and the mental health harm caused by lockdown was now at alarming levels.
Victorian Chamber of Commerce and Industry chief executive Paul Guerra said businesses were in crisis and a road map out of lockdown that was “realistic and full of hope” was essential.
He said this could include reopening municipalities that were Covid-free, 24-hour vaccination hubs and kids back at school when vaccination rates hit 60 per cent.
“This lockdown is six and out for many, but for those that make it through, we need a plan,” Mr Guerra said.
“The state needs to articulate a reopening plan based on national cabinet’s road map and Doherty Institute modelling.”
Mr Guerra said the path out needed to be detailed and even more ambitious than the state’s road map to recovery after the second wave.
“We are on track to have 70 per cent of people with their first jab in mid-October,” Mr Guerra said. “Why don’t we be bold and declare that from Caulfield Cup day and beyond, crowds at race days can be at 50 per cent.”
The Herald Sun believes that Mr Andrews expressed strong support for the national reopening plan during a phone call with Prime Minister Scott Morrison on Saturday.
Mr Andrews said he would make an announcement this week on any changes to restrictions, after receiving advice from the chief health officer.
But when asked how low cases would need to be to ease the current rules, he would only say “as low as we can get them”.
Unlike NSW, the Premier has not announced a plan for returning children to school.
State Opposition Leader Michael O’Brien said it was not feasible for the Premier to keep chasing zero cases.
“It is basically holding the whole of Victoria hostage to something which is practically unachievable, and is doing more damage in the meantime,” Mr O’Brien said.
“The amount of mental health harm, the amount of suicide attempts and certainly the number of suicides is going up because of these lockdowns.”
Federal Treasurer Josh Frydenberg previously said another $700m a week would be wiped from the balance sheet, as the engine room of the state’s economy struggled to stay afloat.
“Small businesses are just hanging on right now, they need hope,” he said on Sunday.
“They need to know that the plan agreed at national cabinet will be implemented, so they can plan.”
Mr Frydenberg said he had a good working relationship with his Victorian counterpart, and together they had provided more than $2bn in economic support this lockdown. However, a school holiday cash splash that tourism operators rely on remains in jeopardy.
If Greater Melbourne and NSW remain in lockdown, a whopping $1.9bn is estimated to be lost over the fortnight from September 18.
Victorian Tourism Industry Council chief executive Felicia Mariani said a road map and a significant step-change to business support measures was required, if they were to survive this latest setback.
“These current grant programs, however, are sadly not going to save businesses from closures that now seem imminent,” Ms Mariani said.
“Businesses in the visitor economy right across the state are struggling under the weight of this latest lockdown and hope is waning that they will ever recover from mounting losses.”
Father of three Chris Papas said families needed certainty about when students could return to the classroom.
“If the kids aren’t back by the end of term four it is going to be disastrous for their mental health, surely there are some measures the government can put in place,” he said.
STATE’S VACCINE RACE GETS SHOT IN ARM Vaccine supplies are to be fast-tracked to Victoria as the nation closes in on its first vaccination target.
After weeks of Australia’s Covid vaccines being prioritised for Sydney, which ended on Sunday, Premier Daniel Andrews said there were efforts to speed up the delivery of vaccine scheduled for Victoria.
Federal Health Minister Greg Hunt also said on Sunday that Australia was “not that far away” from reaching the vaccination targets needed to reopen.
Victoria’s state-run clinics delivered 31,436 Covid shots on Saturday, a 20 per cent increase on a week earlier.
However, Victorian government data shows that although its state-run mass Covid vaccination clinics have provided a similar number of doses to those in NSW, there is a massive difference between the states in doses provided to federally-run primary health clinics.
The 6.5 million doses delivered by NSW clinics is 26 per cent more per head of population than the 5.4 million doses provided by Victoria GPs so far.
After NSW received several hundred thousand extra Pfizer doses to cope with its Covid crisis over the past month, Mr Andrews said Prime Minister Scott Morrison had provided assurances supplies would again be shared equally among states.
The Premier also took a swipe at NSW for allowing weddings and small groups of fully vaccinated people in non-hot spot municipalities to gather outside from mid-September – despite recording 1218 cases on Sunday.
“The national plan is about all of us moving together. Not a national plan for picnics, just quietly,” Mr Andrews said.
Fewer than 2.7 million people are needed to get a Covid-19 dose for Australia to hit the 70 per cent vaccinations marker – and an additional two million need to get the shot to achieve 80 per cent coverage.
“There is real hope,” Mr Hunt said. “We’re not that far away. We can get there.”
New evidence from the National Incident Centre underlines the effect of vaccines, with NSW about to hit the number of infections recorded in Victoria’s second wave – but with deaths at just 10 per cent of the 800-plus fatalities of 2020.
National – 2021 – Covid Vaccination Stats
Australia’s drug regulator is expected to give its advice on whether Moderna can be given to people aged between 12 and 17 this fortnight, before a million doses arrive in September.
Royal Australian College of General Practitioners president Karen Price welcomed the prospect of increased supplies going to Victorian GPs.
“We certainly have got a lot more capacity to deliver a lot more shots,” Dr Price said.
“Our interest is getting hold of more supply and getting it to every GP who has patients lining up for it.”
Federal Opposition Health spokesman Mark Butler said Australia was approaching a situation where pubs, restaurants and venues would require proof of vaccination.
However, he warned premiers of states without Covid-19 to prepare for a rise in case numbers and hospital admissions when Australia hit its first vaccination target.

OLYMPIC MEDALLIST COPS $5K FINE Olympic boxing medallist Harry Garside has been fined more than $5000 for breaching Victoria’s coronavirus restrictions – after he attended a party in Mooroolbark on Saturday night.
The 24-year-old Victorian won Australia’s first boxing medal in more than 30 years at the Tokyo Olympics, after clinching bronze at the games.
Garside, who is a plumber by trade, touched down in Melbourne on Friday evening after completing hotel quarantine in Brisbane in the wake of his Olympic triumph.

Full text: Mr Newman, the Queensland leader of the Liberal Democrats following his exit from the LNP, said the party wanted to “illustrate” its position that border closures were causing huge hardship to many.
More than 100 people gathered on the NSW/ QLD border on Sunday to protest Covid-19 measures, including the closed border , with a significant police presence on Boundary St to maintain the peace.
Footage shows a plane flying a banner with the line “End lockdowns, vote Liberal Democrats” over the border protest.
The Liberal Democrats policy on Covid-19 calls for the country to “learn how to live with Covid” just as it does with viruses like the fly and that the policy of “zero Covid” was “absurd”.
The party is advocating for a “Freedom Day” to be held on December 4, 2021, which is when Australia will return to the “old normal” and there will be no Covid restrictions.
Prime Minister Scott Morrison has repeatedly said there will be no so-called “Freedom Day” as there was “no special virtue in a calendar”.
“This plan is based on vaccination rates and based on a staged, careful reopening in phase B and phase C at 70 and 80 per cent vaccination rates,” he said.
Doherty Institute modelling shows there will be a need for some public health measures moving forward as vaccination alone cannot protect against Covid-19, as evident in other countries like the US and Israel.

Full text: There were no local cases.
It comes as the Doherty Institute has reiterated to National Cabinet that it will be safe to fully reopen Australia when 80 per cent of people aged 16 years and over are fully vaccinated, regardless of case numbers.
The confirmation comes as almost 300,000 Queensland teenagers will be eligible to get the Pfizer Covid-19 jab from mid-September, with school-based vaccine programs now in the works.
The Australian Technical Advisory Group on Immunisation yesterday approved the broad use of the Pfizer vaccine in children aged 12 to 15, with authorities still working on ticking off use of the Moderna vaccine in children.
Children in the cohort will be able to book in for their first dose from September 13, just as Australia’s stock of vaccines is set to increase from October.
After a week of back and forth between the Federal Government and the states and territories over the vaccination levels required to banish lockdowns, National Cabinet was given another briefing from Doherty professor Jodie McVernon on the institute’s draft modelling scenarios.
But National Cabinet was also told that some public measures such as mask wearing, contact tracing and localised moderate restrictions would be necessary at between 70 and 80 per cent of vaccination coverage.
To allay concerns by some states that health systems around the country will struggle to handle the increase in case numbers once the country moves away from the current heavy suppression and elimination models, the nation’s leaders have agreed to establish a taskforce to look at hospital preparedness.
The taskforce, to be led by Health Department Secretary Brendan Murphy, will report back to National Cabinet next week on how to make sure Australia has enough ICU beds and ventilators when coronavirus begins to circulate around the country without lockdowns.
It will also look at ways in which states can help each other to support their health systems when that day arrives.
Sources familiar with the meeting said Victorian Premier Daniel Andrews backed the Doherty modelling in his comments to the National Cabinet.
National – 2021 – Covid Vaccination Stats
But West Australian Premier Mark McGowan, who has expressed unhappiness at the Doherty plan gave no guarantee in the meeting that he would adhere to the plan.
Speaking afterwards in Perth where he was announcing that two infected truck drivers from NSW had entered the state, Mr McGowan hedged his bets.
“If there’s thousands of cases out there and those cases have been seeded into, if you like, into a jurisdiction without Covid, then obviously the risk is much higher,” he said.
“That’s the problem that jurisdictions without Covid face – and I raised that point today – the idea that we just deliberately infect our citizens when we have no Covid when we get to 70 per cent vaccination, I just can’t do that because people will die.”
Vaccine rollout lead Lieutenant General John Frewen confirmed school-based vaccine programs were in the works, with the Federal Government to work with states and territories and directly with the private school system.
“You will see those programs taking shape over the next month or so,” he said.
Allowing children to get vaccinated will further prevent spread of Covid-19 in the community and aid the safe reopening of schools.
NED-4409-How-to-get-proof-of-vaccination
Evidence from countries including Israel and the US, where Covid-19 restrictions have eased significantly, shows infections in young children have risen.
During Queensland’s most recent Delta-strain Covid-19 cluster, more than 90 children aged 19 or younger were infected.
Infectious disease expert Dr Paul Griffin said there was also emerging evidence that children can suffer from “long Covid”, which includes ongoing fatigue, “brain fog” and respiratory issues.
Prime Minister Scott Morrison thanked state and territory leaders for their expansion of state-run hotel quarantine systems for the 4100 evacuees from Afghanistan who have begun arriving in Australia.
The meeting was also addressed by Chief Medical Officer Paul Kelly, who took the leaders through the hot spots in the current outbreaks.
Nationally, the vaccination rollout continues to gather pace with the news that children between 12 and 15 will start getting Pfizer on September 13.
So far 18.3 million vaccine doses have been given in Australia, including 307,090 on Thursday with 55 per cent of people aged 16 years partially protected and more than a third fully vaccinated.

Full text: Local sporting finals were cancelled on Saturday and attractions closed in Port Augusta, Port Pirie and Ceduna as SA Health scrambled to track the travels of the NSW drivers.
SA Health contact tracers identified four tier 1 Covid exposure sites, all of which are petrol stations split between Port Augusta and Ceduna.
Times of concern are last Wednesday between 11.30pm and 12.30am on Thursday, and then later that morning between 5.30am and 6.30am.
Investigations have placed 15 people into quarantine, including six staff and three customers who used QR codes.
Several further exposure sites are expected in Port Aug­usta, Ceduna and Nundroo after the truckies visited earlier last week on a separate trip.
The pair, aged 23 and 29, tested positive for coronavirus in Perth on Thursday night after their cross-country trip that took them through Port Augusta and Ceduna.
The duo, who had each had one dose of the Pfizer vaccine and wore masks outside their trucks, drove almost 4000km from Sydney to Western Australia via Victoria and South Australia.
WA Health Saturday night said no other cases were found to be linked to them.
SA Health said further risk assessments involving contact tracers and police are investigating how many others visited the exposure sites but did not check in with QR codes.
SA Exposure sites
No border crackdowns were imposed Saturday night.
Chief public health officer, Professor Nicola Spurrier, told locals that tracers were reviewing QR codes and CCTV.
Premier Steven Marshall said Covid was a “nasty virus and there is no silver bullet to make our state 100 per cent impenetrable”.
“The situations at our two eastern borders puts us at high alert,” he said.
Port Augusta Mayor Brett said the shocked community had rallied. “they realise the importance,” he said.
Sport cancelled in two regions An SA Health spokeswoman said Covid management plans had also been cancelled for various sporting leagues while the local council has announced tourist attractions have closed “out of an abundance of caution”.
Port Pirie events were also affected.
The Western United Football Club at Penong, west of Ceduna and Port Augusta football and netball preliminary and semi-finals have been postponed.
The spokeswoman praised the organisations for the “responsive and cooperative approach” with SA Health and their excellent co-operation at short notice.
Port Augusta Mayor Brett said the community had rallied despite being in shock.
He urged the community to not panic and follow health advice.
“I think they realise the importance, you can always rearrange a football or netball match,” he said. “Everyone is following the directions. There’s no concern at the moment but contact tracers are working through it all.”
A spokesman for the local sporting organisations told locals a decision was quickly made to cancel “due to the current exposure sites and the potential risk that playing sport may pose”.
He also urged people to follow local protocols.

Full text: Victoria has recorded 79 new cases of coronavirus, with another concerning increase in mystery cases.
The Department of Health’s latest figures show 53 of these infections were linked to existing clusters but 26 are still under investigation.
Nineteen of the most recent cases were in isolation throughout their infectious period.
A day 21 test will also be “strongly recommended”, Health Minister Martin Foley said on Friday.
Mr Foley also remained tight-lipped on when Victoria’s lockdown could end, saying only that health officials would make those decisions based on the most up-to-date advice.
Lockdown is slated to end on September 2, but the end date is looking increasingly unlikely after another 79 new local cases were recorded on Friday.
“At the moment, with another six days to go, it is too early to make that call,” Mr Foley said
He also could not provide clarity when asked if Victoria would be in lockdown until the state achieved a 70 to 80 per cent vaccination rate.
“I don’t know about that but I know there have been public health measures for the last 18 months in place,” the minister said.
The new cases come as Victorians now need a new “departing hotel quarantine permit” if they complete two weeks’ isolation interstate.
The chief health officer implemented the new changes on Thursday night.
It will require a day 17 test after arrival into Australia.

VICTORIA’S LATEST CASES
• 10 linked to the Shepparton outbreak
• 1 linked to the Royal Melbourne Hospital outbreak
• 9 linked to the broadmeadows cluster
• 6 linked to Melbourne’s inner north including clusters in Carlton North and Brunswick
• 2 more cases linked to Caroline Springs
• 46 cases are spread across Melbourne’s western suburbs, with 12 linked to Wyndham and 11 in the Newport area
• 1 new case was detected in Geelong
• 2 new infections linked to the City of Monash
• 2 new cases under investigation

WESTERN SUBURBS ‘AREA OF CONCERN’ Covid-19 commander Jeroen Weimar said 60 per cent of Friday’s cases could be traced to Melbourne’s western suburbs.
“This is a significant area of concern,” he told reporters.
“We believe there are multiple chains of transmission and we’re looking at quite significant community transmission that’s ongoing.”
There are a total of 150 cases in the western suburbs, including the 46 new infections on Friday.
Thirty-nine of the 150 cases were in the City of Wyndham, 81 in the Newport area and 19 linked to the Newport Football Club cluster.
There are now 660 active cases across the state, with 656 of those locally acquired.
Thirty seven Victorians are in hospital, 14 are in ICU and nine people are on a ventilator.
More than 50,000 tests were received over the past 24 hours and 33,411 vaccines administered at state-run clinics.
Victoria has recorded 453 new cases of Covid-19 over the past seven days, while 130 people have recovered from the virus.
Mr Weimar said the outbreak was much bigger than a week ago.
In that time, more than 6000 primary close contacts have been cleared from isolation.
But more than 15,000 others have been forced to self-isolate at home.
At least 50 mystery cases tied to Victoria’s latest outbreak have now been linked.

NSW LOCKDOWN MAY LAST UNTIL OCT New South Wales recorded 882 coronavirus cases in the past 24 hours, a slight dip from their record-breaking 1029 tally on Thursday.
The state’s premier Gladys Berejiklian also detailed her plan to return students to school.
Kindergarten and year 1 students in New South Wales are expected to return to classrooms from October 25 with remaining years returning progressively.

National - 2021 - Covid Vaccination Stats

RULES MAY EASE DESPITE CASE SPIKE Lockdown restrictions may still ease in Victoria next week, despite ­the state recording the biggest spike in Covid-19 cases in almost a year.
There were 80 new cases reported on Thursday, the highest daily number since 110 cases were reported on September 2 last year.
While a major easing of restrictions or lockdown is unlikely, Daniel Andrews would not rule out easing some restrictions when lockdown was due to end next Thursday.
“It’s too early for us to say … every day’s data tells you a different picture. The rules will be on for as long as they serve a useful purpose,” the Premier said.
One of the key restrictions some experts have flagged could be eased first is the controversial playground ban.
Authorities have maintained the shutdown was in response to a record number of children testing positive in the current outbreak.
However, chief health officer Brett Sutton on Thursday said an investigation into playground transmission was ­inconclusive.
“We don’t get a definitive answer. We don’t have an alternative explanation and that becomes a working hypothesis,” he said.
“We can’t see the virus transmit from one person to another so we don’t know ­definitively.”
Just 39 of Thursday’s cases were in isolation for their infectious period, with contact tracers investigating the source of 13 further mystery cases.
Prof Sutton said the virus had moved “silently and with stealth” across the state.
“The fight is still on … clearly today is a challenging day, and the numbers aren’t going in the direction that we would like them to,” he said.
It comes as health authorities continue to discover concerning new aspects of the Delta variant.
“What’s become apparent in recent weeks is that maybe three-quarters of transmission occurs without symptoms or before you’ve developed symptoms,” Prof Sutton said.
“You have to assume that you could be infectious, even without symptoms, at any time.”
Meanwhile, new health department data provided to the Herald Sun revealed in the past week, only 40 per cent of symptomatic people got tested.
It prompted the Premier to lash the “selfish behaviour” of Victorians.
“Don’t, for heaven’s sake, as some have, wait eight days, and literally infect everyone you come anywhere near in that eight-day period,” he said, adding it was evident illegal home visits were still a source of transmission.
“Please don’t be visiting friends, please don’t be visiting family, because the visitor that no one knows about is the coronavirus. You are taking it with you to the people you love. Don’t act in a selfish and irresponsible way. Stay at home, or you will spread this virus.”
Vic Locally-acquired Covid-19
REOPENING WON’T LEAD TO MORE DEATHS
Reopening Australia with thousands of Covid-19 cases active in the community will not lead to more deaths over six months than waiting for virus numbers to be contained at low numbers, updated modelling by the Doherty Institute has found.
The updated modelling, which will be discussed on Friday at a meeting of the national cabinet, conducted analysis of three different scenarios over a 180-day period based on Covid case numbers in the tens, hundreds and thousands and found no material difference in fatality rates.
The updated modelling, already provided to state and territory leaders on Wednesday, comes as Scott Morrison seeks to hold the Premiers to the national cabinet agreement for restrictions to be eased at vaccination rates of 70-80 per cent.
The Doherty Institute earlier this week confirmed that the original advice on its modelling still held irrespective of the case numbers.
The new analysis will quell concerns from state leaders about the outbreak in NSW by suggesting the spiralling number of infections does not present a major obstacle to proceeding with the national cabinet’s four-step reopening strategy.
New South Wales Premier Gladys Berejiklian announced fully vaccinated people would be given more freedoms from September 13.
Outdoor gatherings of up to five people will be allowed across much of the state, while fully vaccinated residents in hot spot areas will be able to gather outdoors for an hour.
Mr Andrews wouldn’t say whether a similar model would be implemented in Victoria, but said he hoped any interstate decisions were “consistent with the national plan”.
Returning Victorians who have completed their two-week quarantine interstate will now need to complete a mandatory day-17 test.
Day-21 testing will continue to be recommended in a bid to reduce the risk of virus incursion into the state.
Mr Andrews said he hadn’t given up hope on a Victorian grand final.
“It’s going to be incredibly difficult for us to have major events any time soon … but no decision has been made,” he said.

HEALTHCARE WORKERS’ JAB DEAL Fully vaccinated healthcare workers may avoid long quarantine periods after being exposed to Covid-positive patients under new guidelines to keep hospitals functioning.
Rather than face a full 14-day isolation, Victorian hospital workers will be able to return to work after just five days under special circumstances.
The new guidelines – which are still being developed by the Department of Health and the state’s health services – come as hospitals feel the strain of hundreds of staff forced to furlough due to Victoria’s worsening outbreak.
Until now all hospital staff who worked in a ward with a Covid-positive patient or colleague were considered high risk and furloughed for 14 days.
National – 2021 – Covid Vaccination Stats
But under the new arrangements, vaccinated staff who spent only short periods in the ward or had minimal contact may be allowed to a continue working if they return a negative test after five days.
Returning workers would also need to undertake daily saliva tests, a PCR test on day nine and undertake a clearance PCR test on day 13, and wear full PPE while working.
Outside their working hours the staff will have to observe the same isolation requirements for the full 14 days, a department spokesman said.
“In light of the recent outbreak, additional guidance has been developed to assist ­Victorian health services through the current Covid-19 outbreak in an effort to protect and preserve the healthcare workforce, and where appropriate and clinically safe, limit unnecessary impacts of staff furlough requirements,” he said.
“This is an evolving piece of work, which may change or health services may adapt depending on their circumstances and outbreak status.”
With eight staff and seven patients confirmed to have Covid in recent days the Royal Melbourne Hospital has been placed on ambulance bypass while more than 370 staff are furloughed.

‘TOO EARLY’ TO REOPEN CLASSROOMS Pressure is mounting on the state government to reopen schools, but the Premier won’t commit to resuming onsite classes before term 4.
Federal Education Minister Alan Tudge on Thursday said families were hurting trying to educate their children at home, adding that schools needed to be reopened urgently.
“Fortunately, (the closure) hasn’t had the dramatic impact on their learning, which is good news, but it has had a massive impact on their mental health,” Mr Tudge said.
“We know the statistics there, it’s very serious because schools aren’t just about learning, they are about that social interaction, they are about that engagement and staying emotionally healthy, as well as academically learning.”
But Premier Daniel Andrews on Thursday said it was “too early” to say whether kids could return for term 3.
“I simply can’t pretend that we have absolutely certainty with this, we’re going to have to see how things unfold. I know that’s frustrating, but I’m not going to make things up,” he said.
Of Victoria’s 600 active cases, 128 are aged under 9, while 106 fall in the 10-19 cohort.
Mr Andrews said given the Delta strain’s infectivity, particularly for children, it was still unsafe to open classes.
He added the risks of children catching the virus and then infecting their households were far too great.
“I don’t want to see kids in hospital, I just don’t,” he said.
Mr Tudge said Victorians could look forward to schools opening up once the state reached 70 and 80 per cent vaccine coverage.
“That’s the great hope for us as a society, as a whole,” he said.

Full text: As vaccine rollout chief John Frewen looks at giving shots to children through schools and together with their parents, Friday’s national cabinet meeting is set to be dominated by the issue of giving jabs to 12 to 15-year-olds.
ACT Chief Minister Andrew Barr is planning to demand the reopening targets set out in the ­national cabinet’s post-pandemic plan include children, but the Morrison government is sticking to the current thresholds and Josh Frydenberg is warning state leaders that the national mood is turning against lockdowns.
While Ms Palaszczuk is not ready to demand the 12-to-15 cohort be accounted for in thresholds, her spokesman told The Australian she had told national cabinet it was time for the Doherty Institute to revise their modelling to include children.
“The Premier suggested further modelling be done in regards to vaccinating anyone over 12 years at last week’s national cabinet meeting. The Premier has spoken to people in other countries about their experience with vaccine rollouts including the need for children to be vaccinated,” he said.
While premiers debate child vaccinations, business leaders hope the current thresholds agreed by national cabinet will be reached as early as November.
National Australia Bank chief executive Ross McEwan has touted a freedom day for the nation on Melbourne Cup Day if vaccination rates persist. “This country will fire again … there’s a pathway out now and it’s called vaccination,” he said on Wednesday.
“The second of November, we could call it freedom day in Victoria because it’s the Melbourne Cup day.”
Treasurer Josh Frydenberg has stressed the importance of being “upfront” about what living with COVID-19 means. “It’s obvious that we’re going to have to live with COVID,” he told Sky News host Chris Kenny. “Zero COVID forever is unrealistic, they’re not my words, they’re the words of the Doherty Institute. “So we’ve got to be upfront with the Australian people, and that is whether they’re in Western Australia, or in New South Wales or Victoria and explain what that actually means”. Mr Frydenberg said living with COVID-19 means that “there will be illness, it means there will be death, it means there will be more cases”. “But with 70 and 80 per cent vaccination rates, we can ease restrictions,” he said. “And ultimately see an opening up of the country.”
Once the Australian Technical Advisory Group on Immunisation finalises its interim advice on vaccinating 1.2 million children aged 12 to 15 – expected to be before Friday – teenagers will be made eligible for vaccines from next week.
Access to both Pfizer and Moderna jabs is expected to be available via GPs, state hubs and schools.
With vaccine supply ramping-up over the next two months, most teenagers are expected to receive at least one jab by December with no impact on the vaccination program for Australians aged 16 and over.
General Frewen on Wednesday said schools would play a “big part” in vaccinations in coming weeks, and he was looking to book families for jab appointments ­together.
“School-based vaccination could be a big part of the program. Already some of the states and territories are moving kids in year 12 to some of the big hubs,” he told ABC News.
“We are also looking at a program where we might be able to book families in so parents and kids can get done together. We are working a set of options at the moment that will give us the best opportunity to get all of those kids vaccinated as quickly as possible.”
Prime Minister Scott Morrison says the federal government is supporting the health system and have been “backing them” throughout the current outbreak. “Over the course of this pandemic, the federal government has committed and provided some $27 billion in direct health support right across this country to support the various types of measures and challenges,” Mr Morrison said. Mr Morrison said the federal and state governments agreed to an equal share "dollar for dollar arrangement" to fund the healthcare system. “To support the cost that were being borne from state and territories because of the additional COVID-related pressures that they’re facing in providing COVID-related medical support through their hospital systems," he said.
Under existing approvals, about 8000 children aged 12 to 15, with underlying medical con­ditions and those in Indigenous and remote communities, have been vaccinated.
Mr Barr has called for the past week for children to now to be included in vaccine targets, and said he feared the national plan did not fully account for the three-week gap between a person getting jabbed and the vaccine providing the fullest immunity.
“We’re in a better position than any other jurisdiction to go beyond 80 per cent and to vaccinate our 12 to 15-year-olds, but I am going to continue to advocate that at a national level,” he said.
“We all try our very best to vaccinate as many 12 to 15-year-olds as we can before big, big decisions are made, particularly at the 80 per cent national threshold.”
Spread of the Delta strain has been highest in young Australians and epidemiologists have called on state and federal governments to prioritise the vaccination of 12 to 39-year-olds.
NSW chief health officer Kerry Chant on Wednesday said the vaccination of people 16 to 40 was a key part of breaking the Delta transmission chain in the nation’s worst-hit state.
Finance Minister Simon Birmingham has conceded that targeted lockdowns “in some circumstances” could be used under the national plan when ­vaccinated rates reached 70 to 80 per cent.

Belated campaign of hope arrives for our Covid future

Full text: As applied through public health restrictions, science has sentenced us to living in our caves for the foreseeable future. The problem, as we all know, is that our caves are damp and depressing.
Leaders, state and federal, have fixated on the immediate. The shortsighted approach has neglected the deeper emptiness of confinement, and brings to mind the line from the 1997 movie As Good As It Gets: “I’m drowning here and you’re describing the water”.
Few bold targets have challenged the everyday currency of woe.
Finally, however, science has served up something more palatable.
The Doherty Institute has conjured societal scenarios that sound easier than today. The institute has predicted what we might be able to do as opposed to what we cannot.
Lockdowns could end once 70 per cent vaccination targets are achieved. The higher the number of vaccinated, the kinder the consequences.
Premier Dan Andrews has chimed in. At 80 per cent vaccinations, he says, generalised lockdowns would be “highly, highly unlikely”.
These are elements in a bigger (and belated) campaign of hope. Prime Minister Scott Morrison has sought to shift expectations. Lockdowns, he has foreshadowed, will become a nasty relic of the past.
The shift in rhetoric finally jettisons the dated preoccupation with eliminating the virus. It also emphasises how badly we trail the western world.
Australia is six months behind other countries, such as Britain, even further behind Israel.
These nations have done what we are finally talking about doing. They have signposted the potholes in our path ahead.
Case numbers will rise overnight when we open. It won’t be like flu, as the longer-term predictions suggest Covid will recede to be.
But the key measures will change, to hospitalisations and deaths. Jittery premiers will impose controls here and there. But holdout states, such as WA and Qld, will be cast as pariahs if they pursue their backward approaches.
The judgment of those who have chosen not to vaccinate will probably soften to sympathy.
Not only will they be left behind. For them, the science will be no friend. It tells us that the unvaccinated will be the most likely to die.
And that might be the toughest lesson of all.

Covid Qld: Premier refuses to confirm whether interstate Christmas trips will be possible amid doubt over Doherty plan

Full text: The incredible position came as the Queensland Premier could not answer whether Queenslanders could look forward to an interstate holiday this Christmas.
Announcing six new Covid cases on Tuesday, although none of concern to authorities, Ms Palaszczuk repeatedly warned of the threat of Covid leaking across the border, and encouraged NSW residents not to “give up” on controlling their outbreak.
Asked twice whether there was a possibility she could withdraw from the current plan to ease restrictions based on what Friday’s updated modelling says, she said: “Well I haven’t seen anything yet.”
Ms Palaszczuk called for the modelling to be released early so leaders could get across it before Friday’s meeting.
She said she remained committed to reaching 80 per cent vaccination rates, although would prefer those rates to be higher.
Discussing how the plan outlined that lockdowns would move to targeting specific regions at 80 per cent vaccination coverage, she added “that was all predicated on 30 cases across Australia, not 13,000”.
“So I’m looking forward to seeing that modelling,” she said.
Queensland Vaccine Locator
She said “nowhere in the world yet” had found the answer on how to deal with the pandemic, but Australia would observe what was happening overseas to “look at that best practice and incorporate that into our practices”.
She said she wanted a plan “that is in the best interest of our citizens”.
Her comments follow Prime Minister Scott Morrison on Tuesday saying Australians couldn’t “stay in the cave”, no matter how much some wanted to.
Prime Minister Scott Morrison said in clear terms this morning that once we get to 70 to 80 per cent vaccinated we have to live with the virus without lockdowns, according to Sky News Political Editor Andrew Clennell.“But when our reporter Jonathan Lea put the PM on the spot would he put the federal government money where his mouth was on this in terms of supporting the states to pursue lockdowns after those benchmarks were reached, the PM wouldn't commit,” Mr Clennell said.“The Prime Minister told me during that interview on June 17, of the difficulties in opening up with a heavy caseload and how we were so much better placed than other countries.“At this time, UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson, because of the Delta variant, had just delayed Freedom Day as cases grew in that country from 3,000 to 10,000 a day. There was more than 70 per cent single dose vaccination and 56 per cent double dose vaccination in the UK at that time. “The Director of Epidemiology of the Doherty Institute Jodie McVernon made clear to me on Sunday Agenda that her modelling which talked about an opening at 70 and 80 per cent vaccination was modelled on a basis of a low caseload and modelling was going on for NSW Health in terms of what happened at a higher caseload. “Scott Morrison has got 23 seats in Queensland and 23 in New South Wales. And they have to be on his mind as he makes this statement about opening up unequivocally at 70 and 80 per cent. In New South Wales, they would want an end to lockdown. In Queensland they would want zero COVID.“From what I'm hearing there won't be a big freedom day in Sydney or Melbourne. But restrictions will be lifted steadily as the vaccination rate goes past those 70 and 80 per cent mark.“The government, as I have reported are looking to do a vaccination blitz in late October for teenagers once ATAGI approves it for 12 to 15 year olds.“So if you have high school kids you have hope of getting them back to school this year in Sydney in particular. You have hopes of them not being at risk of long COVID and the like.”
Asked about the analogy, Ms Palaszczuk suggested Queensland wasn’t in a cave.
“I just say, have a look out in Queensland at the moment,” she said.
“You can go to work, you can go to school, you can go watch sport, you can play community sport, you can go to a restaurant, you can go out.
“We haven’t given up.”
Ms Palaszczuk said she believed the people of NSW did not want to “give up” getting on top of their current outbreak.
And she suggested borders wouldn’t reopen until they were, telling reporters she couldn’t answer whether Queenslanders would be able to visit interstate family at Christmas.
“At the moment the borders are shut and, you know, we don’t know when they’re going to come out of their current outbreak,” she said.

NSW Chief Health Officer Kerry Chant warns mask restriction could be in place ‘for years’

Full text: NSW Chief Health Officer Dr Kerry Chant made the suggestion on Tuesday while speaking about what would happen when the state reached a vaccination level of 80 per cent, which is the national goal for reopening.
“In terms of the Doherty modelling, which says at around 80 per cent (vaccination rate) you have options and choices ... that’s not to say you’re not going to have to calibrate and respond with a level of restrictions,” she said.
“It may be that we actually have indoor mask-wearing for years in certain settings.
“We may have factors where you’re only permitted to go to certain high risk venues if you're vaccinated and can show proof of vaccination.
“The world is grappling with how we coexist with Covid-19 and the virus may throw us curve balls.”
Even after 80 per cent of the eligible population is vaccinated, Covid-19 will still need to be managed with some public health measures – test, trace, isolate and quarantine – according to the report.
For instance, restrictions will ease further and lockdowns will become more generalised so that Phase D – “Normal” – can be reached, where Covid-19 is managed like the flu.
In a statement shared to Twitter on Monday night, the Doherty Institute said there would be no one day where rules were lifted and lockdowns ended for good.
The UK removed the majority of restrictions last month, with July 19 labelled “freedom day”.
But it has had devastating consequences and resulted in a spike of Covid-19 cases, with the country now recording an average of 32,210 new cases and 98 deaths a day.
The Doherty Institute said the 70 to 80 per cent level of vaccination would “make it easier to live with the virus” similar to how the world handles the flu.
“However, it won’t be possible to maintain a situation where there are no cases at all. The focus will shift to keeping the number of people going into hospital and dying at a minimum,” the institute said.
“In an average year of influenza, we would roughly have 600 deaths and 200,000 cases in Australia. Any death is a tragedy but our health system can cope with this.”
NSW recorded 753 new infections on Tuesday, a dip on the previous few days which breached the 800 mark.
The state also hit its target of six million vaccinations, which means some restrictions could be eased in September for those who are fully vaccinated.

Full text: The study, which has not yet been peer reviewed, says tens of thousands Australians would likely die and hundreds of thousands would likely develop cases of long Covid if the federal government were to push the country into Phase D of the national plan prematurely.
Phase D is the final phase of the plan and would involve things being “normal” and managing Covid like the flu, including having international borders opened up.
Lockdowns would be “a thing of the past” under Phase D and all vaccinated people able to travel to Australia without being subjected to inbound arrival caps or quarantine.
“We found substantial morbidity and mortality is likely to occur if the Australian government sticks to the national plan,” ANU economics professor and study co-author Quentin Grafton said.
The federal government has not yet specified when the country will enter Phase D.
At this stage, Prime Minister Scott Morrison says Australia will enter Phase C of “baseline restrictions” when 80 per cent of the population is vaccinated.
For this reason the federal government has pushed back against the academics’ modelling, stating it is “not based in reality and is not a model of anything the Prime Minister or national cabinet are pursuing to reopen Australia.”
“[The modelling] falsely assumes there will be no health protections after 70 per cent of the population is vaccinated, and it assumes vaccinations don’t increase past 70 per cent,” a government spokesman said.
“As The Doherty Institute itself has said, ‘There is light at the end of the tunnel’ – once we achieve 70 per cent to 80 per cent vaccination we will see less transmission of Covid-19 and fewer people with severe illness, and therefore fewer hospitalisations and deaths.”
The ANU-led modelling warns that if Australia reopens to Phase D with 70 per cent of Australians aged over 16 fully vaccinated, there could eventually be 6.9 million cases of Covid-19, 154,000 hospitalisations, and 29,000 fatalities.
“We simply can’t afford to do that, both in terms of lives and long-term illness from Covid,” Professor Grafton said.
And even if the PM waits until 80 per cent of the adult population are vaccinated to enter Phase D, thousands of lives would be lost, according to the modelling.
“Assuming 80 per cent vaccination coverage for only those over 16, as per the national plan, there could be approximately 25,000 fatalities and some 270,000 cases of long Covid,” Professor Grafton said.
“The consequences of prematurely and fully relaxing public health measures to suppress Covid-19, even after vaccinating 80 per cent of adults, would likely be irreversible, and unacceptable to many Australians,” study co-author and University of Western Australia senior research officer Zoë Hyde echoed.
“It’s simply too dangerous to treat Covid-19 like the flu,” Dr Hyde said.
According to the ANU-led modelling, a vaccination rate of at least 90 per cent, which includes children under 16, is needed to prevent mass deaths and hospitalisations in Phase D.
“If children are also fully vaccinated, national fatalities – for all age groups – would be reduced to 19,000 with 80 per cent adult vaccination coverage. This would fall to 10,000 at a 90 per cent adult vaccination coverage,” Professor Grafton said.
“Children also directly benefit from vaccination. If we could achieve 75 cent vaccination coverage among children and adolescents, we could prevent 12,000 hospitalisations in these age groups.”
To give Australians a decent chance in a country without lockdowns or other restrictions, the researchers argue that four key steps must be achieved first:
- Vaccinating both children and adolescents
- Reaching 95 per cent full vaccination among people 60 and older as well as other vulnerable groups, including Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islanders

- Giving an mRNA booster shot to all Australians vaccinated with AstraZeneca, as well as a booster shot to those vaccinated with an mRNA vaccine, when appropriate

- Reaching more than 90 per cent vaccination coverage among all Australians

Study co-author and University of Melbourne environmental economics professor Tom Kompas warned his research had used the lower estimates of the severity of the Delta variant, meaning the real-life outcomes would likely be even worse than the modelling predicted.
“Our projections likely represent a lower estimate of the cumulative public health outcomes of fully relaxing public health measures at Phase D of the national plan,” he said.
But Professor Kompas said it wasn’t too late for the federal government to turn things around, noting there was still an opportunity to devise “a safe and affordable transition to a post-Covid-19 era”.
“If national cabinet revises its strategy to include our four vaccination steps, many lives will be saved, and many more, including children, will not suffer from debilitating long Covid,” he said.

THERE WILL NEVER BE COVID ZERO: DOHERTY RESEARCHERS As contention over the Doherty Institute’s modelling and Australia’s path out of lockdowns ramps up, the experts behind the plan have revealed there will never be a “freedom day” because there will never be “Covid zero”.
Instead, with enough vaccination, Covid-19 will become less of a burden on the health system and citizens will learn to live with it like they do influenza.
In a statement released by the Doherty Institute ahead of new modelling expected to be presented to national cabinet on Friday, a spokesperson said it was important to note Covid-19 “won’t go away”, but it will be “easier to control”.
Last month, National Cabinet agreed on a four-phase “road map” out of Covid-19, based on modelling by the Doherty Institute.
When 70 per cent of the eligible population (currently adults aged over 16) is double-jabbed, the country will enter Phase B – “Vaccination transition phase” – where Covid-19 restrictions and lockdowns are still possible but less likely.
At 80 per cent, Phase C – “Consolidation” – will begin, with lockdowns only being “highly targeted” and vaccinated residents will be exempt from domestic restrictions.
But, even after 80 per cent of the eligible population is vaccinated, Covid-19 will still need to be managed with some public health measures – test, trace, isolate and quarantine.
Restrictions will just ease further and lockdowns will become more generalised so that Phase D – “Normal” – can be reached, where Covid-19 is managed like the flu.
The UK removed the majority of restrictions last month, with July 19 labelled “freedom day”. It resulted in a spike of Covid-19 cases, with the country currently recording an average of 32,210 new cases and 98 deaths a day.
Prime Minister Boris Johnson said the move was “irreversible” and no further lockdowns would be imposed.
Back home, some state leaders are now arguing they won’t abide by the road map, because initial modelling was based on outbreaks with daily numbers of 30 and did not account for cases in excess of 800 currently being experienced in NSW.
The institute said the 70-80 per cent level of vaccination will “make it easier to live with the virus,” as we do with other viruses such as the flu.
“However, it won’t be possible to maintain a situation where there are no cases at all. The focus will shift to keeping the number of people going into hospital and dying at a minimum,” the institute said.
“In an average year of influenza, we would roughly have 600 deaths and 200,000 cases in Australia. Any death is a tragedy but our health system can cope with this.”
In the Covid-19 modelling from the Doherty Institute, opening the country up at 70 per cent vaccine coverage with partial public health measures would result in a predicted 385,983 cases and 1457 deaths over six months.
But, the Institute’s modelling recommends with “optimal” public health measures and no lockdowns, this could be significantly reduced to 2737 infections and 13 deaths.
“We’ve learned from watching countries that have removed all restrictions that there is no ‘freedom day’. We will need to keep some public health measures in place to keep the reproduction number below 1. But, as vaccination rates increase, we’ll be able to ease up further,” the Institute said.
“Once we reach 70 per cent vaccine coverage, opening up at tens or hundreds of cases national per day is possible, however we will need vigilant public health interventions with higher case loads.”

COVID ZERO ‘COMPLETELY UNREALISTIC’: GLADYS NSW Premier Gladys Berejiklian says driving Covid-19 cases down to zero is “completely unrealistic” and some deaths will be an unfortunate consequence of living with the Delta strain.
“You do need to see if you can suppress the virus, if you can, and reduce the case numbers but you have to be realistic about it,” she told ABC 7.30 on Monday night.
“To have zero cases, no deaths and get to complete vaccination, that is not the real world.”
She said some cases and deaths would be unavoidable, drawing a comparison to the flu.
“We know no death is acceptable, no death is easy, but we know that outside of Covid-19 we lose to 600 to 800 people a year in NSW because of the flu,” she said.
“Our job is to give information to the community and prevent the loss of life as much as possible.”
Speaking to A Current Affair earlier, she said an 80 per cent vaccination rate would bring back “pretty much life as we knew it” before the pandemic.

Full text: Queensland Deputy Premier Steven Miles on Monday said the border could remained closed to NSW even when vaccination rates reached 80 per cent.
NSW recorded 818 new Covid-19 infections overnight while Victoria had 71, ACT 16 and Queensland one.
Mr Miles, who in February filmed himself tearing up a $3om hotel quarantine bill Queensland owed NSW, said the Doherty Institute’s vaccine modelling﻿ was endorsed “before the NSW outbreak” and might not be honoured.
Western Australian Premier Mark McGowan, who accused NSW of “failing” in its handling of the Delta outbreak, also suggested he would keep a hard border with NSW even as vaccination rates increased.
National cabinet has based a four-stage plan for easing national restrictions on the Doherty Institute’s report.
Ms Berejiklian cautioned other states that the highly infectious Delta strain would hit their states too.
“In NSW, having a relatively good 18 months compared to the rest of the world, we are (now) facing what every other jurisdiction has faced and that’s confronting,” Ms Berejiklian said.
“But that's OK because every state in Australia is going to have to go through this eventually.
“Eventually, borders are going to have to come down and it’s up to how each premier responds to the national plan.
“But whenever the borders come down, Delta is going to be part of (life).”
Ms Berejiklian also hit out at other premiers for failing to recognise that NSW accepts the majority of the 3000 (capped) international arrivals each week.
“NSW is the … most densely populated state in Australia and we have to accept that the challenges that we face here are very different from what happens in Tasmania and even WA, which is a more isolated state,” she said.
“(But) it doesn't mean that we (shouldn’t) all allow our citizens to live as safely and as freely as possible (once vaccinations rates were high).”

Covid-19 surge no threat to vaccine goal: Paul Kelly

Full text: Initial advice to chief medical officer Paul Kelly from ­experts at the Doherty Institute shows high case numbers in NSW and growing infection levels in Victoria should not derail the national recovery road map.
National cabinet will this week be given updated modelling from the institute’s researchers about how reopening plans will be ­affected by record infections – 830 on Sunday – in NSW and rising case numbers in Victoria.
Josh Frydenberg said lockdowns could not continue indefinitely, and a rapidly increasing vaccination rate should ease restrictions.
“I have taken many a call from state and territory treasurers wanting commonwealth economic assistance as they endured lockdowns … every time we have been forthcoming providing income support,” the Treasurer said.
“But our emergency economic support is not indefinite and nor should lockdowns be. This is why all governments must stick to the plan agreed at national cabinet.”
Mr Frydenberg’s comments come amid a deepening row ­between state leaders and the federal government over the easing of restrictions and an exit from lockdowns once the vaccination rate reaches 80 per cent.
Under the Doherty Institute road map, lockdowns would be less likely but possible and restrictions would be eased on inoculated residents once vaccination coverage reaches 70 per cent. At 80 per cent, there would only be “highly targeted lockdowns”, it says.
Queensland and Western Australia, however, have distanced themselves from the targets, blaming the rise in NSW case numbers since the modelling was first made public late last month.
“We’re signed up and committed to the plan that national cabinet endorsed, but that was a plan that was endorsed before the NSW outbreak,” Queensland Deputy Premier Steven Miles said, adding the border with NSW would not necessarily reopen even if vaccinations reached 80 per cent.
Scott Morrison on Sunday said it was “highly unlikely” Australia would ever see the end of new cases. “You can’t live with lockdowns forever, and at some point you need to make that gear change. And that is done at 70 per cent because that’s where, we’re advised from the medical science, that you can make that gear change,” Mr Morrison said.
“Once you do that, then you can move into focusing on the public health issues of hospitalisation and serious illness. Case numbers are not the whole story.”
Dr Kelly said he had discussed the rise in cases with the Doherty Institute’s lead researcher, Jodie McVernon, who indicated there would be no need for a major rewrite of the road map.
“The model itself remains the same, it is a tweak to the assumption. Does this need to go back to the drawing board? Absolutely not,” Dr Kelly said.
He said the modelling had factored in the potential for the exponential spread of the virus, and its research was being updated to ­reflect a starting point with high rates of transmission. “They are doing that modelling again now, but on first principles, that same effect you have at 70 and 80 per cent would be the same ­effect, it would minimise the number of people in ICU particularly and in hospitalisation,” Dr Kelly said.
However, Professor McVernon, the director of epidemiology at the Doherty Institute, warned it was not possible to have a “freedom day” with high caseloads. She told Sky News restrictions would need to be eased gradually.
“We were set up for a situation where caseloads would be small, that any outbreak would be ­managed; obviously, we were not envisaging shifting from Phase A to Phase B from a situation of lockdown, which is where we are now,” she said.
Professor McVernon said the institute was undertaking “parallel” work to learn how public health measures could be eased in an environment with high vaccination rates and high Covid-19 transmission.
There were 196,000 doses administered on Saturday, with 1.4 million vaccinations over the past four days. Queensland is not the only state to have broken ranks by disputing the national plan that requires an end to lockdowns when vaccination rates reached 70 to 80 per cent.
ACT Chief Minister Andrew Barr on Sunday said lockdowns may still be necessary at 80 per cent and he would personally aim for much higher vaccination rates for Canberrans.
“We need to be very clear this broadbrush language of opening up should not be taken to mean there will be no public health directions, no public health settings and nothing in place to support the unvaccinated,” he said. Mr Barr warned the 70 to 80 per cent target was put in “as an important protection” against NSW “at the request of a number of states and territories” to prevent the Berejiklian government from opening up “ahead of the rest of the nation”.
The Palaszczuk government stepped away from easing border restrictions when national vaccination rates reach 80 per cent, declaring the figure was agreed to before the latest NSW outbreak.
WA Premier Mark McGowan has also accused NSW of failing to get its case numbers under control.
“There’s an Australia outside of NSW and we’re all doing our best to keep the virus out, and we’re following the national plan … Victoria is doing everything it can to crush and kill the virus, the ACT is doing everything it can to crush and kill the virus,” he said.
But NSW Health Minister Brad Hazzard said restrictions and border closures were not a long-term solution to dealing with the coronavirus.
“Delta has shown itself to be capable of getting into every nation and part of every nation across the world. At some point, that will occur,” Mr Hazzard said on Sunday.
NSW Health Minister Brad Hazzard says he is “very pleased” New South Wales has one of the “highest” vaccination rates in the world.

Full text: Health authorities have provided a glimmer of hope that Victoria’s sixth lockdown could be lifted as planned but have declared it will depend on the community’s compliance with the strict restrictions.
Hopes of the lockdown being eased on September 2 are fading fast.
When asked if there was any chance of getting a ring around the outbreak by September 2, Covid-19 commander Jeroen Weimar said he remained hopeful.
“If we continue to work together, we have pulled six, seven outbreaks now in the last eight months, so collectively as a Victorian community we can absolutely do that,” he said.
“We can cap the rising cases and get it down, because if we don’t, we are looking at the other side of the Murray River and that’s what is awaiting us.”
Victoria recorded 71 new cases of coronavirus on Monday, with nearly a quarter of these still under investigation.
Of Monday’s numbers, 49 have been traced to other clusters, while contact tracers are still working to connect remaining 22.
Mr Weimar raised concerns over the spike in mystery cases, which were double those of the day before.
“We also have 22 mystery cases today and it compares to 11 yesterday and 10 the day before — a significant jump,” he said.
“We’re seeing again a spread into suburbs in the Melbourne area, suburbs like Essendon West, Camberwell, Thornbury, Fitzroy North, Maidstone, all the way down to Sorrento.”
Just 16 of the latest cases were in isolation during their infectious period, with Premier Daniel Andrews saying the low figure was “a significant concern”.
He flagged clusters in Shepparton and parts of Melbourne’s inner west, saying they were a “particular challenge”.
Of today’s new cases, 14 are linked to the Shepparton outbreak and 10 are traced back to the Newport cluster.
Another eight have been traced to a childcare centre at Broadmeadows, five to the Royal Melbourne Hospital and 12 are household contacts of existing cases.
The remaining 22 are listed as mystery cases.
Mr Weimar said the childcare centre outbreak appeared to be coming under control.
But he said he remained concerned about loose ends around St Kilda despite no new cases being found in this area.
Twenty-nine Victorians are in hospital with Covid, with nine receiving intensive care.
There were 46,446 test results received over the past 24 hours and 22,191 doses of the vaccine delivered.
There are 52,566 vaccination appointments available at state-run hubs and clinics over the next week, with Mr Andrews revealing an alarming number of vaccine bookings going to waste.
“We have about 10,000 people a day who are either no-shows or cancelling — double what it was a week ago … if you have a vaccine appointment, please honour that appointment,” he said.
“Come forward. As the chief health officer says, the best vaccine is the one that is available
today.
“Getting vaccinated today is better than joining the queue in a fortnight, particularly if you are in that queue with hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of thousands of others.”
TESTING PUSH FOR YOUNG MEN Health authorities are urging young men in the western suburbs to get tested as the Newport Covid outbreak continues to grow.
More than 350 close contacts are in isolation in the western suburb and its surrounds after the outbreak swelled to 61 active cases, with Mr Weimar appealing to young men who are active in the community.
“I’m particularly appealing to younger men in the Newport, Altona, and Altona North area: If you are active in the community, in your 20s and 30s, if you are connected to the footy club or the gyms … please come forward and get tested,” he said.
“We really are concerned about this ongoing emergence of cases in the Newport area.”
The Covid commander again highlighted the number of schoolchildren falling seriously ill, saying the Delta variant was affecting all age groups.
Nearly a quarter of Victoria’s 44 active cases are children under the age of 10, with 100 aged between 10 and 19.
“We have examples of children collapsing and vomiting at school, that is how ill they are,” Mr Weimar said.
“And then we go to the house and we realise a number of people in the household are positives, very symptomatic.”
A baby is among the Victorians receiving intensive care, along with one person in their 20s, one in their 30s, five in their 40s, and two in their 50s. None of the ICU patients have been vaccinated.
Victorian Commander of Testing Jeroen Weimar says there have been examples of children collapsing at school and vomiting at school and DHHS staff then realise a number of people in their household are positive
NSW CASES CONTINUE TO RISE It comes as NSW recorded 818 new locally acquired cases of Covid-19, along with three deaths of people aged in their 80s.
The source of infection for 698 cases is under investigation.
Forty-two cases were infectious in the community, and the isolation status of 714 cases remains under investigation.
Forty-seven cases were in isolation throughout their infectious period and 15 were in isolation for part of their infectious period.
New restrictions came into place at 12.01am with residents in Sydney’s 12 hotspot LGAs limited to one hour of outdoor exercise. A curfew is in place from 9pm to 5am and garden, office, hardware and pet supply stores must close, except for click and collect.
Everyone in NSW must now wear a mask outside their home, and Greater Sydney residents must apply for a permit to enter regional NSW.
PROBE INTO ALLEGED FUNERAL BREACH Authorities are investigating reports of a large Shepparton funeral, held on August 11 between lockdowns, but potentially attended by people from NSW.
Victoria Police Chief Commissioner Shane Patton told 3AW’s Neil Mitchell he was aware of a “large funeral” held in the town.
Shepparton has now been linked to a cluster of more than 20 cases.
Commissioner Patton said the health department was “looking at the numbers” and whether the funeral had breached any restrictions.
He made the comments after revealing police had issued more than 120 infringement notices for Covid breaches on the weekend after receiving more than 5400 calls to the police assistance line.
“We’ve had a lot of private gatherings — some public, but lots of private gatherings in apartments,” he told the show.
“People are still having dinner parties. The public are being very conscious in reporting people.
“That’s a good thing we think, the vast majority of people want to comply.”
NED-3889-Melbourne-lockdown-restrictions
RMH BRACES FOR MORE CASES Health officials have increased protective measures for emergency department staff as officials brace for more Covid cases from one of Melbourne’s busiest hospitals.
PPE requirements in emergency departments have been increased to their highest level, with staff to wear N95 masks, gowns and eye protection while dealing with all patients in a bid to prevent them catching coronavirus.
Pre-operative testing — introduced during last year’s second wave but later revoked — will again be reinstated for all but the most urgent surgical cases, and on-site staff numbers will be scaled back.
It comes as 450 medical staff at the Royal Melbourne Hospital are on forced leave after a Covid-infected Shepparton man had surgery at the hospital.
Covid response deputy secretary Kate Matson said people were failing to get tested as soon as they experienced symptoms, one of the key reasons behind rising case numbers.
“Our teams are working as hard as they possibly can to get on top of this. Victorians can work equally as hard by getting tested as soon as you’ve got a slight symptom,” Ms Matson said.
Vic Locally-acquired Covid-19
Victoria’s health network has been forced to re-implement pre-operative testing, with pressure mounting on the government to use rapid testing in all hospitals and high-risk settings.
It comes after the Shepparton man, treated as the source of the Royal Melbourne Hospital cluster – now at seven cases – was not tested before his surgery on August 12.
A family member who visited a patient in the same room as the man later tested positive to the virus, alerting the hospital to the outbreak.
Both Minister Foley and Ms Matson said there was “no evidence” Victoria’s health system had dropped the ball.
“At that point in time there wasn’t a known risk in Shepparton, so there was no reason to necessarily test that gentleman prior to his surgery,” Ms Matson said. “We are now working with our health system to reintroduce pre-operative testing given the community transmission.”
Contact tracers are unsure as to whether the man is epidemiologically linked to the wider Shepparton outbreak, which has grown to 23 cases.
“We don’t have a source case for the Shepparton outbreak yet, we’re not sure how the outbreak started. It could well be a new incursion from New South Wales, it may be something else we don’t know yet,” Ms Matson added.
All 23 Shepparton cases are believed to be linked by family, but it forced at least 100 Goulburn Valley health staff into isolation through exposure site links.
A new infection from Mansfield, which has since been connected to Shepparton, was also detected on Sunday, and will be included in Monday’s case numbers.
Meanwhile, authorities are working with 120 businesses in a Sunshine West industrial zone with repeated positive wastewater detections.
There are now 27 Victorians in hospital with Covid, including a child aged under five. None are vaccinated, despite 18 being eligible.
As NSW reported a record 830 cases, Prime Minister Scott Morrison said on Sunday it was “highly unlikely” Australia would get to zero cases, and the focus would move from case numbers to serious illness once vaccine targets were hit.
“You can’t live with lockdowns forever and at some point, you need to make that gear change,” he said.
Chief medical officer Paul Kelly said Doherty Institute modelling, which underpinned Australia’s four-step plan to ease restrictions once vaccination levels hit 70 and then 80 per cent, was still relevant despite rising infections.

PUBLIC SECTOR GETS PAID LEAVE FOR JABS Victoria’s entire public sector — including nurses, teachers, emergency service personnel and government workers — will be given paid leave to get vaccinated.
Health Minister Martin Foley announced the measures on Sunday in a bid to get more Victorians vaccinated as part of the state’s drive to administer one million doses in five weeks.
It would give the entire public sector up to half a day’s paid time to get each dose of the vaccine.
The paid time off applies in addition to accrued sick leave, which can be used if people experience adverse side effects.
It will apply to full-time and part-time staff, as well as regular casuals in various roles at departments, administrative offices, statutory authorities, government schools, TAFEs, emergency services and other public sector agencies.
But the private sector is calling for vaccine incentives for all Victorians.
Small Business Australia executive director Bill Lang said small business families had no legal or financial support to help encourage employees to get the shot.
“If we are going to give the day off to those who do get jabbed, then let’s give that opportunity to all workers, not only the favoured few who must, given they have had zero financial impact, pay rises and seen their personal wealth increased, think that surviving a pandemic is as easy as a day watching Netflix,” Mr Lang said.
Opposition Leader Michael O’Brien said the new leave payments didn’t represent a substitute for a “real plan” to get more vaccines off the shelf and into arms.
Industrial Relations Minister Tim Pallas strongly encouraged all employers, including those in the private sector, to put in place similar arrangements.
STUDENTS FIGHT FOR FAIR GO, HOPE AND A PLAN Education Minister James Merlino will hold urgent talks about mental health pressures with VCE students who have spent 40 per cent of their past two years learning from home.
He told the Herald Sun he “won’t waste a second getting students of all year levels back in classrooms as soon as the health advice allows”.
Mr Merlino has agreed to have a virtual meeting next week with VCE students to talk about the pathway towards October exams.
“We’ve already laid out a plan for year 12s in their crucial last months of school to give them clarity on their final exam periods,” Mr Merlino said.
His plan for VCE includes an on-campus GAT on September 9 and allowances for on-campus student assessments where they can’t be done virtually.
But there was no mention of bringing VCE students back to campus if remote learning continues beyond September 2, or a commitment for the priority vaccination of staff and students.
Morgan Vella, a year 12 student from Kyabram P-12 College, who started a petition asking for exams to be delayed and the content to be reduced, has agreed to a meeting with the state government.
“It’s sad to say a lot of year 12s have been trying to commit suicide and it’s really awful,” he said.
The meeting will include year 12 students from the VCE What’s the Plan Dan group (#vcewhatstheplandan) who are asking for clarity, compassion and immediate vaccination of teachers and students to expedite a return to face-to-face learning.
The group organised a “shadow pandemic” protest in which students left their bags out the front of their houses at 5.45pm on Sunday.
Liv, 17, says students “just want a plan to give us hope for our futures and to be given a fair go”.
ROLL UP AT NEW HUB The state’s second drive-through centre will begin vaccinating Victorians with Pfizer on Monday from the comfort of their vehicles.
The former Ford Factory site in Campbellfield has been turned into a makeshift vaccination centre, with about 2000 people expected to get inoculated a week.
The centre, managed by St Vincent’s Hospital, Hume City Council and the Department of Health, will stock Pfizer, with AstraZeneca expected to be added soon. Drive-up appointments are not yet available, and bookings are required.
St Vincent’s Hospital chief executive Angela Nolan said the centre provided another option for people in Melbourne’s north to get vaccinated.
The Campbellfield site is one of four drive-in vaccination hubs across the state. Sites have also been set up at Sandown Racecourse, Springvale, and Eagle Stadium in Werribee.

MUSIC WON’T STOP FOR PORT PHILLIP Musicians, bands and live music venues will have their bills paid for gigs cancelled due to Covid-19 lockdowns in a bid to keep the struggling industry alive.
The City of Port Phillip will become the first council in Australia to pay promoters and band rooms up to $5000 a week to help make ends meet until the end of the year.
In another first, the council will pay pubs and venues $250 to hire musicians from the likes of St Kilda, Port Melbourne, Elwood and South Melbourne to play once lockdowns end.
Melbourne musician Patrick Pierce – of Melbourne duo The Pierce Brothers – said it would be a godsend to artists left high and dry by the cancellation of live music.
“This time people are starting to feel the sting a bit more … some people are looking at moving out of Australia and heading to US because they are struggling,’’ he said. “But I think we can start seeing the light at the end of the tunnel as well.’’
The Please Don’t Stop the Music campaign will be funded with money saved from the cancellation of the 2021 St Kilda Festival.Victoria Vaccine Locator

Full text: Victoria Police made 218 arrests and issued 236 fines after an estimated 4000 protesters stormed Melbourne’s CBD yesterday, with police deploying levels of force not before seen during a “freedom” protest. The protests came as regional Victoria joined Melbourne in lockdown as the Shepparton cluster grew to 21 cases. In NSW, a record 825 new cases were recorded, but violent protests were suppressed in a police crackdown that saw more than 1500 officers deployed.
Paige Taylor, Greg Bearup 11.30pm: Slow swab results hamper regional Covid battle
Major delays in testing have significantly hampered efforts to stop the spread of Covid-19 in the NSW west, with officials now concerned it may have reached regional Victoria and South Australia.
Confidential situation reports, written by federal health officials and obtained by The Australian, note some testing swabs were being sent to Sydney’s Westmead Hospital to help with the volume.
“This may result in delayed ­notifications by 24-48 hours and show artificial lull in numbers,” the document from Saturday reads.
“NSW Health are strained across the state and are conducting in excess of 150,000 tests a day, and exploiting private pathology to cover shortfall.”
Separately, Covid-19 test samples from Wilcannia had not been taken to the medical hub of ­Broken Hill for analysis for several days because the ­contractor hired by NSW Health “didn’t work weekends”.
“We don’t know if we now have 23 cases or if we have 53 or f..king 63,” a source familiar with the matter said on Sunday.

Ellie Dudley 10.45pm: Grave fears for Indigenous in suburbs
Almost half of the Covid-19 cases detected in NSW’s Aboriginal population have been in southwest and western Sydney, as health experts cite grave concerns for the high-risk community.
One hundred and nine of the 226 cases diagnosed so far in the state’s Indigenous community have been detected in the Liverpool (44), Penrith (24) and Parramatta (41) local health districts.
While fears are rife for Indigenous communities in regional NSW, where case numbers have reached almost 90 during the ­latest outbreak, health experts are becoming increasingly concerned for Sydney’s Indigenous population.
“Covid has highlighted incredible health inequity and we see that most in the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander communities,” Western Sydney University chair of general practice Jenny Reath said.
“Often those communities have more crowded housing, often have underlying health problems, poorer access to healthcare which puts them at high risk of Covid and higher risk of much worse consequences.
“This is why it’s such a concern for us when it gets into the ­community.”
Professor Reath said the “connectedness” of Aboriginal Australians was a blessing and a curse when battling a pandemic.

Dennis Shanahan 10pm: PM must manage to lead rather than lead to manage
Scott Morrison has finally stepped up on national leadership and is taking on the premiers threatening continued lockdowns.
The Prime Minister is turning the shield of medical advice that states have used to justify border closures and business shutdowns into a sword to fight for reopening.
Morrison is essentially saying the premiers are misinterpreting the Doherty Institute expert medical advice on lifting social and economic restrictions when vaccination rates reach 70 and 80 per cent.
This is an all-out attempt to take control of not only the ­national narrative on Covid-19, the Delta variant and lockdowns but also the national argument.
After months of prolix media conferences where there were too many words and not enough mess­ages, Morrison has reacted to the threat to the national health challenge, the viability of vaccin­ations, the economic recovery and declining social and political state of the public mind by parochial and oppositionist state leaders.
Instead of waiting for parliament to sit or for the 53rd meeting of national cabinet, Morrison has launched a targeted campaign, based on Doherty Institute advice, to use public pressure to get the premiers to honour their collective agreement on a national phased opening of society and the economy when vaccination levels reached 70 and 80 per cent.

Remy Varga 9.15pm: Hospital workers forced to stay home
The Delta variant has breached major hospitals in Melbourne, increasing pressure on the healthcare system as hundreds of potentially exposed staff are forced to stand down.
Victorian contact tracers believe a man from Shepparton, in northern Victoria, brought the virus to the Royal Melbourne Hospital when he travelled to the city to undergo surgery.
Health Department deputy secretary Kate Matson said the man then infected a woman with whom he shared a room in the cardiac ward who in turned infected a visitor.
Ms Matson said “hundreds” of staff members had been stood aside after the three positive cases emerged on Saturday, but she did not have a firm number yet, saying the man had visited the Royal Melbourne’s radiology and intensive care units.
The Royal Melbourne outbreak comes after a positive case visited the Werribee Mercy Hospital last Thursday, with a spokeswoman on Sunday confirming 83 staff members remained ­stood aside.
Western Health executive ­director of operations Natasha Toohey said 160 staff members had been stood down across various hospitals after being exposed at various sites. A medical imaging worker at Footscray Hospital tested positive on Thursday.

Richard Ferguson, Joe Kelly 8.30pm: US gives a cold shoulder on doses
The US has not given the Morrison government any vaccines throughout the course of the coronavirus pandemic, as tension points between the Biden White House and Canberra build.
Despite President Joe Biden promising to give Covid-19 vaccine doses to needy nations, the Health Department this weekend confirmed Australia had neither bought or received any shots from the US.
The vaccine confirmation comes weeks after The Australian revealed Scott Morrison’s government made as-yet-unanswered requests to the Biden administration for extra Pfizer doses, despite substantial support from US congress leaders.
The Morrison government was attacked last week by the US’s deputy envoy on climate change over its emission reductions policies, and the Prime Minister is yet to speak to Mr Biden about the Afghanistan withdrawal.
Foreign policy experts are warning the Australia cannot expect the US to be the same ally it has been in previous years and must become more self-reliant.
ANU defence and strategic studies analyst Hugh White said on Sunday Mr Biden was “unsentimental” about Australia and Washington was not prepared to help Mr Morrison on vaccines over developing countries.
“The Biden administration, like the Trump administration before it, is demonstrating that it is wholly unsentimental about Australia … We think we’re their little mates, but US policy ­towards Australia has always been determined by how much we help their strategic interests,” Professor White said.

Olivia Caisley 7.45pm: Disability sector cluster worries ACT leaders
The ACT has identified a Covid-19 cluster within Canberra’s disability sector as the territory’s cases rose by 19 infections to 121.
ACT Chief Minister Andrew Barr on Sunday said 14 people in the disability sector had been ­infected with the virus, including Canberrans living with a disability and their support workers.
“The government acknowledges the anxiety that this is causing and can advise that we have been actively supporting the affected individuals,” he said.
Health Minister Rachel Stephen-Smith confirmed four people with a disability were among the positive cases, as well as, seven ACT-based disability support workers and one trades person. She said five disability service providers were directly affected.
Ms Stephen-Smith said another two disability workers, who lived in neighbouring NSW, also tested positive for the virus.
She said low vaccination rates among people with disabilities in the ACT had been a constant “source of frustration” for her.

Evin Priest 7pm: Vax leave for public sector
Nurses, ambos, police and firefighters will be among the public sector employees given paid time off when getting a Covid-19 jab, the Victorian government announced on Sunday.
Health Minister Martin Foley on Sunday announced public sector employees could now access up to half a day’s paid time off to get each dose of the vaccine.
The initiative applies to full-time and part-time staff as well as long-term and regular casuals at departments and administrative offices, statutory authorities, government schools, TAFE institutes, police and emergency services, water and land management authorities and other public entities.

AFP 6.15pm: Storm, not Covid, the NY party pooper
New York City shut down its star-studded concert meant to mark its “homecoming” in the wake of the pandemic’s worst devastation over the threat of severe weather as Hurricane Henri churned closer.
Barry Manilow, who was on a line-up that included Bruce Springsteen, Patti Smith and Paul Simon, was cut off mid-song by a booming voice urging concert goers to proceed swiftly but calmly to the nearest exit due to approaching storm clouds.
Some 60,000 people were expected at the concert in Central Park on Saturday night, as the hurricane, packing maximum sustained winds near 120km/h per hour and heavy rain, was drawing closer to making landfall sometime on Sunday.

Peter Van Onselen 5.30pm: Hunt shuns NSW plea for ADF jab hubs
Greg Hunt has ignored requests from the NSW government for defence personnel to establish special vaccination centres in Sydney’s west and southwest.
The Australian has confirmed the federal Health Minister’s NSW counterpart, Brad Hazzard, wrote to Mr Hunt in early August requesting the Australian Defence Force open several vaccination centres in Sydney and in the state’s west. The commonwealth has yet to provide a formal response.
Health authorities in NSW are scrambling to vaccinate those living in high-risk suburbs in Sydney’s west and southwest, with the state recording a daily record of 830 infections on Sunday.
But commonwealth officials, speaking on condition of anonymity, accused the NSW government of leaking the letter and “playing politics”, noting ADF-run vaccination hubs had been established in the state’s west, where access points were limited.
The officials also said NSW health authorities had dismissed the need for similar hubs in Greater Sydney – as requested in Mr Hazzard’s letter – because there was “ample access to vaccinations at GP clinics and pharmacies littered across the city”.
The Australian understands that NSW Health and NSW Police made it clear to federal officials they thought it was unnecessary to divert ADF from operations to run dedicated vaccination clinics when there are already over 2000 GPs, pharmacies and commonwealth centres doing this.

Steve Zamek 4.45pm: Virus contact hit with $5,000 fine for isolation breach
A Lake Macquarie woman has been hit with a $5000 fine for flouting NSW public health directions by visiting a house half an hour away while under isolation orders.
NSW Police deputy commissioner Gary Worboys revealed the woman had been slugged with the hefty penalty as officers handed out 940 penalty infringement notices across the state on Saturday.
NSW Police officers and ADF personnel conducted over 5000 compliance checks on people who had been ordered to self-isolate either because of a positive test or because they were a contact of a confirmed case.
Officers conducted one of those spot-checks on a residence at Lake Macquarie where four people were meant to be quarantining.
However only three people came to the door when asked by officers, with a fourth woman found a short time later at a residence in Kurri Kurri, about 40kms away in the nearby Hunter Region.
“That person was directed to return back to her residence, which she did and was issued a $5000 penalty infringement notice,” deputy commissioner Worboys said.
He said that the residence would now be subject to greater scrutiny and further checks.
“People need to understand that if you are under one of these orders, you need to stay put, you need to do what is asked of you,” he said.
“In this instance where you have someone that clearly puts people at risk and goes outside of the agreement that has been reached, we will put that to the top of the list.
“In that particular residence, with those four people inside, will now be checked on a more frequent basis to make sure that compliance is achieved.”
On Saturday, NSW Police charged 47 people and fined 260 after they successfully disrupted a planned “freedom” protest in theSydney CBD.
In a major show of strength, more than 1500 officers were placed on patrol around the city, setting up road blocks and compliance checks.
Officers clashed with a small number of people but successfully snuffed out a repeat of last month’s anti-lockdown protests in the CBD.

Steve Zamek 4.20pm: Panic buying hits Bunnings stores
Sydney Bunnings stores have been beset by panic buying as the hardware giant gets set to close its doors to walk-in retail shoppers on Monday.
There were reports of mammoth waits and queues as customers rushed into stores on Saturday and Sunday.
The NSW government has placed restrictions on retail stores as health authorities attempt to quell the latest Covid-19 outbreak due to the Delta variant.
From Monday, retailers in 12 local government areas of concern are being forced to close their stores and only offer click and collect services.
However, Bunnings has decided to close all of its stores across greater Sydney to walk-in retail customers.
All stores will still be open for tradies.
“With the new restrictions on retail spanning a large part of Sydney, Bunnings has made the decision to temporarily close all its stores across Greater Sydney to the general public,” Bunnings managing director Mike Schneider said.
“This is in support of the government and for the safety and security of team members, customers and the community.
“We know from experience that applying a consistent approach across a metropolitan area is easier for our team to manage and helps reduce travel by residents between LGAs.
Despite all customers still being able to shop via click and collect and delivery services, there were reports of massive line-ups and packed stores on Saturday and Sunday.

Erin Lyons 4.00pm: Young Covid patient’s plea from hospital
An unvaccinated young Covid patient has described his horrific symptoms from his western Sydney hospital bed, saying he felt like something was stuck in his chest and he wakes up in sweats.
Jett Stanton, who is just 21 years of age, was a close contact of a known case and returned a positive result on Wednesday.
Mr Stanton, who was unvaccinated, is now recovering in Liverpool Hospital. His two unvaccinated housemates have also tested positive but his girlfriend, who was fully vaccinated, was negative.
His condition rapidly deteriorated and triggered severe anxiety attacks which prompted his girlfriend to call an ambulance on Thursday night.
Speaking to NCA NewsWire on the phone from his hospital bed on Sunday, Mr Stanton said he had no underlying health conditions, was active, ate well and didn’t smoke or drink.
But despite his healthy lifestyle, he said Covid made him fear for his life.
He has issued a desperate plea for people to take coronavirus seriously, even if they are young like him, and follow all the rules and isolate.
“I was super drowsy and I was losing my sense of smell,” he said.
“I remember I had the most uncomfortable cold sweats I’ve ever had in my life, and I still do.
“Over time new symptoms started to pop up like stabbing chest pain and uncontrollable coughing. I felt like something was caught in my throat and chest.”
He said symptoms came in waves, one moment he was fine and the next he felt like he’d been hit by a bus.
“I was on the phone to mum last night about 10.30pm and I felt really good but at about 10.45pm I thought I was going to pass out,” Mr Stanton said.
“And I don’t even know if this is going to be the worst day yet. Symptoms can be worse in the second week.”
His housemates who were also unvaccinated tested positive but Mr Stanton’s vaccinated girlfriend returned a negative result.
“My girlfriend was at risk of catching Covid but she’s the only one that came back negative. It just goes to show that vaccines definitely work,” he said.
“It’s fair enough everyone’s scared of the side effects but that’s just the nature of vaccines.
“Every vaccine will have side effects.”
NSW recorded 830 new infections on Sunday, breaking the record for daily case numbers and there were fears more dark dayswere ahead.
Mr Stanton, who moved to Sydney from Brisbane to pursue a skateboarding career, warned others that Covid-19 wasn’t just an old person disease.
“I’m a pretty healthy individual. I’ve never been drunk in my life, I don’t smoke and I take vitamins daily. I eat healthy and I’m an athlete but I still feel like my life was threatened by the virus,” he said.
He then issued a stern message to others, not to break the rules.
“People are obviously just too privileged to realise what they actually have,” Mr Stanton said.
“They don’t know how good they have it. So the fact they’re protesting for their freedoms is disgusting.”
There are currently 557 Covid-19 cases in hospital with 94 people in intensive care, 31 of which were on a ventilator.

Joseph Lam 3.32pm: Lockdown protesters storm Queensland-NSW border
Police have clashed with more than 2000 people who stormed the Queensland-NSW border in protest of lockdown measures on Sunday.
Protesters marched between Boundary St in Coolangatta and Cafe D’Bar and the Twin Towns Resort while shouting profanities at police.
Among those protesting pandemic measures was a man on a horse who was seen galloping past protesters and police while calling for everyone to “cross the border”.
“Everyone cross the border, they can’t hold all of us,” he was heard yelling as he rode past.

The protest follows more than 5000 gathering in Brisbane’s Botanic Gardens in the CBD on Saturday.
Queensland Deputy Premier described Saturday’s protest as a complete disregard for the health of others.
“Frankly I’m pretty disgusted,” he said. “By having a protest there they have put the safety of our police at risk, they put their own safety at risk and they put the safety of the community at risk.”
“The border is our riskiest place right now. We have to see the situation in NSW the same way we’ve seen the situation in other countries throughout this pandemic.”

Joseph Lam 3.14pm: No revamp need for Doherty reopening modelling: CMO
The Doherty Institute modelling “underpinning” Australia’s transition out of lockdown “absolutely” does not need to be revamped, says Chief Medical Officer Paul Kelly.
Despite the modelling being based on fewer case numbers, Professor Kelly on Sunday said there was no question it could be tweaked.
“Does this need to go back to the drawing board, absolutely not. The assumptions of all modelling can be changed,” he said.
“And sensitivity analysis, that is the technical term for what has been done by the Doherty Institute, can be relatively and easily done.
“Let’s see and have an open mind to what our modellers can show us and I have full faith in the group.”
Professor Kelly sent a strong reminder that the modelling was universally agreed upon.
“To be very clear, there is an agreement to national cabinet ... all states are unanimous in that,” he said.
“Other states will be at 70 to 80 per cent vaccination rates and the more nuanced local elements of that will be worked out over the coming weeks with the Doherty (Institute) modelling, not the only element we would consider in relation to that.”

Joseph Lam 2.47pm: Nation records 917 cases but hospitals ready: CMO
Australia recorded its highest number of Covid-19 cases since the pandemic began on Sunday, a peak of 917 cases.
While the lion’s share were recorded in NSW, which reported 830 cases in the 24 hours to 8pm on Saturday, other jurisdictions were also seeing high numbers, said Chief Medical Officer Paul Kelly.
“We are seeing an increase in the numbers of cases, particularly in NSW but also here where I am in the ACT and also Victoria, mostly in Melbourne but more recently in Shepparton,” he said.
In that same period, the nation put 196,000 jabs in arms across the country, hitting 1.4 million over a four-day period.
Professor Kelly said the government was seeing an increasing number of patients present to hospital and intensive care.
“This is something we’ve been planning for for 18 months, exactly this sort of situation,” he said. “And we know that our hospitals, particularly our intensive care (units), are ready for this - and they are.
“From what we did right at the beginning of the pandemic, was to prepare for this type of
event of severe cases of Covid (which) is the reason why we had so much work in the lockdown measures and so forth.”

Agencies 2.30pm: NZ queries elimination strategy as outbreak grows
New Zealand conceded its ambitious “Covid zero” elimination strategy may no longer be viable Sunday, as an outbreak of the virulent Delta variant continued to spread.
Covid-19 Response Minister Chris Hipkins reported a further 21 cases in a virus cluster that emerged in Auckland last week, ending a six-month run of no local cases and sparking a national lockdown.
Hipkins said Delta’s highly transmissible nature was making this outbreak more difficult to contain than others, raising “big questions” about the elimination strategy.
“The scale of infectiousness and the speed at which the virus has spread is something that, despite all the best preparations in the world, has put our system under strain,” he told TVNZ.
New Zealand’s widely praised Covid-19 response -- which has resulted in just 26 deaths in a population of five million -- centres on eliminating the virus from the community.
It has relied on strict border controls backed by hard lockdowns when any cases do slip through, but Hipkins said Delta may force a rethink.
“(Delta’s) like nothing we’ve dealt with before in this pandemic,” he said. “It does change everything, it means that all of our existing preparations begin to look less adequate and raises some pretty big questions about the future of our long-term plans.” Neighbouring Australia has also pursued a “Covid zero” strategy and been similarly frustrated as its Delta cases continue to spike.
The New Zealand outbreak has underlined the country’s slow vaccination rollout and prompted accusations the government became lax after its early success dealing with the pandemic.
Only about 20 percent of the population is fully inoculated, one of the lowest rates in the developed world.
Opposition National Party spokesman Chris Bishop said the outbreak had exposed a lack of urgency in Wellington’s vaccine plans.
“The government’s complacency and inability to ensure supply and delivery of the vaccine has made us all sitting ducks, completely vulnerable to the Delta variant when it inevitably got into the community,” he said.
Another opposition figure, ACT Party leader David Seymour, said Hipkins could not use the Delta variant as an excuse for current failures.
“We’ve known about Delta since December, what’s he been doing in the meantime?” he asked.
Hipkins said elimination remained top priority for the ongoing Delta outbreak, which now totals 71 active cases -- 65 of them in Auckland and six in Wellington.
The national lockdown is due to expire late Tuesday, although Hipkins indicated Auckland could face further restrictions even if they were lifted elsewhere.
“If I was an Aucklander, I’d certainly be preparing to be at home for a bit longer,” he said.

Yoni Bashan 2.05pm: NSW Health won’t reveal illegal party details to cops
EXCLUSIVE: NSW Health is refusing to provide information to police about an allegedly illegal gathering that occurred in the Sydney suburb of Maroubra, which has resulted in at least 16 cases of Covid-19 and numerous exposure sites to emerge in the local government area.
The Australian has established that police have requested information about the August 14 event from NSW Health, including the address where it occurred and the names of the attendees.
These details have not been provided and police said in a statement they remain willing to investigate the matter once the details are forthcoming.
“When information is provided about positive cases in the community, police will be responsive and take appropriate steps to limit the spread of the virus, in line with the Public Health Order requirements,” a spokesperson said.
Health Minister Brad Hazzard said on Saturday that up to 60 people attended the event and expressed anger at those who had defied health orders across the state. Mr Hazzard has been contacted for comment.
Police Minister David Elliott told The Australian: “It’s very frustrating NSW Health are not forthcoming with information given police are simply trying to enforce Health’s own public health orders.”

Steve Zemek 1.40pm: NSW Central Coast residents on alert after Covid found in sewage
Tens of thousands of residents on NSW’s Central Coast have been warned to be on alert for Covid-19 symptoms after fragments of the virus were detected in sewage.
NSW Health testing recently detected traces of the virus at a facility in Bateau Bay.
The plant services about 39,000 residents in Bateau Bay, Blue Bay, Killarney Vale, Long Jetty, Shelly Beach, The Entrance, The Entrance North and Toowoon Bay.
NSW Health said they were concerned that it could represent an undiagnosed case of coronavirus.
“This detection is of particular concern as there are no known cases in the Bateau Bay area,” NSW Health said in a statement.
“Everyone in this area is urged to monitor for the onset of symptoms, and if they appear, to immediately be tested and isolate until a negative result is received.”
Elsewhere in the state, fragments of the virus had also been detected at a sewage treatment facility in Parkes, which services around 11,600 local residents.
NSW Health said there had been 36 new cases in western NSW among 830 new cases statewide to 8pm on Saturday night.
The majority of the cases were in Dubbo and surrounding towns, although there have been positive cases detected in Bathurst, Wellington, Bourke, Narromine, Gulargambone and Orange.
“Our particular concern for Orange … is that while we had two reported (cases) to 8pm last night, we had overnight an additional four cases,” Deputy chief health officer Marianne Gale said.
“Making that a total of six cases in Orange. So all residents of Orange please come forward to get tested.”
NSW Health has set up two new testing facilities in Orange at the Wade Park Sports Ground and Orange Showground.
There were also two new cases in far western NSW, in Wilcannia and Broken Hill.
“For the residents of the far west, please come forward for testing,” Dr Gale said.
“We remain concerned about the risk for anyone who has spent time in Wilcannia, so please come for testing.”

Remy Varga 1.10pm: Shepparton patient brought Covid to Melbourne Hospital
Contact tracers believe the outbreak at the Royal Melbourne Hospital was sparked after a man travelled from Shepparton to Melbourne for surgery.
Health Department deputy secretary Kate Matson said the Shepparton man is believed to have infected a woman with whom he was sharing a room after his procedure.
She in turn is believed to have infected a woman visiting her in hospital.
Ms Matson said “hundreds” of Royal Melbourne workers would need to be stood down and said the man had been tested after his surgery and not before.
“At that point in time there wasn’t a known risk in Shepparton so at that point in time there was no reason to necessarily test that gentleman prior to his surgery,” she said.
“We are now working with our health system to reintroduce preoperative testing, given the community transmission.”

Paige Taylor 1.05pm: Sydney workers fanning western NSW outbreak
Western New South Wales residents have brought more Covid-19 to the region by employing infected people from Sydney to do work in their homes and in their businesses, according to assistant police commissioner Jeff McKenzie.
There were 36 new confirmed cases of Covid-19 in the 24 hours to 8pm on Saturday, bringing the total number of active cases of the virus in western NSW health district to 253. Of those new cases, a third were infectious while in the community. Of those 36 new cases, 23 were in Dubbo.
The figures announced at a press conference at noon in Dubbo did not include four additional cases confirmed on Sunday morning in Orange, which has recorded a total of six new cases since Friday night. Also not included were 19 cases of Covid-19 in the outback town of Wilcannia, where cases are counted separately because the tiny Aboriginal community is in a separate health district from Dubbo.
Mr McKenzie said tracing proved that residents ignoring lockdown rules had spread the virus to some of the most inaccessible parts of the state.
However, the arrival of infected workers from Sydney was also spreading Covid-19, he said.
He said his officers continued to encounter people who were “telling lies, being dishonest and infecting our communities”.
“If you are hiring people, if you’re engaging people to do work from Sydney, you really need to have a think about it - have a plan and make sure they are following the rules?” he said.
“Some are not and they are bringing Covid into our towns.
“Think of what you are doing when you are accepting someone from that area into your workplace, into your home
... it is not on at the moment and you need to be so careful.”
Mr McKenzie said the Australian Defence Force would begin arriving in some of the most remote locations in NSW in coming days to vaccinate residents. The ADF would move around administering Covid-19 vaccinations for the next 10 weeks. The aim was to vaccinate as many people as possible twice.

Robyn Ironside 1pm: Jabs won’t equal freedom in Queensland
The Queensland government has stepped away from easing border restrictions when national vaccination rates reach 80 per cent, saying that figure was agreed to prior to the New South Wales Covid outbreak.
As Queensland recorded another day with zero cases in contrast to New South Wales’ 830 infections, Deputy Premier Steven Miles said reopening borders would depend on much more than vaccination rates.
Backed by deputy chief health officer James Smith, Mr Miles said case loads, hospitalisations and the situation in other states all needed to be taken into consideration.
“We’re not going to get ahead of ourselves. We look to what’s happening in New South Wales every day and adjust our posture accordingly,” said Mr Miles.
“It’s why we’ve got this new strictest ever border in place right now and why we’re racing to get as many people vaccinated as we can because we want to achieve those thresholds. We’re signed up and committed to the plan that national cabinet endorsed but that was a plan that was endorsed before the New South Wales outbreak.”

Christine Kellett 11.58am: ACT records 19 new cases, one linked to ANU
The ACT has recorded 19 new local cases of Covid, six of them in the community during their infectious period.
Seventeen of the new cases are linked to a known outbreak, while two have a mystery origin.
One of the cases is linked to the Australian National University and is under investigation. Health authorities are also dealing with a cluster of about a dozen cases in the disability sector.
“Unfortunately we have a small cluster of cases in our disability community,” ACT Cheif Minister Andrew Barr has told a press conference.
“This includes people living with disability and disability support workers. The overnment acknowledges the anxiety that this is causing and can advise that we have been actively supporting the affected individuals and the broader community and the Minister will talk further to this.”

Christine Kellett 11.47am: NSW ‘weeks away from more normality’, focus on jabs
Despite infection rates closing in on 1000 per day in NSW, Health Minister Brad Hazzard says the state is just “weeks away from normality” as the focus remains on vaccinations.
Mr Hazzard said the state was approaching 31 per cent fully vaccinated, with jab rates increasing at about six per cent per day. He said 58 per cent had received a first dose.
He said he was not worried about the health system being over-run with Covid patients, thanks to intensive care capacity added at the beginning of the pandemic. Five hundred and fifty people are now in hospital with Covid, including 94 in ICU and more than 30 requiring ventilation.
“I’m confident as we move forward, towards 80 per cent we will have a lot more normality in our lives and we are only weeks away now,” Mr Hazzard told a press conference on Sunday.
“So if our community keeps getting their vaccines the way they are, New South Wales will look pretty good by October, November. I’m really encouraged by the positivity in the community in getting vaccinated.”
Earlier, Prime Minister Scott Morrison also doubled down on the plan to begin reopening at 70 per cent, saying a return to Covid zero was now “highly unlikely”.
Christine Kellett 11.26am: 60 of new NSW cases infectious in the community
Authorities say about 60 people were in the community during their infectious period.
Minister Hazzard acknowledged the “major dilemma” NSW was in at the moment, he said nearly 58 per cent of eligible people had now recieved a first dose, with three-quarters of a million doses administered in just seven days in the state.
“Each week, the total number of citizens who are getting one dose is increasing by about 6 per cent,” Mr Hazzard has told a press conference.
I” am advised that in fact, New South Wales is now amongst the highest, if not the highest, in the world in terms of vaccination rates.”

Remy Varga 10.18am: Victoria Police defend use of pepper bullets
Nine police officers were hospitalised after an anti-lockdown demonstration in Melbourne, in what Victoria Police say is one of the most violent protests seen in 20-years.
Chief Commissioner Shane Patton said the “vast majority” came prepared for violence against police, with thousands turning out armed with flares, beer bottles, marbles and ceramic insulators.
“One police officer was assaulted, pushed against a wall and when they went to the ground were repeatedly punched and possibly kicked,” he said.
Mr Patton said one officer remained in hospital and may have to undergo surgery on his leg while a couple had potentially suffered broken noses.
He said 250 people had been processed, more than a million dollars worth of fines issued two people had been remanded and 19 would be subject to court proceedings.
He said early intelligence suggested the majority of the around 5,000 protesters were angry men aged between 25-40 who were “intent on mayhem”.
Anti-lockdown protesters have clashed with police in major cities across Australia on a day when the nation recorded its highest daily tally of COVID-19 cases.
Mr Patton defended the use of pepper bullets by Victoria Police, saying they needed to de escalate the situation as protesters threw projectiles at officers on the scene.
“The risk that those people have now posed to the rest of the community by the conduct yesterday is disgraceful and it’s selfish,” he said.
“Those who confronted police and were involved in it, their conduct was disgraceful.
“My police officers that I said acted appropriately. They defended themselves. They took the necessary action they had to.”

Richard Ferguson 9.42am: Government finalising plan to vaccinate children
Scott Morrison says he understands growing concerns among parents about the spread of Covid-19 among the nation’s children, as he awaits advice on vaccinations.
The Prime Minister on Sunday said he still hoped to have most children vaccinated by the end of the year, with incoming advice due from vaccine experts on shots for kids under the age of 12.
“Those younger children who are impacted by the virus — that’s a terrible distress to any parent. As a parent, I understand that. Every parent understands that. Every Australian understands that,” he told ABC News.
“We will be looking to finalise our plans when it comes to the vaccination of children. We discussed it last Friday to ensure we want to do it as early as possible and certainly by the end of the terms, and before we get into the holiday period at the end of the year and we would hope a lot sooner than that.”

Richard Ferguson 9.31am: Morrison doubles down on 70 per cent push to reopen
Scott Morrison has warned Australians achieving zero Covid-19 cases is now “highly unlikely” with the Delta strain spreading, as he continues to push his reopening plan.
Premiers have been divided over whether the achievement of 70 per cent and 80 per cent vaccination rates will see the end of lockdowns and state border closures.
The Prime Minister on Sunday said while Covid-19 cases were unlikely to go to zero again, the country still needed to suppress the virus at this point.
“That’s highly unlikely, but that’s really not the point. The point is that we need to suppress the virus as best as we can in phase A of the national plan,” Mr Morrison told ABC News.
“The national plan then transfers our focus from case numbers to issues of hospitalisation, serious illness, ICU and things of that nature, and that is where the national plan takes us to.
“You can’t live with lockdowns forever and at some point you need to make that gear change, and that is done at 70 per cent because that’s where we are advised from the medical science that you can make that gear change.”

Richard Ferguson 8.45am: Zero Covid ‘very difficult to maintain’ says Doherty expert
The primary author of Australia’s post-pandemic reopening plan has warned “Zero Covid” policies will be very difficult to maintain after 80 per cent of adult Australians are vaccinated.
West Australian Premier Mark McGowan last week declared he would continue to pursue zero Covid-19 cases past the 80 per cent threshold and still consider using lockdowns and border closures, fracturing the national cabinet’s agreement to reopen.
Doherty Institute researcher Jodie McVernon, who was deeply involved in the creation of the vaccine thresholds for reopening, said even the best public health response would struggle to contain the delta strain.
“I think that will be a very challenging strategy to pursue into the future.We have seen how contagious these viruses are and we’ve seen how difficult it is to keep out,” she told Sky News.
“In jurisdictions that have had highly effective public health responses and contained outbreaks, you know, it has been getting away.”

John Ferguson 8.19am: Covid border skirmish strands students
Six country school children aged as young as 14 are stranded in rural NSW due to Covid-19 border closures, sparking an examination by the Victorian Ombudsman and concerns from parents about the students’ welfare.
Liberal Senator Sarah Henderson has warned the refusal by the Victorian government to allow the boarders from a regional NSW agricultural college to return directly to their families could constitute a breach of the state’s charter of human rights.
The children, aged 14 to 17, have been force to stay in rural NSW after the closure due to the pandemic of the Yanco Agricultural High School, which is next to Leeton in the Riverina.
Parents of six of the children have asked the Victorian government to allow the students to isolate on their Victorian properties, with daily police checks and the required testing.
Instead, the children have been told informally they must be drive by bus or flown to Melbourne to attend hotel quarantine for a fortnight.
Senator Henderson said a better approach was needed, particularly given that the children have been effectively isolating on farms.

Dow Jones 7.25am: Delta’s major shift from poor to affluent
The centre of the Covid-19 pandemic in America’s second-largest city has shifted from poor, crowded neighbourhoods to affluent ones with younger populations.
Across Los Angeles County, cities and neighborhoods including West Hollywood, Venice and Santa Monica now report some of the most infections, even though their vaccination rates are higher than in poorer areas such as East Los Angeles, where Covid-19 raced through families and neighbourhoods during earlier surges, county health data shows.
The shift is a consequence of the Delta variant, which spreads more easily among people who gather indoors in such places as bars, clubs and restaurants and can affect people who are vaccinated, according to doctors.
Los Angeles shows how the Delta variant is prompting a surge that is different from what occurred earlier. Some other cities across the country, facing signs of increases, are taking steps such as mandating masks or requiring proof of vaccination for indoor dining instead of measures including the lockdowns carried out early in the pandemic.
The newest surge of infections has public-health officials renewing calls for caution, regardless of vaccination status, as more people return to pre-pandemic activities. Though the fully vaccinated are far less likely to suffer serious illness or be hospitalized, according to hospitalization data from around the country, health officials in Los Angeles are now directing everyone to wear masks indoors and return to other precautions, including social distancing when possible.

Agencies 6.54am: Anti-vaccine demos in France for sixth weekend
Tens of thousands of people have demonstrated in the streets of France again against the government’s Covid-19 vaccination policies amid concern from rights groups about anti-Semitic sentiment in the protest movement.
Saturday’s marches were called for the sixth weekend in a row to denounce a “health pass” system announced by President Emmanuel Macron that they say unfairly restricts the rights of the unvaccinated.
The Ministry of the Interior put the number of people turning out at around 175,000 at 220 demonstrations nationwide, including 14,700 in Paris..
Under the new pass system, introduced progressively since mid-July, anyone wishing to enter a restaurant, theatre, cinema, long-distance train, or large shopping centre must show proof of vaccination or a negative test.
The protest movement has brought together conspiracy theorists, anti-vaxxers, former members of the “Yellow Vest” anti-government movement, as well as people concerned that the system unfairly creates a two-tier society.
Around 200,000 people have marched in previous weekends, according to interior ministry figures. Organisers claim the real number on previous weekends was double the figures estimated by police.

Christine Kellett 6.15am: NRL star caught ‘breaching Covid rules’ twice in an hour
Cronulla Sharks player Josh Dugan has denied breaching health orders, despite being stopped 150km from home.
Dugan was stopped by police at 11.30pm on Friday at the intersection of Main Street and the Great ­Western Highway in Lithgow.
Police said they spoke to Dugan, who lives in the Sutherland Shire, and a 30-year-old male passenger in a Jeep Cherokee who allegedly were not wearing masks, the Daily Telegraph reports.
“The driver allegedly told police they were moving to the area and were going to feed animals, however (we will allege he) later admitted they were heading to a friend’s house for the weekend,” a police spokesman said.
“They were directed to return home. About 40 minutes later, officers detected the same vehicle (allegedly) ­travelling away from Sydney towards Yetholme.
“The men were stopped and again directed to return to their homes.”
Both men are facing $10,000 in fines and possible charges.
Dugan was fined $25,000 by the NRL after being caught in June at a Potts Point restaurant in breach of the code’s strict biosecurity protocols.
He apologised for that incident, but plans to defend the most recent allegations and said he had all the necessary paperwork to prove “I didn’t breach bubble or government directions”.
Dugan’s $800,000-a-year Sharks contract reportedly expires in two months.

Rhiannon Down 5.30am: Police use new weapon in violent Melbourne protests
Victoria Police made 218 arrests and issued 236 fines after an estimated 4000 protesters stormed Melbourne’s CBD yesterday, with police deploying levels of force not before seen during a “freedom” protest.
Police were forced to deploy the most powerful nonlethal force available to dispel protesters, with officers firing pepper ball rounds into crowds. The pepper balls, described as the “leader in nonlethal solutions”, are filled with a chemical that irritates the eyes much like pepper spray and can be fired by a munition launcher that looks like a pistol. Police also used oleoresin capsicum (OC) foam to clear crowds out of the city.
Seven officers sustained injuries including two with suspected broken noses, one with a broken thumb and others with concussions, with six requiring hospitalisation.
Three of the arrested were charged with assaulting a police officer.
“While there were some peaceful protesters in attendance, the majority of those who attended came with violence in mind,” a police spokesperson said.
“The behaviour seen by police was so hostile and aggressive that they were left with no choice but to use all tactics available to them.”
Anti-lockdown protesters have clashed with police in major cities across Australia on a day when the nation recorded its highest daily tally of COVID-19 cases.
Police said investigations will continue into who was responsible for several flares being ignited on city streets.
Each protester issued with an infringement notice will be fined $5452 for breaching health directions.
In Sydney, NSW Police say they stopped about 250 people from protesting in Sydney’s CBD, laying scores of charges and fining more than 260 people.
NSW Police Minister David Elliot said the crackdown on the planned anti-lockdown “freedom” rally had “worked to perfection”.
About 1400 officers set up checkpoints and stopped 38,000 vehicles in the city and surrounds from 9am.
“This is not about stopping freedom of speech, it’s about a temporary stop to the freedom of movement,” Mr Elliot said.
“We saw the community backlash after the last protest and that was a genuine reflection of how they saw the actions of a small minority.
“That small minority has again chosen to blatantly ignore the very clear, repeated warnings of NSW Police, which is disappointing, frustrating and – frankly – disgraceful.
“The actions they have taken are likely to prolong the very lockdown they were protesting about.
Forty-seven people will be charged.

Rhiannon Down 5.15am: Shepparton cluster now 21, regional Victoria in lockdown
Health authorities say that the number of cases linked to the Shepparton outbreak has now grown to include 21 cases.
Goulburn Valley Health chief executive Matt Sharp said that several more cases had been detected, bringing the tally higher than the 17 reported yesterday morning.
“Today we’ve had a further small number of people test positive in the early hours of this morning,” he said, addressing local reporters yesterday.
Victorian Premier Daniel Andrews has announced that from 1pm today, regional Victoria will go into the same lockdown conditions as Melbourne with the exception of a curfew.
“At the moment in the outbreak here in Shepparton we’ve had a total of 21 active cases which are being closely monitored and contacted by our contact tracing team.”
The discovery that the virus had reached Shepparton has plunged the entirety of regional Victoria into lockdown from 1pm yesterday.
Covid-19 Testing Commander Jeroen Weimar confirmed this morning that 16 additional cases had been recorded this morning and would be recorded in tomorrow’s case numbers. It remains unclear if the four cases recorded in Shepparton are part of 16 cases.
More than 60 new cases were recorded in Victoria yesterday.

Joseph Lam 5am: Covid zero an impossible task, Berejiklian says
NSW Premier Gladys Berejiklian has warned zero cases in the community is an “impossible task”, as the state records its worst ever day of the pandemic, with 825 new cases today.
Just 149 of the new cases were linked to known clusters, with the origin of 676 infections under investigation.
There are currently 516 people in hospital with the virus, including 85 in intensive care and 29 on ventilators.
NSW Premier Gladys Berejiklian says the state has 825 new local cases of COVID-19 and three deaths were recorded overnight.
The three deaths announced on Saturday include a man in his 80s, a woman in her 90s, and a man in his 90s, who was fully vaccinated but had a number of pre-existing health conditions.
Ms Berejiklian said she had noticed a “change of attitude” in her conversations with other state premiers and in the community at large.
“We accept that Delta is here. We accept that heading to zero across the nation — especially once you open up and live freely — will be an impossible task,” she said.
“No matter how hard we work, no matter if 99 per cent of people are doing the right thing, there is an element of Delta that nobody can control.”
Over 200 infringement notices were issued on Saturday after a major police operation in Sydney prevented larger crowds gathering to protest lockdown measures, Police and Emergency Services Minister David Elliott said.
In Sydney, a violent protest was suppressed by a major NSW Police crack down which saw 47 people charged and 260 fined in the CBD on Saturday.
More than 1500 officers were deployed across Sydney to patrol major roads in bid to prevent protesters from gathering in the city centre, pulling over 38,000 vehicles and issuing about 130 fines.
Police clashed with protesters near Victoria Park at about midday where the group of anti-lockdown “freedom” protesters attempted to gather in a repeat of an illegal protest held at the end of last month, making several arrests.
Earlier this week, self-confessed protest organiser Anthony Khallouf , who runs conspiracy site Australians vs The Agenda, was arrested by police after The Australian revealed he had snuck into Sydney from Queensland.
In tears, Khallouf faced court on Friday and was sentenced to eight months in jail for multiple breaches of public health orders and other offences.

The Territory has a much younger demographic than the Australian average. No vaccines have yet been approved for children, so an 80 per cent penetration rate among eligible adults could mean vaccinating only about half of the people in some areas.
Chief Minister Michael Gunner said there could be “no exit from lockdowns unless we have a plan for our kids.”
“When we hit 80 per cent vaccination rate among the eligible population, and the national plan says open up, our most vulnerable will be those who can’t be vaccinated — every child under 12,” he said.
“Options we need to consider range from mandatory vaccines if you work with our children to daily Covid testing for all staff at childcare centres, preschools, and primary schools. At this early stage, nothing should be off the table.”
Michael Toole, a professor of epidemiology at the Burnet Institute, said the Territory might need to push for higher vaccination rates in areas with many youngsters. “We don’t know yet what overall level of vaccination we need to be able to ease restrictions and open up without having large outbreaks,” he said.
“If we reached 70 per cent (national) vaccine penetration tomorrow, we couldn’t do anything (because there are currently too many active cases in the community).”
The Doherty Institute modelling used as a base for Australia’s national reopening plan examined how small outbreaks might be managed under different levels of vaccine penetration.
The strategy plan was predicated on low daily case numbers as a starting point.
The news comes as the Territory recorded no new corona­virus cases on the second day of a snap three-day lockdown triggered by an infection in a man from the US who had close or casual contact with several hundred people in the community.
Mr Gunner said close to 2000 Covid-19 tests had been conducted and virtually all of his contacts identified. Authorities still did not know the source of his infection. He had declined to reveal his vaccination status.
Professor Toole said even countries such as Iceland and Malta that had achieved high rates of vaccine penetration were still experiencing large corona­virus outbreaks. He said allowing Covid-19 to spread was not viable because it would inevitably mutate to become more infectious. “Vaccination will eventually get us out of this mess, but it’s not a case of in one day you open up and get back to normal life.”

Full text: Prime Minister Scott Morrison on Sunday announced the Federal Government had struck a deal with their Polish counterparts to buy one million doses of the Pfizer vaccine at cost.
About 53 per cent of the doses will be prioritised for express delivery to local government areas in Greater Sydney hit hardest by the state’s worsening Covid-19 outbreak.
The rest of the doses will be split across the other jurisdictions based on population size, with Queensland to receive about 139,000 jabs.
The doses will be targeted at people aged 20 to 39, the group deemed by Doherty Institute modelling to be the “peak transmitters” of SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes Covid-19.
The deal struck with Poland to buy a million of the eastern European nation’s surplus jabs is the first of its kind for Australia.
The doses were manufactured at Pfizer’s Belgium facility, the same place all of Australia’s other Pfizer jabs have come from.
The Polish Government, according the country’s press, had in July flagged the need to sell its vaccines to other countries as the jab rollout there stagnates.
Just 47.6 per cent of Poles are fully vaccinated, with the country considered to be among the most vaccine-sceptical nations in Europe.
The country had already sold excess stock to Georgia and Ukraine, before receiving interest from Vietnam and Australia
Foreign Affairs minister Marise Payne said Australia’s “network of diplomats was working hard to identify opportunities to secure additional vaccine supplies”.
“This is a demonstration of the value of Australia’s close engagement with other governments and a strong example of countries co-operating and supporting one another as we face the pandemic together,” she said.
Mr Morrison said the federal government had been in discussions with their Polish counterparts for “several weeks”, with the outbreak in NSW a key factor in securing the shipment from the country.
“There are a million doses of hope on their way,” he said.
The first shipment was due to arrive in Australia overnight on Sunday.

Full text: The NSW government says it is satisfied with the rules it has in place despite recording 319 new cases on Saturday, marking its darkest day for Covid infections this year. Meanwhile Victoria’s lockdown is set to be extended beyond the scheduled seven days.
Richard Ferguson, Rebecca Urban 11.20pm: Huge AZ stockpile open to the young
Victorian Premier Daniel ­Andrews has joined the national push to expand access to AstraZeneca for younger Australians, as new figures revealed the two largest states were sitting on a stockpile of more than one million unused doses of the vaccine due to low demand.
The Andrews government ­announced on Sunday it would throw open access to 200,000 doses of AstraZeneca for people aged 18-to-39 at nine vaccination hubs in a bid to lift Melbourne out of its sixth Covid-19 lockdown.
The push comes as Cairns and Yarrabah in northern Queensland were plunged into a three-day snap lockdown after a mystery Covid case, while NSW recorded another 262 cases with restrictions being extended to Penrith as the Sydney outbreak spread from its Canterbury-Bankstown cluster.

Sharri Markson, Yoni Bashan 10.40pm: Lib revolt on mandatory vaccines for workers
Premier Gladys Berejiklian faces a backlash from conservative Liberals objecting to her move to make vaccinations a mandatory condition of employment for tradies and construction workers.
NSW Liberal backbencher Tanya Davies will introduce a private member’s bill that seeks to ban companies, or the state government, from forcing employees to get a Covid-19 jab. It has the support of cabinet minister Anthony Roberts and other Liberals.
It comes as businesses globally make vaccinations a requirement of employment, and CNN reportedly sacking three employees who came to work unvaccinated.
Ms Davies said the policy of compulsory vaccination was “an attack on my community and the people of NSW”.
“No person should lose their job if they do not get vaccinated,” Ms Davies said. “They may not want to be vaccinated for medical, ethical or religious reasons and we should be protecting people’s individual rights and circumstances.”
The conservative MP, whose electorate of Mulgoa is in western Sydney, said her private member’s bill reflected concern within her community and the Liberal Party.

Helen Trinca 10pm: ‘All options on table’ for jab passport
NSW has called for a national ­approach to protect businesses that try to force employees and customers to be vaccinated against Covid-19.
Health Minister Brad Hazzard said on Sunday that while it was possible he could use state public health orders to override privacy legislation and allow disclosure of a person’s vaccination status, the federal government should take the lead at this stage.
The reach of the federal Privacy Act is central to whether a “vaccination passport” can be enforced by retailers and other companies and whether employers can require staff to reveal if they have had a jab.
Along with the Fair Work Act, the privacy legislation is problematic for companies trying to decide if they can compel people to be vaccinated.
The federal government says business must make the running on the issue but companies are desperate for more support.
While some sectors are considering following food processor SPC and making vaccination a condition of employment, other companies could consider asking staff if they have been vaccinated.
The problem is that under the Privacy Act, no one has to disclose vaccination status.

Stephen Rice 9.15pm: Vaccination levels pave way back to work
NSW is on track to hit six million vaccinations by the end of the month – enough to ease restrictions on work and schools by September, according to the road map out of lockdown touted by the ­Berejiklian government.
With 4.4 million jabs administered in NSW, the Premier insisted on Sunday that some restrictions could be eased at a threshold of 50 to 60 per cent of the population vaccinated – much lower than the 70 to 80 per cent target set by the Doherty Institute modelling for the federal government released last week.
But Gladys Berejiklian denied suggestions her targets were at odds with Scott Morrison’s, saying that the federal target applied to pre-lockdown level restrictions.

Jess Malcolm 8.30pm: Student vax booking system glitches rife
The Berejiklian government’s vaccination drive for Year 12 students in hotspot areas is being derailed by booking system glitches and last-minute transport disruptions, sparking concerns the mass immunisation of 24,000 students could take much longer than the six days scheduled.
With students’ return to school in time for HSC examinations hinging on high levels of vaccination rates, health authorities have been scrambling to execute priority vaccination for students in eight local government areas from Monday.
But the rollout to students has already been marred by technical glitches that have seen students waiting on the site for hours unable to book a vaccine, reporting the system has been rejecting their personal information or simply crashing. Others say they are still waiting to receive the link to book a jab even though they are part of the eligible group.

Liam Mendes 7.45pm: Pfizer fizzer sends jab hopefuls home in disgust
More than 200 people who turned up for a “Super Sunday” vaccination blitz at Sydney Olympic Park thought they would be getting Pfizer jabs – but left in anger when they discovered they were being offered only AstraZeneca.
Queues formed early for the 5000 doses of vaccine set aside for cafe, restaurant, catering and supermarket workers after NSW Health Minister Brad Hazzard promoted the “special day”, for those people to come and get jabbed.
But many who turned up felt they had been misled, with health officials bearing the brunt of their anger.

Mackenzie Scott 7pm: Lockdowns buoy strong auction results
Lockdowns dealt a blow to auction numbers last week, helping to underpin the strong clearance rates.
Last week saw the country’s three largest cities – Sydney, Melbourne and Brisbane – end the week in lockdown following continued Covid-19 outbreaks.
As a result, the number of properties taken to auction fell week-on-week to 1672 auctions, with preliminary data from researcher CoreLogic finding just over three quarters (76.4 per cent) sold.
While final numbers are not expected until later in the week, early data shows 10 per cent of properties originally scheduled for auction last week were rescheduled to a later date.
CoreLogic’s research executive Tim Lawless said the high levels of properties sold prior and withdrawals suggested vendor confidence might be waning.
“That really says to me that if vendors were super confident, they would be selling under the hammer and testing the market,” Mr Lawless said.
“But it looks like they’re much more willing to accept that offer beforehand if it’s reasonable, and no doubt there is still some good offers coming in as this is still a really tight seller’s market.”

Paul Garvey 6.15pm: Extra medics, beds to ease strain on health
Western Australia will pump ­almost $2bn of extra funding into its health system as it looks to ease the strain that has plagued its hospitals in recent months.
Premier Mark McGowan and Health Minister Roger Cook on Sunday pledged to deliver another 332 hospital beds – including 109 mental-health beds – and promised to recruit 100 new doctors and 500 new nurses.
The government also promised another $88m for additional nursing and administration staff at the Perth Children’s Hospital. The death of seven-year-old Aishwarya Aswath at the hospital earlier this year, after she waited almost two hours for help, prompted a public outcry and ­exposed shortcomings in the hospital’s practices.
Ambulance ramping levels have also hit unprecedented highs this year, peaking at 5246 hours in June, and have consistently been at multiples of the 1030 hours-per-month level that Mr Cook ­described as a “crisis” when he was in opposition.
The government has been under mounting pressure in ­recent months to use its growing budget surplus – the product of ­record-high royalty revenues from the state’s iron ore industry – to improve its health system.
Mr McGowan said the extra spending on staffing levels and ­infrastructure in the health system were the result of his government’s financial management.
The strain in the health system in recent months has come ­despite WA being largely untouched by the pandemic. While the feared hospitalisations due to Covid-19 have not materialised in WA, the closure of international borders has cut off the supply of foreign doctors and nurses that underpinned the health system.
Mr Cook said international studies had shown the pandemic had deterred people from engaging with GPs and hospitals last year, which had led to an increase in the frequency and acuity of hospital presentations this year.
“Every health minister in Australia is feeling the heat from dealing with Covid and dealing with the unprecedented demand on our hospitals,” he said.
“We are very fortunate in Western Australia that we have managed the state’s finances properly and as a result of that we are able to put significant investment as part of the budget process to try to address the situation.”

AFP 5.30pm: Brunei clamps down after first local cases in 15 months
Brunei has imposed strict curbs to halt the spread of Covid-19, after finding its first locally transmitted cases in the country in over a year.
Seven community infections were found, the health ministry said, leading the government to close all places of worship and postpone social events for two weeks.
Mass events were also limited to groups of 30 people over this period as school classes were moved online and restaurants barred from serving dine-in.
The tiny Islamic sultanate has largely remained coronavirus free, logging only three deaths since the pandemic began.
More than half of its 347 infections so far were imported, with tight border controls and quarantine measures keeping the virus’s spread in check.
Five of the oil-rich nation first local infections since May last year were linked to a government-run virus monitoring centre.
“This cluster is believed to likely have been exposed to one of the imported cases in Brunei,” the ministry said in a statement.
The source of infection for the other two could not be identified, the ministry added.
An imported case was also announced Saturday: a man who arrived from the Middle East via Malaysia on July 30 before experiencing symptoms on Tuesday.
Brunei has been spared the serious coronavirus outbreaks that are overwhelming health systems in much of Southeast Asia.
It shares its only land border with Malaysia, which has recorded nearly 1.25 million infections and more than 10,000 deaths.
The country has also been steadily ramping up its vaccination process, with nearly 32 per cent of its 450,000 people getting at least one jab

Rebecca Le May 4.50pm: Hunt confirms third vaccine option for Aussies nears
The Therapeutic Goods Administration is on track to approve the Moderna Covid-19 vaccine within a fortnight, giving Australians a third option to Pfizer and Astra Zeneca, Health Minister Greg Hunt has confirmed.
Mr Hunt told reporters on Sunday it was expected the first million doses would be available next month.
A further three million doses would be supplied each month through October, November and December, he said, although consignment dates had not yet been provided by the company.
Mr Hunt said Australians were rolling up their sleeves in record numbers.
“We see that the hesitancy is down and the intention to vaccinate is up,” he said.
Intention to get the jab was at 77 per cent, the minister said.
Weekly vaccination rates had nearly doubled from 700,000 a month and a half ago to almost 1.3 million over the past seven days, Mr Hunt said.

Agencies 4.30pm: Counting the coronavirus cost at Tokyo’s Olympics
The pandemic affected almost every part of Tokyo’s Olympics, forcing a historic postponement, the banning of almost all spectators, and ending the dreams of more than a few athletes.
As the Games wrap up, how did virus concerns play out during the pandemic Olympics.
How many cases were there?
From July 1 to Sunday, the final day of the Games, Tokyo 2020 says it identified 430 positive cases in a population of 52,000 overseas participants and athletes and many more Japanese volunteers and security.
Most positive cases were among residents of Japan, largely staff or contractors, with 29 athletes and 25 members of the media also testing positive.
There was one so-called “cluster”, in the Greek artistic swimming team. All 12 members went into isolation in the second week of the Games after five members tested positive.
Outside the Olympic bubble, Japan hit new virus records, with the capital accounting for a large portion of the numbers.
Cases were already on the rise before the Games, and Tokyo has been under a state of emergency for weeks.
Did the virus affect events?
Virus regulations meant athletes who tested positive could not continue in the Games.
And some saw their Olympic journey end even before it began. Former US Open winner Bryson DeChambeau and tennis star Coco Gauff tested positive before setting out for the Games.
And others like Chilean taekwondo athlete Fernanda Aguirre were ruled out after a positive test at the airport.
Some athletes were already on the ground and training when they got the news, including US pole vaulter Sam Kendricks, who withdrew from the Games.
But the cases had no major effect on events, with none cancelled or moved as a result.
How did teams react?
There was little outcry from teams forced to withdraw athletes from competition. But the rules around isolation for those testing positive did cause some controversy.
Members of the Dutch team in hotel quarantine went on “strike” over a lack of fresh air in the rooms, winning 15 minutes a day at an open window.
Dutch taekwondo fighter Reshmie Oogink described the quarantine as “Olympic jail”.
Did the ‘bubble’ hold?
For the most part, teams stuck to the rules and got on with their sport. But there were a few notable exceptions.
Members of the Georgian judo team had their Olympic passes removed after an unauthorised sightseeing trip.
And five members of Australia’s mens hockey team were reprimanded for breaking out of the bubble to buy beer.
But organisers said overall the rules were respected and the comparatively low number of cases in the Olympic Village were “a very successful outcome,” said Brian McCloskey, a member of the expert panel advising the IOC on virus measures.
Organisers also denied any connection to rising virus cases in Tokyo, and the city’s governor even argued the Games helped people keep at home to watch on TV.
Some experts argue there was an “indirect relationship” and that holding the Games undermined the government’s messaging on virus risks.

Agencies 4.00pm: Data dynamo’s ‘digital twins’ aiming to tame Covid
“When you turn on the news, you just see queues: queues for vaccination, queues for tests. I see data.”
From her office in Brisbane, Dr Kellie Nuttall’s job is to build solutions to wicked problems and Covid-19 ticks the box.
A digital native still in her 30s, Nuttall is one of Deloitte Australia’s youngest partners, promoted under chief executive Adam Powick’s leadership and now the artificial intelligence lead for the firm. For the past nine years, she has been knee-deep in big data analytics and artificial intelligence and more recently data-rich virtual models known as “digital twins”. She says these will give Australia a much-needed boost to get ahead of the curve in the pandemic.
“I see data. I see supply and demand issues that are just waiting to be optimised,” Nuttall tells The Australian.
“Imagine looking at that vaccination and testing system as a whole. We could build the digital twin of it, and we can quickly see where we have supply and where we have demand issues and how we optimise that system. The digital twins can tell us where tomorrow’s bottlenecks are likely to be before they have even occurred. That’s how we can reduce pressure on the system,” she says.
Digital twins use data to understand fiendishly complex and ever-changing environments.
Vast amounts of data are combined to create a complete digital copy of the environment, which could be a company or a community.
Twins have explored space, made cities smarter, optimised manufacturing systems and generated renewable energy more efficiently.
“There are answers in the data but you need to know what questions to ask of that twin,” Nuttall says.
“What twins are really effective at doing is scenario testing. In a pandemic, I believe that can be extremely effective in helping us test a range of scenarios very quickly to shape an optimal response.”
In Australia, there’s a wealth of lazy data at our disposal.

Philip Sherwell 3.30pm: China outbreak deepens vaccine effectiveness doubts
China has long trumpeted its success in stamping out coronavirus cases at home and distributing vaccines abroad as proof of its superiority over the West.
Now those claims are coming under unprecedented scrutiny as Beijing scrambles to contain China’s worst outbreak for more than a year by placing millions under lockdown and ordering mass testing in cities with infections.
As in many other countries the highly transmissible Delta variant has up-ended previous calculations.
For the first time some Chinese public health experts are suggesting that the country may need to contemplate a dramatic shift in its approach: away from “zero tolerance” of infections and towards a “living with Covid” strategy.
The new wave has deepened existing doubts about the effectiveness of Chinese vaccines against new variants even as President Xi Jinping last week announced that China would supply two billion doses of its vaccines for global use, the latest broadside in an aggressive vaccine diplomacy campaign.
The new outbreak is understood to have started with the arrival of a passenger with the Delta variant on a flight from Russia in the eastern city of Nanjing on July 10. It was spread by aircraft cleaners who were infected after a breakdown in safety protocols. By yesterday, there had been more than 1,500 new confirmed cases since mid-July - and hundreds more asymptomatic ones, which China does not include in tallies.

Ellen Ransley 3.05pm: Woman charged with fleeing Qld quarantine
A woman has been charged with multiple offences after she allegedly fled her Gold Coast hotel quarantine room.
Queensland Police said the 24-year-old had travelled to the Sunshine State from New South Wales when she was picked up at a border control checkpoint last Saturday.
She was transported to hotel quarantine, but on Tuesday allegedly forced open the glass door of her room and absconded.
She allegedly remained on the run until Saturday, when she was found at Centenary Lakes Park in Caboolture, more than a 100km from where she was last seen.
She was taken into custody and later charged with one count each of fail to comply with Covid-19 direction, wilful damage and stealing, and two counts of breach of bail in relation to other matters.
Deputy Commissioner Steve Gollschewski said she would remain in custody while she completed her quarantine.
The woman was denied bail and will appear in Brisbane Magistrates Court via video link on Monday.

Agencies 2.40pm: Unvaccinated twice as likely to get Covid re-infection
Unvaccinated people are more than twice as likely to be reinfected with Covid-19 as the fully vaccinated, a study by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said.
The agency said the finding supports its recommendation “that all eligible persons be offered Covid-19 vaccination, regardless of previous SARS-CoV-2 infection status.” Some US politicians, including Senator Rand Paul, have in the past said they do not plan to take a Covid-19 vaccine because of their natural immunity derived from prior infection.
The new study was based on 246 Kentucky adults who were reinfected in May and June this year after previously being infected in 2020.
They were compared with 492 “controls” who were matched by sex, age, and time of initial positive test.
The analysis found that unvaccinated people were 2.34 times as likely to be reinfected compared to people fully vaccinated with the Pfizer, Moderna or Johnson & Johnson vaccines.
The duration of infection-acquired immunity remains poorly understood and may be affected by the emergency of newer variants, the paper said.
For example, laboratory studies have shown that blood samples from people previously infected with the original Wuhan strain had poor antibody responses to the Beta variant first identified in South Africa.
One of the limitations of the study is it was conducted before Delta became the dominant strain in the United States.ia/ft

Ellen Ransley 2.20pm: What you can and can’t do in Qld post lockdown
Southeast Queenslanders will be released from lockdown on Sunday afternoon, but will need to follow strict rules for at least two weeks.
Premier Annastacia Palaszczuk said it was important residents of the 11 local government areas that spent the past eight days in lockdown recognised they were “not out of the woods yet”.
For the next 14 days, high school students will be required to wear masks at school.
“For all our high school students, please, I need you to wear masks, because you’ll be helping to keep the whole community safe,” Ms Palaszczuk said.
“Because we have the Delta strain, and until we can get to those 70 and 80 per cent of vaccination rates, masks are absolutely critical.”
Other rules that will come into place at 4pm Sunday include a maximum of 10 people inside homes.
“You are able to go and visit your loved ones in hospital and aged care, but of course you can’t do that if you are subject to a home quarantine order,” Ms Palaszczuk said.
Weddings and funerals will be capped at 20 people.
Places of worship, convention centres, retail, hospitality, gyms, hairdressers, beauty and personal care venues will all reopen, but the one person per four square metre restrictions will come back into force.
Community sports will not be permitted over the next two weeks.
Ms Palaszczuk stressed that masks would continue to be “really important” and would need to be worn widely.
She said those living in southeast Queensland could travel within that area, but now was “not the time” to be travelling to regional parts of the state.
“Please, put off plans to visit family and friends in regional Queensland for the next two weeks,” she said.

Evin Priest 2.00pm: The restrictions NSW will ease first
A return to school and to work is slated for Greater Sydney residents if New South Wales can hit a total of 6 million doses of Covid-19 vaccinations by August 28.
The race is on to get another 1.6 million jabs in arms during the next three weeks after the state reached 4.4 million jabs.
“Pleasingly, New South Wales has now made sure that there are 4.4 million jabs in arms. That is positive,” Premier Gladys Berejiklian said.
“This is a race. We are tracking well to hit our 6 million target (of at least one dose).
“I am keen to get to 6 million jabs by the end of August because that will provide us opportunities to consider what life looks like in September.”
On Sunday, NSW recorded 262 new locally acquired cases and at least 50 were active in the community while infectious.
A woman with the virus died overnight, bringing the number of Covid-related deaths during the current outbreak to 28.
Health officials confirmed the woman, aged in her 80s, was a resident at the Wyoming Residential Aged Care Facility in Summer Hill, which is at the centre of an outbreak, and died at Royal Prince Alfred Hospital.
Ms Berejiklian and health officials insist not only will the amount of Covid-19 deaths be reduced if NSW can get to 6 million jabs, but two restrictions could be eased.
“Our priorities as a government are getting face-to-face learning back, but also getting workers back to the workplaces,” Ms Berejiklian said.
“If certain categories of workers go back to work, it also means all citizens will perhaps have access to services they don’t have access to (currently).”
Students will be only able to return to school on Monday if their school is not in a high-risk local government area (LGA), while a public health order prevents workers from attending offices unless they are essential workers.
For suburbs in Greater Sydney that are not in high-risk LGAs, the allowed reasons to leave home are:
• Shopping for food or other essential goods and service (within 10kms of home)
• Medical care or compassionate needs, including getting a Covid-19 vaccine
• Exercise outdoors in groups of two (within 10km)
• Essential work or education where you cannot work or study from home
However, people who live in the LGAs of Penrith, Blacktown, Campbelltown, Canterbury-Bankstown, Cumberland, Fairfield, GeorgesRiver, Liverpool and Parramatta can only leave home to:
• Obtain food or other goods and services (within 5km)
• For work if you cannot reasonably work from home and your workplace is in the same local government or if you are an authorisedworker
• Education if it cannot be done at home
• Exercise (within 5km)
• Medical care, including obtaining a COVID-19 vaccination
Another incentive for NSW residents to get the jab is a growing number of people hospitalised with the virus.
There are currently 362 cases in hospital, with 58 people in intensive care, 24 of whom require ventilation.
There were 95,480 Covid tests in NSW in the 24 hours to 8pm on Saturday as well as 20,612 vaccinations.

Michael McKenna 1.27pm: Campbell Newman returns to politics with swipe at PM
Former Queensland premier Campbell Newman is returning to politics, running for a senate spot for the Liberal Democrats at the next federal election.
Just weeks after quitting the Liberal National Party, Mr Newman on Sunday announced he would be leading the Queensland senate campaign ticket for the Liberal Democrats.
Mr Newman said he had been approached to run by a number of minor parties, including Clive Palmer’s party and One Nation.
Despite being ousted from government and his seat after just a single term in state politics, Mr Newman said he felt compelled to return to politics, accusing the Morrison government of an abject failure with its vaccination rollout.
Mr Newman also criticised the Palaszczuk’s Governments mounting lode and the burden on business of Covid-related restrictions over the past 18 months, while conceding the latest lockdown was necessary because of the threat of the Delta variant and low vaccination rates.
“Six years ago, I declared my political career over. But I simply cannot sit by and watch Australia being so poorly led, and this crisis being so poorly managed, by our major political parties,’’ he said.
“I love Australia and I love Queensland. I want to represent Queensland in the Senate and hold the major parties’ feet to the fire, because right now they are all seriously letting us down.’’

Rebecca Urban 12.18am: Victoria to offer AZ to 18-39 year olds
Victoria will be offering AstraZeneca shots to 18 to 39-year-olds as part of a push to boost vaccination rates.
Premier Daniel Andrews announced that nine of the 50 open-access state-run clinics would have 200,000 doses designated for young people from next week.
He said that he anticipated sites would be busy.
“A lot has been written and said about vaccine hesitancy,” he said. “That’s not what I’m picking up on.”
Premier Gladys Berejiklian says New South Wales has recorded 262 new locally acquired COVID cases with at least 50 infectious in the community and the death of an unvaccinated woman in her 80s.
Mr Andrews urged Victorians aged 18 to 39 to book to be vaccinated.
“It’s critical to us being open and staying open.”
The state also announced the first drive-through vaccination site, which will be open for bookings from Monday.
A former Bunnings warehouse at Melton has been converted for the purpose.
“Today we’re announcing the soft launch of Australia’s first drive-through vaccination clinic,” Victorian Acting Covid Commander Naomi Bromley said.
“You book, you drive up, roll down your window, roll up your sleeve, get a jab, it’s that easy.
“It is has been planned very carefully in line with advice that ATAGI has provided about what a drive-through vaccine model looks like.”

Jess Malcolm 11.43am: Berejiklian flags restrictions easing by September
Gladys Berejiklian has denied suggestions her vaccination targets are at odds with the Prime Minister, flagging that some restrictions could be eased if NSW reaches six million doses by September.
The NSW Premier said some restrictions could be eased at a threshold of 50 to 60 per cent, a much lower target than Doherty Institute modelling for the commonwealth released last week which set a 70 to 80 per cent target.
“We are currently in lockdown, and lockdown plus some level of easing of restrictions is possible once we get to 50 or 60 per cent rates of vaccination,” she said.
“The Prime Minister said publicly... that because New South Wales is in lockdown, if we hit certain vaccination targets we can ease some restrictions.
“It doesn’t mean you get to what you would ease if you are 70 per cent, but there are certainly opportunities for us to look at what we can ease in September, so long as we hit our
vaccination targets, we can look for opportunities as to how we live in the month of September.”
Ms Berejiklian said NSW Health experts had been carefully observing how other countries such as Canada had eased restrictions with higher vaccination rates.

Jess Malcolm 11.25am: NSW ‘on track to hit vaccination target’
Gladys Berejiklian has urged people to listen to health professionals amid growing concerns of widespread misinformation about vaccines.
The NSW Premier has urged people to get vaccinated and said there were a wide range of places for people to come forward to get vaccinated, including GPs, pharmacies, mass vaccination hubs and mobile clinics.
“Speak to your GP, your pharmacist, a community leader, who has provided you with information,” she said.
“We have targeted grassroots information to so many diverse communities. Over 200 different communities of diverse backgrounds, in greater western Sydney, something our state is very proud of, but also something we need to acknowledge.”
Ms Berejiklian also urged all essential workers to get vaccinated as soon as possible, but foreshadowed the state was “on track” to hit its six million-dose target.
“What it does mean is that September can be a month where we have greater freedom than we do now,” she said.
“Freedom relies on vaccination, and there is no doubt about that, but it also means having to suppress the virus.”

Jess Malcolm 11.02am: NSW records 262 new cases, one more death
NSW has recorded 262 new cases of Covid in the past 24 hours, with residents in the Penrith local government area to be subject to tougher restrictions from today.
A woman in her 80s also died overnight. She was a resident of a Summer Hill aged care home.
“Regrettably, there are 12 suburbs in the Penrith local government area that will now be listed as an area of concern and will be subjected to those harsher restrictions,” Premier Gladys Berejiklian said, citing fears of cases spreading from eight other LGA hotspots bordering Penrith.
“We want to make sure that we stem the tide of the virus seeping into those additional communities and we ask residence from five o’clock this afternoon to adhere to the additional restrictions placed upon them.”
Those suburbs are Caddens, Claremont Meadows, Colyton, Erskine Park, Kemps Creek, Kingswood, Mount Vernon, North St Marys, Orchard Hills, Oxley Park, St Clair, and St Mary’s.

“In line with restrictions currently in place in Blacktown, Campbelltown, Canterbury-Bankstown, Cumberland, Fairfield, Georges River, Liverpool and Parramatta LGAs, people in those 12 suburbs must only obtain food and other goods and services and exercise 5km from their home,” NSW Health’s Dr Jeremy McAnulty said.
“You cannot travel to other areas of work outside those areas unless you are an authorised worker. Masks must be worn whenever you are outdoors, except in a common outdoor area of a backyard, apartment, for example.”
The woman’s death overnight brings the total number of deaths in the latest outbreak to 28.
There are now 362 cases in hospital, with 58 in intensive care and 24 cases are ventilated.
Of the 58 cases in intensive care, five are in their 20s, seven in their 30s, four in their 40s, 17 in their 50s, seven in their 60s, 15 in their 70s and three in their 80s.
Dr McAnulty said young people are at serious risk of illness from Covid-19 and urged all people to get vaccinated.
“So young people are certainly getting caught up with this disease,” he said.
“With the 58 people in ICU, 54 were not vaccinated, three had received their first dose of AstraZeneca and one had received their first dose of Pfizer vaccine.”

Mackenzie Scott, Jess Malcolm 10.03am: Qld records nine new cases, Cairns in lockdown
Lockdown will end in Queensland for 11 local government areas in the state’s south east at 4pm today, but an infected taxi driver has triggered a snap, three-day lockdown in Cairns.
The state has recorded nine new cases of Covid, with concern emerging over the taxi driver, who was infectious in the community for 10 days.
Seven of today’s cases are locally acquired and linked to the Indooroopilly cluster. Another case on the Gold Coast is still under investigation.
“Unfortunately, this discovery of a positive case in Cairns is something that we were not expecting, and we really need the residence of Cairns to come forward with any symptoms and get tested,” Premier Annastacia Palaszczuk has told a press conference.
“So, from 4pm today, for the next three days, Cairns and Yaribah will go into a lockdown. It is essentially a lockdown that the 11 LGAs went to, but they will be allowed to have up to two visitors to come and visit their homes. We need more testing in Cairns. I am very concerned.”
It is unclear if the infection is linked to a fully vaccinated reef pilot who tested positive last week.
For rolling coverage watch Sky News Australia on Foxtel or visit www.skynews.com.au.
While lockdown will lift at 4pm for 11 LGAs stretching from the Gold to Sunshine coasts, some restrictions will remain.
People will now be able to leave their homes and schools will reopen, and visits in hospitals and aged care are now allowed.
But several restrictions remain, including mask wearing for all high school students and primary school staff at schools.
Weddings and funerals will be capped at 20 people, and places of worship, convention centres, retail, dining, gyms and beauty services will operate at 50 per cent capacity.
People will only also be able to have 10 people in their homes.
Ms Palaszcuk has also advised people not to travel into regional Queensland, confirming the state was “not out of the woods.”

Christine Kellett 9.55am: Queensland Premier addresses the media | WATCH
Annastacia Palazszcuk will hold her first daily Covid press conference in weeks after leaving hotel quarantine this morning.
The Queensland Premier has been out of action after returning from Tokyo for the Olympic Games, will update the media at 10am, and is expected to announce whether a circuit-breaker lockdown will be lifted in southeast Queensland later today as planned.
Health authorities yesterday said the lockdown easing would depend on today’s daily infection number.

Max Maddison 9.45am: Hunt tight-lipped on Gladys’ reopening plan
Health Minister Greg Hunt has refused to say whether NSW Premier Gladys Berejiklian will rescind lockdown restrictions before the state gets to 70 per cent, despite the intention being in clear contradiction to modelling conducted by the Doherty Institute.
Ms Berejiklian has stated she will begin to ease draconian public health orders once NSW reaches 50 per cent vaccination coverage. The figure, however, stands in stark contrast to the federal government’s own modelling which showed the effective threshold was significantly higher.
When pressed on the issue, despite saying he had recently spoken to NSW chief health officer Kerry Chant, Mr Hunt declined to say whether the state intended on breaking away from the rest of the country to carve their own path.
“What I can say is clear, David, is that they are committed to defeating COVID,” Mr Hunt told ABC’s Insiders on Sunday morning. “That’s what I can say is clear, and as to the way in which they’re doing it, one of the things which is really important is to continue to provide support for the public”
He added that children were likely to begin receiving vaccinations in the “last quarter” of this year.
Mr Hunt also sought to stem speculations that federal chief medical officer Paul Kelly was publicly calling for tougher measures in NSW, saying he was merely encouraging people to comply with existing restrictions.
“To continue to move to suppression, it is about encouraging people to stay home, it is about the compliance which comes with the additional positive support of the Australian Defence Force,” he said.

Ellen Ransley 9.37am: Qld teachers, FIFO workers jab priority
Queensland teachers and FIFO workers have become priorities for the state’s vaccination rollout amid the Delta outbreak.
School staff and childcare workers have been added to the state’s 1B priority list, as well as fly-in-fly-out, freight and distribution centre workers.
More than a hundred cases are now linked to southeast Queensland’s Delta cluster, which began when a high school student somehow contracted the virus last month.
It spread to a number of students, staff and family members at Indooroopilly State High School, Ironside State School, Brisbane Girls Grammar and Brisbane Grammar.
Premier Annastacia Palaszczuk said the reason for adding school and childcare workers was because of how much of an impact the latest outbreak had had on educational facilities.
“We need to provide the best possible protection for staff and students,” she said.
“This strain of the virus moves incredibly quickly, and we need to be just as fast in our response.”
Ms Palaszczuk said the changes to the state’s vaccine rollout, “coupled with the remarkable work of Queenslanders during this lockdown” would bolster the state’s efforts to get out on top of the latest outbreak.
Education Minister Grace Grace, said she hoped staff in all schools and childcare centres across Queensland would take up the offer of vaccination.
“I would urge any eligible worker who has not yet been vaccinated to jump online and register,” she said.
“I am also asking schools to be as flexible as possible when it comes to assisting staff to access leave to attend their vaccination appointments.”
To date, Queensland has administered more than 2.5 million doses of the Covid-19 vaccine.
Anyone who works at a school or childcare centre is included in the eligible 1B group, including childcare educators, teachers, teacher aides, management and administrative staff, groundskeepers, cleaners, locum staff, regular volunteers, and any other ancillary school and early learning support staff.

Max Maddison 9.15am: Vaccine still a struggle for non-English speakers
Opposition communications spokeswoman Michelle Rowland says it remains a “real struggle” for people from non-English speaking backgrounds to get information about vaccinations, as she laments the long-term damage school closures may have on students.
A record day of case numbers in Greater Sydney was set to climb higher on Sunday, as outbreaks in Newcastle, Melbourne and Brisbane left the eastern seaboard of the country under strict lockdown orders.
Premiers are racing to vaccinate a sufficient proportion of their population, but Ms Rowland said there remained insufficient vaccine information for some culturally diverse communities, which was undermining attempts to mitigate vaccination hesitancy.
“I think that there has been a real struggle here for people of non-English speaking backgrounds to get information about Covid Safety, let alone about vaccination,” she told Sky News on Sunday morning.
“When you go to the vaccination checker, you can get information in Icelandic, but you can’t get information in Tamil. And I have one of the highest proportions of Tamil speakers in all of Australia in my electorate.”
She also expressed concern that ongoing school closures, forcing kids into home learning, would have unforeseen consequences further down the track.
“Part of it is wondering what impact this is going to have on them in the long term, again, with no end dates to remote schooling inside at the moment,” she said.

Max Maddison 8.54am: States ‘reserving their rights on reopening’
Employment Minister Stuart Robert has refrained from criticising NSW Premier Gladys Berejiklian, despite her plans to plough ahead with reopening at odds with the Morrison government’s own modelling.
Amid rising infections across Greater Sydney, including an outbreak in Newcastle, Ms Berejiklian has changed her milestone from case numbers to jabs, flagging her intention to begin easing restrictions at the end of August, once 50 per cent of the NSW population is vaccinated.
But despite the figure being considerably lower than modelling conducted by the Doherty Institute, which pointed to 70 per cent as the key metric for easing restrictions, Mr Roberts refused to question the plan.
“States have always reserved their rights on a whole range of issues — we’ve seen that consistently. But we’ve also seen the simple message: phase one, let’s get 70 per cent of the population vaccinated,” Mr Robets told Sky News on Sunday morning.

Angelica Snowden 8.38am: Victoria records 11 new cases
Victoria has recorded 11 new local cases of coronavirus in 24 hours, from more than 38,000 tests.
That’s down from a high of 29 cases on Saturday.
All 11 cases were out in the community during their infectious period, authorities say.
The cases have all been linked to current outbreaks
There are a further two cases that have been recorded in hotel quarantine.
Yesterday’s 29 cases — the highest daily rise this year — has thrown the end of lockdown number six into doubt on Thursday.
All 29 cases yesterday were also in the community during their infectious period and Premier Daniel Andrews said mystery cases were behind two outbreaks in Hobson’s Bay and Maribyrnong.

Max Maddison 8.20am: Moderna set to be given the green light
Ten million Modern jabs will soon be given the green light, with the Therapeutic Goods Administration set to approve the vaccine as early as next week.
Senior federal government sources told The Daily Telegraph that the drugs regulator was set to approve Moderna within a fortnight, opening the door for the first 300,000 doses to hit Australia’s shores in September. It will become the third vaccine in the Morrison government’s arsenal.
The country has another three million doses scheduled from October until December.
The highly effective mRNA vaccine’s arrival in Australia comes with over half the country suffering through ongoing lockdowns. The Morrison government is under intense pressure for the perceived failure to procure enough vaccines, with mixed messaging undermining the rollout of AstraZeneca.
With vaccine demand rising amid the most serious outbreak since the start of the pandemic, Health Minister Greg Hunt said more than 200,000 vaccinations had taken place over each of the preceding five days, and pointed to declining vaccine hesitancy in the community.
“What we do know is that the capacity is now fully established to deliver over two million doses per week of AZ plus Pfizer and Moderna, as supplies become available,” he told The Daily Telegraph.
“As the Pfizer numbers grow from one to two million per week, and as Moderna grows to 700,000 per week, we will be able to deliver well over two million doses per week if there is demand.”
The Morrison government has also procured almost 8000 doses of Sotrovimab, a monoclonal antibody treatment, used to treatment Covid-19 patients with mild symptoms who are at high risk of developing severe symptoms.
Trials for the treatment have shown it dramatically reduces hospitalisation and death among unvaccinated Covid patients.

Agencies 6.40am: Protesters mass in France against Covid health pass
Almost a quarter of a million people took to the streets across France on Saturday for the biggest protests yet against a coronavirus health pass needed to enter a cafe or travel on an inter-city train, two days before the new rules come into force.
Similar but smaller protests were held in Italy.
Championed by President Emmanuel Macron, the French regulations make it obligatory to have either a full course of vaccination against Covid-19, a negative test or be recently recovered from the virus to enjoy routine activities.
Macron, who faces re-election next year, hopes to encourage all French to be vaccinated against Covid-19 and thereby defeat the virus and its fast-spreading Delta variant.
But opponents — who have now held four weekends of consecutive protests — argue the rules encroach on civil liberties in a country where individual freedom is highly prized.
About 237,000 people turned out across France, including 17,000 in Paris, the interior ministry said, exceeding the 204,000 recorded last weekend -— unusual numbers for protests at the height of the summer break.
In one of several protests in Paris, hundreds marched from the western suburbs to the centre, chanting “Freedom!” and “Macron, we don’t want your pass!”.
Wearing a mask, Alexandre Fourez, 34, said he was protesting for the first time and that he had himself recovered from Covid.
“The problem with the health pass is that our hand is being forced,” said the marketing employee, adding he “really has difficulty believing its use will be temporary”.

Rhiannon Down 5am: NSW government resists harsher lockdown
The NSW Opposition says it would support tougher lockdown measures to try to reign in the state’s spiralling Covid crisis, after 319 new cases on Saturday marked the state’s darkest day this year.
But the Berejiklian government is resisting pressure to come down harder on Greater Sydney, despite NSW Health Minister Brad Hazzard revealing a third of Saturday’s new cases were out and about in the community while infectious. Instead, he said the responsibility remained with people to do the right thing.
“We are satisfied that the orders in place are appropriate,” Mr Hazzard told Nine newspapers, saying the state already had in place the “toughest lockdown in the country at the present time.”
“The real problem remains: it doesn’t matter what orders you put in place if people ignore them.”
Five more deaths – including three linked to a ballooning cluster at Liverpool Hospital’s geriatric ward sparked by an infected nurse – have pushed the death toll from this outbreak to 27, with authorities citing a growing number of young people left desperately ill with Delta and requiring ventilation in intensive care.
NSW Health's Dr Jeremy McAnulty says Canterbury-Bankstown is the "number one LGA for cases" following the state recording 319 new locally acquired cases.
Meanwhile, a new epicentre of the virus is emerging in the Canterbury-Bankstown local government area. Mr Hazzard said general compliance with public health orders as well as the region’s reliance on manufacturing and distribution industries were behind the spread there.
“The NSW government must hold to the strategy of bringing community transmission to zero or close to zero,” Labor leader Chris Minns told The Daily Telegraph. “If the CHO and NSW government think that more measures are needed, NSW Labor will support them.”
NSW Health Minister Brad Hazzard says NSW has “the toughest lockdown in the country” but the problem is citizens are “not complying” with public health order.
More than 340 people are now in hospital in NSW with coronavirus, 56 of them in intensive care. Of those, four are in their 20s, four are in their 30s, and three are in their 40s. So this disease is infecting people of all ages,” Deputy Chief Health Officer Jeremy McAnulty said on Saturday.
“Of the 56 people in ICU, 51 were not vaccinated at all, four had received the first to dose of AstraZeneca vaccine, and one has received the first dose of the Pfizer vaccines.”
Premier Gladys Berejiklian was criticised on social media for not attending Saturday’s press conference, instead leaving it to Mr Hazzard, who announced the 319 figure and a seven-day lockdown in regional Armidale after cases were detected there.
Mitch Clarke 4.45am: Victoria’s lockdown to be extended beyond seven days
Victoria’s sixth lockdown is set to be extended past Thursday after the state recorded its worst day of cases in almost a year.
The Sunday Herald Sun was told by senior government sources on Saturday night that hopes of coming out of lockdown later this week are fading fast.
It is believed fears are mounting within the government that contact tracers will be unable to identify and connect all cases in the community in time for the lockdown to end as planned.
The state government is expected to announce details about an expanded vaccination program – including for younger people and key workers such as teachers – in the coming days.
Leading epidemiologists on Saturday said they expected the Victorian lockdown to be extended after the state recorded 29 cases – the highest daily case number since last September.
Premier Daniel Andrews has warned that more infections were likely to be discovered in the community.
The leader of Melbourne's Victoria state, Daniel Andrews, comments on the current coronavirus outbreak, after the state returned to lockdown for the sixth time since the pandemic began. Australia's three largest cities are in lockdown, as New South Wales records 319 community cases of the virus and five more deaths — a third straight day of record case numbers.

Cormac Pearson 4.30am: Minister’s plea with Queensland on ‘knife edge’
Queensland health minister Yvette D’Ath has called on Queenslanders not to “undo all the hard work” after footage showed people mingling at a popular market in Brisbane this morning.
Footage showed groups of people sitting together at the Jan Powers Farmers Markets at Brisbane Powerhouse in New Farm which is classified as essential, with some seemingly without masks.
“With southeast Queensland on a knife-edge, we’re asking everyone to stay home and not leave their front door unless it’s absolutely necessary,” Ms D’Ath said.
“Now is not the time to undo all our great work, and eating out at the markets can probably wait.
“The purpose of allowing food stalls is for people to get essential groceries or takeaway food.
“If you go out, mask-up and socially distance – that’s what will get us through this.”
People took to social media in anger at the scenes with a decision on the end of the lockdown looming on Sunday.
Queensland Deputy Premier Steven Miles says the state has recorded 13 new cases of COVID-19.

Full text: Epidemiologists advising the state and federal governments say Victorians will endure more frequent lockdowns between now and the end of the year because of Sydney's worsening outbreak and the high infectiousness of the Delta variant of COVID-19.
Victoria was out of lockdown for just over a week before stay-at-home orders were imposed for another seven days from 8pm Thursday, after the detection of six new cases in the community.
The state recorded another six new cases of coronavirus yesterday linked to existing outbreaks, but the infected people were not in quarantine while infectious.
Meanwhile NSW recorded a new record-high 291 new cases yesterday in a worsening outbreak that experts from Melbourne and Monash universities say will mean more frequent outbreaks - and lockdowns - in Victoria.
Yesterday, two federal government sources with knowledge of the vaccine rollout told The Age 150,000 extra Pfizer vaccines would be brought forward for Victoria in response to a request from Premier Daniel Andrews.
It follows the federal government on Thursday bringing forward the delivery of nearly 185,000 jabs for NSW and 112,300 for Qld, which has also locked down in a bid to suppress the virus.
Modelling by the Doherty Institute, commissioned by the federal government, suggests lockdowns would be needed about 40 per cent of the time while less than half the Australian population is vaccinated. By Thursday only 21.38 per cent of Australians aged over 16 had received both doses of a COVID-19 vaccine.
This model assumes light restrictions are in place at all times and the virus is circulating at low levels when emerging from lockdown.
Importantly, it does not account for the periods when the virus is eliminated and could therefore overestimate the amount of time spent in lockdown.
University of Melbourne modelling published in JAMA Health Forum last week suggested Melbourne could expect to spend about a quarter of the year in lockdown.
That modelling could underestimate the risk of ongoing disruptions, as it was based on data from the coronavirus strain that first left Wuhan, not the widespread Delta variant.
Delta is about 60 per cent more infectious than the Alpha variant of the virus, which in turn was perhaps 50 per cent more contagious than the version of the virus that first emerged in the Chinese city.
Victoria's fifth and previous lockdown was triggered by three Sydney-based removalists who spread the virus. One theory behind Victoria's latest outbreak is that it was linked to a family who spent a week in a NSW quarantine hotel.
The University of Melbourne modelling assumed there was a one in 100 chance per day of a new case being seeded in Victoria,but with Sydney's worsening case numbers that threat has increased.
University of Melbourne's Jason Thompson, who worked on the Victorian government's epidemic modelling, said: "When you've got it more like one in every two or three weeks, that totally changes the equation."
"If your strategy is 'go hard, go early', but you can't control the incursions, you're going to be doing it a lot. So you have to control quarantine, and the border, and the incursions. That's it, really, because otherwise you are in permanent lockdown," Dr Thompson said.
Monash University's epidemiology team, which provides Victorian and federal modelling, assumes Sydney will not bring its caseload to zero over the next few months.
The team's head, Associate Professor James Trauer, said Victoria would have to cycle through lockdowns until vaccine coverage of 70 or 80 per cent was reached.
"It does look likely that we'll need several more lockdowns from now till we have substantial vaccination coverage," Associate Professor Trauer said.
Another member of the team, Michael Lydeamore, said: "Delta is so much more transmissible that the likelihood of control using only our existing measures, but without lockdown, is very small."
At yesterday's national cabinet meeting, state and federal governments signed off on a plan to phase out lockdowns once 70 per cent of the population was vaccinated. Vaccination levels above 70 per cent would also allow more freedom of interstate and overseas travel.
Victorian Health Minister Martin Foley said yesterday lockdowns would continue to be part of the state's pandemic playbook. "No one likes lockdowns. As we've now established, they work. They are one of our major tools in our public health response, and until such time as we have the levels of 70 or 80 per cent vaccination, they are ging to continue to be a part of that."
Doherty Institute modelling suggests Australia will reach the vaccination target of 70 per cent of the eligible population at the start of November, with 80 per cent reached closer to the end of the month. Much of that is driven by a surge of Pfizer supplies expected in September.
Burnet Institute head of modelling and biostatistics Nick Scott said that as more people were vaccinated, the chance of a single case turning into an outbreak should fall.
"But even with more chance of a dead end, it is still a roll of the dice each time and some will lead to an outbreak that requires a lockdown," he said.
"We will be transitioning in and out of lockdowns for a while."

Politicians have abdicated responsibility for this Covid crisis

Full text: Let’s not go through the various conditional predictions of the virus’s impact, especially the “worst-case” scenario, which happily generates a number far short of “everybody dies”, which I would regard as the worst case.
Instead here’s what the Doherty Institute says could happen if we suffered a six-month uncontrolled outbreak with only 60 per cent of the population vaccinated: there would be 737,971 infections and 5294 deaths. Note the super-scientific accuracy: not 737,970 or 737,972 infections; why, that would just be sloppy guesswork.
I’m teasing, of course (it’s one of the few pleasures not yet forbidden in these joyless times), and have no doubt the statisticians are doing their very best with the data; so let’s assume they’re correct that almost three-quarters of a million would be infected, of whom 5000 would die.
Many of us in the anti-lockdown corner are asked how many lives we would sacrifice to see the country open up again, our accusers triumphantly certain there is no decent answer because, as the NSW Premier told us in May, “no death is acceptable”.
She and her interstate counterparts would rather smash our lives and livelihoods in pursuit of their ridiculous, hubristic ambition.
If a foreign power were causing damage on this scale we would regard it as an act of war, when deaths in defence of the country would become acceptable again.
Perhaps we should bite the bullet and say 5000 predominantly old people taken prematurely is a sad but tolerable price to pay for the restoration of our freedoms and the repair of our society – as long as it’s not my precious grandparents. Oh wait, mine have already died of old age, like all my ancestors since humans first wandered out of the African Rift Valley. It happens a lot, I understand. And by the way, those 5000 projected deaths assume we could find no other way of protecting the vulnerable, which is hard to believe.
The Prime Minister’s proud boast is that our closed borders and hyper vigilance have “saved 30,000 lives” since the start of the epidemic last year. More unverifiable modelling; but again, let’s assume he’s right. I wonder how many of the saved have succumbed to other ailments in that time; or will next week’s census reveal a Cocoon-like bubble of healthy nonagenarians, 30,000 strong, laughing at Covid and death in all its other guises?
At best, we’ve dragged their lives out for a few more lonely months sequestered from their families, just as we’ve kicked the whole pandemic a little way down the road, at an almost inconceivable cost. As our leaders and their worker bees finesse their incarceration strategy, in the background the cries of misery grow louder.
The politicians look on, stern-faced and witless, bleating their platitudes about feeling our pain, and urging us to get vaccinated as the only way to escape the shackles on our lives, as though they had nothing to do with the sinister emergency powers they have granted themselves and aimed against us. “A surge in cases has closed restaurants”; “the latest outbreak means tradesmen can’t go to work”; “thanks to some selfish cab driver we must stay at home for the next month”.
No, ladies and gentlemen, the virus hasn’t done this to us; you have, cosy in your luxurious offices with your index-linked financial cushions, surrounded by sycophants and shoving people around like demented puppetmasters.
It may come as a shock to those snorting and gobbling at the trough of public money, but not everyone makes their living by opening a spreadsheet on a laptop, reaching out to a stakeholder and unmuting themselves on a Zoom call.
There are people who pay taxes (rather than recycle them) by travelling every day to places where they make actual things with their hands, who build home offices rather than work from them.
Some then have the audacity to consider their manual or menial work essential, as though they are under some obligation to put food on the table for their families.
And these ungrateful wretches, instead of praising the wisdom of their superiors who imprison them in their unfashionable suburbs, have the nerve to march in the streets in complaint, thousands of people engaged in reckless superspreader events that have led to a massive zero new infections.
“How sharper than a serpent’s tooth it is to have a thankless child!” wails Shakespeare’s King Lear. Echoing him, our politicians and bureaucrats, parents to their infantilised population, are “disgusted” (NSW Premier Gladys Berejiklian) with these “filthy” (NSW Deputy Police Commissioner Gary Worboys) “boofheads” (NSW Police Minister David Elliot), “wankers” (NT Chief Minister Michael Gunner) and “hooligans, dropkicks” (WA Premier Mark McGowan). Treasure the eloquent, statesmanlike rhetoric of these latter-day Ciceros; that’s the way to bring the people along with you in difficult times.
Instead they govern by regulations that grow daily more ridiculous. Sit down to drink, but stand up near a park bench; exercise, but don’t rest; go shopping but don’t browse, even though the sadists at Coles have moved everything you wanted into different aisles; under no circumstances talk to anyone you know, despite the masks that afford magic protection from nanometre Covid dust; the list is a never-ending carousel of hilarity.
The latest inanity from the future governor of Queensland (remember her, the one who did more than anyone else to dissuade people from receiving the AstraZeneca vaccine?) is to warn against online shopping.
“Do you need those people out in the community delivering packages and things?” she asks. No, your excellency, of course not, let them park their vans and bikes and get a well-paid, non-executive board position like your pals do.
What begins as absurdity soon turns dark. In NSW you must carry evidence of your address at all times when outside your home, and produce it to a police officer – “Papers please!” – on demand. You must carry a mask on your person, even to walk the dog around the block. Cold War Berlin-style police checkpoints have appeared on our streets to confirm cars are within 10km of their homes, and their occupants not intending to protest against their rulers. The army is on patrol in areas whose citizens are often refugees from regimes where camouflage battle-dress is rarely a welcome sight.
Do Western concepts of freedom no longer matter in Australia? Is it a trivial matter that we are commanded not to leave our homes? Does it seriously not bother anyone in office that we are being compared – accurately – to North Korea in our legislated refusal to allow our citizens to leave the country, or overseas Australians to return? This is very bad company we find ourselves in.
The politicians say they’re faced with tough decisions, but they’re not making decisions at all. They defend their abdication of responsibility by loftily declaring they are acting on the health advice they receive. They don’t evaluate that advice, mind, they simply follow it.
And it leads always to the same destination: lockdown. It’s “horrible”, Berejiklian said this week, “but we know we have no option”. In Victoria, Premier Daniel Andrews parrots her: “There are no alternatives to lockdown”, he said on Thursday. Unless of course you don’t order a lockdown, which I think does qualify as an option, and a much more appealing one.
Lockdowns certainly work in the crudest sense, in that by isolating people you limit viral transmission, but that’s not the point.
It’s the cost-benefit analysis that’s missing, absent from the moment our governments panicked and abandoned our sensible national pandemic plan to follow the brutes of Communist China into a policy of dystopian oppression, to “keep us safe”.
Let’s turn the acceptable casualty question around and direct it to our leaders: how many fruitful young lives are you happy to waste to keep those Covid numbers low?
How many small businesses are you ready to see disappear? How many suicides will you tolerate? How many bankruptcies? How many children should forgo their formative primary education and socialisation? How many deaths from other untreated illness are acceptable to you?
How much sorrow are you willing to impose on your subjects? How many grief-stricken families must bury parents and children without ceremony, like backyard pets? How many tears will soften your stony, self-righteous hearts?
Whether born of stupidity or callousness, the effect of our current aimless course is the same. State against state, city against country, suburb against suburb, office worker against tradesman, old against young, vaccinated against unvaccinated: it is a heartless, divisive and dehumanising policy. And worse, it doesn’t work.
The very people we elect to safeguard our freedoms are shredding them, causing fractures in society that may never be healed.
Surely there are politicians in every party who are silently appalled by this mounting despair and devastation. If their leaders cannot find a path out of this madness, perhaps those others should speak up and think about taking the reins, before the electorate’s frustration turns to fury.

Flight Centre boss Graham ‘Skroo’ Turner: The prices we must pay for Covid freedom

Full text: As lockdown frustration has intensified and as the costs – financial, mental and emotional – have skyrocketed, attention has inevitably turned to finding more sustainable ways to safely and sensibly navigate our way out of the pandemic and to return to a degree of normalcy in our everyday lives, while protecting the vulnerable and minimising hospitalisations.
The near-term solution, as things currently stand, is obviously the vaccination program and it appears that it is now starting to gain some real momentum, after a fairly sluggish start.
Politicians at all levels of government are talking about fast-tracking the roll-out and people are seemingly recognising the potential benefits and displaying an increased willingness to roll up their sleeves.
Roll them up
Vaccinations are, of course, the fuel that will drive us along Prime Minister Scott Morrison’s recently released roadmap out of the pandemic.
When this four-phase roadmap was unveiled a little over a month ago it initially attracted a fair degree of criticism (roadmap rage) in the media, the opposition and certainly among the travel and tourism industries.
It initially appeared that the plan was wishy washy on timetables and milestones and seemingly lacking in urgency.
NED-4196-QLD-Restrictions-lifting
In essence, it lacked key information that is integral to any roadmap – namely, the timelines as to when we can expect to turn the next important corner and the significant milestones that we will pass along the way.
Late last week, the Prime Minister and the national cabinet provided some of this information, along with detailed modelling undertaken by the Doherty Institute.
THE PATH AHEAD
There are, of course, many moving parts – not least the current outbreaks in NSW and Queensland – but I think that the path the national cabinet has advocated can lead us out of the Covid mess Australia is in now and that most of this pathway can potentially be achieved relatively quickly, as covered in greater detail a little later.
This will help prevent us from being rapidly left behind the rest of the western world in our freedoms through random lockdowns, tight restrictions on normal activities and widespread border restrictions.
Our understanding of the roadmap is that it requires us to initially ramp up vaccinations and trial home quarantine for the fully vaccinated, then move from elimination to suppression, accepting that there will be some endemic infection.
We can significantly limit hospitalisations and deaths by ensuring the vulnerable (the elderly and those with pre-existing health conditions) are vaccinated if they want to be as quickly as possible, followed soon after by other lower risk groups among the general population.
Assuming this all goes to plan, we can then stop lockdowns as Covid-19 is suppressed, not eliminated, and hospitals are coping with the case load, which effectively means we are living with the virus in a similar way we live with many other infectious diseases.
living with it
To be living with the virus, returning to normalcy and opening Australia back up to the world in the next five or six months, we really need two things to happen.
Firstly, the elderly and the vulnerable need to be protected. Once this is achieved, hospitalisations among adults will largely be vulnerable people who do not want to be vaccinated.
Secondly, public servants, politicians and the public in general will need to accept that as some stage we have to live with the virus in the community under a suppression, rather than total elimination, regimen and in a safe and sensible way.
This was acknowledged in the Doherty Institute’s report and Australia has probably reached this point now.
VAX DEATHS RARE
On a positive note, vaccinated deaths appear to be very rare.
As of early July, 99.5 per cent of Covid-19 deaths in the US were in unvaccinated people, according to Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) director Dr Rochelle Walensky.
Of 157 million people who had been vaccinated, 733 died of Covid-19, per CDC data noted recently by Insider’s Andrea Michelson and Mia de Graaf.
By comparison, there had been more than 600,000 deaths from Covid-19 in the US, according to Johns Hopkins University data.
timetable and Milestones
Around the same time as the Prime Minister initially unveiled his four-phase roadmap, Flight Centre Travel Group, with the support of the travel, cruise, tour operators, airports, airlines, education, mining and farming industries, released a plan that was in some ways similar to the national cabinet’s blueprint.
Queensland Vaccine Locator
The FCTG and industry plan though has possible timelines attached to it, as outlined below.
If this plan goes to “plan” – and nothing seems ironclad in the Covid-19 world – it’s possible that we could have a return to freedom and a level of normalcy well before Christmas 2021.
Phase One is built around fast-tracking vaccinations and piloting a home quarantine model during the next couple of months.
This involves vaccinating the vulnerable and old (1a and 1b) and expediting the overall vaccination rates to perhaps 7 million a month.
During this first phase, Vaccination Passports will be introduced and a home quarantine model piloted for the fully vaccinated.
Fast forward to the end of October and some 14 million people should be fully vaccinated (70% of adults) and 4 million more should have had one vaccination (20%).
If the phase one timeline relies on having those who are vulnerable (and who want the vaccination) protected, we are on track to achieve this milestone by the end of next month.
PHASE TWO
Phase Two focuses on minimising hospitalisations and fatalities and we expect to start to see the benefits of this in August and September.
As outlined above, all vulnerable people should have been offered a vaccination by now, along with a sizeable percentage of the overall community.
Increased vaccinations and successful home quarantine trials for those who have been fully vaccinated should take pressure off hospitals and hotel quarantine facilities, which would allow for the current the caps on returning residents to be lifted and for international students to return.
Queensland Deputy Premier Steven Miles says the state has recorded ten new cases of COVID-19, bringing the cluster to a total of 89 cases. All new infections are household contacts of previously-identified cases and are linked to the Indooroopilly Delta cluster. Mr Miles said two cases were infectious in the community for a single day and eight cases were not in the community at all. Mr Miles said compliance with mask regulations had fallen and asked Queenslanders to keep adhering to the requirements. “If you think about where this outbreak spread, it is spread in places we didn’t have masks, schools and in households, and that just underlines how valuable masks have been at controlling spread in other places,” he said.
PHASE THREE
Phase Three will see Australia learn to live with the virus in the community and eliminate the need for further lockdowns. Assuming vaccinations continue to prove effective and that vulnerable people who want to be vaccinated have been, this could take place across September and October.
PHASE FOUR
Phase Four will see a return to normal life in many ways, as most of the restrictions that are currently in place will no longer be required given that the vulnerable and many others will be fully vaccinated.
My suggestion is that this might be possible during the fourth quarter of this calendar year if we can ramp up the vaccination program as expected to about 7 million per month. From a travel perspective, we should be able to safely open the international borders to fully vaccinated travellers without quarantine but subject to some other safeguards, including a negative antigen or PCR test.
PASSPORT TO FREEDOM
We are already seeing this in other parts of the world, including North America and the UK-Europe.
The challenge will be families with unvaccinated children unless the Therapeutic Goods Administration approves the vaccine for children. We are, of course, dealing with a never-before-seen challenge that is evolving, so there can be no guarantees. There is, however, cause for optimism that we can return to a more normal life in the near-term assuming that vaccinations do continue to prove successful in minimising the virus’s spread and reducing hospitalisations and fatalities.

Full text: The Department of Health has confirmed a teacher at Al-Taqwa College has tested positive to the virus.
The acquisition source of this case is currently under investigation and household contacts of the case are being urgently tested.
The case is isolating and being interviewed by contact tracers.
In a statement, the Department confirmed urgent public health actions were underway.
“The Department will support the school community in partnership with Western Public Health Unit. Transmission risks at the school are being assessed,” it read.
“In the meantime, the school will close, and all students and staff will be instructed via direct communications to get tested and isolate until further notice.”
Covid commander Jeroen Weimar said health authorities were working on the basis that the female teacher may have been infectious in the community last week.
“We always take a deliberately cautious approach, but it serves us well,” Mr Weimar told ABC Radio.
The positive case lives with her husband in the Hobsons Bay local government area.
Mr Weimar said contact tracers would immediately test anyone who may have come into direct contact with the teacher.
“We would hopefully have some of their results by Thursday morning when we do our normal update,” he said.
Al-Taqwa College, an Islamic school that was the location of one of Melbourne’s largest outbreaks last year.
A large faith-based school in Truganina, it was linked to 185 cases and closed for nearly two months.
A statement from the school said the college “assures our families, staff and the Victorian community that we have done everything required by the Victorian government to implement Covid-19 protocols and precautions, as we have throughout this pandemic”.
“The health department, the college and Jeroen Weimar’s team are working co-operatively together,” he said.
Dr Hanna El-Khoury, a Newport GP close to the school community, told the Herald Sun there was great frustration. “But this is no different to anywhere else, it could happen anywhere,” he said. “The issue is how did it happen? Hopefully it will be an isolated case and there will not be any greater consequence.” he said.
“We all understand everything better now - this virus is very bad and needs no excuse.”
“Everyone is very responsible, everyone is feeling it,” he said.
The school has more than 300 staff and 2095 students. It receives around $30 million a year in government funding and charges under $3000 a year in fees on average. The school posted a $1.6 million loss in 2020, including $262,000 it lost after giving parents a 5 per cent discount on fees last year.
SECOND SCHOOL CLOSES OVER COVID FEARS
A second school in Melbourne’s west has closed due to Covid fears.
Ilim College in Dallas announced on Wednesday night it would close all campuses on Thursday, as they await further advice from the health department.
In a post on Facebook the college emphasised that it does not have any positive Covid cases from the current outbreak, but was shutting its doors as a precautionary measure.
The prep to year 12 Islamic school said it would provide further updates to staff and students on Thursday morning.
The school community was urged in the post to check the exposure sites list and get tested accordingly.
The Department of Health has been contacted for comment.
NEW EXPOSURE SITE LISTED
It comes as a Coles in Yarraville has been listed as a tier two exposure site after the new infection was made public.
Anyone who visited the supermarket on Williamstown Road and High Street between 4:30pm – 5:30pm on July 29 must get tested and isolate until receiving a negative result.
It is the first exposure site to be added to the Department of Health’s website since Saturday.
The new infection comes hours after Victoria’s consecutive run of Covid cases appeared to end on Wednesday, with the state recording no new local cases in the previous 24 hours.
In an astonishing sign the Delta outbreak has been squashed, it was the first day of no new locally acquired cases since the most recent outbreak began in mid-July.
Deoples COVID-19 Victorian Exposure Sites Table
TESTING SITE BREACH PROBED FOR LINK TO MYSTERY CASE
Contact tracers are preparing to ramp up investigations into an earlier mystery case from a Moonee Valley Covid testing site.
Covid commander Jeroen Weimar said the Department of Health was actively probing whether a breach may have occurred at the site.
It comes as Mr Weimar urged Victorians to avoid complacency about the virus.
“Only a week ago we found that new case in the community, the traffic controller that was completely unexpected — it was not on the trajectory eight days ago but now suddenly you’re dealing with a brand new case,” he said.
“You can do a fantastic job of getting an outbreak driven down, only to have it wiped away a few weeks later when you see another incursion.”
Just 3000 of more than 20,000 primary close contacts from the outbreak remain in isolation as hundreds are released back into the community each day.
No new exposure sites have been added since Saturday.
More than 30,000 Victorians turned out to get a test on Tuesday, and 17,612 vaccine doses were administered.
Nine Victorians are in hospital with Covid-19. Two of those are in ICU with both on a ventilator.
Covid-19 commander Jeroen Weimar said he was “delighted” to record no new local cases.
Chief health officer Brett Sutton celebrated the milestone by tweeting an image of Aussie Olympic champion Ariarne Titmus’s coach Dean Boxall’s viral celebration after she won gold.
Victoria has recorded 220 cases linked to the two outbreaks that jumped the border from Sydney’s deadly Delta cluster – one from a team of Sydney removalists who transited through the state and the other from a family who returned to Melbourne’s north from a NSW red zone.
No new cases were recorded in hotel quarantine, with the number for active infections in the state falling to 99 – down from 124 on Tuesday.
It comes as Day 13 tests are set to begin at the LaCrosse apartment complex in Docklands.
Mr Weimar said a large portion of existing close contacts would be released from their 14-day quarantine period in the coming days.
195 primary close contacts are associated with the Woolworths Devon Plaza in Doncaster which was visited by a positive case last week but 89 per cent of those have returned a negative test.
261 people have been deemed primary close contacts of the Moonee Valley testing site in Moonee Ponds but 91 per cent have so far returned a negative test.
“In terms of the overall outbreak, we all obviously still have more work to do, these outbreaks are not over until we’ve got everybody cleared, until all remaining leads have been closed down, all exposure sites released,” Mr Weimar said.
NEW INSIGHT INTO VICTORIAN JABS

An additional 60,000 Pfizer bookings will be made available at state run vaccination clinics in the coming months.
People can now book their spot but there is no change to eligibility yet.
Deputy Secretary of Covid-19 Vaccinations Naomi Bromley urged Victorians to roll up their sleeves.
“Get vaccinated, get protected, and help us get back to normal,” Ms Bromley said.
When asked about Victorians turning up to vaccination sites in a bid to secure leftover Pfizer jabs that hadn’t been used, Mr Weimar said wastage wasn’t occurring.
“Our clinics are running at a really rigorous and robust and professional system,” he said.
“The wastage amount we’re seeing is low.”
Ms Bromley said the state was looking forward to even more supply becoming available in September, October and November.
“Supply continues to be the limiting factor – not hesitancy or even complacency,” she said.
Ms Bromley said the state government would continue to align their vaccine rollout with the Commonwealth’s rollout.
“Our horizons are the Commonwealth’s horizons,” she said.
AstraZeneca could be made available for people under 60 at state-run mass vaccination centres in coming weeks.
Ms Bromley said the matter was under active consideration, adding more would be said soon.
INTERSTATE VIRUS OUTBREAKS WORSEN
New South Wales recorded 233 virus cases in the past 24 hours and a man in his 20s died “suddenly” from the virus.
NSW chief health officer Kerry Chant said the man, who was being cared for by the local health district, died in his home in southwest Sydney.
“He was being cared for by the southwestern Sydney local health district during his isolation period and he had reached the day 13,” she said.
Vic Locally-acquired Covid-19
“He was being followed up daily by nursing staff and suddenly deteriorated.”
His death is being referred to the coroner, Dr Chant said.
A woman in her 80s has also died.
The new figures come after NSW Health issued a mammoth list of new exposure sites which were littered across 79 suburbs.
NSW Premier Gladys Berejiklian said more than 105,000 people were tested in the latest reporting period.
It comes as the state’s health authorities issued the biggest ever list of Covid-exposed venues, including a Woolworths visited by a positive case over 11 days.
Queensland has recorded 16 new locally acquired Covid-19 cases as the southeast’s Delta cluster continues to wreak havoc.
Confirmation of a positive case in Cairns, in the state’s far north, has authorities on edge.
While the fully vaccinated reef pilot tested positive for the Delta variant, authorities said the case was not linked to the Brisbane outbreak.
There are 63 cases in the outbreak, the biggest cluster Queensland has seen.
Meanwhile, just as South Australia had begun to shake the shackles of lockdown, another locally acquired Covid-19 case has been recorded.
The person was already isolating in the state’s dedicated Covid-positive facility, Tom’s Court Hotel.
Premier Steven Marshall confirmed the newest infection was linked to the Modbury cluster, bringing the total number of connected infections to 22.
The cluster was thought to have stopped growing at 21 cases, with the last recorded on July 29.

NYE CELEBRATIONS IN LIMBO
Melbourne’s New Year’s Eve fireworks display is under threat from pandemic restrictions for the second year in a row.
With mass outdoor gatherings unlikely to be permitted in the city for several months, events like the fireworks and related entertainment on the night are in limbo.
City of Melbourne ditched the $3.4m New Year’s Eve celebration in 2020, opting instead for a more low-key ticketed event involving central city eateries and bars.
Lord Mayor Sally Capp said it was too early to say what the festival would look like this year and whether it would have fireworks, “given the pace of change and disruption we’re experiencing at the moment”.
“We’re in active discussions with the Victorian government about what may be possible to safely deliver this year’s event, but we will ultimately be guided by the health advice,” she said.
“We hope we will be able to deliver a bigger celebration – because more people in the city means keeping people in jobs and our restaurants, bars and cafes full.”
Pyrotechnics firm Howard and Sons is on call to stage fireworks for New Year’s Eve if it goes ahead, but director Andrew Howard said it was a difficult time.
“We are preparing to go ahead with all events that are safe to proceed, but we’ve got events all around the country cancelling, and we have events trying to proceed,” he said.
Mr Howard said the company was changing the way it presented shows during the pandemic.
“We design fireworks displays where people can actually stay at home and watch,” he said.
“The idea is to be innovative in how you enable people to do what they can do safely, but not give them nothing.”
The AFL Grand Final Parade will not proceed in its usual way this year and the Melbourne Cup Parade faces a similar fate.
Council-run events such as Melbourne Fashion Week, Melbourne Music Week and the Christmas Festival are being planned with COVIDSafe rules and flexibility in mind, particularly given restrictions and health advice can change quickly.
Ms Capp said the more people who got vaccinated, “the bigger and better our events will be”.
“The size of any future events relies on every single one of us doing what we can,” she said.
HITTING VACCINE TARGET WON’T END RULES
Covid-19 containment measures will be needed to prevent 2000 deaths a year even once 80 per cent of the adult population is vaccinated, according to Australia’s plan to live with the virus.
The Doherty Institute’s modelling, used by the national cabinet to set its vaccination target to reopen the country, confirms snap lockdowns will be the best way to stop the Delta variant until 70 per cent of Australians over 16 have received both vaccinations.
Once that target is reached, crowd caps at major events and density limits in offices and hospitality venues will still be required – costing the economy $140m a week – and rapid testing, tracing, isolation and quarantine will need to be maintained.

SUPERMARKET, STADIUM VAX HUBS
Stadium carparks, supermarkets and shopping centres could be turned into vaccination sites within months as the jab rollout chief revealed how he plans to reach the summer vaccination target.
Lieutenant General John Frewen’s vaccine campaign plan indicates the critical marks to reopen the country will “potentially” be met in the final two months of the year.

NEW YORK’S DRASTIC NEW RULE
Gyms, bars, restaurants, theatres and sporting venues.
Anyone who wants to visit these venues indoors in New York City will need to provide proof of Covid vaccination starting this month, Mayor Bill de Blasio announced on Tuesday.
People who haven’t had the shot will be denied entry.
“It’s time for people to see vaccination as necessary to living a good and full and healthy life,” Mr de Blasio said during his daily press briefing.
Meanwhile, beer joints, doughnuts and cars are just a few of the vaccine incentives being offered around the world.

SUTTON REJECTS RAPID TESTING CALL
Chief health officer Brett Sutton has slapped down fresh calls to introduce rapid antigen coronavirus tests more widely.
Responding to renewed pleas from the state Opposition to adopt the alternative testing, Professor Sutton said the standard PCR test remained the “genuine gold standard”.
“A rapid antigen test is reasonably good … but it’s not a perfect test by any means. You really want a supremely accurate test if you have a true positive case out there,” he said.
“We want a test that will tell us that we are negative all of the time.
“When you are doing tens of thousands of tests per day, you don’t want dozens of false positive cases that you need to chase up as if they are real cases, put others in quarantine and declare them primary close contacts when that is not a correct result.”
Opposition Leader Michael O’Brien on Tuesday joined party colleagues for a rapid test, which he says have an accuracy of 95 to 99 per cent.
Mr O’Brien, who returned a negative result in just 15 minutes, said his party wanted to see the tests used for events and to visit people in hospital and aged care.
Premier Daniel Andrews said he would not be taking advice from the “people on the front steps of parliament”.

Full text: Projections by Dr Chris Billington from Melbourne University show Australia could reach the 70 per cent adult vaccination rate on November 8 and 80 per cent on November 21.
Those milestones were adopted as key triggers for the loosening of restrictions by National Cabinet last Friday.
NSW Premier Gladys Berejiklian has suggested a 50 per cent vaccination rate – about where the US is right now – could be used to trigger some freedoms, but declined to specify what they might be.
Infectious diseases expert Professor Peter Collingnon from the ANU said Ms Berejiklian’s suggestion was “more realistic” than the 70 and 80 per cent vaccination targets, which were an “all or nothing view”.
Restrictions should be “proportional to the risk of spread and the consequences of that spread,” he said, and the turning of the seasons would play a role in that calculation.
“Winter is more of a risk than spring and early summer,” Prof Collingnon said. “Covid-19 can spread in summer, but less readily than in winter.”
vax dates
Other modelling conducted by a team from Sydney University suggests easing restrictions too early or too liberally could be disastrous.
“Our model suggests that re-opening and ceasing lockdowns with under 50 per cent of the population fully vaccinated could generate around 10,000 cases a day across Australia,” team leader Professor Mikhail Prokopenko said.
“This part of the modelling was done on the previous, less contagious strain. The delta strain, as we know, is more contagious, so it could result in even more cases with a premature re-opening.”
Similarly bleak predictions were made in the Doherty Institute modelling used by National Cabinet and released on Tuesday.
The Doherty team found that with a 50 per cent vaccination rate, infections could top 1.1 million and deaths could get to 10,000 within six months.
NED-4305-Vaccine-effectiveness-estimates
Countries such as the US and UK have loosened restrictions at far lower vaccination rates than 70 and 80 per cent, prompting some to call for Australia to follow their lead, but Prof Collingnon said such comparisons were “not legitimate”.
“We don’t want to be compared to a country with a huge death toll,” he said. “The US and UK had uncontrolled spread while we had minimal spread. It’s reasonable to compare us to New Zealand, Japan, South Korea and Singapore.”
With increased supplies of vaccines coming online, Prof Collingnon said he was hopeful Australia could achieve 75 per cent adult vaccination by mid October.
“There’s light at the end of the tunnel,” he said.
NED-4150-Pathway-out-of-pandemic
Dr Billington’s projections of Australia’s vaccination rate is based on supply only, so it doesn’t take into account some of the human factors that could push back herd immunity milestones.
“Hesitancy or slackness certainly could limit the rate of uptake toward the end, but is hard to predict. So this model is very much a case of ‘what’s possible if we don’t have significant hesitancy and people go and get vaccinated when it’s their turn,’” Dr Billington said.
If the government were to include Australians aged 12-16 in the mass vaccine rollout program, the target 80 per cent date could still be reached on December 2, he added.
Nearly 41 per cent of people aged 16 and over have had one dose of vaccine and just over 19 per cent have had two doses, according to government figures.

War over percentage who need to be vaccinated to stop Covid

Full text: And while some medical experts argue children should not be vaccinated against Covid until there is evidence it provides them a benefit others disagree.
A war has erupted among experts over what proportion of the population must have the jab.
Modelling by James Cook University epidemiologist Professor Emma McBryde argues 85 per cent of the population, including children, needs to be vaccinated to achieve herd immunity against the more infectious Delta strain of the virus.
Vaccination rates by SA4
If vaccine coverage was targeted to the most infectious ages Australia could achieve herd immunity by vaccinating 75 per cent of the population.
However this would require 100 per cent uptake in the 20 to 60 year age groups, Professor McBryde said.
“My estimate is that without vaccinating younger people, we will not achieve herd immunity,” she said.
“This would require vaccinating down to 5 year olds if we want herd immunity. But if we don’t do this, the cases amongst children will be mild, but they may end up being a reservoir of infection,” she said..
Former health department chief now Grattan Institute researcher Professor Stephen Duckett has said the government’s benchmark, which excludes children, would be inadequate because it meant only 64 per cent of the entire population would be vaccinated.
The Doherty Institute which did the modelling showed there would still be a 20-40 per cent risk of Victorian style hard lockdowns under this scenario, he said.
“What they said is, assuming our test trace and isolating capacity is optimal, and quarantine capacity is optimal, then you could open up at say, 70 per cent with really low rates of likelihood of a Victorian style hard lockdown,” Professor Duckett said.
“If you don’t believe they’re optimal, then they gave you another choice in which case, opening at 70 per cent, means that you’ve got somewhere between a 20 per cent and a 40 per cent risk of a Victorian style heart lockdown,” he said.
“I think is a very risky strategy to open up at 54 or 65 per cent of the population, and their modelling shows that,” he said.
Professor Duckett insists the only way to prevent ongoing hard lockdowns is to vaccinate 80 per cent of the entire population including children.
NED-4166-Vaccination-by-percentage-of-age-bracket
Immunisation Coalition spokesman Professor Robert Booy said children with certain health problems should be vaccinated if they derived a benefit from the jab, they should not be given the shots merely to achieve herd immunity.
“Children are in a powerless position and they need to have advocates who say, okay, don’t do anything to children unless we’re sure we first do no harm,” he said.
Only 400 children had died from Covid in the United States compared to 600,000 adults so the cost benefit ratio of vaccinating them was different, he said.
Doherty Institute Professor Jodie McVernon who is advising the government said vaccinating 12-15 year olds would add very little to herd immunity.
NED-4292-Percentage-of-eligible-population-fully-vaccinated-by-state
We should wait until more evidence emerges on the benefit of Covid vaccines to children, Professor Booy said.
These studies in children as young as six months are currently underway.
AMA President Dr Omar Khorshid said: “The PM has released the modelling and the AMA will consider it”.
“We welcome the fact that National Cabinet has agreed to set vaccination targets so that we have a pathway to a more normal life and Australians know that they need to get vaccinated if we are to get back to normal,” he said.

Full text: A lightning response vaccination unit targeting infection outbreaks is part of the Morrison government’s battle plan to curb Covid-19 and raise vaccination rates by the end of the year.
Scott Morrison has unveiled the Doherty Institute’s modelling which has guided that nation’s blueprint for living with Covid which indicates 20 to 39-year-olds are most likely to spread the virus.
Gladys Berejiklian has set a target of 6 million vaccinations by the end of August, as NSW records 199 new local cases.
Queensland has recorded 16 new cases of locally-acquired Covid-19, all which have been linked to the Indooroopilly Delta cluster. The total number of cases associated with the cluster is now 47.
Vaccination rates by SA4
Tom Dusevic 11.30pm: It’s worth giving Covid-19 vaccine incentives a shot
Australia is spending $8bn on its Covid-19 vaccination program, which is a pittance against the economic cost of lockdowns and damage to livelihoods and lives.
Yet having invested so much buying miracle drugs developed at warp speed, we need to find the best way – from messaging to logistics – to get vaccines in arms.
Scott Morrison has outlined ambitious targets of fully vaccinating between 70 and 80 per cent of the eligible population, or 14.4 million to 16.5 million people, to move into the next two phases of reopening the economy. But to achieve them we’ll need more ­robust and bespoke incentives than the Prime Minister’s “freedom passes” or appeals to the “Australian way”.

Joseph Lam 10.05pm: HK reduces quarantine period
Hong Kong has reduced its quarantine period for countries deemed low and medium risk, with vaccinated tourists able to travel the region after seven days in hotel quarantine.
Under the new rules vaccinated Australians, only if permitted to leave the country, could be travelling to Hong Kong after seven days in hotel quarantine from August 9.
“All inbound travellers are required to present prior to boarding proof of a negative COVID-19 nucleic acid test result conducted within 72 hours before the aircraft’s scheduled departure time and confirmation of a room reservation at a designated quarantine hotel in Hong Kong,” a statement from the Hong Kong government read.
The government also said it would strengthen vaccination and testing arrangements for airport and quarantine staff.

Greg Brown 9.20pm: PM open to a lottery but not cash splash
Scott Morrison has lashed ­Anthony Albanese’s proposal to pay people to get Covid-19 jabs as a “vote of no confidence in Australians”, but left the door open to ­implementing a vaccine lottery.
The Prime Minister said Labor’s proposal to give $300 to everyone who was fully vaccinated by December 1 was a “bubble without a thought”.
“It says to them that their health concerns that they might have about a vaccine can be paid off. And I don’t think that’s the view of Australians,” Mr Morrison said on Tuesday.
“I think doing it for themselves, their family, their communities and for their country is what motivates them to do this.”
However, Mr Morrison said the government would “look at” proposals for a vaccine lottery if an ­increased uptake was needed, ­arguing there was a “big difference” between a lottery and Mr ­Albanese’s cash handout policy.
“The fiscal difference is pretty huge … and we’ve had lots of private offers of how things like that might work,” Mr Morrison said.
“But the primary reason why Australians are going to do this is because Australians know that it’s good for them, their family and their country.”

Richard Ferguson 8.35pm: Life more of a right than jab refusal
The biggest civil liberties group in NSW has backed vaccine mandates in high-risk workplaces and jab passports to get into stadiums and nightclubs, saying life itself is a fundamental right.
Business groups have begun to call on Scott Morrison and the national cabinet to begin setting out rules for employers who want to make vaccines compulsory for workers as the vaccine rollout and eligibility for Covid-19 jabs ramps up.
The Law Council of Australia has joined constitutional experts to declare vaccine mandates in workplaces reasonable, and lawful in certain circumstances and under public health orders.
NSW Council for Civil Liberties president Pauline Wright this week told The Australian that targeted vaccine mandates were not an incursion on Australians’ freedoms.
“It’s within the rights of employers to say to employees I need to keep everyone safe. The right to life, the right to be free of disease, is pretty fundamental,” she said.
“And with vaccine passports at a nightclub, for example, you make a deal at the door. You’re saying if you come into my premises, I have to think of my staff.
“We would oppose a blanket mandate across the population as that offends freedoms – people have religious views, for ­example – but looking at each ­instance (in different workplaces), it’s hard to see an incursion on liberties.”
Hotel quarantine and residential aged-care workers are the only groups currently mandated to receive vaccinations as a condition of employment.

Dennis Shanahan 7.50pm: Bad cop, good cop shift a political landmine
Anthony Albanese has stepped on a landmine of his own making with his $6bn proposal for $300 cash payments for vaccination.
It’s bad policy created for political reasons and could turn out to be bad politics as well.
The Opposition Leader’s surprise plan came as he had Scott Morrison under pressure and was benefiting from attacks on the Prime Minister’s “failure” on the Covid-19 vaccine rollout.
Before parliament resumed on Tuesday, Albanese was in the political ascendancy and Morrison’s leadership was failing after the Delta virus outbreaks and economic lockdowns in NSW, Queensland, Victoria and South Australia.
Albanese’s case was that Morrison had failed the “only two jobs” he had in 2021 – to deliver enough vaccines and to prevent quarantine breaches from sparking new outbreaks.
Albanese was also aware that while legitimate campaigns for an opposition, his blaming Morrison made him look negative, carping and a whinger without a positive alternative to what the Coalition was doing.
So without warning or widespread consultation within the ALP, Albanese announced his plan for a $300 payment for every Australian to get fully vaccinated, which he costed at a total of $6bn, including $5bn between now and Christmas.
Albanese enthusiastically described it as positive, constructive, practical and common sense with “no downside” or negative impact.

Carparks at major sporting stadiums could be turned into drive-through vaccine hubs as early as nex month.
The federal government is considering the move as part of an overhaul to give people aged 30 and over the Pfizer Covid-19 vaccine, Nine News reported on Tuesday.
Shopping centres will also reportedly be involved in the drive-through push, while “flying squads” of nurses will begin going into workplaces to vaccinate employees as early as October, the report said.

Stephen Lunn 6.35pm: Regional exodus from big smoke
About 11,800 more people fled capital cities to the regions than moved from the country to the big smoke in the three months to March, more than in any quarter since records began two decades ago.
Melbourne and Sydney led the way, losing a net 8300 and 8200 people respectively to the regions, Australian Bureau of Statistics data reveals.
Brisbane had the biggest net gain of people either from elsewhere in Queensland or interstate, adding 3300 to its popu­lation from overall internal migration, including 2600 from interstate.
“(Overall) Queensland gained the most people from net interstate migration (+7000) over the March 2021 quarter, while ­Victoria lost the most (-4900), closely followed by NSW (-4500),” the figures detail.
There was higher volatility overall in the interstate movement of people than in the same period last year when Covid-19 was first starting to affect free movement.
More than 16,400 more ­people moved interstate in the March quarter this year ­compared to the 2020 March quarter, the ABS data shows. NSW was the leaving point for most of those moving to Queensland, with 3800 packing their bags to move north of the Tweed.

Max Maddison 5.05pm: PM takes aim at Queensland CHO on vaccines
Scott Morrison has taken aim at Queensland chief health officer Jeanette Young saying her view “isn’t the national view”, while cash incentives won’t “shift the dial” of vaccine hesitancy,
The Morrison government’s reopening roadmap, based on modelling done by the Doherty Institute, sees society effectively resume as normal with 70 per cent coverage of the population aged 16-years and older, before almost all restrictions are removed at 80 per cent coverage.
While responding to doubts about the ability to reach that level of vaccination coverage, the Prime Minister said he believed in Australians responding to the challenge, before saying he didn’t believe Labor’s cash incentive would change people’s intentions.
“We need to get more points of presence so people can go and get it,” Mr Morrison told 3AW on Tuesday afternoon. “I don’t think it does shift the dial. What does shift the dial is you can go and get it and you can get it now.”
With mixed messaging undermining the rollout of AstraZeneca, Mr Morrison attempted to assuage concerns about the vaccine. He then took aim at Ms Young, who had refused to back down on her warnings about the jab.
“She can have that view, but that doesn’t align with what ATAGI thinks, it doesn’t align with what the Therapeutic Goods Administration thinks, and it doesn’t align with what the chief medical officer thinks,” he said.
“That’s not the national view, that’s not the medical view being put forward by General Frewen.”

Tom Dusevic 3.45pm: Crack vax unit at heart of PM’s battle plan
A lightning response vaccination unit targeting infection outbreaks is part of the Morrison government’s battle plan to curb Covid-19 and raise vaccination rates by the end of the year.
According to the National Covid Vaccine Campaign Plan for Operation Covid Shield, a new crack National Response Option “is an opportunity to increase vaccination capacity when and where required” in the event of an outbreak.
The new unit will be dispersed nationally and be on call to move quickly.
The co-ordinator general of the National Covid-19 Vaccine Taskforce, Lieutenant General John Frewen, said “while there are many factors involved in reducing the spread of COVID-19, vaccination is the most effective means we have to build nation resilience”.
The new unit is “intended to be capable of supporting the states and territories in achieving or exceeding targets either by reinforcing success or addressing delay in extraordinary circumstances”.
“Once we reach threshold vaccination rate levels, we will be able to live with this virus and begin our recovery,” the plan says.
“The National Response Option will be dedicated solely to the task of administering vaccinations and will maintain a high level of readiness in the event of a callout, being dispatched to the location directed to provide between 2000 and 3000 additional vaccinations daily over the course of a two-week campaign.
“Consumables and vaccines will be progressively held with the National Response Option as supply permits during 2021.
“The workforce will be made up of NCVTF-controlled contractors not employed by other jurisdictions. It will consist of 50-100 FTE clinical staff, plus the required non-clinical staff.
“The workforce will reside in nationally dispersed locations and concentrate in a single location at the discretion of the Co-ordinator General.
“Clinical Governance will be at the direction of the Commonwealth, working in close conjunction with the state Chief Medical Officers for licensing, and will address cross border movement requirements in the event of border closures”.
LG Frewen said that “intrinsic to this plan is a collaborative assessments process to identify strengths and weaknesses to ensure the plan’s overall success”.
“The plan also realises the establishment of a National Response Option that will be able to react and support States and Territories when the need for additional vaccine capacity is required.
“This is a critical endeavour for our nation. We all need to work together to ensure that we protect our people and recover as quickly as possible from this pandemic. Together we can get this done.”
COVID-19 Australia: Cumulative vaccinations by state
Max Maddison 2.45pm: ‘No comparison’ between virus vaccine, child jabs
Anthony Albanese has drawn attention to comments by Scott Morrison about the “no jab, no pay”, as he tried to draw a parallel between the two immunisation incentive programs.
Amid a fierce Coalition attack on Labor’s $6 billion vaccination incentive scheme, the Opposition Leader unsuccessfully tried to table a transcript of the Prime Minister’s press conference from earlier on Tuesday, where he claimed the policy wasn’t necessarily designed as an incentive.
While citing comments by Mr Morrison, who previously said the policy was an “important initiative aimed at boosting child immunisation rates”, Mr Albanese asked whether the policy was “wrong then or today”?
But Mr Morrison said there was “no comparison” between child immunisation rates and the federal government’s attempts to vaccinate the entire population.
“The point I was making was to draw a comparison between that and what was occurring at that time is not a proper comparison. Mr Spooker, the Leader of the Opposition might be desperately trying to put some clothes on his ill-thought proposal.
“No Jab No Pay” was a policy initiative delivered under the Abbott government which saw tax benefits withheld from parents of children who were not fully immunised.

DAVID ROGERS 2.35pm: RBA leaves rates, taper plan unchanged
The RBA has left its target interest rates unchanged as expected, while surprising economists by leaving its plan to taper its bond purchases to $4bn in early September and keep it at that level until at least mid-November.
Economists widely expected the RBA to reverse its taper plan due to Covid lockdowns.
AUD/USD has consequently soared 0.5% to 0.7395.
Max Maddison 2.23pm: PM to Labor: Support rather than undermine vax program
Scott Morrison has told Labor to stop “undermining” the vaccination program, as he moves to mitigate attacks on the pace of the rollout and the hotel quarantine system.
In a slimmed down Question Time on Tuesday afternoon, lacking a number of MPs due to Covid restrictions across the country, the Prime Minister responded to a question from Anthony Albanese which asserted widespread outbreaks demonstrated that Mr Morrison had failed his job.
“If the Opposition, if the Labor Party, if they want to support this national effort, Mr Speaker, then I invite them to spend more time supporting the vaccination program than undermining it,” Mr Morrison said.
Mr Morrison also continued to attack Labor’s $6 billion vaccination incentive program, after the opposition leader invited him to adopt the policy.
“The Leader of the Opposition’s proposal is a vote of no confidence and an insult to Australians, suggesting they won’t get vaccinated unless you dole out the cash,” he said.
“Over these years in opposition, this Labor Party has learnt absolutely nothing. The cash splashes of their last untargeted, ill disciplined fiscal recklessness, Mr Speaker, is writ large again.”

Ellen Ransley 2.19pm: Two major cities Aussies are abandoning
The populations of Sydney and Melbourne fell by more than 8000 people in the March quarter as Brisbane and Perth boosted their numbers.
Internal migration figures, released by the Australian Bureau of Statistics on Tuesday, revealed Brisbane gained the most people through net internal migration (+3300), while Melbourne lost the most (-8300) in the March 2021 quarter.
Melbourne’s net loss was closely followed by Sydney (-8200).
Of the net gain to Brisbane, 710 people relocated from other parts of Queensland, while 2600 arrived from around the country.
A net loss of 11,800 people from Australia’s capital cities through internal migration was recorded in the first three months of the year, the most significant amount in 20 years.
“This was the largest net loss on record since the series started in 2001, surpassing the previous record net loss set in the September 2020 quarter (-11,200),” the ABS report stated.
“The net loss was the result of 54,400 arrivals (down from 55,400 in the December 2020 quarter) and 66,300 departures (up slightly from 66,000) to non-capital city areas.”
Internal migration by capital city, March 2021:

Ellie Dudley 2.00pm: Positive case detected in Cairns
A positive case of Covid-19 has been detected in Cairns, in far north Queensland.
An investigation by Queensland Health is under way to determine the status of the case.
Queensland Health said it was still unclear whether the positive notification was an active or historical case, according to reports from the Courier Mail.
The new potential case comes as Queensland recorded 16 new locally acquired cases of Covid-19 on Tuesday, tallying the state’s current Delta cluster to 47 cases.
Olivia Caisley 1.50pm: Phony conflict: Premier ‘not at odds’ with expert advice
Scott Morrison has rejected claims that NSW Premier Gladys Berejiklian’s target of reducing the state’s restrictions after achieving a 50 per cent vaccination rate contradicts Doherty Institute modelling, declaring it is a “phony conflict”.
As parts of the state enter its fifth week of lockdown Ms Berejiklian on Tuesday flagged restrictions could be eased once NSW reaches six million jabs and if case numbers are lower by the end of August.
Chief Medical Officer Professor Paul Kelly says Australians can look forward to a “soft landing” once the country reaches its vaccination targets. Under national cabinet’s four-stage road map, Australians will see an easing of restrictions once 70 per cent of Australians are fully vaccinated. “The modelling very clearly shows that once we get to a certain point in the vaccination strategy, which is in the next few months, we will be able to look at that point and say that we can see a soft landing from this in a way that no other country has seen to date and that’s the great hope that we see in this modelling,” he said. “It will be tough to get there, and after we get that the vaccination will also continue to rise, but we'll need to have those other public health and other measures in place as well.”
The Prime Minister said Doherty Institute modelling that supports an end to lockdowns once national vaccine rates hit 80 per cent was a separate issue.
“We’re talking in one instance about a national vaccination strategy where short, sharp lockdowns are the response during the suppression phase before you move at 70 per cent into the next phase where that isn’t as necessary or at all necessary, and certainly almost completely unnecessary once you get to 80 per cent,” he said. “That is a separate issue as to how you come out of a lockdown you’re already in.”
He cautioned Australians not to conflate two issues.
“I think we need to be careful that we’re not mixing two issues here. This (the Doherty modelling) is not a vaccination rate to break out of an existing lockdown. This is a vaccination rate that enables Australia as a country to move from phase A to phase B to phase C. So I think we’ve got to avoid sort of phony conflicts here,” he said.

Max Maddison 1.31pm: Coalition MPs oppose ADF on streets to fight virus
Members of the Morrison government with libertarian concerns say the Coalition shouldn’t be putting the army on the streets to deal with Covid outbreaks, and shouldn’t be demonising unvaccinated members of the wider community.
The Coalition held their first joint party room meeting for the Spring parliamentary sitting weeks on Tuesday morning. And some members used the opportunity to question the draconian measures implemented by state and federal governments to stem the spread of the virus.
According to sources present at the meeting, one member, who said they weren’t “anti-vaccination but pro-freedom”, conceded their views were likely to be in the minority of the party room and wider community, and asserted people needed to have a freedom of choice and freedom of movement.
As a corollary, they said the Coalition shouldn’t be preventing people from employment or services if they chose not to get vaccinated, and shouldn’t be restricting overseas travel. Another member retorted that those rights went both ways, and people could choose to avoid people who hadn’t been vaccinated.
Nationals senator Matt Canavan weighed in to defend the ability for people to choose whether they got the vaccine, saying they were effectively making a decision on their health, as he cited overseas evidence, which showed vaccines didn’t stop the spread of the virus.

Olivia Caisley 1.05pm: Vaccine incentives ‘not needed yet’
Vaccine rollout commander Lieutenant-General John “JJ” Frewen says he doesn’t think vaccination incentives are needed just yet amid calls from federal Labor for a $300 payout for those who get both jabs.
Prime Minister Scott Morrison says the Doherty Institute's modelling outlining vaccination targets have been released as part of Australia’s “plan to live with the virus”. “That plan is based on common sense precautions that prevail and is based on a pathway on vaccination that provides the protection necessary to ensure the many tools we have to suppress the virus and its impacts on lives and livelihoods are held at bay,” he said. “The targets that are part of this plan, the vaccination targets of 70 per cent to get to the next phase and 80 per cent to Phase C are based on the world’s best scientific analysis and economic advice.” Mr Morrison said “more than 30,000 lives” had been saved due to the country’s COVID-19 response with one in five Australians now fully vaccinated. “We now have one in five Australians who have received double dose, we now have two in five Australians who have had a first dose, we have around two-thirds of Australians aged over 50 who have had a first dose," he said.
“We’ve got really strong signs that the vast majority of Australians intend to come forward to get vaccinated because it’s the right thing to do,” he said on Tuesday. “And that really is the best incentive right now, to do it for themselves, their friends, families, communities and for the country. Right now we don’t think incentives are necessary and it’s really pleasing to see how many Australians are willing to get vaccinated.”
Scott Morrison blasted Anthony Albanese’s calls to dole-out $300 payments to Australians who get vaccinations as a “bubble without a thought.”
The Prime Minister on Tuesday said Covid-19 was a serious public health crisis and not a game show, declaring he trusted Australians to do the right thing without monetary incentives.
“I think the proposal that has been put forward by the Labor Party and Mr Albanese is a vote of no confidence in Australians,” Mr Morrison said.
“It says to them that their health concerns that they might have about a vaccine can be paid off and I don’t think that’s the beauty of Australians. I’ve seen Australians respond with courage, determination and kindness over the past 18 months.”
Lieutenant-General Frewen said that “even” rates of vaccination across the nation are essential going forward.
“It’s really important that we vaccinate the nation as consistently and as evenly as we can,” he says.
“The data that we released yesterday gives good insight into how progress is going and we’ll be watching very carefully from here on in to see where some areas are moving ahead and where other areas are falling behind and we’ll be adapting the plan and offering additional assistance to those areas that do need to be brought along a bit more quickly.”

Olivia Caisley 12.50pm: Early, short, sharp lockdowns ‘most cost-effective’
Josh Frydenberg says Treasury analysis shows “early interventions, short, sharp lockdowns, are the most cost-effective way” to handle Covid-19 with vaccinations the key to returning to normal.
The Treasurer on Tuesday said until Australia gets to a national vaccination rate of 70 per cent, state and territory governments need to move fast to lockdown or risk a greater economic burden.
“These numbers underline the imperative of Australians getting vaccinated.
It is the way out of this crisis and it is the way to avoid longer, more severe, lockdowns (in the future),” Mr Frydenberg said.
“The second key finding or outcome from the economic analysis is that the economic cost comes down significantly. If government’s work quickly to get on top of the virus … early interventions, short sharp lockdowns are the most cost effective way to handle the virus, particularly at the current time.”
It comes as the NSW Berejiklian government was criticised for taking too long to implement a lockdown over the state’s Delta outbreak.
Mr Frydenberg said the stage four lockdown restrictions in Victoria in August last year cost the national economy $3.2bn a week, while the state’s stage three restrictions in May 2020 cost the economy $2.35bn.
The Treasurer says the numbers underline the imperative of Australians getting vaccinated.

Olivia Caisley 12.40pm: New vaccine strategy: Jab the young sooner
Professor Jodie McVernon from the Doherty Institute says 20-39-year-olds are most likely to spread the virus and epidemiologists are proposing a reorientation of the national vaccine strategy to get this group vaccinated as soon as possible.
Prime Minister Scott Morrison says 30,000 Australians or more would be dead if we had not responded the “Australian way”.
“Yes, children can get Covid and we are concerned about them becoming infected, but they’re nowhere near as good (at spreading Covid-19) as their parents are,” she said.
“So this virus’s case, it’s really the 20 to 39 years category, who are the big spreaders, and they will bring it home for their children … and to their own parents, and this is the group now where they’re proposing the reorientation of the strategy.”
Max Maddison 12.36pm: Morrison blasts Albanese’s vaccination ‘bribe’
Scott Morrison has launched a blistering attack on Labor’s cash incentives, saying Anthony Albanese has “lost belief if he thinks he needs to bribe the Australian people”.
The Coalition held their first joint party room meeting for the Spring parliamentary sitting weeks on Tuesday morning.
The Morrison government has launched several attacks on the opposition’s cash incentive policy which will see $300 paid to every person who receives both vaccinations by December 1. The Prime Minister questioned Labor’s $6 billion proposal during the meeting, saying the “ill-conceived” idea was “all bubbles and no thought”.
Political leaders who contribute to vaccine hesitancy across the nation by failing to incentivise, encourage and educate people to get the COVID-19 jab are “playing with fire”, political focus groups say. Opposition leader Anthony Albanese called on the federal government to throw in financial incentives by paying Australians $300 if they are fully vaccinated by the year’s end. Simon Welsh, director of Redbridge Group Australia, says there is an expectation amongst swing voters that the government will work to address problems over “confusing and mismatched messaging”. “Those governments who really aren’t getting behind and incentivising, encouraging and educating people, those governments that aren’t seen to be doing those things are playing with a bit of fire,” he told Sky News Australia. “There’s a voter cohort there, what we call a contestable voter cohort – that’s voters who swing and can be persuaded at elections, particularly in those suburban, middle-class contestable voter cohorts that are really looking at government and saying, ‘you’re contributing to this, you need to do more, you’re affecting my life through your confusing and mismatched messaging and we really have a high expectation of you trying to fix this vaccine hesitancy problem’. ‘I think if we don’t get the 70 or 80 per cent and these voter cohorts will look at that and say, ‘government, you contributed to that problem, I wouldn’t want to be in the shoes of those governments at that point.”
Moreover, Mr Morrison said the policy wasn’t about overall health, but rather Labor’s inability to manage the economy, which was reminiscent of Kevin Rudd’s investment in school halls, according to a party room source.
Deputy Prime Minister Barnaby Joyce also weighed in, questioning how much Labor would pay people to brush their teeth or get a measles shot, joking that Labor had found the cure to Covid for just $300 per person.
He added that the ALP hadn’t consulted the relevant authorities, which followed Mr Morrison asking why the ALP hadn’t sat down with Covid-19 vaccine commander Lieutenant General John Frewen since he had started in the role.
Olivia Caisley 12.32pm: Outbreaks still out of control with 50-60pc vax rate
Professor Jodie McVernon from the Doherty Institute says a national vaccination rate of 80 per cent would help to reduce the chance of lockdowns.
She said their modelling found that at 50-60 per cent vaccination, there would still be “rapidly growing outbreaks that would be very difficult to control” and that above 70 per cent that risk is far lower.
Scott Morrison said that once you get to those higher vaccination rates of 80 per cent, “the sort of death, hospitalisation and infection rates is what you expect to see with something like the flu.”
Olivia Caisley 12.27pm: ‘Australian way has saved 30,000 lives’
Scott Morrison has defended the government’s response to the crisis, declaring he has chartered an “Australian way” throughout the pandemic that has saved more than 30,000 lives.
Amid criticism over his government’s handling of the vaccine rollout, the Prime Minister on Tuesday said early challenges had been overcome and Covid-19 deaths had been prevented.
“An Australian way with Australian results that are different to almost every other country in the world bar a few – an Australian way has saved more than 30,000 lives,” he said.
“30,000 Australians and more would be dead today were it not for the Covid response that Australia has put in place.”

OLIVIA CAISLEY 12.20pm: PM unveils blueprint to reopening nation
Scott Morrison says the world is in a serious battle with the highly virulent Delta strain and Australia must continue to adapt to a shifting situation.
The Prime Minister on Tuesday is unveiling the government’s blueprint to reopening the country, based on health and economic modelling provided by the Doherty Institute and Treasury.
“This has been a long war against this virus, and there have been many, many battles,” he said.
The government’s plan, which was released on Friday after a marathon meeting with national cabinet, outlines four stages ending in a post vaccination phase where Australians live with Covid-19 in a similar way to the flu.
NED-4300-Geographic-Vaccination-Rates-Map
“Last Friday I announced Australia’s plan to live with the virus and I announced the whole country’s plan to get us back to that position where we can ultimately live with this virus in the same way that we live with other infectious diseases that are present in the community, and we can get on with our lives,” he said.
“That plan is based on common sense precautions that is based on a pathway to vaccination that provides the protection necessary to ensure the many tools we have to suppress the virus and its impact on lives and livelihoods.”
Mr Morrison says Australia is not alone in the battle against Covid-19, highlighting the fact that he spoke with his Greek counterpart, Kyriakos Mitsotakis , last night.
“This has been a long war against this virus, and there have been many, many battles, and this is a fierce one when it comes to the delta strain. “As I have said on many occasions, Australia is not alone in this battle.”

Rachel Baxendale 11.49am: Vaccinated avoiding hospital, ICU in Victoria
There are currently 10 Victorians in hospital with coronavirus, three of whom are in ICU, and one of whom is on a ventilator.
The number of people hospitalised represents just under five per cent of the 220 people who have been infected with the Delta variant of the virus as a result of Victoria’s current NSW-derived outbreaks.
No one among those hospitalised has received two doses of Covid-19 vaccine.
With 124 active coronavirus cases remaining in Victoria, including up to seven overseas-acquired cases, chief health officer Brett Sutton said 90 per cent of close contacts linked to the current community outbreaks had been released after completing their fortnight in quarantine.
About 3000 close contacts remain in isolation, with health department authorised officers conducting compliance visits to 525 households on Monday.
There are currently 9000 households isolating in Victoria as a result of returning from red zones over the past fortnight, including 1100 households who returned from southeast Queensland on Monday.
Of Victoria’s four new community-acquire Covid-19 cases on Tuesday, two are linked to a workplace associated with the Young & Jackson Hotel cluster, one is a household contact linked to a cluster of cases sparked by a red zone arrival home quarantine breach in Coolaroo in Melbourne’s outer north, and one is a workplace contact of a traffic controller at the Moonee Valley Racecourse testing centre, who tested positive last week.

Ellie Dudley 11.35am: LGA at epicentre has lowest rates of vaccination
Gladys Berejiklian has rejected accusations that her government has failed south west Sydney, after it was revealed the epicentre of the state’s latest outbreak has the lowest rates of vaccinations in Sydney.
About 14.6 per cent of people aged 15 and over are fully vaccinated in Sydney’s south west, while the North Sydney and Hornsby area had the highest rate of double vaccination with 26.9 per cent.
NED-4300-Geographical-Vaccination-Rates-NSW
The NSW Premier said the low rates in the area are due to a young population.
“The age of that population is younger than the state average,” the NSW Premier said.
“Until recently, health advice precluded a lot of people from coming forward and getting vaccinated.
“Now the health advice has changed, given the outbreak, we have made concerted efforts, whether it’s mobile clinics, ramping up pharmacy access.”
Ms Berejiklian also pointed to Qudos Bank Arena, which will be open as a mass vaccination clinic for the public on August 9, after it has finished vaccinating year 12 HSC students.

Ellie Dudley 11.20am: NSW to consider ‘freedom’ vax incentives
NSW premier Gladys Berejiklian says the state government will look at “freedom” incentives rather than cash incentives for people who get the Covid-19 jab, rejecting federal Labor’s plan to have $300 paid to everyone who is fully vaccinated.
“Look, we’ve been looking at incentives for some time in the New South Wales government,” Ms Berejiklian said.
“We’re focusing on what we believe people want at this stage. They want peace of mind that they can move more freely, send their kids to school, work.
“Any incentives around those things we think are great motivators so we’re looking at those options.”
Ms Berejiklian said her government would “encourage people” to get vaccinated by providing them with additional freedoms, which she believes is “the best motivator of all.”
She said incentives would be “linked to our plan for what life looks like on August 29.”

Ellie Dudley 11.15am: 53 NSW cases in ICU, 11 under 40
NSW has 53 cases of Covid-19 in the ICU, which chief health officer Kerry Chant says “underscores the severity” of the virus.
“We are seeing more hospitalisations associated with the Delta strain,” she said.
“We have five cases in their 20s, six in their 30s, three in their 40s, 18 in their 50s, 11 in their 60s and 10 in their 70s.”
Twenty of the 53 cases in the ICU are requiring ventilation.
Dr Chant said 43 of the 53 people in ICU are not vaccinated.
“It really is quite tragic that we’ve still got people in their 90s that are unprotected, people in their 80s, 70s and 60s, notwithstanding other age groups that are not protected,” she said.
Ellie Dudley 11.12am: Berejiklian sets target of 6m jabs by end of August
Gladys Berejiklian has set a target of 6 million vaccinations by the end of August, saying vaccinations are the key to NSW reopening.
Up to 3.9 million jabs have been administered across the state so far.
“In New South Wales at the moment, we have 3.9 million jabs of vaccinations that have been provided, and thank you to everybody taking up the vaccine,” the NSW Premier said.
“By the end of August, I’d like to see that go to 6 million jabs.
New daily cases in New South Wales
“We know that 10 million jabs gives us 80 per cent of the adult population vaccinated.”
Ms Berejiklian has hinted at future incentives for people who receive the jab.
“Whilst I alluded to incentives yesterday, we are very keen to explore what opportunities we can provide,” she said.
“In particular we know that people value their freedom, their desire to go back to work, their desire to engage in community life and those are the type of incentives that we’ll be looking at over the next little while.”
Ellie Dudley 11.02am: NSW records 199 new virus cases
NSW has recorded 199 new locally-acquired cases of Covid-19 as infections in greater Sydney continue to surge.
At least 50 cases were active in the community for the entirety of their infectious period.
A total of 104,536 tests were conducted in the 24 hours to 8pm last night.
Ellie Dudley 10.43am: New cases infectious in community for up to six days
Queensland chief health officer Jeannette Young says the lockdown will be lifted once all locally-acquired cases have been in isolation for their entire infectious period.
NED-4196-QLD-Restrictions-lifting
The state recorded 16 new cases of Covid-19 on Tuesday, bringing the latest cluster to 47.
The lockdown of 11 high risk LGAs in south east Queensland has been extended until 4pm on Sunday, but Dr Young said it would not lift until positive cases had been quarantining for the required time while infectious.
“Someone who’s been in quarantine for their full infectious period doesn’t concern me. It’s people who have been out and about, so there are more exposure sites,” she said.
Dr Young said “most” of Tuesday’s cases have been infectious in the community, some for up to 6 days.
Ellie Dudley 10.25am: New case detected in Sydney nursing home
Wyoming Nursing Home in Summer Hill has confirmed one new case of Covid-19 has been recorded in a vaccinated resident, growing the facility’s cluster to 21.
All 19 residents who have tested positive have been transferred to local hospitals, as have the other unaffected residents who live on the top floor of the facility.
Meanwhile the two staff who have shown positive tests, continue to be in isolation, a statement from the nursing home said.
“More than 80 per cent of the 65 residents and 60 staff are currently vaccinated and we expect a further round of vaccinations to be offered to any residents, who have previously declined, be undertaken over the next few days, while we are encouraging all staff to get fully vaccinated,” the statement read.
“The facility continues to work closely with the health authorities to undertake daily COVID-19 testing and contact tracing of all staff and residents of the facility.”
The home defended accusations of a “Christmas in July” function being the source of the outbreak, claiming the event was “simply a normal lunch for residents, with Christmas decorations and carols being played.”
All close contacts of the staff are in isolation and the facility remains in a full lockdown.

Ellie Dudley 10.20am: Queensland to take 150,000 new AstraZeneca doses
Queensland’s pharmacy guild will accept 150,000 new doses of the AstraZeneca vaccine from the federal government as the state gears up to fight an evolving outbreak of Covid-19.
Queensland health officer Yvette D’Ath said she has spoken to pharmacists and understands the new doses will be administered “in a matter of days.”
“I phoned the pharmacy guild and asked them if they had 150,000 vaccines available of AstraZeneca can they … get this in the arms of Queenslanders across south east Queensland in a matter of days? They said yes, they will take it,” Ms D’Ath told reporters.
“So, I asked the commonwealth, do whatever approvals you need to give today, get the 150,000 vaccines here tomorrow and we will ensure that more Queenslanders are getting vaccinated by the end of this week.”
In Queensland’s 60-69 year old age group, only 20 per cent have received their first dose of the vaccine, Ms D’Ath said.
Eighteen per cent of Queenslanders are fully vaccinated.
Ellie Dudley 10.10am: Source of Queensland outbreak still unknown
Queensland chief health officer Jeannette Young says she is “concerned” state authorities are still unaware of how the state’s latest Covid-19 cluster began.
“I’m concerned that we don’t know how this outbreak has happened,” she told Tuesday’s press conference.
Sky News Political Editor Andrew Clennell says Queensland Chief Health Officer Dr Jeannette Young’s stance on AstraZeneca is concerning. Dr Young reiterated her earlier calls discouraging anyone below the age of 60 to receive the AstraZeneca jab. This is despite the Australian Technical Advisory Group on Immunisation urging those in that age group to consult their GP. “With an outbreak and lockdown now in South East Queensland, this is concerning,” Mr Clennell said. "Particular with over 18s in Sydney encouraged by federal government advertisements to get the AstraZeneca jab.”
“We know the very first two cases that arrived in Queensland on 29 June, but I don’t know how it’s got from either of those two people to the first family in that Indooroopilly area.”
Dr Young said the key to understanding the outbreak was testing.
“We need to continue testing throughout the 11 LGAs and throughout Queensland,” she said.
“It is really important so we can make sure that we don’t have any other transmission events, any outbreaks happening.”
The lockdown of 11 high risk LGAs in south east Queensland is expected to end at 4pm on Sunday, which Dr Young said is “absolutely my aim”.
Ellie Dudley 10.04am: Queensland records 16 new local virus cases
Queensland has recorded 16 new cases of local-acquired Covid-19, all which have been linked to the Indooroopilly Delta cluster.
The total number of cases associated with the cluster is now 47.
A total number of 34,718 tests were conducted in the state over the past 24 hours.
“We now have 7995 Queenslanders in quarantine and at least 4,089 in home quarantine but probably much more than that while all of us in the south-east have to stay home,” deputy premier Steven Miles said.
“Those who are subject to home quarantine directions are legally required to stay home. They cannot leave home except in an emergency or to get a test.”
The LGAs in Queensland currently in lockdown are City of Brisbane, City of Gold Coast, City of Ipswich, Lockyer Valley Regional Council, Logan City, Moreton Bay Region, Noosa Shire Council, Redland City, Scenic Rim Regional Council, Somerset Regional Council and Sunshine Coast Regional Council.
Max Maddison 9.59am: Albanese refuses to condemn Young’s AZ remarks
Anthony Albanese has refused to condemn Queensland’s chief health officer Jeannette Young , despite concerns her emotive language on AstraZeneca could contribute to vaccine hesitancy.
Dr Young has drawn staunch criticism for her ongoing criticism of AstraZeneca, saying she didn’t want 18-year-olds being given the vaccine, despite her advice being at odds with official recommendation from the Australian Technical Advisory Group on Immunisation.
Offered two opportunities to repudiate Dr Young’s position on breakfast television on Tuesday morning, the opposition leader declined both, instead saying he wasn’t going to “join a pile on”, before deflecting to attack the Morrison government for insufficient supplies of vaccine.
“People should be vaccinated with whatever vaccines are available. It’s as simple as that. Okay, but the problem. The problem here has been the government had two jobs this year,” Mr Albanese told Sky News.
Moments later on ABC Breakfast News, Mr Albanese again refused an opportunity to criticise the soon-to-be Queensland governor, blaming vaccine hesitancy on Scott Morrison holding late night press conferences.
“And so, we encourage people to be vaccinated. We need to get those vaccine rates up. It’s as simple as that. If your doctor says go, then go,” he said.
Ellie Dudley 9.17am: When to watch Queensland, NSW virus updates
State authorities in both Queensland and NSW are expected to front the media this morning to address the growing concerns of their respective Covid-19 outbreaks.
Queensland health minister Yvette D’Ath and chief health officer Jeannette Young are expected to hold the state’s press conference at 10am, while Premier Annastacia Palaszczuk is still in hotel quarantine.
Queensland’s lockdown has been extended to 4pm Sunday after 13 new locally acquired cases of Covid-19 were recorded on Monday.
Sky News Political Editor Andrew Clennell says Queensland Chief Health Officer Dr Jeannette Young’s stance on AstraZeneca is concerning. Dr Young reiterated her earlier calls discouraging anyone below the age of 60 to receive the AstraZeneca jab. This is despite the Australian Technical Advisory Group on Immunisation urging those in that age group to consult their GP. “With an outbreak and lockdown now in South East Queensland, this is concerning,” Mr Clennell said. "Particular with over 18s in Sydney encouraged by federal government advertisements to get the AstraZeneca jab.”
NSW Premier Gladys Berejiklian will provide an update on the state’s Covid-19 situation at 11am.
She will present alongside health minister Brad Hazzard and chief health officer Kerry Chant.
A total of 207 new cases of locally-acquired Covid-19 were detected in NSW on Monday, at least 51 of which were active in the community for the entirety of their infectious period.

Jack Paynter 9.12am: How to get your Covid vaccine in days
A new tool is allowing Australians to see where they can get a Covid-19 jab in their local area as thousands rush to book their appointments online.
The federal government’s eligibility checker ‘nearest’ and ‘earliest available’ sort functions shows Aussies where they can get an AstraZeneca vaccine within just days and do their bit to help end lockdowns forever.
Vaccine Locator
The checker allows people aged 16 to 59 years old to select whether they would consider the AstraZeneca vaccine, which opens up dozens more appointment times and locations nearby.
Appointment times can then be made within days, and potentially on the same day for those eagle-eyed users.
Those who don’t want to consider the AstraZeneca vaccine are taken through a more rigid eligibility process, but there are limited appointments available for the Pfizer jab for those eligible.
The Australian Technical Advisory Group on Immunisation recommends the Pfizer vaccine as the preferred option for those aged 16 to 59, but those aged 18 to 59 can get the AstraZeneca jab following an appropriate risk/benefit assessment and consent process.
Prime Minister Scott Morrison announced on Friday that at a nationwide vaccination rate of 80 per cent broad lockdowns would no longer exist, and those who were vaccinated would be given greater freedoms – including on travel.
Mr Morrison said states could only move to the next transition stage – ‘Phase B’ of managing the virus – if the entire country reaches a vaccination average of 70 per cent.
“To get to that next phase, all of Australia has to get there together,” Mr Morrison said.
The would mean Australians could “start saying goodbye” to lockdowns, with the nation to transition away from lockdowns and restrictions would ease significantly for vaccinated people. – NCA Newswire

Robyn Ironside 8.53am: Qantas, Jetstar to stand down 2500 workers
Qantas and Jetstar will stand down 2500 employees in response to the extended Greater Sydney lockdown, Brisbane’s latest lockdown and related border closures.
The announcement to the ASX came a day after the federal government agreed to pay aircrew affected by lockdowns and border closures a Covid relief payment of $750 a week.
All affected workers would get two weeks notice, with pay continuing until mid-August. No further job losses were expected, after Qantas and Jetstar axed 8500 roles last year.

Ellie Dudley 8.49am: Ardern to skip parliament after undergoing Covid test
New Zealand Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern will miss the first day back in Parliament after a three-week recess as she awaits the results of a Covid-19 test after catching a cold from her daughter.
A spokesman for Ms Ardern said she appeared to have caught a cold that her three-year-old had picked up at preschool.
Ms Ardern will work from her Wellington residence at Premier House, but won’t be able to attend Question Time.
New Zealand is largely free of coronavirus and has had no cases in the community since February.
Ms Ardern’s duties will be carried out by deputy prime minister Grant Robertson.

Max Maddison 8.40am: Labor’s $300 cash for vax plan a ‘token bribe’
Nationals senator Matt Canavan has described Labor’s plan to provide $300 to encourage uptake of vaccines as a “token bribe” which will confirm people’s fears, as he says the keys to the country have been handed over to “public health overlords”.
The Queensland senator said the idea was little more than a “gimmick” which wouldn’t work, and said Anthony Albanese needed to get out and speak to people who were vaccine hesitant.
“But if you are concerned about some impact on your health, how is $300 going to work? It’s probably going to have the opposite effect,” Senator Canavan told Sky News on Tuesday morning.
“Hopefully the government won’t listen to this because I don’t think it will work, it will be counter-productive and, of course, waste billions.”
He also took aim at public health officials who were too narrowly focused on suppressing cases of Covid, and failing to take into account a broad array of factors, including people’s livelihoods and mental health.
“How’s that being balanced against the cost. Who’s doing the calculation? It seems to me we’ve just given the keys to power over to public health overloads who only have one thing in mind,” he said.
“They’re not Nostradamus. They’re not bringing down tablets from Mount Sinai. They’re making judgments about risk just like all of us have to do in life, and ultimately the best judge of our risk is you, and people can make their own decisions.”

Rachel Baxendale 8.22am: Victoria records four new local virus cases
Victoria has recorded four new locally-acquired coronavirus cases and one overseas-acquired case in the 24 hours to midnight on Monday night.
The local cases have all been linked to the state’s current outbreaks and are in people who have been in quarantine throughout their infectious periods.
New daily cases in Victoria, from July 10, 2021
Tuesday’s four new local cases follow two on Monday, four on Sunday, two on Saturday, three on Friday, seven on Thursday, eight on Wednesday, and an outbreak peak of 26 on Thursday July 22.
Only two of the 30 cases over the past seven days had not been in quarantine for the duration of their infectious period.
This includes a traffic controller in his 20s who tested positive for coronavirus after working at the Moonee Valley Racecourse drive through Covid-19 testing centre.
Investigations are ongoing into how the traffic controller contracted the virus.
Aside from a work colleague who the man is understood to have infected when the pair car-pooled, all testing centre colleagues have tested negative for the virus.
Victoria’s latest cases bring the total number of community acquired cases since two incursions from NSW emerged almost three weeks ago to 220.
There are currently 124 active cases, including up to seven active cases acquired overseas.
At least 89 of those infected during the current outbreaks have recovered, and more are expected to do so in coming days.
The latest cases come after 22,217 tests were processed on Monday – up slightly from 21,417 on Sunday, but down from 25,779 on Saturday, 32,760 on Friday, 43,542 on Thursday and 24,340 the previous Monday, and well down from the July 20 Victorian record of 59,355.

Max Maddison 8.10am: Albanese: Cash incentives good for health and economy
Anthony Albanese has taken aim at the Morrison government’s criticism of Labor’s financial incentives to encourage people to get fully vaccinated, saying the idea is “not only good for health, but good for the economy”.
Opposition Leader Anthony Albanese has pledged to offer $300 cash payments to everyone who receives both doses of a Covid vaccine before December. However, new research by the government which was leaked to The Australian indicates they do not necessarily believe financial incentives are the best option. The research suggests restrictions relief and things like frequent flyer discounts would be better incentives. Since there is no guarantee there will be an election before December it is believed Labor hopes to either take the political credit if the government adopts their idea, or that the government will be forced to admit they do not have enough vaccine supply for everyone to be double jabbed by December.
After a Labor caucus meeting on Monday decided on the $6 billion policy to encourage uptake of vaccinations, Finance Minister Simon Birmingham rubbished the ideas as “unnecessary, unlikely to work and a little bit insulting”.
Mr Albanese said the policy was consistent with the advice of chief medical officer Paul Kelly , and said the negative reception was typical of the federal government, which “says no to everything as it’s first response”.
“If you look at Scott Morrison , he changes his mind and his view on things from day to day, let alone, week to week,” Mr Albanese told Sky News on Tuesday morning.
“So we’ve put this forward, we’ll wait and see what next week’s reaction is or tomorrow’s from Scott Morrison, but it’s a constructive idea, and I think it is a real pity that it’s been dismissed so readily by the government.”

Ellie Dudley 7.48am: ‘Not safe’ for HSC students to return to class
The decision to have year 12 students returned to school in mid-August is “premature”, says NSW Teachers Federation President Angelo Gavrielatos .
Teachers and HSC students in Sydney are calling on Premier Gladys Berejiklian to reassess a return to face-to-face learning as medical experts reveal young people are driving the current outbreak. Tens of thousands of students will be travelling up to 20 kilometres to attend school and some teachers are alarmed by the prospect of students from 100 postcodes travelling into hotspot areas. NSW Teachers Federation President Angelo Gavrielatos told Sky News Australia there was "deep concern” regarding the premier’s announcement that all HSC students would return to face-to-face learning on August 16. “That would see state-wide, 76,000 students face-to-face in year 12 and some 6,500 teachers,” he said. “Across Greater Sydney that’s 50,000 students and in the eight hotspot areas that’s 21,000 students and more than 2,000 staff. Incredible amount of mobility in and out of the lockdown areas and that’s causing us deep concern. “This is not about whether kids should come back to face-to-face, of course they should, but it should occur when it’s safe to do so.”
NSW recorded 207 new cases of Covid-19 on Monday, as the highly-infectious Delta variant of Covid-19 continues to surge around the state.
Premier Gladys Berejiklian last week announced 20,000 doses of the Pfizer vaccine would be administered to year 12 students in high risk areas, to prepare anyone in the state completing their HSC to return to school on August 16.
Mr Gavrielatos said he believed while case numbers remained high it was not safe for students to return to school.
“These are very, very difficult and concerning times and we certainly believe that the announcement made by the Premier last week was premature,” he told Channel 9’s Today/
“Students do transmit this virus and unfortunately 25 per cent of all cases are young people under the age of 19.”
Mr Gavrielatos said the plan could see up to 600 young adults and teachers on any one site.
“That’s a lot of people,” he said.
“We want our students back to face-to-face teaching and learning. We want them back but we want them back when it is safe to do so.”

Ellie Dudley 6.55am: Labor $300 vaccine offer ‘won’t work’, says Birmingham
Federal Finance Minister Simon Birmingham has condemned the ALP’s plan to offer cash in return getting vaccinated claiming it is “unnecessary” and “won’t work”.
Under the proposed $6 billion incentive revealed by Labor on Monday, everybody who is fully vaccinated against Covid-19 by December 1 would receive $300.
“It is all very well for Labor to say, “Well throw some money at the problem.” That’s what they have always done,” Senator Birmingham told Channel 9’s Today.
“It is what they did when they were last in government with the Global Financial Crisis, just throw money around in a scattergun way. Our approach has been to be guided by principles, principles that making sure spending is targeted, it is proportionate, it is focused on getting the exact outcomes that are necessary.”
Senator Birmingham said research developed by the Behavioural Economics Team of the Australian Government indicated paying people for jabs would not work. “We can’t just throw $6 billion around against the evidence,” he said. As revealed by The Australian on Tuesday, the government will likely prioritise non-financial incentives, including partnering with businesses to provide discounts and frequent flyer point bonuses, ahead of a US-style cash approach.
Senator Birmingham said it was “insulting” to the people who have already received their vaccination.
Labor leader Anthony Albanese said on Tuesday anyone who had already received the jab would also get the payment.
Senator Birmingham also followed up Scott Morrison’s backing of exemptions for those who were fully vaccinated, and said that plans for a vaccine passport were “being established”.
“Certainly we’re making sure the technologies are in place for people to be able to demonstrate that they have been vaccinated,” he said.
“It’s very important that people have that ability, particularly when it comes to overseas travel in the future, not just in terms of what rules Australia might put in place, but the rules other countries might put in place, as well.”

Ellie Dudley 6.30am: $300 jab payment ‘something we need to do’: Albo
Federal Labor leader Anthony Albanese has doubled down on his party’s plan to offer $300 to every Australian who gets fully vaccinated, claiming it is “something that we need to do”.
Under the proposed $6 billion incentive, everybody who is fully vaccinated by December 1 would receive the cash payment as a new encouragement to have the country vaccinated quicker.
“If everyone did it, it would be $6 billion. If 80 per cent, the figure we’re aiming for, was done, it would be just under $5 billion,” Mr Albanese told Channel 9’s Today.
“But that’s a small amount compared with the $2 billion a week that these mass lockdowns are costing our national economy.”
“This would be good for our health, but also would provide a much-needed stimulus at a time when workers and small business is really struggling to get by as a result of these lockdowns,” Mr Albanese said.

Ellie Dudley 6am: Brisbane Grammar latest school to be infected
Brisbane Grammar is the latest school in Queensland to be infected with Covid-19, after three students and a parent tested positive for the highly contagious Delta variant.
Seven schools in total have now been put on high alert after students or staff members have returned positive readings for the virus.
In an email sent late from the school on Monday night, the Brisbane Grammar School community was told of the rising case numbers.
“Queensland Health has tonight confirmed two further Brisbane Grammar School students have tested positive for Covid-19,” the email, acquired by the Courier Mail, read.
“BGS now has four confirmed Covid cases – three students and one parent.
“This development does not change the directives already in place, which have been communicated previously by the School.”
Defence Minister Peter Dutton has been forced into home quarantine amid Brisbane's current COVID-19 outbreak. Mr Dutton was due go to Canberra this week for the return of Parliament. However, Mr Dutton is now subject to a 14 day stay-at-home directive because his son attends a school impacted by the latest health advice in the state.
Earlier on Monday evening, Brisbane Girls Grammar School parents were also advised that a student had contracted the virus. The student attended school last Friday between 8am to 6pm.
The latest case comes after a parent attended the school on Friday from 5.25pm for several hours for an open night, and later caught the virus.
Queensland Health has also urged all students and staff at St Joseph’s College Gregory Terrace to get tested for Covid-19 after students from the school shared a bus with a student from another school who had tested positive.
At least seven schools have been caught up in the latest cluster, with confirmed cases among students, parents and teachers at Indooroopilly State High School, Ironside State School, Brisbane Grammar School, Brisbane Girls Grammar School and St Peters Lutheran College in Indooroopilly.

Ellie Dudley 5.45am: Vaccinated Westmead Hospital worker tests positive
A fully vaccinated Westmead Hospital worker has tested positive for Covid-19, forcing at least 36 colleagues into immediate isolation.
The worker had been on the job for three days while infectious.
“A Westmead Hospital staff member has tested positive to COVID-19,” a statement issued from the Western Sydney Local Health District read. “The staff member worked for three days while infectious last week. The staff member was fully vaccinated.”
Sky News Political Editor Andrew Clennell says he has been told that unfortunately "around 24 intensive care unit nurses at Westmead Hospital" have been defined as close contacts after a ward clerk infectious with coronavirus entered the hospital. Mr Clennell said, "19 orderlies have also been defined as close contacts". "A very concerning situation when it comes to hospital staffing," he said. "New South Wales Health has confirmed this afternoon that my numbers on this are roughly correct".
NSW recorded 207 new Covid-19 cases on Monday, and the death of a man in his 90s in southwestern Sydney.

Charlie Peel 5.15am: Young won’t back down on AstraZeneca warning
Epidemiologists and commonwealth officials have repudiated Queensland chief health officer Jeannette Young ’s repeated comments discouraging young people from having the AstraZeneca ­vaccine, as the outbreak in southeast Queensland escalated.
Dr Young’s stance on Monday that she didn’t want 18-year-olds being given the vaccine was at odds with official advice from the Australian Technical Advisory Group on Immunisation, which recommended all adults in hot spots should “strongly consider” speaking to their doctor about taking the vaccine.
Deputy chief medical officer Michael Kidd said the outbreak in southeast Queensland, which has put 11 local government areas under lockdown, met the threshold to be considered “significant”.
Health Minister Greg Hunt insists the Australian Technical Advisory Group on Immunisation’s revised recommendations remains the “guiding light” amid concerns over blood clotting associated with the AstraZeneca jab in younger Australians.
“ATAGI has reaffirmed their previous advice that in a large outbreak, the benefits of the Covid-19 vaccine AstraZeneca are greater than the risk of the side effects occurring, for all age groups,” Dr Kidd said.
“The ATAGI advice remains that Pfizer is the preferred vaccine for those under 16 but the AstraZeneca vaccine is available to anyone over the age of 18.
“But we are wanting people to have a discussion with their trusted medical practitioner, general practitioner, and to provide informed consent before they receive the AstraZeneca vaccine.”
Dr Kidd’s advice came hours after Dr Young said she “remained firm” on her edict from June that she did not want young people to be given the AstraZeneca vaccine.
“I said I didn’t want 18-year-olds to have AstraZeneca, and I still don’t,” Dr Young said.

Geoff Chambers 5am: ‘Freedom incentives’ to encourage vaccine take-up
Scott Morrison will pursue “freedom incentives” ahead of cash payments under the national cabinet’s four-phase reopening plan, with new research commissioned by the federal government warning that large financial ­incentives and lotteries have had “little to no impact on longer-term vaccination rates”.
The government ­received advice last week outlining the merits of financial ­incentives as other countries, including the US and Britain, announced inducements to maintain the momentum of their vaccination programs.
The research — prepared by the Behavioural Economics Team of the Australian Government, led the Health Department and officials at Prime Minister and Cabinet – concluded that financial incentives were “unlikely to drive vaccine uptake in Australia”.
Venues NSW Chairman Tony Shepherd says subject to government approval, his organisation is pushing for those who are unvaccinated against COVID-19 to not be allowed to attend live sporting matches.
Instead, the government will likely prioritise non-financial incentives, including partnering with businesses to provide discounts and frequent flyer point bonuses, ahead of a US-style cash approach. Joe Biden said last week $100 should be paid to people who were fully vaccinated.
Ahead of vaccine supply ramping up in September, the government is examining a range of incentive options considered crucial for Australia to progress to the second and third phases of national cabinet’s reopening plan, requiring 70 and 80 per cent vaccine coverage.
Anthony Albanese will today put forward a $6bn vaccine plan which proposes a $300 payment to all Australians who get vaccinated by December 1.
But the BETA research said financial incentives could set an “expensive precedent for future vaccine strategies”.
U.S. President Joe Biden on Thursday urged local governments to pay people to get vaccinated against COVID-19, and set new rules requiring federal workers to provide proof of vaccination or face regular testing, mask mandates and travel restrictions.

Chris Griffith 4.45am: Covid vaccination certificates ready for your phone
Covid vaccination certificates are now available for storing on your phone and can be accessed via the myGov site and app, or via the Medicare Express app. You need to have had both doses of the jab for your COVID-19 digital certificate to be available to you as a digital record. It takes the form of a PDF file and isn’t tethered to blockchain.
You can add your Covid vaccination certificate to Apple Wallet on an iPhone, which will make it easy to produce should you be required to show it, for example in the future on international flights.
The certificate paves the way for federal and state governments to grant access and concessions to fully vaccinated Australians who present less of a health risk out and about.

Full text: NSW has recorded 207 new locally-acquired cases of Covid-19 as infections in greater Sydney continue to surge.
Queensland’s lockdown has been extended to 4pm Sunday after 13 new locally acquired cases of Covid-19 were recorded overnight.
Federal health officials believe NSW is on a trajectory to hit 70 per cent vaccination cover in as little as five weeks, with Gladys Berejiklian tying the relaxation of Sydney’s lockdown to hitting significant inoculation targets.

Jess Malcolm 11.30pm: Pharmacies’ concern at jabs risk in hotspots
Pharmacies in southwest and western Sydney are worried they are ill-equipped to deal with the risks posed by vaccination in hotspot areas where the virus is rife, saying a lack of available personal protective equipment and enough ventilated clinical space is putting their workforce at risk.
As community pharmacies are purpose-built retail spaces, with many located in crowded indoor spaces such as shopping centres, pharmacists are worried they are improperly set up for vaccination and may be unable to meet infection prevention and control standards during an outbreak.
More than 90 pharmacies in southwest and western Sydney have been called on to join the vaccination rollout, with millions of doses fast-tracked to the epicentre of the city’s outbreak in a bid to ramp up vaccination rates and immunise the community, thereby slowing the spread of the virus.

Nicholas Jensen 10.50pm: ICUs prepare for ‘worst-case scenario’
As contact tracers battle to contain the spread of the rapacious Delta variant, Covid-19 wards across Sydney’s major hospitals are making urgent plans to ratchet up intensive care unit capacities in the event of a “worst-case scenario”.
An analysis by The Australian reveals NSW is recording higher levels of hospitalisation, including ICU admissions, in the current outbreak than Victoria did at the same stage of its outbreak last year.
With the suspension of all non-urgent surgeries at Greater Sydney hospitals to come into effect on Tuesday, ICU occupancy has reached its highest levels since the beginning of the state’s outbreak on June 16 — recording 54 patients on Sunday.

AFP 9.45pm: Millions under lockdown as China battles outbreak
Millions of people have been confined to their homes in China as the country tried to contain its largest coronavirus outbreak in months including seven positive tests found in Wuhan, where the virus first emerged in late 2019.
China reported 55 new locally transmitted cases on Monday as an outbreak of the fast-spreading Delta variant reached over 20 cities in more than a dozen provinces.
The Wuhan cluster came after the official daily tally was released, but it was confirmed by state media which said the infections had been traced to a train station.
“The seven were identified as migrant workers,” Xinhua reported, citing Covid-19 prevention and control officials.
Major cities including Beijing have now tested millions of residents while cordoning off residential compounds and placing close contacts under quarantine.
Authorities in the capital met and agreed on the need to “raise vigilance, take strict precautions and defend (the city) to the death, sparing no expense,” in comments put out by the Beijing government.
Elsewhere, over 1.2 million residents were placed under strict lockdown for the next three days in the central city of Zhuzhou in Hunan province on Monday, as authorities roll out a citywide testing and vaccination campaign, according to an official statement.
“The situation is still grim and complicated,” the Zhuzhou government said.
China had previously boasted of its success in bringing domestic cases down to virtually zero after the coronavirus first emerged in Wuhan, allowing the economy to rebound.
But the latest outbreak, linked to a cluster in the city of Nanjing where nine cleaners at an international airport tested positive on July 20, is threatening that success with more than 360 domestic cases reported in the past two weeks.

Richard Ferguson 9pm: Business push to mandate workplace jabs
Australia’s biggest industry groups say the nation is ready for governments to consider mandating Covid-19 vaccinations in the workplace.
Tying vaccinations to employment is already operating in the hotel quarantine system and aged care, but calls are growing for wider powers allowing employers to force staff to get jabbed.
Constitutional experts also say there is nothing in the nation’s founding document preventing the states or the commonwealth from making jabs compulsory.
Australian Industry Group chief executive Innes Willox said on Monday increased supply and evidence vaccines slowed workplace transmission should start the conversation on mandates.
“For the first time, employers are able to give careful consideration as to whether … it is reasonable in the circumstances of their businesses and employees to man­date vaccinations.
“Until now, mandating was not practical,” he said.
“Mandating will not be appropriate for many employers but there are now a lot more circumstances where this will be a potential option than just the narrow circumstances of quarantine and residential aged care.”
Mr Willox also called on groups such as WorkSafe Australia to update their advice on whether mandates were practicable, considering the changes in vaccine supply and eligibility.
Vaccine mandates have gained steam in recent weeks. US President Joe Biden has made vaccinations compulsory for federal public servants and French President Emmanuel Macron is moving to make the vaccine mandatory across most of the population.

Angelica Snowden 8.15pm: Rallying call for ‘our war against virus’
A tech start-up has crowd-­sourced ideas from it’s global network of designers to create what they think could be the face of Australia’s Covid-19 vaccine campaign.
Australian companies DesignCrowd and BrandCrowd chief Alec Lynch said he wanted to leverage the graphic design expertise of nearly one million artists to release a free and powerful image, available to front the country’s marketing strategy.
“There has been some negative commentary about the government’s campaign. I think the ‘Arm Yourself’ concept is not a bad way to summarise that (vac­cines are) the best way for us to protect Australia,” the 37-year-old said.
Mr Lynch selected the graphic, created by Istanbul-based graphic designer Mosa Abosweilem, out of more than 180 entrants as the winner for a small cash prize. He said it played on the theme of the iconic US World War II poster used to attract women into defence manufacturing jobs.
“It is the ‘We can do it!’ poster which featured a woman flexing her arm and it was a creative ­design as a rallying symbol,” Mr Lynch said.
“Our view was Australia and the world is at war with Covid and we think we need positive things — messages, symbols, campaigns — that Aussies can get behind.”
The advertiser behind the 1980s HIV/AIDS Grim Reaper commercial Siimon Reynolds said positive messages did not cut through. Instead, he lauded the style of the ad that featured a woman gasping for air because people responded to fear.
“It did make people wonder about what if Covid is bad for me. If there were another 10 ads like that and ... they put it everywhere, then I think we have got a chance,” Mr Reynolds said.

Stephen Lunn 7.30pm: Small business owners a homeless risk
Family small business owners who have lost their livelihoods in the Covid-19 pandemic are a growing cohort of those seeking homelessness services, advocates warn.
And up to 650,000 more social housing options are needed to cater for the growing demand, they say, with single mothers and their children fleeing family violence a particular concern.
Homelessness Australia chair Jenny Smith said rising house prices and rents were putting pressure on those needing housing, an issue exacerbated by federal government funding cuts.

AFP 6.45pm: NZ opens travel bubble to Pacific workers
Seasonal workers from selected Pacific countries will be allowed into New Zealand without undergoing two weeks in quarantine, Jacinda Ardern says.
The expansion of the travel bubble will be restricted to workers from Tonga, Samoa and Vanuatu employed in the horticulture and viticulture industries where there are not enough New Zealand-based workers.
“This new one-way travel policy will significantly expand the potential workforce available for those experiencing labour shortages,” the New Zealand Prime Minister said on Monday.
“Our closed border has been critical to keeping Covid out and keeping our economy running but... we know our agriculture sector is experiencing challenges.”
“We’ve heard the call from primary sectors and others to bring in additional workers in a safe way and we think that is now possible.”
Tonga, Samoa and Vanuatu have largely kept Covid-19 at bay. There have been four cases in Vanuatu, three in Samoa and none in Tonga. New Zealand, which has recorded just 26 Covid-19 deaths in a population of five million, opened a trans-Tasman travel bubble with Australia in April.
It was hailed as a major milestone in restarting the global travel industry, but the arrangement was suspended last month when a Covid-outbreak spread through Australia.
Opposition leader Judith Collins said the decision to open up to seasonal workers from three relatively risk-free countries was a welcome move but did not go far enough.
“The question now is, if we can bring in (seasonal) workers without them having to undergo quarantine once they enter New Zealand, why can’t we prioritise other people from these three countries for quarantine-free travel?” Collins asked.

Matthew Denholm 4.58pm: Five people cautioned in Tasmania for breaches
Five people in Tasmania have been officially cautioned by police for breaching coronavirus “stay at home” orders imposed on recent arrivals from Queensland.
“A group of four tourists from Queensland each received a caution notice, after they attempted to enter the Cradle Mountain National Park,” Tasmania Police said in a statement. “All four members of the group were compliant with police and are now adhering to the ‘stay at home’ direction as directed on Saturday 31 July.
“A 19-year-old Southern Tasmanian woman also received a caution in relation to failing to comply with the stay at home order. The woman recently returned from Queensland, and on Saturday night attended the Hobart waterfront. Information was reported to police who investigated and later spoke to the woman. The woman has been given suitable advice relating to her ‘stay at home’ direction.
“Information obtained confirmed that the five people have not been in a high-risk premises and the risk to the others in the wider community is low.”
People who have arrived in Tasmania from “high risk” areas of Queensland since July 17 must self-isolate until August 2.

Courtney Gould 4.40pm: Vaccine target data must be released: Senator
A key senate crossbencher is calling for the government to immediately release data it has used to calculate its vaccine target that the Prime Minister is keeping under wraps.
Scott Morrison on Friday announced Australians could look forward to a life without lockdowns once 80 per cent of the nation’s adult population is vaccinated.
But South Australian Senator Rex Patrick has warned this figure could be too low.
“We’ve seen already criticism in relation to what’s being put out. Where the Prime Minister says 70 per cent and 80 per cent, others are pointing out that needs to be the entire population,” he told Sky News.
COVID-19 Australia: Cumulative vaccinations by state
“When you translate those numbers back into the entirety the population, including children, you get to numbers like 56%, which is way too low compared to other jurisdictions.”
Mr Morrison’s plan to open the nation up again hinges on having 80 per cent of the eligible population vaccinated. The eligible population does not include individuals under the age of 16, if it did, that figure would sit at just under 65% of all Australians.
Phase B, which kicks in at 70 per cent, would equate to just 56% of total population.
Senator Patrick said for the sake of transparency, Mr Morrison should release the data immediately.
“We’ve got a lack of transparency here and that needs to be fixed,” he said.
“The Prime Minister has failed miserably at that.”
The Doherty Institute was commissioned by the government to model what would occur when a certain percentage of the population was vaccinated and what impact further outbreaks would have on the health system at that rate.
Vaccine doses rollout across age groups
It is understood the government will release the modelling later this week.
His comments follows reports four Labor MPs — Victorian MP Julian Hill, Queensland MP Anika Wells and Western Australian MPsPatrick Gorman and Anne Aly — have backed the call for a royal commission into the government’s handling of COVID-19, despite it not being Labor policy.
A senate inquiry into the government’s handling of the pandemic is ongoing, but Senator Patrick said a formal inquiry was “inevitable”.
“I think the whole point of a serious royal commission into such an event is to basically be able to examine all aspects of the response, including the vaccine purchase, including aged care and how we dealt with that,” he said.
“I think it’s inevitable … I think, eventually, over time, we‘ll get the support of the Labor Party and we’ll put pressureon the Liberal Party to do this.”

Greg Brown 4.25pm: Health officials reject Young’s AZ claim
Commonwealth health officials have repudiated Queensland’s chief medical officer Jeannette Young for saying she did not want young adults to take the AstraZeneca vaccine.
Deputy Chief Medical Officer Michael Kidd said the medical advice from Australian Technical Advisory Group on Immunisation was that all adults in hotspots should “strongly consider” speaking to their doctor about taking a vaccine.
“The ATAGI advice remains that Pfizer is the preferred vaccine for those under 16 but the AstraZeneca vaccine is available to anyone over the age of 18,” Dr Kidd said.
“But we are wanting people to have a discussion with their trusted medical practitioner, general practitioner, and to provide informed consent before they receive the AstraZeneca vaccine.”
He said there were 11 local government areas in southeast Queensland that met the thresholds for a commonwealth hotspot, making it a “significant outbreak”.
Health Minister Greg Hunt said the ATAGI advice had been “reframed” since it discouraged people under 60 from taking the vaccine.
“If you are over 60 AstraZeneca is the preferred vaccine,” Mr Hunt said.
“If you are under 60, it is something that in a hotspot …that people should strongly consider, and more broadly than that, anybody can consult their doctor and seek advice.”

Robyn Ironside 4.15pm: Aviation workers to get Covid support
Domestic airline crew will gain access to Covid support payments of $750 a week, in an extension of federal government assistance for the aviation industry.
Deputy Prime Minister Barnaby Joyce has announced a range of measures to “keep domestic aviation ready for takeoff” including assistance to retain workforce capability.
In addition, a half-price airfare initiative will be extended from September to November, after many of the cheap seats sold by airlines had to be cancelled.
The government announcement follows a warning from Qantas Group CEO Alan Joyce that the airline would again have to stand down staff without pay, if current low levels of flying persisted.
In June more than 9000 domestic flights were cancelled as a result of lockdowns and border closures, including 5000 by Qantas and Jetstar.
The Deputy Prime Minster said the Domestic Aviation Network Support and Regional Aviation Network Support schemes would continue until the year’s end, subsidising airlines on routes across the country.
A 50 per cent waiver of domestic air services charges for regular public transport and aeromedical flights would also go on until December 31.
“This will continue to help manage costs for airlines as they navigate the serious ongoing challenges posed by Covid-19 outbreaks, including lockdowns and border closures,” the Mr Joyce said.

Adeshola Ore 4.00pm: Labor to mandate anti-harassment training
All Labor MPs will be required to complete new sexual harassment training to be introduced in Parliament House.
The Australian understands that Labor’s caucus today agreed to mandate the training for all opposition MPs.
Last week the Morrison government confirmed it would enact all 10 recommendations from an internal review – sparked by former Liberal staffer Brittany Higgins’s rape allegation – aimed at cleaning up parliament’s workplace complaints procedures for serious incidents. The report said anti-harassment education should be offered to parliamentarians and their staff on a voluntary basis.
But the Coalition will require all ministers and their staff to undergo the training, with those who refuse training warned they could lose their frontbench positions.
MPs who do not complete the education program will be named and shamed, with a public register to list all parliamentarians who undertake the training.

Joseph Lam 3.32pm: ADF sent into locked-down Sydney
The boots of some 300 ADF personnel hit the ground in southwest Sydney today as NSW Police amped up its capabilities on the ground.
Brigadier Mick Garraway on Monday said the ADF weren’t working as law enforcement officers but rather a “disciplined” support task force.
“What you have with the Defence Force is a disciplined, capable organisation that is vaccinated, tested and compliant and able to do a range of tasks that will take the pressure off the police, take pressure off the Department of Health and other organisations so they can get out and do what they do best,” he said.
“I want to stress up front again that we will be under control of the NSW police. We are not a law enforcement agency and we will do tasks that are supportive in nature.
It’s understood the full 300 personnel will have joined NSW Police on the ground in Sydney by the end of the week.

Ellen Ransley 3.25pm: QLD’s Ekka show cancelled just days from opening
Queenslanders have been dealt a devastating blow with the cancellation of the “comeback Ekka” just days before it was due to start.
Queensland recorded 13 new locally acquired Covid-19 cases on Monday, on the second day of the southeast corner’s snap lockdown.
Authorities say the new cases are genomically linked to the 17-year-old Indooroopilly State High school student, with the state’s Delta outbreak now at 31.
Authorities on Sunday expressed their concerns about low levels of testing, prompting 21,806 Queenslanders to get swabbed which the Deputy Premier said was “fantastic”.
But the rise in cases has meant the annual Ekka, which was cancelled in 2020, will not go ahead this week as planned.
It comes despite rural and regional Queenslanders having already travelled to the capital to prepare for the show.
Mr Miles said as “sad and disappointing” as it was, the risk was just “too great”.
“It will not be able to go ahead. I know that’s sad and disappointing for many,” Mr Miles said.
“We just can’t afford to have an event like that where people travel into town, circulate in large numbers. The risk is just too great.”
Of the new cases, seven are Ironside State School students, and five are related to the school.
The other case is linked to a confirmed case from the karate school.
Dozens of new exposure sites are expected to be listed by Queensland Health later on Monday.
Agencies 3.00pm: Despite Delta surge, no lockdown for US: Fauci
The United States is unlikely to be sent back into lockdown despite a surge in Covid-19 cases stemming from the Delta variant, top US scientist Anthony Fauci said Sunday.
America is in for “some pain and suffering in the future” but enough people have now been vaccinated to prevent a repeat of last winter’s deadly surge, the infectious disease expert who advises President Joe Biden told ABC’s “This Week.” “I don’t think we’re going to see lockdowns,” Fauci said, after Biden this week said the United States was probably headed for new restrictions because of the Delta variant surge.
America's top infectious disease expert does not believe the United States will go back into lockdown again despite a surge in Delta variant infections. Dr Anthony Fauci says the highly infectious strain has been spreading mostly among the unvaccinated. This comes after 58 per cent of Americans have received their first dose - with 100 million people who are eligible for the vaccine yet to get a jab. He believes not enough people have been vaccinated to stop the outbreak but it is enough to prevent the mass infections and deaths recorded last winter. The average number of new cases across the US has almost doubled in the past 10 days.
Elsewhere in the world countries including China and Australia have in fact put some of their people back under lockdown as the highly contagious variant spreads, not long after it seemed life was beginning to return to normal.
The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention changed course this week and said fully vaccinated people should mask up again indoors in higher-risk areas of the country.
The top US health authority says the Delta variant is as contagious as chickenpox and -- critically -- that breakthrough cases in vaccinated individuals, though still rare, may be as transmissible as unvaccinated cases.
This change in mask policy, after Biden had predicted a “summer of freedom” if enough Americans got a shot, has caused worries that confidence in coronavirus vaccines would be undermined.
Fauci tempered this on Sunday by reiterating that people who are vaccinated run a very low risk of infection, and even lower of hospitalisation or death if they do get sick.
“We are seeing an outbreak of the unvaccinated,” he said.

Max Maddison 2.38pm: Vulnerable children now eligible for Pfizer: Hunt
Pfizer jabs will be made available for vulnerable 12 to 15-year-old children, says Health Minister Greg Hunt, while ATAGI reduces the recommended interval between AstraZeneca vaccines.
Amid another outbreak of the highly transmissible Delta variant in south-east Queensland, Mr Hunt said GPs could begin administering the mRNA vaccine to immuno-compromised children immediately, which would include around 220,000 children.
The news came as the Australian Technical Advisory Group on Immunisation reduced the recommended interval between receiving AstraZeneca jabs from 12 weeks down to four to eight weeks.
“ATAGI has reiterated that all adults in Greater Sydney should consider the benefits of either protection with the AstraZeneca vaccine rather than waiting for alternative vaccines to become available,” deputy chief medical officer Michael Kidd told a press conference on Monday afternoon.

Geoff Chambers 2.27pm: Dutton in quarantine, Porter to fill in
Peter Dutton has been forced into quarantine after his sons were caught-up in the Queensland schools outbreak, with Christian Porter filling in as Leader of the House in parliament this week.
Mr Dutton, who contracted Covid-19 last year after travelling to the US, will be unable to attend parliament with the ACT Government imposing strict restrictions on MPs arriving from hotspot areas.
Mr Porter, who was Leader of the House for almost two years before losing the job in a Cabinet reshuffle earlier this year, will lead the government’s agenda in the House of Representatives.
In a statement released on Monday, Mr Dutton confirmed Mr Porter would step-in as Leader of the House on Tuesday.
“My sons attend a school subject to the current Queensland Health directive and as a household member I am subject to the 14 day direction. I will quarantine at home with my family,” Mr Dutton.
“I will therefore be unable to attend parliament, although will take part in Leadership, NSC, ERC and Cabinet meetings remotely.
“Having had COVID and being fully vaccinated, I have also tested negative this morning.”

Courtney Gould 2.00pm: Brutal vaccine reality for sports fans
Australia could be one step closer to implementing the use of vaccine passports at major sporting events and concerts.
An increasing number of countries are shifting towards allowing only vaccinated people to attend events such as concerts and sporting matches and travel overseas.
Speaking to the Today show, the two faces of Australia’s vaccine rollout — former deputy chief medical officer Nick Coatsworth and vaccine taskforce commander Lieutenant General John Frewen — indicated Australia could be headed down the same path.
“I think we are almost certainly going to see different levels of freedom associated with people who are vaccinated,” Dr Coatsworth said.
“We don’t want to exclude non-vaccinated people from everything that they need to do in society … Certainly at sporting events, I 100 per cent agree that vaccinated people should be allowed into the crowds.”
But General Frewen stressed while no decisions had been made just yet, people should use it as a motivator to get vaccinated.
“We have seen those sorts of measures overseas. I don’t think anything has been settled on in that regard just yet,” he told Nine.
“But, of course, down the track, I mean, there is going to be benefits to being vaccinated. I think there will be requirements to be vaccinated in certain conditions.
“So, again, if you are still considering whether to get vaccinated, I urge you to do so.”
Scott Morrison on Friday announced Victoria, the Northern Territory and Tasmania had formed a working group to establish a plan to exempt vaccinated Australians from restrictions.
Mr Morrison on Monday said people who had taken the steps to protect themselves and the community should be rewarded.
“It‘s got nothing to do with politics or freedoms or anything like that. It’s just simple, if you’re vaccinated, then you’re less of a public health risk,” he said.
“And so people who are vaccinated have taken steps to protect themselves and others around them.
“And so in that circumstance, it only stands to reason that where you have taken that step there would be exemptions for you. If you haven‘t, then you’re at risk of catching it and suffering severe disease and worse.”
It comes as Venues NSW chairman Tony Shepherd said the body would seek government approval to require vaccination passports as a requirement to buy tickets for the NRL, AFL or cricket.
“If you choose not to have the jab that is your civil right in a free country but the Delta strain is extremely transmissible and we need to do something to reopen our stadiums,” Mr Shepherd told The Daily Telegraph.
“The venues will have to say you can’t attend. Simple as that. Getting crowds back to sport is important, but we can’t put fans at risk.
“It will be a tremendous incentive for people to get vaccinated.”

Ellie Dudley 1.30pm: Christmas in July ‘may have caused superspreader event’
A Christmas in July event at an aged care facility in Sydney’s inner west may have catapulted the city’s latest superspreader event.
The outbreak at the Wyoming Residential Aged Care Facility in Summer Hill grew to 20 cases on Monday, including 18 residents and two staff members.
Residents who live on the top floor of the facility will also be moved to hospital after being deemed close contacts.
NSW Health Minister Brad Hazzard said a Christmas in July party that occured on the infected floor was where the virus spread.
“The ground floor residents are, at this point, considered to be in a different situation,” Mr Hazzard told Monday’s press conference.
“They didn’t happen to be exposed to the assistant in nursing that was employed by the private hospital and I understand that the actual numbers are believed to have occurred off a superspreading event that occurred in the aged care facility.
“Sometimes it is not a good idea to have Christmas in July right in the middle of a pandemic but I do understand that it is an effort to try and provide entertainment and to support to residents and those things have to be decided by the aged care facilities.”
Some 83 per cent of the patients and 75 per cent of staff at the centre have been fully vaccinated against the virus, NSW chief health officer Kerry Chant confirmed.

Ellie Dudley 12.20pm: Young victim’s boyfriend: my survivor guilt
The boyfriend of the 38-year-old Sydney woman who died after being infected with Covid-19 has said he is struggling with the guilt of surviving the virus when she did not.
Chef Khalid, who asked not to give his surname, said he was only able to say goodbye to his girlfriend Adriana Takara through a hospital window the day before doctors switched off her life support machine.
“I have my memories of Adriana, that’s all I have of her I need to stay with those now, I don’t have it (Covid) now, I’m ok, but I feel bad, I miss her, she was a modest, beautiful soul,” he told the Daily Telegraph.
“I‘m angry at the situation, why I had to make it and she didn’t?”
Ms Takara, 39, died last Sunday at Sydney’s Royal Prince Alfred hospital after suffering a ten-day battle against Covid-19..
Friends said the Brazilian citizen, who was studying accounting in Sydney, deteriorated quickly after contracting the virus from a friend and had no underlying conditions.
The Kaplan Business School masters student had tried on “numerous” occasions to get an appointment for a Covid-19 vaccination in the weeks before falling ill on July 15 but was informed on the NSW Health vaccine portal no appointments were available until after October, the Daily Telegraph reported.
She did not suffer from any underlying medical condition, a fact seized on by health officials, who are urging a quick uptake of vaccines.
Ellie Dudley 12.05pm: SA to move to next stage of freedom
South Australia will move into the next stage of eased restrictions, as health authorities remain cautious of the potential for new outbreaks of Covid-19.
It has been two weeks since the first case of the Delta strain of Covid-19 was detected in South Australia, forcing the state into a seven day lockdown.
Premier Steven Marshall announced on Monday restrictions would be eased further for the state, but authorities will remain on alert.
“We are still concerned. Yes, it has been 14 days but if we have missed any cases in SA, we would be picking them up around about now and so we really do need to just be a little bit careful for the next couple of days,” he said.
As of Thursday, venues will enforce the two square metre rule, having previously operated under one person per four square metre restrictions.
Gyms will move from the one person per eight square metre rule, to the four square metre rule.
Sport can return for competition, but rules will be enforced about the number of spectators permitted to watch.
Masks will continue to be required in all high-risk settings including personal care services, transport and health care, due to the “air borne” nature of the Delta variant, Mr Marshall said.
Ellie Dudley 11.50am: Chant silent on numbers to free Sydney from lockdown
NSW Chief Health Officer Kerry Chant has refused to name an appropriate vaccination rate or case number which will guarantee Greater Sydney emerges from lockdown on time.
The current lockdown has been extended but is scheduled to lift on August 28.
Dr Chant said it was “premature” to stipulate rates at which the city could reopen, saying she was “focused on breaking the back” of community transmission.
“ I am in no way giving up on achieving marked reductions in achieving no community transmission,” she said.
“There are a lot of things that have been put in place to support communities.
“We are making testing easier and we are making sure that people are supported if they have any health needs or any other social and welfare needs.”
Courtney Walsh 11.45am: Vic rules out NRL Grand Final bidding war
Victoria will not engage in a bidding war with Queensland for the NRL Grand Final should the Covid-19 situation in New South Wales force the game to be moved.
But Victoria’s sports minister Martin Pakula said the state was willing to assist if the outbreaks in Sydney and southeast Queensland forced rugby league’s administration to make a difficult call on the grand final.
He has exchanged text messages with NRL chairman Peter V’Landys and confirmed Victoria’s tourism organisation was also in discussions with league officials in case the situation worsened in the northern states.
Both the MCG and Marvel Stadium would be available to host the NRL Grand Final, which is held a week after the AFL decider, should a move be required.
“I have exchanged text messages with Peter V’Landys and he indicated ... they are probably looking at New South Wales and Queensland but they are happy having the conversation with us,” he said.
“We are not interested in a bidding war with the Queensland Government about this.”
Mr Pakula also said Victoria would not enter into a bidding war with South Australia or Western Australia for the AFL Grand Final with good reason _ the game is contracted to the MCG until 2058.
Both the AFL and the Victorian Government are working on a Covid-safe plan in relation to crowds attending matches throughout the finals series including the grand final.
Transmission in the latest outbreak in Victoria occurred at both the MCG and AAMI Park.
Mr Pakula said this had prompted a rethink regarding crowd safety measures.
AFL chief executive Gillon McLachlan said he remained optimistic the grand final will be held in Melbourne but was not prepared to outline “thresholds” regarding the league’s hopes for crowds at the MCG.
Optus Stadium in Perth can host 60,000 and Adelaide Oval well over 50,000 fans.
Both McLachlan and Mr Pakula ruled out the introduction of a policy requiring fans to be vaccinated in order to be able the finals series, stating it was too early in the vaccination roll out for that to be possible.
But it is a discussion that will be held for future years,
Greg Brown 11.40am: Labor to oppose ARENA funding expansion
Labor is moving to partially oppose regulations that have expanded the investment remit of the Australian Renewable Energy Agency.
Opposition energy spokesman Chris Bowen is expected to recommend Labor oppose ARENA being used to fund hydrogen and carbon-capture and storage technologies.
Caucus is likely to back moving a disallowance motion in the Senate against a section of the regulation that allows funding to be used on the technologies.
Labor is not opposing the entire regulation because senior MPs believe it was a significant retreat from what Energy Minister Angus Taylor initially proposed in June.
Ellie Dudley 11.35am: Berejiklian: Vaccine incentives on the table
NSW Premier Gladys Berejiklian has refused to comment on upcoming vaccination incentives, instead saying it is more important to focus on getting people back to school and work.
“I will say this: We can look at (incentive) opportunities in a little while,” she said.
“Let me stress, we can look at those opportunities in a little while and incentives are a good way to move forward.
“Today I want to talk about kids getting back to school and workers getting back to work. All those other things will come in good time.”
Ms Berejiklian said vaccine incentives were “on the table” but she didn’t want to “take away from the fact that we understand what stress people are going through at the moment.”
Incentives could include free alcohol for people who have gotten the jab or permitted entry to sporting events.
There have been 12 residents of an aged care home in Sydney's inner-west taken to hospital after they tested positive to COVID-19. A staff member of the Wyoming Nursing Home in Summer Hill - also known as Hardi Summer Hill - tested positive to the Delta variant on July 27. The worker - who had received one dose of the COVID vaccine - is believed to have been asymptomatic. Testing of residents and staff will continue daily and the facility has undergone deep cleaning while being in full lockdown.
Remy Varga 11.30am: Uncertain if crowds allowed at AFL grand final
Victorian Sports Minister Martin Pakula says it is not yet known if crowds will be allowed at the MCG for the AFL grand final.
Mr Pakula said conversations around crowds would likely happen towards the end of the week.
“We haven’t had that conversation yet, I’d expect to have that later this week or on the weekend,” he said.
Ellie Dudley 11.28am: Central Coast, Shellharbour hopes of leaving lockdown quashed
NSW Premier Gladys Berejiklian has quashed the hopes of residents on the Central Coast, Shellharbour or Wollongong coming out of lockdown early.
There have been zero cases of Covid-19 in the Shellharbour area during the latest outbreak.
“If the health experts tell us that the Central Coast, Shellharbour and Wollongong are able to be treated as regional NSW, we will take that advice,” Ms Berejiklian said.
“It is positive that we have seen very low numbers in those regions or close to zero.
If the health experts say to the NSW government those communities can be treated the same as the rest of regional NSW, we will take that advice.”
Ellie Dudley 11.25am: Chant urges under-40s to get jab
NSW Chief Health Officer Kerry Chant has urged Sydneysiders under the age of 40 to adopt “informed consent” when taking the AstraZeneca vaccine, but has urged everyone to get whatever jab is available to them.
New South Wales residents have been called on to make August the month of vaccination records as Premier Gladys Berejiklian hints restrictions may be eased if targets are met. The state recorded 239 new cases yesterday and health authorities have issued a warning to younger health groups. Ms Berejiklian said vaccine milestones were the key to ending lockdown and matches the National Cabinet advisement of a vaccine threshold to eliminate internal border closures. There are renewed calls for people of all age groups to register to get the AstraZeneca vaccine, with Ms Berejiklian stating there is only a three day wait to receive the jab.
“My view is that we follow the ATAGI advice and ATAGI has looked at risk benefits,” she said.
“It is about informed consent. I would also be very concerned if people did not know what actions to take, so if anyone develops headache or abdominal pain following AstraZeneca, it is important that you seek urgent care.
“I’m very much committed to following the expert advice of ATAGI.”
Ellie Dudley 11.20am: ‘Keep work place social settings segregated’
Up to 30 cases recorded on Monday were acquired in the workplace, causing chief health officer Kerry Chant to issue a plea for those going to work to segregate from one another.
“We have recognised a number of industries and they are probably reflective of the ones that are necessary to keep us as a city going,” she said.
“For instance, freight is an example. We have also had - that’s generated a large number of cases in some freight businesses.
“Because of the good processes that people have put in place, they haven’t led to large numbers of cases but they are obviously complex because we need to keep those workplaces operational and we need to do a lot of work.
“It is really important that you think about the tea rooms and some of the social settings in work places. You might have the best safety plans for the actual premises but if people go and congregate somewhere, it defeats the purpose of segregation.”
Ellie Dudley 11.15am: Latest death linked to Liverpool hospital cluster
The man who passed away from Covid-19 is the fifteenth death in NSW associated with the latest outbreak.
The man in his 90s had received one dose of the AstraZeneca vaccine, and was associated with an outbreak of the virus at Liverpool hospital.
“My condolences to his family and his friends,” NSW chief health officer Kerry Chant said.
“This highlights another point, that two doses of the vaccine are more effective. Even one can provide protection, so there is an opportunity to bring forward your second dose of AstraZeneca to afford that protection.”
The second dose of AstraZeneca can be administered eight weeks after the first, despite the previous advice of a 12 week gap between doses.
Ellie Dudley 11.10am: Outbreak in Sydney aged care home
An outbreak of Covid-19 has occured at an aged care centre in Sydney’s inner west, NSW chief health officer Kerry Chant says.
Eighteen patients and two staff members have tested positive for the virus.
“The positive patients have been removed from that facility and a number of, as a precaution, the remainder of residents of that facility are also being removed (to) hospital,” Dr Chant said.
“The outbreak is occurring on that top floor and that action has been taken as a precautionary approach.
“I can confirm that 83 per cent of the patients were vaccinated and 75 per cent of staff at the facility were vaccinated.
Dr Chant urged anyone working closely with the aged care industry, or elderly Australians, to be vaccinated as soon as possible.
New daily cases in New South Wales
Ellie Dudley 11.02am: NSW records 207 new local cases
NSW has recorded 207 new locally-acquired cases of Covid-19 as infections in greater Sydney continue to surge.
CHO Kerry Chant has also confirmed a 90-year-old man who had received one AstraZeneca dose has died.
At least 51 cases were active in the community for the entirety of their infectious period.
Up to 117,000 tests were conducted in the 24 hours to 8pm last night.
NSW Premier Gladys Berejiklian said it would be a “combination of case numbers and vaccination rates” to determine what life looks like for greater Sydney when the lockdown is expected to lift on August 29.
“Can I stress that August is the month where we all should come forward and get vaccinated,” she said.
“It will be a combination of seeing where the case numbers are in a month’s time as well as the rate of vaccination that determines what August 29 looks like.”
Ms Berejiklian again pointed out that no one in intensive care in NSW has received both doses of the vaccine.
“One learning we have had in the last five weeks is that the vaccinations, both vaccines, are working extremely effectively,” she said.
“We still don’t know of anybody in intensive care who has received both doses of the vaccine.
“That is a positive thing. We know the vaccine is working and we need people to come forward and get vaccinated.”
Remy Varga 10:41am: Positive Victorian case linked to Wallabies match
Of the two-cases Victoria recorded on Monday, one is linked to the Wallabies match at AAMI park.
The other case is a household contact of a traffic controller who worked at the Moonee Valley racecourse testing site.
Both cases were in isolation for the entirety of their infectious period.
Charlie Peel 10.40am: Concerns over spread in Qld schools
Brisbane’s health workforce has been put under increased pressure after a significant number of Queensland Health staff were forced into isolation because their children attend the schools affected by the latest coronavirus outbreak.
Chief Health Officer Jeannette Young said she was very concerned by the impact the spread of the virus in the school communities had on staff.
Six Brisbane schools have been listed as exposure sites.
“I really am very, very concerned about these six schools,” Dr Young said.
“We know Delta is much more likely to spread amongst younger people.
“So in previous outbreaks, we’ve known that younger people have been spared but Delta has a closer affinity to respiratory cells, and we know that younger people are more at risk and although they’re less likely to do particularly badly if they get infected, they’re less likely to die - they are more likely to transmit to other people.
“So although it’s destroying our health workforce numbers because a lot of health workers have children going to those six schools, and now those health workers are in quarantine with their children, they’re not at work.
“I need that to happen because I cannot have those health workers going into the workplace and spreading the virus.”
Dr Young said she hoped the affected staff were only in isolation for 14 days.
Students will be learning from home for the rest of the lockdown.

Remy Varga 10.35am: Vic tightens restrictions on NSW border communities
Victoria has announced a strengthening of the border bubble system with NSW in a bid to minimise the risk from the “deteriorating situation” in Sydney.
State Health Minister Martin Foley said residents on the NSW side of border communities would only be allowed to cross into Victoria without a permit to purchase essential goods and services, medical care, care and compassion reasons, paid and voluntary work, to receive a covid vaccine and for sport and exercise.
Mr Foley said any NSW resident was not allowed to travel further into Victoria other than what was reasonably necessary.
He acknowledged the changes would be difficult for communities along the NSW and Victorian border but said the changes reflected the risk of the Delta variant.
“We need to have our border bubble reflect the changes that Delta has brought to how we respond and manage the global pandemic,” he said.
Restrictions on hospitality venues, gyms and tours in Victoria will change slightly from 11.59pm Tuesday.
Group booking limits will no longer apply but venues need to adhere to one person per four square metre density limit.
Charlie Peel 10.20am: Higher rate of emergency hospitalisation in Qld than NSW
The delta strain circulating through Queensland has led to a higher rate of emergency hospitalisation than in New South Wales.
It prompted an extraordinary warning from Queensland’s Health Minister Yvette D’Ath who said people who did not get tested for the virus had died in their own homes in NSW.
“We’ve seen two people in New South Wales who have died at home because they have not gone and got tested for Covid,” she said.
“They died in their homes from Covid.
“So please, if you have any symptoms, what we know is that the delta variant in Queensland is leading to a higher rate of hospitalisation than New South Wales, so we need you to take this seriously.”
Ms D’Ath said there were 64 drive-through testing venues across Queensland.
“This is the first time that we’ve seen an outbreak like this one spreading in schools amongst students, teachers and parents, and via extracurricular activities and public transport. It will likely see thousands of people subject to home-quarantine directions, and we thank those schools for working so closely with us.”
Charlie Peel 10.00am: Qld lockdown extended to 8 days
Queensland’s lockdown has been extended to 4pm Sunday after 13 new locally acquired cases of Covid-19 were recorded overnight.
Chief Health Officer Jeannette Young said the outbreak was “escalating” and that required the extension of the lockdown, by another five days.
The lockdown will now last for eight days, the longest lockdown in Queensland since the height of the pandemic last year.
The extended lockdown has also dealt a fatal blow to Brisbane’s Ekka show, which was set to take place next week.
Dr Young urged anyone who did not absolutely need to leave their homes to stay put.
Ellie Dudley 9.40am: Qld update at 10am, Berejiklian at 11am
State authorities across the country will face media conferences this morning to inform residents of the latest updates to their respective Covid-19 situations.
NSW Premier Gladys Berejiklian will hold a press conference at 11am alongside chief health officer Kerry Chant and health minister Brad Hazzard.
A total of 239 cases of Covid-19 were detected in NSW on Sunday, another record day for the state.
Queensland authorities will speak at 10am to speak to the state’s evolving Covid-19 outbreak.
The state recorded nine new cases of the highly-infectious Delta strain of the virus on Sunday, tallying the total number for the latest cluster to 18.
South Australian authorities will speak at 11.20am local time (11.50am AEST), where they are expected to present a roadmap of the state’s restrictions moving forward.
Max Maddison 9.30am: PM backs exemptions for vaccinated
Scott Morrison has flagged exemptions for those who get vaccinated, saying it is a “common sense” decision for people who have “taken steps to reduce risk to other people and themselves”.
Venues NSW has called for vaccine passports to be introduced for live sports from 2022, and while the Prime Minister said while any decision would need to be legislated by the states, he backed the idea.
“If you’re vaccinated you’re less likely to get it, you’re less likely to get a serious disease, and you’re less likely to die,” Mr Morrison told 4BC’s Neil Breen on Monday morning.
“If you’re not having the vaccination, then clearly state governments are going to have to make decisions to protect people in those circumstances because they’re basically unprotected.”
“Exemptions would be applied to people because they’ve taken the step to reduce their risk to other people and to themselves.”
Mr Morrison said options were currently being trialled across the country, which would be brought back to National Cabinet with recommendations for other states to pursue.
“We’ve got the Northern Territory government working together with the Victorian government and the Tasmanian government right now,” he said.

Ellie Dudley 9.20am: SA building industry: we’re essential workers
The South Australian construction industry is calling on the state government to deem them “essential”, in order to safeguard jobs and businesses in the event of another lockdown.
The industry was forced to close during the latest seven day lockdown for the state, which cost approximately $230 million, despite being classified as essential during the state’s first lockdown in 2020.
Master Builders Association SA chief executive officer Will Frogley said the change in status had left the sector “baffled”.
“Over the past 18 months building and construction has clearly demonstrated we have the risk mitigation systems in place to be declared an essential service if lockdown occurs,” he told The Advertiser.
“Most construction work occurs outdoors, safety is ingrained in workers from day one, Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) is routinely used and in many instances required by the nature of the work.”

Ellie Dudley 8.55am: Queenslanders can access disaster payments from Sunday
Queenslanders impacted by the latest outbreak of the coronavirus will be able to access the Covid-19 disaster payments from Sunday, despite only being in a three day lockdown.
The payments last week were increased to $750 for those who have lost more than 20 hours of work per week, and $450 for those who have lost less than 20 hours.
Services Australia General Manager Hank Jongen said Queenslanders could start accessing the payments from 8am Sunday.
“Queenslanders, even though they are only in a 3-day lockdown now, under the rules they will be eligible for the Covid disaster payment and they will be at that new rate,” he told Channel 9’s Today.
“However, Queenslanders can’t start claiming until 8am Sunday. This is really important. There is no point claiming beforehand.”
Mr Jongen said Victorians and South Australians could access the payment for their respective lockdowns.
“They can apply retrospectively for the one week lockdown that they had, if they haven’t already claimed,” he said.
“With all of these payments there is no need to rush. You have 28 days to claim from the beginning of lockdowns or from the date they are declared, and we do pay in arrears.”

Max Maddison 8.45am: Wilson welcomes Labor getting on board rollout
Federal Liberal MP Tim Wilson says he welcomes Labor belatedly getting on board the vaccination rollout.
Mr Wilson also said the states need to accept they need to share the burden of economic support if they impose lockdowns.
Labor’s preselection of Michelle Ananda-Rajah in the Victorian seat of Higgins drew staunch criticism after she repeatedly criticised AstraZeneca, at one point saying the vaccine had “failed in terms of its efficacy”.
But after former opposition leader Bill Shorten publicly backed the jab, Mr Wilson said he “welcomed” Labor’s decision to support the vaccine program, as he called on Dr Anada-Rajah to “repudiate her views” on AstraZeneca.
“It’s welcome we’re seeing the opposition get on board … rather than trying to dissuade people from getting the AstraZeneca,” Mr Wilson told Sky News on Monday morning.
With Brisbane plunged into another snap lockdown, Mr Wilson said the state needed to accept financial responsibility if they decided to resort to the draconian measures.

RACHEL BAXENDALE 8.40am: Victoria records two new locally-acquired cases
Victoria has recorded two new locally-acquired coronavirus cases to 8pm on Sunday.
Both cases are linked to the state’s current outbreaks and in people who have been in quarantine throughout their infectious period, Victoria’s health department says.
Monday’s three cases follow four on Sunday, two on Saturday, three on Friday, seven on Thursday, eight on Wednesday, 10 on Tuesday and an outbreak peak of 26 on Thursday, July 22.
Only two of the 37 cases over the past seven days had not been in quarantine for the duration of their infectious period.
This includes a traffic controller in his 20s who tested positive for coronavirus after working at the Moonee Valley Racecourse drive through Covid-19 testing centre.
Investigations are ongoing into how the traffic controller contracted the virus.
Aside from a work colleague who the man is understood to have infected when the pair car-pooled, all testing centre colleagues have tested negative for the virus.
Victoria’s latest cases bring the total number of community acquired cases since two incursions from NSW emerged almost three weeks ago to 217.
There are currently 134 active cases, including up to seven active cases acquired overseas - although there were no new overseas-acquired cases in the 24 hours to Monday.
At least 76 of those infected during the current outbreaks have recovered, and more are expected to do so in coming days.
The latest cases come after 21,417 tests were processed on Sunday, down from 25,779 on Saturday, 32,760 on Friday, 43,542 on Thursday and 25,404 the previous Sunday, and well down from the July 20 Victorian record of 59,355.

Ellie Dudley 8.30am: Miles restates advice against AstraZeneca for under 40s
Queensland deputy premier Steven Miles has doubled down on the state’s advice against administering the AstraZeneca vaccine to under-40s, despite the latest outbreak being linked to an unvaccinated medical student.
The medical student has been deemed the key to understanding Queensland’s latest Covid-19 outbreak, which grew by nine cases on Sunday.
State health authorities put a ban on medical placements for a week after the cluster continued to grow.
Mr Miles said they would not mandate the vaccine in hospitals due to shortage of supply of the Pfizer jab.
“We don’t even have enough vaccination supply to mandate vaccinations for people in hospitals, we’re working through, making sure that everyone working at our five COVID hospitals are vaccinated,” he told ABC Radio National.
Chief health officer Jeanneatte Young attracted criticism when she strongly advised under 40s to wait for the Pfizer vaccine citing the risks of the AstraZeneca vaccine.
Asked whether Dr Young would change her messaging surrounding the AstraZeneca jab to have the vaccinations done quicker as the cluster grows, Mr Miles said the authorities could continue to follow ATAGI’s advice.
“They are certainly allowed to (get the AstaZeneca vaccine) in accordance with (the ATAGI) advice, but the advice recommends they take the Pfizer and so that’s our focus,” he said.
“As you’d expect most of our medical students are well under 40.”

Max Maddison 8am: Sydney lockdown will eventually work: Coatsworth
Former deputy chief medical officer Nick Coatsworth says there’s now “national agreement” that short, sharp lockdowns are necessary, and says Sydneysiders should be “absolutely confident” the measures will eventually work.
After considerable disagreement about whether lockdowns were worth the toll on the economy, particularly with NSW managing to avoid resorting to the draconian measure, Dr Coatsworth said the Delta variant had changed the equation for chief health officers since the pandemic last year.
With case numbers continuing to rise across Greater Sydney despite extended and tightening lockdown restrictions, Dr Coatsworth said people in Greater Sydney should be confident that stay-at-home orders would eventually have their intended effect.
“But, of course, we know now there is national agreement that short, sharp lockdowns are necessary whilst our vaccination rates are increasing. So, this is the best chance that Queenslanders have to get the virus under control,” Dr Coatsworth told Nine’s Today on Monday morning.
“What Sydneysiders are doing, they need to be absolutely confident that it’s working and vaccination is going to be the added thing that gets them out of this lockdown.”

Ellie Dudley 7.30am: Shane Warne tests positive for Covid-19 in London
Cricket great Shane Warne has tested positive for Covid-19.
The former Australian player is head coach of Lord’s-based team London Spirit, but missed his side’s Hundred match against Southern Brave on Sunday due to his positive reading.
The club confirmed his infection just before the match.
“London Spirit men’s head coach Shane Warne will be absent from today’s match against Southern Brave at Lord’s,” the statement from the club read.
“After feeling unwell this morning, Shane returned a positive lateral flow test and will isolate from the squad and support staff whilst he awaits PCR results.
“A second member of the team management is self-isolating after also returning a positive test. No players have been impacted.”
He was one of two members of the team’s coaching staff to test positive for the virus.

Ellie Dudley 7.25am: Qld CHO Jeanette Young pushes mask wearing
Queensland health authorities will continue to rely on mask wearing to curb the spread of the highly-contagious Delta variant, in a strategy starkly different to NSW’s attempt to vaccinate their way out of lockdown.
Queensland’s latest cluster grew to 18 on Sunday, after nine new cases of Covid-19 were detected - the largest daily number for the state in a year.
The state’s chief health officer Jeannette Young penned an opinion article over the weekend to plead with residents to wear masks when they are in public. She only mentioned vaccination at the conclusion of the piece and did not refer to the widely available AstraZeneca vaccine.
“Queensland, COVID-19 is coming,” she wrote. “It’s unfortunate but almost inevitable that we will see a rise in COVID-19 cases here in coming months.
“That’s why I am pleading with Queenslanders to wear masks when they are in public.
“Please get vaccinated as soon as you become eligible. Vaccines are safe and effective.’’
She advised single-use surgical masks were the most effective against the virus, but “any paper or cloth mask would do.”
Dr Young attracted criticism when she strongly advised under 40s to wait for the Pfizer vaccine citing the (remote) risks of the AstraZeneca vaccine.

Ellie Dudley 7.10am: ADF troops begin Sydney street patrols today
Australian Defence Force troops will begin patrolling the streets of Sydney from today, having spent the weekend in training.
Some 300 army personnel have been enlisted by the NSW government to help enforce the city’s stay-at-home orders in a desperate attempt to boost compliance.
NSW Police Commissioner Mick Fuller said they would conduct door-knocks of the residences of Covid-19 positive patients and close contacts to see if they are complying with health orders.
They will be primarily based in south-west and western Sydney, where the outbreak is at its worst.
NSW recorded 239 new cases of Covid-19 on Sunday, with the source of 124 of the cases still under investigation.

Ellie Dudley 6.45am: Qld lockdown won’t end on Tuesday: AMA
Queensland President of the Australian Medical Association Chris Perry says the state’s lockdown will not end on Tuesday as planned, after nine new cases were detected on Sunday.
Eleven LGAs in the state’s south-east were forced into a three-day snap lockdown on Saturday over the spread of the highly-contagious Delta variant.
But with further growth in cases on Sunday, taking the outbreak’s tally to 18, Dr Perry said it was unlikely the restrictions would lift as planned.
“I don’t think it will stop tomorrow, but I hope it will,” he told Sunrise.
“We don’t want a lockdown that goes like a Victorian lockdown, we prefer one that goes a few days, we will take it one day at a time and see what happens this morning and tomorrow.”
The state’s health authorities are struggling to find the missing link between two returned travellers and a medical student, which they believe is the key to understanding how the virus has spread.
With cases appearing at a karate school and high schools, Dr Perry said mystery cases were highly concerning. “We don’t know where it originally came from,” he said. “It is suspected that it came from the Sunshine Coast and (spread to) the family of four, the medical student, the karate class and these massive schools.”

Yoni Bashan 5am: NSW faces ‘five-week race to freedom’
Federal health officials believe NSW is on a trajectory to hit 70 per cent vaccination cover in as little as five weeks, with Gladys Berejiklian tying the relaxation of Sydney’s lockdown to hitting significant inoculation targets.
“Once you get to 50 per cent vaccination, 60 per cent, 70 per cent, that triggers more freedoms. We can turn this around in four weeks,” the NSW Premier said after the state reported a record 239 Covid-19 cases on Sunday.
With more than 82,000 doses distributed in 24 hours, commonwealth officials are more optimistic that weekly vaccinations in NSW could rise to 650,000, paving the way for the 70 per cent cover level to be hit in September.
Sky News host Nicholas Reece says there needs to be an independent judicial review into what "went wrong" in Sydney so that Australia "does not make a mistake like this again".
At the current trajectory of about 450,000 doses weekly, however, NSW would reach the 80 per cent cover ­figure used by Ms Berejiklian as the threshold for a return to pre-pandemic ­settings only in mid-November.
The push to accelerate inoculations in Sydney – and in particular the city’s southwestern and western suburbs hard hit by the current outbreak – comes as the scientist in charge of the nation’s Covid-19 road map said she was optimistic Australians would embrace the vaccine program.
“I am still optimistic that once we have really good supply, we won’t be facing the challenges we have and that we are seeing in some countries overseas,” said Sharon Lewin , the director of Melbourne’s Doherty Institute.
It was Professor Lewin’s team that provided national cabinet with modelling that underpins plans for post-pandemic normalisation, with a vaccine coverage target of 70 per cent before the country can move out of the ­current virus suppression phase.
When coverage reaches 80 per cent, restrictions on vaccinated Australians will largely be lifted and international travel will begin to return to previous levels.
The existing lockdown across Sydney is due to expire on August 28, although this is likely to be extended with some changes in areas that continue to record higher rates of transmission.
Prior to the most recent extension, Treasury officials produced economic modelling about the impact of a lockdown that would extend until September 17.
NSW Premier Gladys Berejiklian says she will “never suggest” the state government’s Covid response has been “mistake free” but argues there is “no road map” for dealing with the Delta strain.

Ben Wilmot 4.45am: Delta outbreak a major threat to building boom
The emergence of the Delta variant of Covid-19, which has triggered a string of state-based lockdowns, threatens to sap confidence and derail the nation’s infrastructure and construction boom.
The latest quarterly Investment Monitor by consultancy Deloitte warns the Delta disruption in NSW, including its recent construction ban, is placing further pressure on an already stretched building industry, which could lead to delays and cost blowouts for major projects.
The report, which tracks major engineering and commercial construction projects across Australia, notes that before the June outbreak Australia was experiencing one of the biggest building booms of the past decade.
Industries such as mining and energy are underpinning the boom with the value of all projects – under way and announced – increasing by $25.1bn to $783.4bn during the June quarter, Deloitte said.

John Ferguson 4.30am: Pandemic fat cats dine out on taxpayer dollar
Millions of dollars were splurged on pot plants, morning and afternoon teas, psychologists, work-from-home allowances and overtime in the pandemic response across Victoria’s Department of Premier and Cabinet.
The government also provided some bureaucrats with “staff recognition” Visa cards, UberEats vouchers and gift cards as part of publicly funded incentive ­programs.
New figures show nearly $3.4m was pumped into the department for such expenses as a brass quartet and jazz trio and to hire pot plants and keep them alive during 2020.
The government spent nearly $1m on the work-from-home ­allowance over 10 months and $600,00 on overtime as it struggled to contain the killer corona­virus wave.
The figures highlight the extent to which professional development is emerging as a booming industry for consultants, with coaches and facilitators – some with psychology qualifications – netting more than $1.2m.

Full text: “Once you get to 50 per cent vaccination, 60 per cent, 70 per cent, that triggers more freedoms. We can turn this around in four weeks,” the NSW Premier said after the state reported a record 239 Covid-19 cases on Sunday.
With more than 82,000 doses distributed in 24 hours, commonwealth officials are more optimistic that weekly vaccinations in NSW could rise to 650,000, paving the way for the 70 per cent cover level to be hit in September.
At the current trajectory of about 450,000 doses weekly, however, NSW would reach the 80 per cent cover ­figure used by Ms Berejiklian as the threshold for a return to pre-pandemic ­settings only in mid-November.
The push to accelerate inoculations in Sydney – and in particular the city’s southwestern and western suburbs hard hit by the current outbreak – comes as the scientist in charge of the nation’s Covid-19 road map said she was optimistic Australians would embrace the vaccine program.
“I am still optimistic that once we have really good supply, we won’t be facing the challenges we have and that we are seeing in some countries overseas,” said Sharon Lewin, the director of Melbourne’s Doherty Institute.
It was Professor Lewin’s team that provided national cabinet with modelling that underpins plans for post-pandemic normalisation, with a vaccine coverage target of 70 per cent before the country can move out of the ­current virus suppression phase.
When coverage reaches 80 per cent, restrictions on vaccinated Australians will largely be lifted and international travel will begin to return to previous levels.
“I am optimistic that we will not see the same hesitancy that we’re seeing in countries like the US here in Australia,” Professor Lewin told The Australian.
While a number of US states have fully vaccinated more than 70 per cent of their populations, others have struggled with ­hesitancy and a low take-up rate.
Ms Berejiklian said while the NSW government wanted to ease restrictions “as much as possible”, it would be possible only with higher vaccination rates.
“There is no place in the world that has been able to live with the Delta virus and not have higher rates of vaccination. We have to be very clear about that,” she said.
The existing lockdown across Sydney is due to expire on August 28, although this is likely to be extended with some changes in areas that continue to record higher rates of transmission.
Prior to the most recent extension, Treasury officials produced economic modelling about the impact of a lockdown that would extend until September 17.
Federal officials believe the 70 per cent target is achievable ­because vaccination hesitancy has waned since updated Australian Technical Advisory Group on ­Immunisation advice on the safety of the AstraZeneca vaccine.
So far, Ms Berejiklian has avoided discussing carrot-and-stick approaches to vaccine ­hesitancy but she has hinted that the lockdown would be eased if high rates of immunisation were achieved in the coming weeks.
Of the 239 cases recorded on Sunday, 61 were known to be ­infectious in the community at some point and the isolation ­status of a further 98 people is under investigation.
Officials said 124 cases had not been linked to known sources, with investigation continuing.
Sending a strong signal that ­restrictions could be eased ­within weeks, Ms Berejiklian said high rates of vaccination during August would provide immediate pathways out of lockdown and potentially end their use.
“We have the month of August to get the vaccination rates as high as possible. Let August be the month where we break records with the vaccination,” she said.
NSW Labor leader Chris Minns on Sunday backed the ­government’s vaccination drive but criticised a decision to divert Pfizer doses from the Hunter and Central Coast regions to inoculate students in Sydney’s western and southwestern suburbs.
NSW Health decided on ­Friday to reallocate Pfizer vac­cines from non-metropolitan ­regions to maximise vaccinations in communities under strain, resulting in booking cancellations, including for frontline workers.
Premier Gladys Berejiklian says New South Wales has recorded 239 new locally acquired COVID cases as she urges residents to take up the vaccine in the month of August.
“This is in no way a desirable action by the Ministry of Health but access to supplies for NSW have become so constrained that they have been left with no alternative,” an internal email ­obtained by The Australian read.
Mr Minns said he would seek a “commonsense solution” to the problem through consultation with the government. “After all, we all need to remember these communities are in lockdown just as most of Sydney is in lockdown. It’s not a similar situation to ­regional NSW,” he said.
Ms Berejiklian said a rise in vaccinations would prevent the state from re-entering a lockdown after it emerged from the current restrictions.
“Other states might be facing regular lockdowns in and out all the time,” she said. “We want this to be the last lockdown we have and we can make that happen if we get vaccinated.
“Our strategy for NSW is to get vaccination rates to 60, 70, 80 per cent. That means we can live with the Delta variant and we won’t have to go in and out of ­lockdown.”
Michael Kidd, the acting ­commonwealth chief medical ­officer, said 4.5 million Covid-19 vaccines had been administered in July, compared with 3.2 million in June and 2.1 million in May.
Professor Kidd said only 15 of more than 2700 local cases linked with the current Sydney outbreak had been fully vaccinated.
“There have been no notified cases of people who are fully vaccinated who have required admission to hospital apart from the small number of residents of residential aged-care facilities moved out of their facility and into hospital as a precaution to optimise their care and to prevent the risk of further spread to other residents,” he said. “No fully vaccinated people have been admitted to intensive care units.”
Highlighting the difficulty in hitting a high vaccination target is the experience of other countries, including the US, which is expected to hit 70 per cent coverage only in early November.
Figures compiled by US organisation Our World in Data shows Britain and Singapore both have a vaccination coverage rates of about 57 per cent.
The most recent federal Health ­Department data, for July 31, showed 19 per cent of Australia’s adult population was now fully vaccinated.
A further 41 per cent had received one dose of either the Pfizer or AstraZeneca vaccine.
The take-up of AstraZeneca vaccines to people aged between 16 and 39 in NSW has risen dramatically in July, the Australian Immunisation Register shows.
Asked whether Australia would reach a 70 per cent coverage level by the end of the year, Professor Kidd would only say: “I’ll let you do the maths.”

Scott Morrison sets a goal of 16.8m shots to Covid-19 freedom

Full text: Following a marathon national cabinet meeting on Friday, the Prime Minister unveiled a new four-phase national plan that sets a vaccine coverage target of 70 per cent before the country can move out of the current suppression phase.
With more than 3.7 million people already fully vaccinated, a further 10.7 million will have to ­receive both jabs to reach the ­target of 70 per cent of all Australians eligible for the vaccine, or 14.4 million people.
A further 16.8 million vaccine doses will be required to hit the 70 per cent target.
The reopening blueprint, based on health and economic modelling provided by the Doherty ­Institute and Treasury, outlines four stages ending in a post-­vaccination phase where Australians live with Covid-19 in a similar way to influenza.
The Weekend Australian ­understands there will be enough supply to jab all eligible Australians twice before the end of the year and the federal government is increasingly confident it can hit 80 per cent coverage by December, advancing the country to the third phase of the plan.
Under phase three, there will be targeted lockdowns in exceptional scenarios, restrictions on vaccinated Australians will be ­lifted, new travel bubbles opened and caps increased for student, economic and humanitarian visa holders.
In the fourth phase, uncapped international travel will resume with quarantine reserved for high-risk travellers and vaccine boosters provided as necessary.
Mr Morrison, who said that within days vaccinated people would have a digital wallet recording their inoculations, said travellers coming into the country would need to be vaccinated with a dose “recognised in Australia”.
“By the time we get to that stage, digital vaccination certificates for many nations will ­already be in place,” he said. ­“Indeed for Australia it will be in place.”
On the back of another day of record vaccinations that pushed national vaccine coverage to 18.24 per cent, Mr Morrison said he was confident the nation could hit 70 per cent by December.
“I believe we can get this done but it’s not something that any one government, any one vaccination clinic, any one Australian can achieve on their own – it’s done as a team effort,” he said.
Industry groups questioned the reality of hitting a 70 per cent vaccine rate by December and warned that until the next phases of the national plan were unlocked, business would need to “brace itself for disruption for at least the next six months”.
The in-principle agreement struck by federal, state and territory leaders on Friday does not include specific timelines and will require Australia-wide average vaccination rates to reach 70 and 80 per cent before any one jurisdiction can move to the next step.
Mr Morrison said the national plan would “chart the way back” out of the suppression phase, currently dominated by the extended lockdown in NSW and avoiding outbreaks of the more contagious Delta strain.
“Under this plan, no state or territory is required to increase the restrictions beyond where they are right now. They are a matter for them to set based on the balance of risk that they see in their state or territory,” Mr Morrison said. “There is no state or jurisdiction in the country that wants to apply a lockdown or hold Australians back should it not be necessary. What the modelling … showed us was that when you get to that 70 per cent level you have achieved a level of coverage which enables you to then ease into that process.”
He said the national plan was “not about freedom days”.
“We have made our own Australian way through this,” he said. “Sure, we’ve acted with a lot of caution. That’s why there are 30,000 Australians today who are still alive because of that and the decisions that we’ve taken.
“We don’t go from shut one day, open the next. That is a very dangerous path. What we need to do is take steps towards that – sensible, cautious steps. We get to 70 per cent. So let’s get there and then we get to 80 per cent and we make that work and then we get to the next level.”
West Australian Premier Mark McGowan said the 70 per cent target was “fairly modest”, flagging the more significant change would come with the third phase, which requires an 80 per cent threshold. “In any event, the exact criteria within each of the phases isn’t resolved as yet,” he said. “Some are agreed but not all, and a range of states and territories will work on that over the coming weeks to nail that down. We do need a road map, we need to understand what the plan is.”
Queensland Premier Annastacia Palaszczuk said the in-­principle agreement was to achieve 70 and 80 per cent vaccine coverage before states could move to “more limited lockdowns … when needed”. “In the meantime with the threat of variants like Delta we still maintain a strategy of hard and fast lockdowns because they are so fast moving,” she said.
Australian Industry Group chief executive Innes Willox said business needed to brace itself for disruption for at least the next six months while lockdowns were a component of “formal national policy”. “We need a formal end point for this disruption no matter the take-up rate,” he said. “Once everyone eligible has been ­offered a vaccine we need to move to the next phase and not be held hostage to vaccine hesitancy and opposition.
“Our economic recovery depends on all our leaders sticking by their agreements, something they have found impossible to abide by to this point.”
With more than one billion doses of AstraZeneca now supplied globally, Mr Morrison urged Australians to book an appointment for the jab as the domestic take-up of the vaccine increased. “If you want to get vaccinated, the AZ vaccine is there for you. It is a highly effective vaccine,” he said.

Full text: AUSTRALIA would need 70 per cent of people under 60 and 95 per cent of seniors vaccinated against Covid in order to open and avoid thousands of deaths, one of the nation’s leading research institutes has found.
Even then, face masks and some restrictions on gatherings would need to be reintroduced during danger periods to keep Covid-19 deaths below the annual flu toll.
Australia’s Burnet Institute, a world-leading medical research body, has undertaken modelling to help guide policymakers at the same time the Doherty Institute has done similar work for Australia’s national Covid cabinet.
Prime Minister Scott Morrison (pictured) will on Friday discuss vaccine targets proposed in the Doherty report with state leaders at national cabinet in an effort to reach a consensus on how to ease restrictions, prevent lockdowns and gradually reopen the borders.
After missing last week’s meeting due to being in Tokyo, Queensland Premier Annastacia Palaszczuk is expected to join the link up from hotel quarantine in Brisbane.
The Burnet’s modelling found once 95 per cent of those over 60, 70 per cent of those aged 12-59, and 70 per cent of under-12s were vaccinated, Australia could safely reopen its international borders – provided the number of deaths and hospitalisations were balanced with intermittent restrictions.
“This gives us lots of hope,” Burnet head of modelling Nick Scott said. “It shows that we don’t need to be in the situation we are in forever. Once we get high vaccine coverage we don’t need to just keep pulling out the lockdown as soon as we get a few cases. We can actually just let it go for a little bit then slowly put the brakes on with a much more acceptable approach.” Because current vaccines do not offer 100 per cent protection, Dr Scott said it was not yet possible to have open borders, no restrictions and no deaths at the same time.
Based on international data weighing up the effectiveness of Covid vaccines, as well as the impact of public health and distancing measures used in Victoria, the Burnet’s Covasim model – provided to the Victorian government this week – provides several “acceptable” paths to reopen the country.
Rather than extreme measures such as lockdowns, the projections show masks, limiting outdoor gatherings to 50 and working from home where possible would be enough to address the risks when average daily cases rise.
Under the “light” restriction model, schools and entertainment venues could remain open, though pubs, restaurants and places of worship would need 4sq m density rules.
Burnet deputy director Margaret Hellard said the higher Australia’s vaccination levels rise, the less frequently any public health measures will be required.
“Once we have a high level of vaccination and we open up our borders, we need to understand that you may need to have some level of restriction,” Professor Hellard said.
“You can’t just say ‘we are all vaccinated, we’ll open our borders’. This is us functioning in the world, this is going to visit family, this is going on holiday, this is us bringing in workers from the pacific region to pick fruit … these are the lives we live.” Mr Morrison on Thursday said targets proposed in the Doherty report – yet to be publicly released – were achievable.
“That’s up to all of us to go and get vaccinated to achieve those,” the Prime Minister said. “We want to be able to go forward. Countries that have launched into open have found themselves within days having to walk back. Now, we don’t want that.” He said he was confident there would be “ample supply” of the vaccine over the next five months to ensure all Australians who wanted the jab would be able to access it by Christmas.
Mr Morrison said the Doherty modelling was being considered in conjunction with an economic analysis on the costs of lockdowns.
It comes as another organisation, the Grattan Institute, on Thursday released a report saying that borders could reopen and lockdowns could end once 80 per cent of the population was vaccinated.
The institute’s modelling showed at this level, along with 95 per cent vaccination for the most vulnerable, severe cases would be rare while the virus remained in the community. National cabinet will also discuss the new Covid-19 payments system announced by Mr Morrison this week.

Full text: EXCLUSIVE AUSTRALIA would need 70 per cent of people under 60 and 95 per cent of seniors vaccinated against Covid in order to open and avoid thousands of deaths, one of the nation’s leading research institutes has found.
Even then, face masks and some restrictions on gatherings would need to be reintroduced during danger periods to keep Covid-19 deaths below the annual flu toll.
Melbourne’s Burnet Institute, a world-leading medical research body, has undertaken modelling to help guide policymakers at the same time the Doherty Institute has done similar work for Australia’s national Covid cabinet.
Scott Morrison will today discuss vaccine targets proposed in the Doherty report with state leaders in an effort to reach a consensus on how to ease restrictions, prevent lockdowns and gradually reopen the borders.
The Burnet’s modelling – which was provided to the Andrews Government earlier this week – projects that about 3000 Victorians would die from the virus each year if Australia was to “let it rip” and abandon all measures completely after reaching high vaccination levels.
However, it found that once 95 per cent of those over 60, 70 per cent of those aged 12-59, and 70 per cent of under-12s are vaccinated Australia could safely reopen its international borders – provided the number of deaths and hospitalisations were balanced with intermittent restrictions.
Because current Covid-19 vaccines do not offer 100 per cent protection, the Burnet’s head of modelling Nick Scott said it was not yet possible to have open borders, no restrictions and no deaths at the same time.
However, he said reaching the “95/70/70” vaccination levels could limit Victoria’s Covid deaths to a level of about 31 a year without resorting to lockdowns, border closures or the absence of major events.
“This gives us lots of hope,” Dr Scott said.
“It shows that we don’t need to be in the situation we are in forever. Once we get high vaccine coverage we don’t need to just keep pulling out the lockdown as soon as we get a few cases.
“We can actually just let it go for a little bit then slowly put the brakes on with a much more acceptable approach.” Based on international data weighing up the effectiveness of Covid vaccines, as well as the impact of public health and distancing measures used in Victoria, the Burnet’s Covasim model provides several “acceptable” paths to reopen the country.
While the report says a highly vaccinated Victoria could manage five new Delta cases entering the state each day with contact tracing, it found measures would need to be introduced when average daily cases rose higher.
Rather than extreme measures such as lockdowns, the projections show masks, limiting outdoor gatherings to 50 and working from home where possible would be enough to address the risks during those periods.
Under the “light” restriction model, schools and entertainment venues could remain open, though pubs, restaurants and places of worship would need 4sq m density rules.
Major events such as the AFL grand final and concerts have not been included in the model, however it is expected they could continue during periods of higher daily cases provided plans were in place to limit the mixing of spectators.
Most crucially, Burnet deputy director Margaret Hellard said the higher Australia’s vaccination levels rose, public health measures would not be required as often.
“It is vital to have high levels of vaccine in the community because it protects people from severe disease related to Covid, but also it will impact on transmission,” Professor Hellard said.
“Once we have a high level of vaccination and we open up our borders, we need to understand that you may need to have some level of restriction.
“You can’t just say ‘we are all vaccinated, we’ll open our borders’. It has to be a combination of the two. This is us functioning in the world, this is going to visit family, this is going on holiday, this is us bringing in workers from the pacific region to pick fruit on our farms. These are the lives we live.” The Prime Minister on Thursday said targets proposed in the Doherty report – yet to be publicly released – were achievable.
“That’s up to all of us to go and get vaccinated to achieve those,” he said. “We want to be able to go forward. Countries that have launched into open have found themselves within days having to walk back. Now, we don’t want that.” He said he was confident there would be “ample supply” of the vaccine over the next five months to ensure all Australians who wanted the jab would be able to access it by Christmas.

It comes as another organisation, the Grattan Institute, on Thursday released a report saying that borders could reopen and lockdowns could end once 80 per cent of the population was vaccinated.
The institute’s modelling showed at this level, along with 95 per cent vaccination for the most vulnerable, severe cases would be rare while the virus remained in the community. National cabinet will also discuss the new Covid-19 payments system announced by Mr Morrison this week.

Full text: Premier Daniel Andrews on Tuesday banned any Victorians still in NSW – except essential workers or those given compassionate exemptions – from returning home in the next fortnight while suspending all red zone permits from Covid hot spots.
South Australia on Tuesday became the latest state plunged into lockdown due to Covid’s Delta variant, which leaked from Sydney before its lockdown was strengthened on July 9.
University of Melbourne epidemiologist Professor Tony Blakely said restrictions on construction and other work sites implemented this week effectively put Sydney under a Stage 4 lockdown, though the current outbreak will present an ongoing risk for weeks.
“It could be at least several weeks before they get those numbers to something like five cases per day,” Prof Blakely said.
“The real shame for Sydney is it will take considerable time ... It’s going to take weeks to beat this thing.
“The question is what can we do to speed it up by a week or so?”
While states have halved their hotel quarantine intake, Prof Blakely said the threat of infected cases travelling over borders now presented the same level of risk for each jurisdiction.
As he extended Victoria’s lockdown, Mr Andrews ramped up his rhetoric on the Berejiklian government’s restrictions, saying a hard border was required to prevent more Delta cases leaking from Sydney.
“I’ll just remind you all, we had a ring of steel around Melbourne last year and it didn’t just protect country Victoria, it protected the whole country,” Mr Andrews said.
“They are not locked into Sydney, so they must be locked out of Victoria.
“That is the choice I have had to make.
“We don’t want to get this outbreak under control only to see another outbreak flare up, another incursion.”
South Australia entered a tough seven-day lockdown from 6pm on Tuesday after the fifth case was linked to its growing cluster. Under SA’s statewide restrictions schools and the construction industry are closed, while residents are limited to 90 minutes exercise a day and within 2.5km of their house.
Queensland is also on alert after a woman in her 20s tested positive after returning from a Melbourne exposure site on July 10, despite being fully vaccinated.
Western Australia and Tasmania have also placed a hard border on NSW, Queensland and Victoria, while restricting travel from South Australia.
Although Sydney’s Delta outbreak began on June 16, the first “soft-lockdown” measures were only introduced on June 26, before being partially strengthened on July 9 and again stepped up on the weekend.
The NSW government’s decision not to enter a “hard and fast” lockdown at the early stages of the outbreak is now expected to see the state endure weeks or months of harsh measures – also increasing the likelihood of repeat leaks into other states.
Modelling by the Burnet Institute last week revealed the restrictions first placed over Sydney would not be enough to drive the outbreak down, resulting in 100+ daily cases and thousands of deaths over the coming months.
Although the Berejiklian government has now brought its settings closer into line with the Victorian stage 4 restrictions which experts say are needed to overcome the Delta outbreak, it may still take more than a month to control its spread.
According to the Burnet’s latest COVASIM modelling, even if the density restrictions introduced in NSW on July 9 were maintained for the next 12 months they would not have eliminated the outbreak, leading to 12 times the number of deaths than during the horror 2017 season – which claimed 654 lives in NSW.
“When we looked at the NSW numbers, but in a simulation for Victoria, we found that if you didn’t have the stage-4 level of restrictions we would not be able to control the outbreak – and that you would be in some level of restriction for many months as opposed to weeks,” Burnet Institute deputy director Professor Margaret Hellard said.
“If the outbreak isn’t immediately contained, you are better off going harder faster than delaying too long.
“The faster you go – even the severe restrictions - it means you are in lockdown for less period of time and your ability to release is faster.
“If you miss out on getting under control you have a big, long, problem ahead of you.
“Currently, with the level of vaccination we have in the community, when we can’t see the edge of the outbreak, you are better off going harder faster, because in the long run getting out of restrictions faster.”

Full text: Thirteen million Australians will be under coronavirus measures from tonight as Delta continues its march across the nation.
Victoria’s “five day” lockdown will be extended by another seven days to midnight next Tuesday, July 27. It comes as the state recorded 13 new virus cases.
NSW has recorded 78 local cases of Covid-19 in the past 24 hours, with 27 of those infectious in the community.
South Australia will enter a snap lockdown from 6pm tonight
Paul Garvey 11.30pm: Escapee had the sheets with hotel quarantine
A 39-year-old Queensland man who allegedly escaped from his fourth-storey hotel quarantine room by making a rope out of bed sheets had been arrested and charged by West Australian police.
The man had arrived in Perth on a flight from Brisbane on Monday afternoon without a valid exemption to enter the state. He was directed to leave WA within 48 hours and was taken to a quarantine hotel in Rivervale while he awaited his return flight, but in the early hours of Tuesday he climbed out a window of his room using bed sheets he had tied together and fled.
He was arrested just over eight hours later in Mt Lawley, 7.5km away.
Yoni Bashan 10.45pm: Builders’ case for getting tradies back on site
A coalition of home building companies is urging the NSW government to immediately restart residential construction across Greater Sydney under a plan that will significantly reduce mobility on worksites but allow homes to be built during the lockdown.
Devised by the Housing Industry Association, the plan seeks an immediate resumption of building activity across Greater Sydney by halving the number of trade teams allowable on work sites.
The plan would also limit those teams to a maximum of five people and restrict tradespeople to four jobs sites a week.
Joseph Lam 10pm: Updated orders for NSW central west
NSW Health has provided an update on the stay-at-home orders coming into central west NSW from 12.01am on Wednesday.
Anyone who lives in the local government areas of Blayney, the Cabonne Shire Council and Orange can only leave home for the following reasons:
● Shopping for food or other essential goods and services
● Medical care, compassionate needs and to get vaccinated unless you have been identified as a close contact
● To exercise outdoors. Groups are limited to two unless you are members of the same household
● To work or study where you cannot work or study from home
● To attend a wedding or a funeral. A grace period is in place until 12.01am on Friday July 23. After this date, funerals will be limited to ten people.
The new rule requires face masks to be worn indoors and in outdoor settings where you cannot socially distance yourself from others, including queuing for takeaway food.
COVID-19 testing clinics will be open at Bathurst, Orange, Parkes, Blayney and Molong.
David Penberthy 9.15pm: Businesses in fear as state snapped shut
The snap imposition of a hard seven-day lockdown in South Australia has left shattered businesses with unanswered questions about what compensation they will receive to offset their multimillion-dollar losses.
But the state government insists it had no choice but to move swiftly against the fast-spreading Delta variant, saying it had shown that any delays could have resulted in a mass outbreak within days.
As SA’s supermarkets were again the scene of frenzied panic buying, Premier Steven Marshall said SA had signed up to the joint state-federal compensation arrangements at last Friday’s national cabinet and details of relief would be made available soon.

Rachel Baxendale 8.30pm: Infection triggers testing push in Victoria’s east
Gippsland’s Wellington Respiratory Clinic, in Sale in Victoria’s east, will increase its testing capacity on Wednesday in response to a positive case in the Wellington Shire.
The area covers Sale, Yarram and Maffra.
Sandro Demaio, CEO of Victorian government health promotion foundation Vic Health, tweeted that the Health Department would not be listing any exposure sites as the person had been in quarantine while infectious.
Rachel Baxendale 7.45pm: Melbourne firm an exposure threat for a week
A logistics business in Melbourne’s outer west has been listed as a Tier 1 coronavirus exposure site for seven full consecutive days.
Anyone who attended BR International Logistics in Australis Drive, Derrimut, between Tuesday, July 13, and Monday, July 19, must quarantine for 14 days.
The site is among almost 30 new sites listed on Tuesday, bringing the total number of exposure sites in Victoria to 349.
Also listed are sites in Richmond, Carlton and St Kilda in inner-city Melbourne, Camberwell and Box Hill South in the east, Glen Iris in the southeast, and Dandenong and Berwick in the outer southeast,
There are also eight new public transport exposures, including at Southern Cross Station in the CBD, Blackburn station in the outer east, and on city trams.
Joseph Lam 7.20pm: Lockdown for Orange, Blayney and Cabonne LGA
A regional NSW city and nearby towns will be thrown into lockdown from midnight on Tuesday after Sydney’s growing Covid-19 outbreak spilled into the state’s west.
Blayney, the Cabonne Shire Council and Orange will be under strict restrictions for the next seven days, a decision made in a crisis meeting on Tuesday to curb the virus’s spread in regional NSW.
The new restrictions will see about 50,000 people in the area only allowed to leave home for essential trips, including medical appointments and grocery shopping. But construction will continue and retail stores will remain open.
The announcement came after NSW recording 78 new locally acquired cases and one overseas-acquired case in the 24 hours to 8pm on Monday.
Just 37 of those new cases were in isolation during their infection perious. So far 49 have been linked to a known case or cluster, 45 of which are household contacts and four of which are close contacts.
On Tuesday, NSW Chief Health Officer Dr Kerry Chant confirmed one of those cases had been recorded in the regional town of Cootamundra, about 190km south of Blayney.
NSW Health has listed the following exposure sites as venues of concern. Anyone who visited during the listed exposure times is required to get tested immediately then isolate for 14 days regardless of the result.
● Woolworths, North Orange Shopping Centre, 9 Telopea Way, Orange: Saturday, July 17, from 1.20pm to 1.50pm; 3pm to 3.30pm
● CTC Orange, North Orange Shopping Centre, 9 Telopea Way, Orange: Saturday from 1.50pm to 2pm

Joseph Lam 7.20pm: PM offers income support to SA
Scott Morrison has activated income support payments of up to $600 a week for South Australians affected by Covid-19 restrictions.
The government declared on Tuesday night that it would “stand by South Australians” and help communities struggling with the economic consequences of extended lockdowns.
Chief Medical Officer Paul Kelly has declared a number of local government areas in the state a “hotspot” under the commonwealth definition, ensuring that individuals will be eligible for Covid disaster payments.
These payments will see affected workers receiving $375 if they have lost between eight and less than 20 hours of work and $600 if they have lost 20 or more hours of work. No liquid assets test will apply to these payments.
A statement issued by the Prime Minister, Government Services Minister Linda Reynolds and Emergency Management Minister Bridget McKenzie said the payments would be paid in arrears and that applications could be made through myGov from Wednesday July 28.
“To get ready, South Australians should set up their myGov accounts so they can claim quickly and easily online,” they said.
“Services Australia will make the payments as quickly as possible, with some payments being made in less than an hour following an application.”
South Australians in the following local government areas can apply:
The cities of:
• Adelaide
• Burnside
• Campbelltown
• Charles Sturt
• Holdfast Bay
• Marion
• Mitcham
• Norwood Payneham and St Peters
• Onkaparinga
• Playford
• Port Adelaide Enfield
• Prospect
• Salisbury
• Tea Tree Gully
• Unley
• West Torrens
The towns of:
• Gawler
• Walkerville
And the council of:
• Adelaide Hills Council
Joseph Lam 6.50pm: McGowan closes SA border
Western Australia has closed its borders to anyone who has travelled through South Australia since Thursday July 8, requiring anyone entering the state after that date to isolate for 14 days and take a Covid-19 test within 48 hours of arriving and again on Day 12.
Those unable to quarantine at home will be directed to hotel quarantine.
“My advice to any West Australian who is currently in South Australia is to come home now,” Premier Mark McGowan said on Tuesday. “Things can change rapidly and it is not worth the risk.”
Queensland has also shut its borders to residents travelling from South Australia with an official restriction set to come into place from 1am on Thursday.
While a small grace period was given, Queensland Premier Annstacia Palaszczuk announced a more immediate restriction requiring anyone who has travelled to a hotspot to get tested immediately upon return and to isolate at home.
“We strongly advise Queenslanders to reconsider travel to South Australia,” she said. “If you’re already in South Australia, please consider returning home if you can.”
The rule will also affect Queenslanders who will be required to apply for an exemption to return. Those who do not qualify for an exemption will be required to go into hotel quarantine for 14 days.
Joseph Lam 6.28pm: Orange faces lockdown as Sydney cluster spreads west
A regional NSW city could go into lockdown from midnight on Tuesday after a pet food delivery driver spread coronavirus from southwest Sydney.
About 50,000 residents in and around Orange, 250km west of Sydney, could be locked down for seven days after the man who works in Blayney visited five large venues after contracting the virus from the Sydney worker.
It’s understood a crisis is being held to discuss the lockdown after the man travelled to an Officeworks, a fuel station, a Woolworths, a Pizza Hut and the North Orange Shopping Centre on Saturday afternoon.
NSW Health has listed the exposure times on Saturday afternoon from between 1.20pm and 6pm.
NSW Health has listed the following exposure sites as venues of concern. Anyone who visited during the listed exposure times is required to get tested immediately then isolate for 14 days regardless of the result.
● Woolworths, North Orange Shopping Centre, 9 Telopea Way, Orange: Saturday, July 17, from 1.20pm to 1.50pm; 3pm to 3.30pm
● CTC Orange, North Orange Shopping Centre, 9 Telopea Way, Orange: Saturday from 1.50pm to 2pm
● Officeworks, 179 to 181 Byng Street, Orange: Saturday from 4.35pm to 5.50pm
● Pizza Hut, 33 Bathurst Road, Orange: Saturday from 4.55pm to 5.05pm
● EG FuelCo Australia, 1 Hanrahan Place, Orange: Saturday from 5.45pm to 6pm
Joseph Lam 6.08pm: Second Covid-positive ship leaves WA on alert
A 21-crew ship which travelled to Western Australia and later New Zealand from Jakarta has left the state on high alert after nine new crew members tested positive for Covid-19.
The Mattina, which docked in Fremantle from July 10 to 12, is the second ship which has posed a serious risk to the state, the first being BBC California, which has had 10 crew members test positive for the virus.
Premier Mark McGowan said he believed there was a relatively low risk posed to his state from the Mattina as strict Covid-19 protocols were followed and crew members tested positive after leaving Fremantle.
“The chief health officer advises if there is any risk involved with this ship, it is low,” he said.
“But out of an abundance of caution, all stevedores who may have come into contact with the ship, whilst she was in Fremantle, are being contacted by Western Australia Health and interviewed to determine the most appropriate testing and quarantine arrangements for them,” he said.
Mr McGowan said about 25 people came into contact with crew members aboard the Mattina including pilots, customers officers and ship handlers.
“All those people have been individually interviewed to see what level of precaution has to be put in around them,” he said.
On the BBC California, Mr McGowan said Western Australia was still figuring out how to handle the situation and the positive crew members on board.
“We are now at a stage where decisions need to be made on how to best handle the BBC California, from a COVID point of view and from a maritime safety standpoint,” he said.
“We don’t want to risk the health of the remaining healthy crew members and need to ensure the ship has adequate crew to safely operate.”
Eli Greenblat 5.24pm: David Jones defies Covid hit
Upmarket department store David Jones has seen consumer confidence improve despite the pandemic, with closed borders preventing Australians from travel overseas driving higher “inward focused consumption”.
This has seen a rebound in sales for David Jones, as well as the Country Road fashion group which is part of the same retailer, with second half sales for the department store better by more than 17 per cent. However, the retailer is expected to see its profits shaved by writedowns and impairments linked to the closure of its food business.
The comments were made in an market update by Woolworths Holdings, the South African retailer that owns David Jones. While they share the same name, there are no links between Australia’s Woolworths and the South African group.

Rachel Baxendale 4.45pm: Eid festival ‘had no bearing’ on lockdowns
Daniel Andrews said his government’s decision to extend Victoria’s lockdown was not influenced by the timing of the Muslim festival of Eid, which is due to be celebrated this weekend.
Muslims across Canterbury, Liverpool, Fairfield, and Bankstown are forced to celebrate the holiest day of the year confined to their own homes on Tuesday instead of the usual large family gathering. Lakemba Labor MP Jihad Dib said it was important for Muslims to stay "socially connected" even though they could not celebrate as usual. “Anyone who’s got a voice is encouraging people to make sure that we find new ways to celebrate Eid and to acknowledge Eid, certainly well within the rules but also to make sure we stay...socially connected but we stay physically distanced,” he told Sky News. Mr Dib said Muslims can celebrate with COVID-19 restrictions in place by having activities to spend time with the family, mosques performing online services, and giving gifts in advance through mail. “Economically it has a huge impact because people do spend an incredible amount of money in preparation for Eid." “These businesses that are mostly affected are small family businesses who, for a couple of times a year, that’s when they really go out and do...the most business that they can.”
A family Eid gathering in Coburg in Melbourne’s north in late June last year sparked what was then one of the state’s biggest family clusters, as daily case numbers began to reach double digits on their way to a peak of 725 cases on August 5.
“My message is one of goodwill and best wishes for a very holy time,” the Victorian Premier said when asked whether he had a message for the Muslim community ahead of Eid.
“This particular festival, this particular cohort, this particular series of events was not a factor (in determining lockdown timing), so I wouldn’t read anything into that.”
Rachel Baxendale 4.35pm: Andrews defends delays on Business helpline
Daniel Andrews has hit back at criticism over a message telling callers to the Business Victoria hotline they would be on hold for more than 17 hours by saying that his government “literally can’t have 30,000 people answering phones”.
On Monday, desperate Victorian business owners calling the hotline were greeted with a recorded message telling them their “estimated wait time is about 17 hours and five minutes”.
The government has attributed the message to a “technical issue” and maintains calls were answered within 10 to 20 minutes.
South Australia will be thrown into a seven-day statewide lockdown after recording five COVID-19 cases and Western Australia has declared anyone coming from the state will need to quarantine. There have been four cases related to the Mulberry cluster and all are family members of the 81-year-old Argentinian man who contracted the virus in New South Wales. The fifth case is a friend of the family who appears to have contracted the virus at a party he attended with one of the family members at a Greek restaurant. Under the lockdown, there will be five reasons for residents to leave home which are compassionate grounds, essential work, essential shopping, medical reasons, and up to 90 minutes of exercise. Western Australia has classified the state as low risk, requiring travellers to undergo 14 days quarantine.
But despite Mr Andrews claiming on Tuesday that the issue has “been rectified” callers were still waiting more than an hour for their calls to be answered.
“We work as hard as we can to provide information that’s accurate in as timely a way as possible,” Mr Andrews said when asked to respond to the ongoing long wait times.
“I think people know and understand though, like we literally can’t have 30,000 people answering phones.
“People will call in and we will get to them as fast as we can with the best information we can. If we don’t have an answer we’ll follow it up. That’s often a very time-consuming thing.”
The Australian understands 30 call-takers were added to a roster of 70 on Monday to accommodate the extra demand.
Asked whether Business Victoria had “solved” the problem of yesterday’s message by removing the hotline feature telling people how long they were likely to be on hold, Mr Andrews said: “I’m not briefed on that and I’m not necessarily directly involved in the messages people hear, pre-recorded or otherwise, when they call those hotlines.”
Paul Garvey 4.30pm: Man arrested after daring hotel quarantine escape
A 39-year-old man who allegedly escaped from his fourth storey hotel quarantine room by making a rope out of bed sheets has been arrested and charged by Western Australian police.
The man had arrived in Perth on a flight from Brisbane on Monday afternoon without a valid exemption to enter the state. He was directed to leave WA within 48 hours and was taken to a quarantine hotel in Rivervale while he awaited his return flight, but in the early hours of Tuesday morning he climbed out a window of his room using bed sheets he had tied together and fled.
He was arrested just over eight hours in Mt Lawley, 7.5km away.
The man, who has returned a negative Covid-19 test, has been charged with failure to comply with a direction and providing false/misleading information and will appear in Perth magistrates court on Tuesday.
Queensland, NSW and Victoria are all classified as medium risk under WA’s controlled border policy, meaning only people with valid exemptions are allowed to enter WA from those states.
Max Maddison 4.25pm: Hunt hits out at ‘fantasy’ on securing vaccines
Health Minister Greg Hunt has rejected the “fantasy” that the Morrison government could have done more to secure greater and earlier access to mRNA vaccines, as he claims the most important factor was ensuring domestic production.
Despite just over 10 per cent of the population having received their second dose, and less than a third of over 70-year-olds, Mr Hunt said the federal government had taken the only route available to them.
Health Minister Greg Hunt says Australia’s response to the COVID-19 pandemic is “immeasurably different” to the rest of the world as there have been fewer cases and deaths. “The scope and the scale between the rest of the world and Australia are immeasurably different and we shouldn’t lose sight of what has been achieved on an extraordinary level,” he said. Mr Hunt said there were between 30,000 and 45,000 thousand lives saved when compared to the OECD average and Britain and America respectively. Mr Hunt said with the vaccine rollout picking up speed Australia will see “there is greater protection” for the community and emphasis shifted away from case numbers. “We will increasingly focus on hospitalisation and preventing loss of life, and we recognize that as we’re seeing in parts of Europe that there is a much stronger focus not on case numbers but on loss of life.”
“One of the things I want to knock on the head is this fantasy that more could have been done earlier,” Mr Hunt told Sky News on Tuesday afternoon.
“We were able to obtain all of the early vaccinations, we added subsequently to later on in the year … but that was not available earlier.”
With the Morrison government procuring five vaccines - including AstraZeneca; the University of Queensland jab which was later abandoned; and Novavax, which won’t be available till later in the year - Mr Hunt said in an “intense global environment”, the most important quality was developing onshore vaccine capabilities.
“It was precisely because the international supply was constrained and understandably companies were producing for the country of manufacture … But we also knew that the only way to guarantee that supply was to create our own sovereign domestic manufacturing,” he said.
Rachel Baxendale 4.10pm: Victoria’s ring of steel ‘protected country’
Justifying his lockdown extension, Daniel Andrews said the stay-at-home orders would not be in place for “an hour longer” than necessary.
“This is a matter of days. The alternative is months,” the Premier said.
“We don’t want that. We’ve been there. We’ve done that. We know how hard it is. Sydney is going through that at the moment and we send our best wishes and support to them.
“I am determined to avoid that. We are all as Victorians, determined to avoid that.”
Premier Steven Marshall has announced a snap seven-day lockdown, forcing South Australia to join NSW and Victoria.
Greater Sydney has so far been locked down for 25 days, and five people have died from coronavirus in that time.
Amid Victoria’s 112-day lockdown last year, 801 people died after contracting coronavirus, 655 of whom were residents of private aged care facilities.
Asked how long Victoria would be closed to people from NSW, Mr Andrews said it was “very much dependent upon the virus numbers in Sydney” and the control measures put in place by the Berejiklian government.
“I just remind you all, we had a ring of steel around Melbourne last year and it didn’t just protect country Victoria, it protected the whole country,” Mr Andrews said.
He noted that he “had to announce” the suspension of red zone permits for people wanting to return to Victoria from NSW.
Asked whether he was calling for NSW to impose a “ring of steel” around Sydney, Mr Andrews said: “That’s entirely a matter for them. I don’t want to see more cases from Sydney.”
Joseph Lam 4.05pm: Tasmania open to essential SA travellers only
Tasmania’s move to close its border to South Australia comes after that state’s tally of five Covid-19 cases were all linked to the Delta variant.
The stage two restrictions will restrict anyone except for essential travellers from entering the state.
All of those wishing to enter, including Tasmanian residents, will need to apply for essential traveller status. Those who are not approved and do not have suitable accommodation will be required to isolate in hotel quarantine for 14 days and may be forced to pay a fee.
The move to lock South Australians out of the state follows an earlier decision to restrict residents from NSW and Victoria.
Rachel Baxendale 4pm: Andrews explains variation in test result times
Daniel Andrews has conceded that turnaround times for coronavirus test results are not uniform across Victoria, with Mildura, 540km northwest of Melbourne, representing a particular challenge.
Statewide 92.5 per cent of results are being returned within 24 hours.
“It is a little challenging because we have to fly samples out of that community and into labs,” Mr Andrews said of Mildura.
“There’s a bit of (variation) and you’ll see this in your own family, circle of friends, some people will get them back within 12-18 hours, some are closer to four hours, some are more than 24 hours since the swab was taken.
“Overall our capacity is strong and the teams are doing an amazing job. To continue to have 50 (thousand) a day pretty much and have 90 per cent plus of those coming back the next day, that’s a really strong outcome.”
Rachel Baxendale 3.50pm: Lockdown ‘cost-benefit analysis needed’
National employer association AiGroup has called for a cost benefit analysis of lockdowns and the supercharging of Australia’s vaccine rollout, as more than half of the nation’s population endures stay-at-home orders.
AiGroup chief executive Innes Willox state leaders had for too long referred to “health advice” to justify “job and life wrecking decisions” on lockdowns.
“The time has come for that advice to include a proper cost benefit analysis of lockdown decisions, including the impact of Covid lockdowns on general health, mental health, impacted business sectors and the general economy,” Mr Willox said.
“Premiers need to stand up and advise the community of their best estimate, based on a proper analysis of earlier experiences, of how many jobs will be lost and for how long, how many people will be stood down, how many businesses will have to close temporarily and permanently, how much economic activity and wealth will be lost, how many doctors appointments will be cancelled and how many extra calls to mental health services will be made as a result of their decisions.
“Until that advice becomes more transparent and includes more than health advice, doubts will continue to grow as to whether we are on the right path and confidence will be further eroded in the decisions made by state governments.”
Mr Willox said that almost 18 months into the pandemic, more than two-thirds of the nation’s economy was impacted by ongoing lockdowns with no clear end in sight.
“The simple reality is that we can’t keep going on like this,” he said. “The Prime Minister’s four-phase pathway out of COVID is well thought through but doubts are growing by the day as to whether there is any taste from the states to follow through with the plan.
“We need the vaccine roll-out to be supercharged with clearly articulated rewards for accepted and achievable targets such as the end to lockdowns and border closures.”
Mr Willox also hit out at the NSW government’s decision to shut construction “when risks are extremely minimal in an industry that is leading the way in COVID safe practices”.
“(It) surely cannot be justified by any data or proper risk assessment,” he said. “South Australia is now following suit with a construction shutdown as part of a seven-day state-wide lockdown that looks like a kneejerk response.”
Staff Reporters 3.40pm: Tasmania closes its border to South Australia
Tasmanian Premier Peter Gutwein says South Australia will be declared a “high-risk level two” from 4pm today, meaning travellers won’t be allowed in unless they’re an essential traveller.
It comes as SA prepares to enter a snap lockdown from 6pm tonight after another two local infections brought the state’s current cluster to five cases.
Border restrictions will remain in place until at least Tuesday, Mr Gutwien said.
Rachel Baxendale 3.30pm: ‘Fingers crossed’ over Queensland case
Victorian chief health officer Brett Sutton said a student in her 20s who tested positive overnight after returning to Queensland from Victoria was a known primary close contact of one of his state’s clusters.
“They’ve tested negative initially. They’ve subsequently tested positive,” Professor Sutton said.
“They were messaged from us as soon as we were aware of them as a primary close contact and that’s prompted the testing.
“Whether or not they transmit to anyone else, that’s all in Queensland Health hands.
“I’ve had some communication with the (Queensland) chief health officer ( Jeanette Young ) this morning on that and obviously we have our fingers crossed for them there’s no further transmission from that case.”
Rachel Baxendale 3.25pm: Could Victoria’s lockdown end early?
Asked whether Victoria’s extended lockdown could end earlier than midnight on Tuesday July 27, chief health officer Brett Sutton said the lockdown would be reviewed daily.
“I am sure we will come back to you over the course of the next week where you’ll ask that question every single day, and we’ll be reviewing that on a day-by-day basis,” Professor Sutton said.
He said the inclusion of regional Victoria in what is currently a statewide lockdown would similarly be reviewed “day-by-day”.
“It is fair to say detections in sewage, in Phillip Island, cases in Mildura, primary close contacts across the state, there’s a lot to play out here yet, but of course it’s under review every day,” Professor Sutton said.
Rachel Baxendale 3.20pm: Sutton tips good results after seven days
Victorian chief health officer Brett Sutton says he has a “high level of confidence” that the state will be “on top of” the current outbreaks when its lockdown is due to end seven days.
“We won’t say that after seven days there is absolutely no risk of someone being out in the community infectious, but there is a high level of confidence that we’ll be on top of it,” Professor Sutton said.
“Equally, that might come earlier or, again, there might be something from left field, a super spreading event, someone not complying, someone not discovered in the community or, indeed, another incursion into Victoria that hasn’t been detected thus far.”
Professor Sutton said he expected daily case numbers in seven days would be “absolutely in single figures”, and “that there’s a reasonable chance that we’ll have no new individuals who were out in the community during their infectious period.”
“There’s a probability that that sits within. There’s always uncertainty around that,” he said.
Professor Sutton said the end of the lockdown was not dependent on reaching zero cases, but would be based on how much time infectious cases had spent in the community.
“A person who’s out in the community for any time with this Delta variant could transmit to one person, could transmit to no people, but could transmit to 20 people. So you have to be sure that you’ve got the response around that risk,” he said.
Over the weekend Victoria’s new cases had spent an average of 1.7 or 1.8 days in the community while infectious, with that number falling to 1.5 on Monday.
“I reckon it is under one for today, given again the great majority haven’t been out in the community at all,” Professor Sutton said.
Heath Parkes-Hupton 3.10pm: Nestle factory closed over Covid case
A Nestle factory in regional NSW has closed and a worker has tested positive for Covid-19 after coming into contact with a truck driver carrying the virus.
Sky News Political Editor Andrew Clennell has revealed the Fairfield local government area, subject of the most COVID-19 cases in the country right now, also has some of the lowest vaccination numbers in the country. “At the start of July, the percentage of the over 50s in the adult population in the Fairfield LGA who had their first dose of vaccine was just 34 per cent compared to the national average of 55 per cent,” Mr Clennell said. “In Liverpool, that figure was 36 per cent, we know that’s another hotspot area. “Over 50s partial coverage is now over 60 per cent. Waverley, where the outbreak began – that covers Bondi … has a partial coverage of over 50s in the mid 60 per cent. “So, almost double that of the Fairfield area.” Local community leaders, such as Canterbury MP Sophie Cotsis, are pushing for further vaccination hubs in the area and more mobile pop-up vaccination clinics for the LGAs targeted in the outbreak.
The company’s facility in Blayney, in the state’s central west, was closed on Sunday and all staff ordered to isolate after the visit last week.
In a statement Nestle said the infected worker was “doing reasonably well” and had been in isolation.
“The person is among the small number of people identified by NSW Health as close contacts of a truck driver who tested positive following visiting the site last week,” the company said.
“All close contacts have been tested, and all have been directed to self-isolate by NSW Health. In addition, NSW Health has asked that we close the site.
“Our immediate concern since becoming aware of the possibility of contact at the site has been to protect our workers and the community.”

Rachel Baxendale 2.53pm: Change in rules for outdoor workers
The Andrews government has made minor changes to its “Authorised Premises and Authorised Worker” list, to enable people who provide services which operate solely outdoors, where physical distancing can be maintained at all times, to continue working.

Rachel Baxendale 2.42pm: ‘Immeasurable pressure’ on tourism, business
Victoria’s Tourism Industry Council said the extension of the state’s lockdown for another week had placed “immeasurable pressure” on the businesses that support the visitor economy, with the industry now “hanging on by a thread”.
VTIC CEO Felicia Mariani said operators across the industry had no financial or emotional reserves left and needed to be urgently supported.
“With Lockdown 5.0 now being extended, it’s clear that we won’t have a road to recovery without significant sustained support that lasts until widespread vaccinations can be achieved across the country at year’s end,” Ms Mariani said.
“Every overnment talks about “go hard and go fast” in shutting down this virus; we need to see the same commitment to supercharging our rate of vaccinations and supporting the industry’s survival and recovery.”
COVID-19 Australia: Cumulative vaccinations by state
“The key pain point is that current support measures only cover periods of lockdown, or in the case of the federal government, periods of regions being classified as commonwealth hotspots.
“VTIC knows from our members that the reverberations of these rolling lockdowns create economic impact that stretches well beyond the timing of the lockdown.
“Our members are telling us that it takes them four to six weeks to get their business rhythms back to pre-lockdown operations, and three months to get their trading levels back to what they were experiencing prior to any lockdown.”
Ms Mariani said the federal government’s decision to end JobKeeper was based on modelling showing Australia would achieve significant rates of vaccination by the end of March.
“Clearly that projection never materialised, and our businesses have been subjected to rolling extended lockdowns that are shattering Victoria’s and Australia’s tourism and events industry,” she said.
“With lockdowns now in three states, we must see commitment from the state and commonwealth governments to sustained levels of businesses support until we achieve heightened levels of vaccination across the country, which is not expected to occur until the last quarter of 2021.”
Victoria’s visitor economy shrunk by $21.5 billion during the period of the pandemic leading up to April 2021.
Nationally, visitor spend from both domestic and international markets has fallen from $150bn in early 2020 to $80bn currently, Ms Mariani said.
She said 660,000 direct jobs and more than a million indirect jobs were at stake nationally.
Victorian Chamber of Commerce and Industry CEO Paul Guerra said Victoria’s lockdown extension was “devastating”.
“Five days has turned into 12 days for Lockdown Five, right off the back of Lockdown Four,” Mr Guerra said.
“Businesses and workers do not have the cash or emotional reserves for further restrictions on trade and work.
“Governments need to find a way for cash to flow and correctly compensate for their losses.
“Businesses understand the need to protect public health, but they can’t keep bearing the disproportionate cost of lockdowns.”
Victorian Property Council deputy executive direction Nick Johnston said the extension of Victoria’s fifth lockdown reinforced that vaccination was the only pathway out of the pandemic.
We support measures to protect the community against what is a fast moving and ever evolving virus but lockdowns can’t be a permanent solution,” Mr Johnston said.
“Lockdowns have a devastating impact not just on Victorian business but people’s lives, and with every lockdown our economic recovery and Melbourne’s CBD takes another huge hit.
“The reality is COVID be with us for some time yet and the only way out of this crisis is for those who are eligible to be vaccinated to roll their sleeves up. With the vaccine rollout ramping up, it’s up to all of us to do what we can to future-proof our communities and workplaces against further outbreaks.
“Once we do emerge from this latest lockdown we will need to redouble efforts to reopen our city and enable people to return to their daily lives safely. This includes looking at ways to get people back to the workplace and enjoying all Victoria has to offer.”

Rachel Baxendale 2.34pm: Unlinked transmission sites cause Victorians concern
Victorian transmission sites which have not been linked to new cases on Tuesday but remain of concern to authorities include:
- The Crafty Squire hotel in Melbourne’s CBD, as more than 400 soccer fans watched the Euro final in the early hours of Monday July 12. In their midst was the Trinity Grammar teacher who had contracted the virus at the MCG just 36 hours earlier. One positive case, which was in Monday’s numbers, has so far been linked to this venue. Of 450 primary close contacts, almost 75 per cent have returned negative test results.
- AAMI Park, where the Trinity Grammar teacher transmitted the virus to at least three others on the evening of Tuesday July 13. More than 50 per cent of 2,100 primary close contacts have tested negative.
- Mildura, 540km from Melbourne, in Victoria’s northwest. A positive case was detected there on Sunday in a person who was at the MCG on July 10. A household contact of this person, who also attended the game, subsequently tested positive on Monday.
Rachel Baxendale 2.08pm: Where Victoria’s latest cases lie
Of Victoria’s 13 new cases on Tuesday:
- Seven are linked to the Ms Frankie restaurant in Cremorne in Melbourne’s inner east. This cluster was sparked by a Trinity Grammar teacher who caught the virus at the MCG on July 10 and transmitted it to other people at the Crafty Squire Hotel and Trinity Grammar on July 12, and Ms Frankie and AAMI Park on July 13. Of Tuesday’s seven cases linked to Ms Frankie, three are staff, two are patrons, and three are further household primary close contacts. This brings the total number of transmissions linked to Ms Frankie to 19, including six staff members, 11 patrons and two household contacts. Of the 19, 18 were in the venue on either Tuesday or Thursday last week. There are 840 primary close contacts associated with this cluster, 69 per cent of whom have returned a negative test result.
- Two are linked to Trinity Grammar in Kew, in Melbourne’s east. One is a staff member and one is a student at nearby Ruyton Girls’ School. This brings the total number of transmissions linked to Trinity Grammar to nine, including five staff members, three Trinity students, and the Ruyton student. There are 2,500 staff and students in isolation, two thirds of whom have returned a negative test result.
- Two are household contacts linked to the MCG. These people share a household with a person who was at the MCG on July 10. There are now 14 cases associated with the MCG, nine of whom attended the Geelong vs Carlton match on July 10. There are 3,800 primary close contacts associated with the MCG, just over half of whom have returned a negative test result.
- One is a member of a group of six who spent three days on Phillip Island with a person who caught the virus at the MCG. Five members of this group have now tested positive, but the cluster is yet to spread beyond the group. However, Victorian Covid-19 logistics chief Jeroen Weimar said coronavirus fragments had been detected in wastewater on Phillip Island. There are 700 primary close contacts linked to the Phillip Island group, some of whom are on the island. Of these, 43 per cent have so far returned a negative test result.
- One is a woman in her 20s from Roxburgh Park in Melbourne’s outer north. This case is under investigation and yet to be linked to Melbourne’s two current outbreaks, one of which was sparked by three Sydney removalists and spread to the MCG, and the other of which stems from a family in the City of Hume in Melbourne’s northern suburbs, who breached home quarantine soon after returning from Sydney.
“We are working through her connections at this moment in time,” Mr Weimar said of the Roxburgh Park woman.
“We have very strong indications that she’s connected to the City of Hume outbreak.”
Mr Weimar said coronavirus fragments had been detected in wastewater from Roxburgh Park overnight, and urged anyone in the Roxburgh Park or Coolaroo area who had “any symptoms whatsoever or reasons to be concerned” to get tested immediately.
There are 11 cases associated with the City of Hume outbreak if the Roxburgh Park woman is included. There are 280 primary close contacts linked to these people, 70 per cent of whom have returned a negative test result. The Health Department is expecting to hold virtual community meetings with communities in the northern suburbs tonight and over coming days.

Max Maddison 2.03pm: Nearly 1m vaccines administered in past week
Australia’s vaccination rollout has begun to gather pace, with Health Minister Greg Hunt revealing that almost one million vaccinations took place within one week, as he flags a pending decision on whether South Australia is included as a commonwealth hotspot.
With 975,716 vaccinations taking place around Australia within one week, Mr Hunt said it was an “immensely important step”, as a symbol and in terms of “practical protection on a mass scale”.
Almost 10.3 million vaccinations have now taken place, with 2.9 million people fully vaccinated, and 7.3 million,or 35.7 per cent
of the population, who have received their first jab.
While the country was enduring “challenging days” he said there were “real signs of hope”, as he contrasted the situation in NSW with the second wave outbreak in Melbourne.
Vaccine doses rollout across age groups
“The difference now is that New South Wales has stabilised. That is the most important real sign of hope in Australia today. There’s more work to do, as the premier said, today, with regards to the infectious cases in the community. They are stable,” Mr Hunt told a press conference on Tuesday afternoon.
He also highlighted the vast discrepancy between flu cases which are generally diagnosed in an average year and 2021, saying it was an “important byproduct” of the measures being taken by state and federal governments.
“That in an average year, over the last five years, at this stage, we would have had 53,000 diagnosed flu cases and 157 lives lost,” he said. “At this point there have been 408 cases diagnosed of influenza in Australia, and zero lives lost.”
Chief Medical Officer Paul Kelly will be meeting with South Australian chief health officer Nicola Spurrier on Tuesday afternoon to consider whether the state was included as a Commonwealth defined hot spot, Mr Hunt said.

Anton Nilsson 1.54pm: Town 400km from Sydney on virus alert
A positive coronavirus case has been discovered in the rural NSW town of Cootamundra.
The Murrumbidgee Local Health District said the person visited a private residence in the town on July 16 and that they had subsequently tested positive.
Household members have been identified as close contacts, and those people are in self-isolation and have been tested.
“No community risk has been identified at this time,” the local health district said in a statement.
A mobile testing clinic was set up at the Cootamundra Showground at 47 Pinkerton Road and will be open between 10am and 4pm.
People were urged to call ahead on 1800-831-099 to pre-register for an appointment. Walk-ins were also possible.
There were three possible exposure sites identified in the area.
Anyone who has been at the following places at the relevant times will be considered a close contact and should get tested immediately and self-isolate for 14 days:
Gundagai Shell Coles Express, Thursday 8 July between 1.00am and 1.30am
Jindera Shell, Saturday 10 July between 11.15am and 11.45am
Hay Shell Roadhouse, Saturday 10 July between 7.30am – 8.00am

Nicholas Jensen 1.11pm: Alert for 2500 residents of inner city development
Thousands of residents at Sydney Park Village in Erskineville have now been deemed casual contacts after a positive case reportedly attended the property on Saturday morning.
More than 2500 residents will now be forced to get tested and self-isolate until a negative result is returned.
It is also understood specific locations within the complex have been named as “close contact” sites by NSW Health.
In response to the state’s unfolding Delta outbreak, more than 62,000 residents were tested for the virus in the last 24 hours.

Nicholas Jensen 12.31pm: South Australia to enter snap lockdown
South Australia will enter a snap lockdown from 6pm tonight after health officials recorded another two local infections of Covid-19, bringing the state’s current cluster to five cases.
Premier Steven Marshall said the lockdown will last “for at least seven days”, while confirming the outbreak was the Delta strain.
NED-4117-South-Australias-New-Covid-19-Restrictions
“We’re extremely concerned about developments this morning, we now have a fourth and a fifth case to report”
The fourth case was one of the 16 close contacts announced by SA Health yesterday, while a fifth case was detected in a patron at a Greek restaurant on Halifax Street.
Mr Marshall said “we have no alternative but to impose some fairly heavy immediate restrictions to take effect from 6pm tonight … South Australia moves into lockdown, there will now be just five reasons why people can leave their home”.
Medical reasons including vaccination and testing
Purchase of essential goods, such as a food
Care and compassion reasons
Essential work
Exercise limited to those from the same household
The South Australian government will close schools across the state from tomorrow and impose a pause on construction work and elective surgery.
Mr Marshall said there will be no intimate partner exemption during the lockdown.
“We’ve moved very quickly, very decisively to stop the spread, every single day that you let this go, you put yourself in a more difficult situation to bring it back under control...
“It will certainly slow and put a stop to this variance breeding any further but it’s only going to happen with the cooperation of all South Australians, we’ve got to stop movement around this state, and we’ve got to stop it immediately.
“We hate putting those restrictions in place but we believe we have just one chance, one chance to get this right.”

Paul Garvey 12.25pm: WA tightens border as SA records new case
Western Australia has tightened its border with South Australia in light of Adelaide’s latest Covid-19 outbreak.
People who enter in WA from SA will now need to self-quarantine for 14 days upon arrival, effective immediately.
WA has already shut itself off from NSW, Victoria and Queensland, with only those who have been granted exemptions able to enter WA from those states.
Tasmania and the Northern Territory are now the only jurisdictions open to unencumbered travel to WA.
In a statement, WA premier Mark McGowan said the state’s controlled border had been instrumental to keeping the community safe.
“These changes will no doubt be disruptive and cause frustration but we need to do everything necessary to lock out this virus, especially when there are numerous Delta variant outbreaks on the eastern seaboard,” he said.
“I urge any Western Australian that has recently travelled to South Australia to come home immediately - as the hard border may need to return if the situation escalates further.”
Rachel Baxendale 12.22pm: Victoria ‘going in the right direction’
Victorian chief health officer Brett Sutton said that of Tuesday’s 13 new cases, nine had been in isolation during their entire infectious periods, with the activities of the remaining four “very substantially limited” due to the lockdown.
While 12 of the 13 cases have been linked to known outbreaks, the source of the remaining case is under investigation.
“I can’t say yet whether we are ahead of this thing, but I do know that our contact tracers, our health team, Public Health Units, are wrapping their arms around it and it is going in the right direction,” Professor Sutton said.
He said the rapid rate of transmission, which has seen people acquire and transmit the virus in as little as 36 hours, underscored the need to remain in lockdown.
“To lift restrictions now on another day of new cases who have had some time in the community, and double figures of cases, before we have fully wrapped ourselves around this outbreak, while we are still seeing curve balls of cases potentially not yet linked, will put all of the sacrifices of Victorians at risk and make it all for nought,” Professor Sutton said.
“We do not want that to happen. It is too early today to lift restrictions.”
Professor Sutton also pointed to the spread of the outbreak across the regions, from Phillip Island, 140km southeast of Melbourne, to Mildura, 540km northwest.
“We have seen significant and stand-alone outbreaks in regional areas in Phillip Island, in Bacchus Marsh, Barwon Heads and as far away as Mildura,” he said.
“Around a third of all of our primary close contacts are right across regional Victoria.
“Much of that is due to the super-spreading events early on in this outbreak that took place in the MCC members’ reserve for the Geelong v Carlton game.”
Spread of primary close contacts and red zone arrivals across Victoria
Professor Sutton pointed to five deaths in Sydney in highlighting the risk posed by the Delta coronavirus cluster in Victoria.
The NSW deaths include that of a woman in her 50s who is the mother of two removalists who have been charged over allegedly knowingly travelling around regional NSW while infected.
“(The lockdown) is a significant sacrifice, but a really important one that is going to protect all of us from potential further transmission and serious illness,” Professor Sutton said.
“There have been multiple deaths now with this Delta variant, including five in Sydney’s outbreak.
“We could have real and awful consequences if transmission were to continue to occur in Melbourne.”
Victorian Covid-19 logistics chief Jeroen Weimar said three of Victoria’s 85 active cases had been hospitalised, but none were in intensive care.
He said 92.5 per cent of test results were being returned within 24 hours.
Nicholas Jensen 12.15pm: NSW number infectious in community corrected to 21
NSW Health has clarified some of this morning’s figures quoted at the premier’s daily press conference, after confirming the state recorded 78 cases of local transmission.
Of the 78 cases, NSW Health says 37 were in isolation throughout their infectious period, eight cases were in isolation for part of their infectious period and 21 cases were infectious in the community.
New South Wales Chief Health Officer Dr Kerry Chant says the responsibility for minimising the risk of COVID-19 transmission now falls on workplaces after the state recorded 78 new cases. Dr Chant said residents must ”reduce the opportunities for anyone to come into contact with anyone else”. “That responsibility is now firmly on workplaces to take those actions and clearly we have seen the closure of a number of workplaces which facilitates that as well,” she said. “Now is the time to really ensure that everyone complies with the spirit and intent. And the spirit and intent of the public health orders is to reduce mobility.” Dr Chant also said there is an “emerging risk” within the area of Canterbury-Bankstown the number of exposure sites growing in the suburbs of Belmore, Lakemba, Punchbowl and Yagoona.
Health officials have confirmed the isolation status of 12 cases remains under investigation.
There have been 1418 locally acquired cases reported since 16 June, when the first case in the Bondi cluster was detected.
There are currently 95 COVID-19 cases admitted to hospital, with 27 people in intensive care, 11 of whom require ventilation.
Rachel Baxendale 12.11pm: Andrews flags more support for business
Victorian Premier Daniel Andrews said further announcements would be made on Wednesday in relation to support for businesses forced to close due to the lockdown.
“I can confirm for you that more than 90,000 businesses have had payments made to them already,” Mr Andrews said.
Victorian Chief Health Officer Professor Brett Sutton says it is still "too early” to lift restrictions in the state as doing so will “put all of the sacrifices of Victorians at risk” after the state recorded 13 new cases. “To lift restrictions now on another day of new cases who have had some time in the community … while we are still seeing curveballs of cases potentially not yet linked, will put all of the sacrifices of Victorians at risk,” Professor Sutton said. He said there have been “significant and stand-alone outbreaks” in regional areas which has prompted concern. “Around a third of all of our primary close contacts are in regional Victoria, right across regional Victoria. “This outbreak has touched the whole state and that was in a way that the Delta and Kappa outbreaks didn't do back in May and June."
He noted that the payments had been based on qualification for business support during last month’s lockdown, meaning the payments have been made automatically, without those who qualified last time needing to apply again.
However, tens of thousands of businesses who did not qualify last time have been struggling to find out why, and were yesterday greeted with a recorded message on the Business Victoria hotline telling them they could expect to be on hold for at least 17 hours.
“We will have more to say about further payments and further support, because there will be more pain because the lockdown is longer than we had first hoped,” Mr Andrews said.
“That will be very soon, as soon as tomorrow morning, the (Industry Recovery & Support) Minister (Martin Pakula) will take you through that.
“Again, that won’t require people to fill forms in.”
Rachel Baxendale 11.59am: Victorians need exemption to return from NSW
Victoria is suspending the issuing of NSW red zone permits for at least a fortnight from midnight on Tuesday in light of Sydney’s uncontained Covid outbreak.
This means Victorians seeking to return home from NSW will not be able to enter Victoria without an exemption.
About 21,000 people have returned to Victoria from NSW on red and orange zone permits since Sydney’s Bondi cluster emerged last month, of whom about 11,000 are still completing their fortnight in home quarantine.
“For weeks we have been saying to people from Victoria who are in Sydney and now in broader New South Wales, not the bubble, but beyond that border bubble, we have been saying come home, come home because the rules may change. Well the rules are changing today,” Premier Daniel Andrews said.
Victoria Premier Daniel Andrews says there will be changes to red zone permits in the state and the only ones able to come from an interstate red zone will be authorised workers or on compassionate grounds. “For four weeks, we have been saying to people from Victoria who are in Sydney and now in broader New South Wales, not the bubble but beyond the border bubble, we have been saying come home, come home because the rules may change,” he said. Mr Andrews said the only people who will receive travel permits are “authorised workers and those who apply for and get a compassionate exemption” to the new rules and banned red zone travel for two weeks. “What I cannot have happen is hundreds and hundreds of people who were warned weeks ago to get back here who have not done that.” “I can’t keep having hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of Victorians coming back to Victoria while the situation further deteriorates and we see more and more cases.”
“I can’t be having hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of Victorians coming back to Victoria while the situation further deteriorates and we see more and more cases, hundreds of cases in Sydney and we get this outbreak under control and then with finish up with another incursion brewing. I don’t want that to happen.
“For this reason, the chief health officer will temporarily pause the issuing of red zone permits from 11:59pm on Tuesday 20 July – pending a further review in a fortnight.”
For at least the next two weeks, Victorian residents in red zones will require an exemption to enter the state – and these will only be granted in exceptional circumstances.
“There will be exemptions on compassionate grounds if you had a loved one that was unwell or you yourself needed medical care,” Mr Andrews said.
“However, he warned those applying for compassionate exemptions to “be patient”.
“That is not a quick process and that is by virtue of the fact it takes into account every circumstance, which is what I think anyone seeking an exemption would want. That means it takes time,” he said.
If people enter Victoria from New South Wales without an exemption, they will be put on a return flight or placed in 14 days mandatory hotel quarantine.
Fines of $5452 may be imposed if a person is found to have entered Victoria from a red zone without a permit.
A person will still be able to enter Victoria from a red zone if they are aircrew, listed on the Specified Worker List, or transiting through Victoria to another jurisdiction – e.g. traveling from regional NSW through Mildura to get home to South Australia.
Mr Andrews said Victoria chief health officer Brett Sutton would continue to consider the status of the ACT, but the pause on red zone permits would also apply to that jurisdiction while it is classified as a red zone.
There are no changes to the current arrangements for border communities.

Rachel Baxendale 11.45am: On-site learning resumes for disability students
From Wednesday July 21, some students with a disability will be permitted to return to on-site learning, despite Victoria’s lockdown extension.
Victoria Premier Daniel Andrews says there will be changes to red zone permits in the state and the only ones able to come from an interstate red zone will be authorised workers or on compassionate grounds. “For four weeks, we have been saying to people from Victoria who are in Sydney and now in broader New South Wales, not the bubble but beyond the border bubble, we have been saying come home, come home because the rules may change,” he said. Mr Andrews said the only people who will receive travel permits are “authorised workers and those who apply for and get a compassionate exemption” to the new rules and banned red zone travel for two weeks. “What I cannot have happen is hundreds and hundreds of people who were warned weeks ago to get back here who have not done that.” “I can’t keep having hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of Victorians coming back to Victoria while the situation further deteriorates and we see more and more cases.”
Where a parent or carer indicates that a student with a disability cannot learn from home due to vulnerability or family stress, the school must provide on-site learning for that student.
The change will apply to students enrolled in specialist schools and students with a disability enrolled in mainstream schools.
“We know for some families of kids that have got special needs, educating at homes, home schooling is incredibly difficult,” Premier Daniel Andrews said.
“Where that is causing real hardship then schools will be open for those kids.”

Rachel Baxendale 11.40am: Victoria getting most test results in 24 hours
Victorian Premier Daniel Andrews said 49,454 tests had been processed in the 24 hours to Tuesday, with 90 per cent of results returned within 24 hours of people being tested.
There are now 85 cases linked to the two NSW incursions which emerged just over a week ago, with 18,000 primary close contacts linked to those cases.
Rachel Baxendale 11.35am: ‘Promising news’ among Victoria cases
Premier Daniel Andrews said nine of Tuesday’s new cases had been in isolation for the entirety of their infectious period.
“So they were tucked away, away from others, no risk to public health. That is very, very promising,” he said. “We hope that continues and develops as a trend.
New daily cases in Victoria, from July 10, 2021
“That is really how we will know that we have brought this under control and we don’t have that residual risk of it running again, of it flaring up once we open up. We just can’t run that risk.
Mr Andrews said Victoria’s progress in quashing the current outbreaks had been “promising” and the state had avoided “a New South Wales-style long, lengthy, very challenging lockdown, where you just lose control of cases”.
He did not make reference to Victoria’s 112-day lockdown last year.
“But, we need more time,” Mr Andrews said. “That is why on the advice of the chief health officer we will extend these lockdowns for a further seven days.
“We are all going to work very, very hard to have Victoria begin the process of opening up at midnight next Tuesday, the 27th of July, so seven days from midnight tonight.
“We wish we could bring this in earlier, but we can’t run the risk that there are cases out there that we don’t know about.
“We need to avoid what is going on in Sydney at the moment.
Mr Andrews pointed to several “superspreader” events which have seen large numbers of transmissions, some of which have occurred between strangers at large sporting events.
“Some of those stranger-to-stranger infections and the speed with which this has moved through the Victorian community confirms that we did the right thing to lock down and it sadly confirms that we need more time,” he said.
Nicholas Jensen 11.30am: NSW health chief warns of ‘emerging risk’
Dr Kerry Chant said there was an “emerging risk” in the Canterbury Bankstown LGA, asking residents to reduce their contact with others and follow the stay-at-home orders at all times.
She also called on residents in Hurstville, Kogarah, Guildford and Greystanes to come forward for urgent testing, saying NSW Health was yet to “crack and break” the chain of transmission.
“We are finding unlinked cases in other areas and that means there are changes of transmission we must address,” Dr Chant said.
NSW Health says the state continues to ramp-up testing capacity with a private pathology in Sydney to ensure fast turnaround times are maintained.
Despite lagging vaccine supply, Dr Chant said patients should continue to seek out available jabs whenever and wherever they can.
“We haven’t got enough vaccine at the moment, but we have got some vaccine which is accessible and I would urge everyone to go forward for your second dose of AstraZeneca or also your first dose or if you are eligible.”
Health Minister Brad Hazzard also urged the public to reject anti-vaxxers in the community and embrace the national rollout effort.
Regarding the rollout of the vaccines, Mr Hazzard said: “We know the (federal) government has now brought online more GPs to distribute the vaccine. That means that you have the capacity to hopefully ring a GP in your area, preferably your own GP, and get your vaccine.”
“Anti-vaxxers obviously live in another universe and give messages that this virus isn’t dangerous … This virus is an extremely transmissible virus. It can kill you and it can kill your family and your friends.”
Deputy Police Commissioner Gary Worboys confirmed 100 penalty notices issued in NSW.
One incident included a birthday gathering in an office in Sydney’s CBD, which involved seven people.
Rachel Baxendale 11.21am: Victorian lockdown extended another week
Victoria’s “five day” lockdown will be extended by another seven days to 11:59pm next Tuesday July 27.
Premier Daniel Andrews ’ lockdown extension comes after the state recorded 13 new cases in the 24 hours to Tuesday, 12 of which have been linked to current outbreaks and one of which is under investigation.
Nicholas Jensen 11.02am: NSW records 78 new cases, 27 infectious in community
NSW has recorded 78 local cases of Covid-19 in the last 24 hours, with 27 of those infectious in the community.
More than 63,000 tests were recorded across NSW.
New daily cases in New South Wales
Premier Gladys Berejiklian said “I want to say a big thank you to those living in the Fairfield local government area. We have noticed a significant increase in testing in that community and today, in particular, we want to encourage people living in the Canterbury Bankstown local government area to please come forward.”
Ms Berejiklian urged residents to continue to get testing, particularly in workplaces across south western Sydney, where the majority of cases have been detected.
Chief health officer Kerry Chant said the death of a 50 year old woman yesterday shows that “Covid is a very serious disease. We are seeing more hospitalisations, more admissions to ICU, more people on ventilators and we have to stop the spread”.
“Now is the time to ensure everyone complies with the spirit and intent of the public health orders.”
Dr Chant stressed health authorities were also working to re-open the construction industry as soon as possible.
“I want to stress the government is working very hard with communities to make sure construction can go back to work safely after July 30, and we will be having more say about that in the coming days.”
Rachel Baxendale 10.36am: Victorian leaders to deliver update at 11.15am
Victorian Premier Daniel Andrews , Health Minister Martin Foley and chief health officer Brett Sutton are due to address the media at 11:15am.
The press conference comes after Mr Andrews on Monday promised to let Victorians know on Tuesday how much longer they will be confined in their homes under what was initially a five day lockdown.
The extension is expected to be at least five days to Sunday night, and could be as long as seven, according to sources familiar with the deliberations.
Nicholas Jensen 10.17am: Melbourne outbreak hits Queensland
Queensland Health has recorded one new locally acquired case of Covid-19 in the last 24 hours, after a woman from Mareeba in her 20s, who attended an exposure site in Melbourne, tested positive for the virus. The case is unrelated to any of the state’s existing outbreaks.
The woman, who was fully vaccinated, travelled from Melbourne to Maroochydore on July 13, and received a text from Victorian health officials on July 15 saying she had visited a close contact site on July 10.
Acting Premier Steven Miles said the woman had been infectious in the community from July 15 to July 17, especially in the Sunshine Coast.
Mr Miles urged Queenslanders in southern states to return home: “Now is not the time to be holidaying inter state,” he said.
Queensland chief health office Jeannette Young said: “I strongly recommend that people holiday in Queensland, that they don’t go interstate for holidays … Please holiday in Queensland. We don’t know where the next case might be.”

Rachel Baxendale 9.40am: How the virus has spread across Victoria from NSW
Graphics released by Victoria’s Department of Health on Monday show the statewide spread of primary close contacts and recent returnees from NSW red zones.
As of Monday, 11 of 72 cases linked to the current outbreaks lived in regional Victoria, with almost a third, or 5177 of 15,800 primary close contacts residing in the regions.
Exposure sites extend from Phillip Island, 140km southeast of Melbourne to Mildura, 540km northwest, with the homes of close contacts scattered even further afield, from Warrnambool in the far southwest, to Wodonga in the northeast, and far east Gippsland.
This largely results from exposures at major sporting events, including the July 10 Geelong vs Carlton AFL match at the MCG and the July 12 Wallabies vs France rugby union clash at AAMI Park.
The spread of cases, exposures and primary close contacts across regional Victoria means the state’s extended lockdown is expected to remain statewide.

Rachel Baxendale 9.18am: Victoria records 13 new virus cases
Victoria has recorded 13 new coronavirus cases in the 24 hours to Tuesday, including one case which is yet to be linked to current outbreaks.
Tuesday’s new cases include four cases made public on Monday, all of which are in people who were in isolation for the duration of their infectious period according to health officials.
Tuesday’s 13 cases follow 13 on Monday, 16 on Sunday, 19 on Saturday, 10 on each of Thursday and Friday, one last Wednesday and three including a NSW-acquired one last Tuesday, and bring the total number of community acquired cases since two incursions from NSW emerged just over a week ago to 85.
“Of the 13 new locally-acquired cases, 12 have been linked to the current outbreaks and one is under investigation,” Victoria’s Health Department tweeted regarding Tuesday’s numbers.
There were also two overseas acquired cases detected in hotel quarantine in the past 24 hours, bringing the total number of active cases in Victoria to 96, including 11 acquired overseas.
The latest cases come after 49,454 tests were processed on Monday, down from 54,839 on Sunday and 53,283 on Saturday.
These numbers compare with Victoria’s June 2 record of 57,519 tests processed.
Nicholas Jensen 9.11am: SA Premier says state recorded a new case
South Australian Premier Steven Marshall has confirmed a fourth positive case of Covid-19 from overnight, as new restrictions came into effect across the state on Tuesday.
The Premier told Adelaide radio station FiveAA that the new case was a close contact of the man in his 80s who tested positive on Monday, saying he would provide a more detailed update at his press conference today.
Mr Marshall announced that more testing sites would open on Thursday, with additional health staff deployed to help reduce long waiting times.
The new restrictions that came into force on Tuesday include private gatherings capped at ten people, masks on public transport and changes to social distancing rules.

Nicholas Jensen 8.53am: Formula behind when NSW can lift restrictions
Modelling conducted at University of Melbourne suggests NSW will not be in position to lift its lockdown restrictions until the end of August, as contact tracers struggle to keep up with the spread of the Delta variant.
Epidemiologist Tony Blakely , who led the modelling research, told ABC RN that NSW must reach at least five cases per day in order to lift its current lockdown setting.
The Australian's Steve Waterson says the governments are "ramping up the fear" when a decent, responsible government would be trying to calm people down. "I was looking today at the latest official figures on how many tests we've had in Australia and they're just about hit 23 million," he told Sky News hoist Chris Kenny. "So you're looking at $2.3 billion of tests so far to produce tiny number of cases. "Even when we have the cases called out we're not told how sick they are. We're told that people are infectious in the community but what that suggests to me is that they don't know they have it. "This suggests to me that the cases are simply positive tests but not sicknesses – and I would like to know that and I think we're entitled to know that. "I think it's irresponsible scaremongering."
“We think that the number to watch is when it gets to about five cases per day,” Professor Blakely said. “When you get to about five cases per day you would assume all cases are occurring in isolation, so you can begin to relax your restrictions”.
Professor Blakely said the modelling shows that if NSW stayed in “soft lockdown” or “stage three lockdown”, the expected number of weeks would have been between eight to 14 weeks.”
“The benefit of doing it the hard way, with a hard lockdown, is that we have less uncertainty about numbers and can better predict when the lockdown will end.”

Adeshola Ore 8.41am: Defiant Hopkins’ final jibe as she’s deported
Divisive British TV personality Katie Hopkins couldn’t resist one last jibe at Australia, as she is deported for flouting the country’s quarantine rules.
Hopkins departed Sydney Airport on Monday afternoon after her visa was cancelled over the breach and as NSW police confirmed the 46-year-old was issued a $1000 fine for not wearing a mask on Sunday – a breach of the state’s public health orders.
But a defiant Hopkins posted a picture of herself in an empty business class cabin on Instagram, claiming: “You may ‘deport’ the Hopkins. But you cannot silence the truth”.
Telling her followers she would “see them in the morning,” she added: “We will fight to TAKE BACK our freedoms.”
The post, which has since disappeared from her public page, followed shortly after the far right commentator uploaded a “how to survive a media sh*t storm” guide, telling her “lovelies” not to be cowed, as the “fight for freedom” was a “fight for our children’s future”.
Hopkins was dumped as a member of Seven’s Big Brother program at the weekend after she streamed a video describing Covid-19 lockdowns as “the greatest hoax in human history” and boasting about breaching quarantine rules.
Home Affairs Minister Karen Andrews labelled Hopkins’s behaviour “shameful” and a “slap in the face” to millions of Aus­tralians in lockdown.

Rachel Baxendale 8.27am: Crisis cabinet meets to weigh Victoria’s fate
Victoria’s crisis council of cabinet is meeting at 9am, with the full cabinet due to meet at 10 to discuss the length of the state’s lockdown extension.
Victoria’s lockdown could be extended for at least five days and possibly even a week, according to reports. The state’s fifth lockdown was scheduled to only last for five days but on Monday authorities announced it would be extended following a number of super spreading events. At least four cases will be included in today’s numbers after they were announced during Monday’s media conference, but the number is expected to be far higher. There are now more than 300 exposure sites across the state and 21,000 close contacts.
A final decision was yet to be made when government and health officials met on Monday night, but sources familiar with the deliberations said the most likely outcome would be a five day extension to midnight on Sunday.

Nicholas Jensen 8.22am: Stay home or difficult decisions await: AMA
Australian Medical Association president Omar Khorshid has warned Sydneysiders to obey stay-at-home orders at all costs, saying this week’s results will show whether the government’s current restrictions are working or if a stricter raft of measures will be needed to stem the spread of the Delta variant.
“The lockdown hasn’t worked yet, not in terms of dropping the numbers,” Dr Kohrshid told Seven’s Sunrise. “The next week or so will be absolutely critical to see whether these current more harsh restrictions are working, or if they are not.”
NED-3760-NSW’s new COVID restrictions
“Sydney either has to do something really dramatic in order to stop the spread or work out what other permanent settings will need to be put in place in order to protect people as best as possible.”
“Sydneysiders need to be prepared for the possibility that if we are still seeing that 100 cases a day – 20 or 30 people out in the community – by the end of this week … the government will have a difficult decision to make about what is the next step.”
Dr Khorshid said lockdown sceptics need only “look to the UK, where they are seeing 50,000 cases or more everyday”, adding that those numbers in Australia would result in “many people dying” because of the country’s vaccine shortage.
“Anyone calling for an end to the lockdown needs to think about what the human cost of that will be in terms of hospitalisations and deaths directly as a result of stopping the lockdown too early.”

Anton Nilsson 8.11am: Removalists in mourning after mum‘s death
A Sydney woman who became the city’s fifth person to die from Covid-19 during the latest outbreak has been mourned by her family and community on social media.
The woman, aged in her 50s, was the mother of twin removalists who have been charged for allegedly working while infectious with coronavirus.
One of the twins honoured the woman in a Facebook post reading: “Mama, my love, you are my life, Mama, you are my comfort and my life, Mama.”
The other changed his profile picture to an image of his mother, which drew hundreds of comments from people praying for the woman.
A woman in her 50s who was a confirmed COVID-19 case was this morning found dead in her Green Valley home in Sydney's South West. NSW Health are recording the fatality as the fifth death linked to the current Bondi outbreak. There are multiple reports the woman was the mother of two Sydney removalists who tested positive to COVID in recent days, but authorities are yet to confirm those details. Police are on the scene in Personal Protective Equipment investigating the fatality. The woman is now the youngest death of this outbreak, with the previous four victims aged above 70.
The woman’s congregation, based in Fairfield, posted a tribute to the woman as well.
NSW Police said in a statement officers responded to a concern for welfare at a home on Thursday Place, Green Valley, at 9.15am on Monday where they found the body of a woman in her 50s.
NSW Health confirmed the woman was positive for Covid-19 and was a close contact of another case.
“NSW Health today sadly reports the death of a woman in her 50s who was a confirmed Covid-19 case. She was a resident of southwestern Sydney and a close contact of a Covid case,” the department said.
“This is the 61st death in NSW related to Covid-19 and the fifth of the current outbreak.
“NSW Health extends its sincere sympathy to her family and friends.”

Nicholas Jensen 7.57am: Construction the ‘engine room of NSW economy’
Master Builders Australia chief executive Denita Wawn has warned the NSW government against its decision to halt all construction work until July 30, saying the industry could have remained open as it had during previous lockdowns.
“We’re the engine room of the economy in NSW,” Ms Wawn told the ABC this morning. “We know we’ve been able to work safely through previous lockdowns nationwide, not only last year, but also in places like Victoria.”
Sky News host Alan Jones says construction is not an industry that can be "turned on and off". "It's already been smashed, and there's a domino effect," Mr Jones said. "There are carpenters, sparkies, plumbers, gyprockers, and landscapers. These decisions can only be taken by people who know nothing about business, who have never filled out a payroll tax slip". It comes as the construction industry has been shut down across Greater Sydney for a period of two weeks, in a bid to stem the spread of COVID-19 across the state. Mr Jones said New South Wales Premier Gladys Berejiklian "demonstrates daily how out of touch she is". A tiler from Sydney, Josh Young, spoke to Mr Jones about the impacts the latest restrictions and shutdown are having. "This is doing my head in," Mr Young said.
Ms Wawn said she was aware the NSW government was concerned about the spread of the virus across multiple construction sites in Sydney’s southwest, but said officials did not give the industry enough time to readapt before the ban.
“We ran a big campaign last year about ensuring that our members could work safely and we did so.”
“We were surprised it’s been a total lockdown because we believe we can work with the government to ensure we can return to work as soon as possible,” she said.
While “sympathetic” to the state’s current “health concerns”, Ms Wawn said she disagreed with the two week construction ban.
“We’ve got to be cognisant that 90 per cent of the industry are small businesses. Many of them are self-employed. The concern we’ve got is not only the two-week shutdown but the flow on impacts in terms of being able to restart.”

Nicholas Jensen 6.50am: No end date for NSW resrictions
With Premier Daniel Andrews poised to extend lockdown restrictions in Victoria beyond Tuesday, contact tracers across the border in NSW continue to battle the spread of the virulent Delta strain as the state’s list of exposure sites continue to swell.
On Monday, NSW Health recorded 98 locally acquired infections, with 20 cases out in the community while infectious. More than two-thirds of cases were recorded in south-western Sydney.
At Monday’s press conference Premier Gladys Berejiklian said she was “not willing to give an end date” to stay-at-home restrictions until she received more data.
“We know the Delta variant is nothing like we have seen … We know how challenging it is but we wouldn’t have thrown everything at it if we didn’t have a chance of quashing it,” she said.
Chief health officer Kerry Chant said the “areas of concern” have moved well beyond central Sydney and the western suburbs, as health authorities issued alerts for residents in Parkes, Blayney, Coffs Harbour and Wollongong.
Victoria Chief Health Officer Brett Sutton told reporters on Monday that Victorian public health authorities had seen modelling suggesting Covid-19 may be circulating in NSW for months.
“That means it might be an ongoing risk north of Victoria for weeks or months to come,” said Professor Sutton”.

Joseph Lam 6.30am: Victoria to find out today when lockdown ends
Victorians will find out today when their fifth lockdown will end after Daniel Andrews extended it yesterday.
Mr Andrews said restrictions from Wednesday will depend on interviews with primary close contacts of identified Covid-19 cases which will be carried out on Monday.
“We will not be ready to lift this lockdown at midnight tomorrow,” Mr Andrews said.
“We have made great progress. We have avoided thousands of cases,” he said.
“This is by no means over. Think about it like a fire, we have a containment line. If it’s smouldering it will… take off again.”
There were 13 new locally acquired cases of Covid-19 in the state on Monday.
All are linked to the current outbreak.

Trees stood like alpine ghosts in the aftermath of a blizzard that covered everything in white and sprinkled the mountain with fresh powder.
With the empty chairlifts disappearing into the winter fog and with Covid-19 restrictions in place in Sydney and Melbourne, Ms Anton and Ms McMaster, 19, could have been excused for thinking they had the mountain to themselves.
“It’s half capacity... There’s no waiting for food here, there are no lines on the chair lifts and there are not many beginners this year,” said Ms Anton, who is planning to drive down every weekend she has off work while the slopes are empty.

Yoni Bashan 6.00am: Delta danger: no freedom until kids get vaccinated
Health authorities are warning that the dangers of the Covid-19 Delta variant will require a rethink of whether restrictions can be ­permanently relaxed once the adult population is largely ­vaccinated.
That warning – which would require the national vaccine program to extend to children before a return to pre-pandemic settings – came as NSW recorded 98 new Covid-19 cases and Victoria abandoned plans to lift a statewide lockdown on Tuesday.
“The Delta strain transmissibility will make us have to rethink about the level of vaccination,” said NSW chief health officer Kerry Chant . “I think we need to see that our journey of living with Covid is going to be a long one.
“We will have to adjust to whatever the virus delivers us. We will respond,” she said.
Dr Chant’s comments came as South Australia became the latest state to impose restrictions — ­including the closure of non-­essential retail and a ban on indoor gatherings — after the state recorded three community Covid-19 transmissions.
The first South Australian case was an 81-year-old man who contracted Covid-19 overseas but completed hotel quarantine in NSW before returning home to Adelaide. The two other infections – a man and a woman both in their 50s – were close contacts of the first case.

Joseph Lam 5.30am: Removalists’ mother dies, more alerts on north coast
The mother of twin Sydney removalists Roni and Ramsin Shawka , 27, who travelled to regional NSW despite testing positive for Covid-19, has died after contracting the virus.
NSW Police have confirmed officers from Liverpool were called to the house in Thursday Place in Green Valley, some 39km west of the CBD, after reports a woman in her 50s died.
The mother was in isolation with the boys who were apprehended by Police on Speedy Street, in Molong, on Saturday and escorted back to Sydney.
The Shawkas and another removalist, Maryo Shanki, 21, will face Orange Local Court on August 30. They have been charged for failing to comply with notice direction section 7/8/9 – COVID-19.
Overnight NSW Health released more alerts including for Coffs Harbour on the mid-north coast, and Crows Nest on Sydney’s lower north shore.
Joseph Lam 5.15am: SA returns to Stage Four restrictions
South Australia will return to stage four restrictions from Midnight on Tuesday after the state recorded a second case of Covid-19.
South Australian Premier Steven Marshall on Monday conceded “we only have one chance to get this right”.
NED-4117-South-Australias-New-Covid-19-Restrictions
“My strong message to the people of South Australia is that we need to just respect these restrictions that have been put in place,” he said.
“No need to panic whatsoever in South Australia. There is no need for a run to the shop urgently.”
The restrictions will effectively ban all large events and restrict private gatherings to no more than 10 people.
Non-essential retail, including gyms and personal care, will be closed and food consumption will be limited to outdoor venues at a capacity of one person per four square metres.

Victorian Health Authorities have identified seven new coronavirus cases, six of which are linked to the Ariele apartment complex visited by a team of Sydney removalists
Almost one in two aviation workers is not vaccinated, according to a survey of nearly 800 cabin crew, pilots, cleaners, baggage handlers and ground workers.
Rhiannon Down 11.45pm: Outbreak hits regional NSW
Two shops in regional NSW have been named as exposure sites, indicating the outbreak may have broken free of the city limits.
South Gundagai’s Shell Coles Express and the Jindera Shell in the Riverina region became close contact venues late on Wednesday.
D&M Excavations and Hanson Concrete Australia, both in Greenacre, southwest Sydney, were also added.
More than 25 venues with casual contact or monitor symptoms alerts were added, including: Pyrmont Coles, Mortdale Woolworths, Sutherland Priceline Pharmacy, Mamma Barone Italian Restaurant in Mortdale, Bondi Junction Coles, Bexley 7-Eleven, Hurstville Oporto, Strathfield South 7-Eleven and Riverwood Post Office.
Multiple time periods for the 309 Bus route were also added to the list.
The full list of exposure sites is available on the NSW Health website.
Olivia Caisley 11.15pm: No childcare fees for kids who stay at home
Parents in NSW who keep their children home during stay-at-home orders will not be charged fees by their childcare providers under regulation changes made by the Morrison government.
Education Minister Alan Tudge altered the rules on Wednesday night so that children could still be kept on the books if they did not attend their childcare centre in a move set to benefit more than 200,000 families.
It comes as restrictions in NSW were extended by at least two weeks to deal with a surge in Covid-19 infections after the state recorded 97 new locally acquired cases in the past 24 hours.

Rachel Baxendale 10.40pm: Masks mandatory indoors in Victoria
Victorians will be required to wear masks in all indoor locations from 11:59pm on Wednesday night.
Giving people just under 90 minutes’ notice of the decision, the state Health Department tweeted details of the rule change at 10:30pm.
“Wearing a face mask will be mandatory indoors (not at home) unless an exception applies – this includes all workplaces, and secondary schools,” the department tweeted.

“Masks must also be worn outdoors if you cannot maintain 1.5m distance from people who aren’t from your household (such as at an outdoor event).”
Rhiannon Down 10.30pm: ‘Pregnant woman’ tests positive in hospital
A hospital at the centre of Sydney’s western suburbs outbreak has been forced to postpone non-emergency surgery, after a patient — believed to be a pregnant woman — tested positive for Covid-19.
Close contacts at Liverpool hospital are undergoing testing and will be required to isolate for 14 days, while operating theatres undergo deep cleaning.
The case — who underwent a caesarean section, reports said — will be included in Thursday’s numbers.
NSW Health said urgent surgery was expected continue.
“Non-urgent surgery has been postponed for the remainder of the day so the hospital’s theatre complex can be deep cleaned,” the health body said.
“These procedures will be rescheduled as soon as possible.”
The major scare comes after an unvaccinated student nurse worked shifts while infectious at Fairfield and Royal North Shore hospitals, causing staff shortages after about 600 health workers were forced into isolation.

Stephen Rice 9.45pm: Clubs: lottery or Keno to push vaccine
Australia’s club industry has offered its 6413 clubs to the federal government to accelerate the vaccine rollout, proposing a national Covid-safe lottery and free games of Bingo or Keno for patrons who agree to be vaccinated.
Clubs would also be encouraged to offer “Schooner or a Schnitzel for a Shot” – a free drink or meal for vaccinated members, in the submission by Clubs Australia to Treasurer Josh Frydenberg and Covid-19 taskforce commander Lieutenant General John Frewen.
The proposal is likely to receive serious consideration because clubs are popular with older Australians – a key at-risk demographic. Others cater to ethnic communities with non-English-speaking backgrounds, a cohort the government is concerned vaccination messages are not reaching.

Tom Dusevic 9pm: Growing despair may lift jab uptake
Covid-19 outbreaks and state lockdowns have soured the ­national mood, with young Australians reporting high levels of psychological distress and more people saying our way of life will never return to normal.
An ABS household impacts of Covid-19 survey released on Wednesday also shows people have reduced their safety precautions, such as handwashing and wearing masks, over the course of the pandemic, but are now more likely to get vaccinated as perceptions of infection risk change in the community.
Last month, 26 per cent of those surveyed reported that life would take more than a year to return to normal, compared with 14 per cent in November.
ABS head of household surveys David Zago said 16 per cent reported that life would never ­return to normal, compared with 11 per cent in November.
As well, 20 per cent of respondents had experienced high or very high levels of psychological distress in the past four weeks, including 30 per cent of people aged 18 to 34, in results that were similar to survey results reported in November and March.
Associate director of the ANU Centre for Social Research and Methods Nicholas Biddle said “the evidence in Australia and around the world is that lockdowns have a greater negative ­effect on the mental health and wellbeing of young people than older people”.

Rhiannon Down 8.15pm: Alert over Brisbane Airport International Terminal
Brisbane Airport International Terminal, a shopping centre and several retail outlets have been added to Queensland’s list of exposure sites.
Anyone who was at the airport’s international terminal at level 3 departures or the toilets near the newsagency on Friday, July 9, between 9.45pm and 10.15pm has been asked to get tested and isolate.
A string of venues in North Ipswich have also been added, including Kmart, Vodaphone, Telstra and JB Hi-Fi at Riverlink, as well as Club Services Ipswich.
Chac’s Grill in Inala on Brisbane’s outskirts is also as an exposure site.
Queensland recorded zero local cases today and five cases in hotel quarantine.

Rachel Baxendale 8pm: Infection at Victorian primary school
A coronavirus case has been reported at Barwon Heads Primary school, 110km southwest of Melbourne near Geelong.
The Australian understands the latest case is one of two family members who have contracted the virus from a Bacchus Marsh Grammar teacher, who spent time with an Ariele apartment resident on Saturday afternoon.
The teacher and the apartment resident went to the Young & Jackson hotel in Melbourne’s CBD before attending the Carlton vs Geelong clash at the MCG.
Parents at the school have been told it will be closed from Thursday, with students advised to stay home until further notice.

AFP 7.15pm: Indonesia hits record 47,000 cases in a day
Indonesia has surpassed India and Brazil for new coronavirus ­infections after adding a record 47,899 cases in a single day, with officials appealing to the public to stay home to slow down the surge dominated by the Delta strain.
The number of Covid-19 cases in India meanwhile has tapered off after a second wave of the pandemic in May. The country registered 37,152 new cases on Monday.
Experts suggest Indonesia has not seen the peak of the surge and could see “up to 100,000 new cases daily” as the government pledges to increase testing and tracing.
“There is no need to be surprised if we see 100,000 or more cases daily, because there’s ­already massive transmission in the community … now it’s just the matter of quickly discovering and isolating them,” said public health expert Hermawan Saputra.
“The quicker we detect these cases, the more lives we can save.”
A partial lockdown, including a ban on restaurant dining, tighter travel checks and closure of non-essential offices, in areas with uncontrolled Covid-19 transmission will run until July 20.
But with no end in sight, critics have urged the government to ­extend it or “risk more victims and overburdening the health system”.

Rhiannon Down 7pm: SA threatened with tighter restrictions
Tighter health restrictions could be on the cards if South Australians fail to remain vigilant, Police Commissioner Grant Stevens has warned, as new testing requirements were introduced for freight drivers and interstate travellers.
“It’s fair to say that SA Health and South Australia police are very concerned about the current situation that we are facing,” he said.
“And this arises from the situation in NSW and the significant number of positive cases that have been active within the community, and also the emerging situation in Victoria with positive cases that have been identified there.
“We also have the situation where we have a positive exposure site at Tailem Bend and the situation with two removalists testing positive having been in South Australia and having been at that location for an extended period.”
He said it was concerning that just 25 QR check-ins had been recorded at the site while 76 card transactions had been made, with 118 contacts identified.
“We need to be confident that the South Australian community are doing the right thing and using the QR check-ins so we can actively contact trace anybody who may have been exposed,” he said.
Mr Stevens also announced the state would be stepping up restrictions with travellers from Victoria now required to get tested within 24 hours of arrival, while freight drivers must have returned a negative test 48 hours before arrival.
“That means you must have a test within 24 hours of arriving in South Australia and you are not permitted to go to a high-risk location, for example, an aged-care facility until you have a negative result,” he said.
“That only requires one test at this time.
“We are also requiring all freight drivers who are arriving in South Australia to produce evidence of a negative COVID test that has been undertaken within the last 48 hours on arrival to the state.”
Jacquelin Magnay 6.35pm: Three out of 8000 test positive at the Olympics
Just three out of more than 8000 people involved in the Olympic Games have tested positive to Covid-19 upon their arrival in Japan this month, officials announced, as the Japanese prime minister Yoshihide Suga welcomed the International Olympic Committee president Thomas Bach at a meeting in Tokyo on Wednesday.
The Japanese government has also approved sensitive visits by Mr Bach and the Australian IOC vice-president John Coates to Hiroshima and Nagasaki this Friday, despite some local objections, in order to mark the beginning of the Olympic Truce.
The low Covid-19 infection rate - which includes a Ugandan boxer and coach and another unidentified person, comes after strict pre-entry covid testing requirements in Japan.
Most arrivals have had to undergo up to three covid tests before boarding their flights and everyone is subject to an additional test upon arrival at a Japanese airport.
The statistics are heartening for Mr Suga, who has staked his political future on continuing with the Games despite a split among the Tokyo public about whether the Games should go ahead amid slowly rising case numbers of the coronavirus. Mr Suga faces elections immediately after the Games and is relying on a strong Japanese performance at the Game to boost domestic morale.
Mr Bach said the Games ‘’will unite the world in all our diversity, they will show that we are stronger together in all our solidarity” as he praised the organising committee, the volunteers and staff.
He added: “The IOC is sitting in the same boat and we are rowing in the same direction, enjoying the full support of the government of Japan.’’
Rachel Baxendale 6.07pm: Covid-19 fragments detected in Geelong wastewater
Victorian health authorities say they have detected Covid-19 fragments in wastewater from the Greater Geelong area, 80km southwest of Melbourne.
The first detection in the area precedes any known coronavirus cases from NSW travelling to Victoria.
This includes three removalists who were in Victoria on July 8, and a man from the City of Hume, who returned from Sydney the same day.
The Victorian health department says it has detected Covid-19 in sewage samples taken from the Geelong suburbs of Belmont, Highton and Wandana heights between July 4 and 7.
A second sample from between July 8 and 12 concerns the Geelong suburbs of Breakwater, Clifton Springs, Curlewis, Leopold, Drysdale, East Geelong, Moolap, Newcomb, South Geelong, Thomson and Whittington.
“The unexpected detections may be due to someone who has had COVID-19, is no longer infectious and is continuing to ‘shed’ the virus – or it may be due to an active but undiagnosed infectious case,” the department said.
“Anyone in the affected suburbs is urged to monitor for symptoms of COVID-19 and get tested if any symptoms develop.
“The Department will continue to monitor the situation closely.”
Rachel Baxendale 5.56pm: Teacher at school west of Melbourne tests positive
Bacchus Marsh Grammar, west of Melbourne, has confirmed one of its teachers has tested positive for Covid-19.
The positive test result comes after three Sydney removalists linked to at least six coronavirus transmissions in Melbourne visited a service station at Ballan, 24km west of Bacchus Marsh, last Thursday evening.
Health authorities are yet to confirm whether the teacher’s case has been linked to the Ballan exposure site.
Bacchus Marsh Grammar principal Andrew Neal wrote to parents on Wednesday evening, informing them of the news.
“The teacher was at the School’s Staff Day on Monday 12 July but has not been in contact with students on either Tuesday 13 July or Wednesday 14 July 2021,” Mr Neal wrote.
“As a result of this result all staff who were at the Staff Day on Monday 12 July have been directed by the COVID-19 Public Health Division Department of Health to isolate and be tested.
“We are awaiting instruction from the Department on appropriate sanitation and cleaning of the school.
“Given the need for testing of virtually all staff and the need for additional cleaning, there will be no classes at the Woodlea or Maddingley Campus on Thursday and Friday 15-16 July for all students.
“In the event of a longer period of confinement for staff, online learning would commence on Monday 19 July.
“This is a fairly fluid situation and we will endeavour to keep parents informed of the situation as it develops as we have further information of any additional public health requirements.
“At this stage, I would strongly advise that if any student does start to present with any of the recognised COVID symptoms they are tested as soon as possible as a matter of precaution.”
Rhiannon Down 5.50pm: Rosebery apartment block residents warned to get tested
Residents of a Rosebery apartment complex in Sydney’s inner east have been put on high alert after several cases of Covid-19 were detected.
Anyone who lives in the Valentino Place complex, or has visited since July 8, has been urged to get tested and isolate until they return a negative result, according to a notice shared by residents on social media.
“Further cases of Covid-19 have been identified at Valentino Place apartments, Rothschild Avenue, Rosebery, 2018,” it said.
“All residents (and anyone who visited the on or since July 8) are now identified as casual contacts and are advised to get tested for Covid-19 as soon as possible and self-isolate until they receive a negative result, even if they have been recently tested.”
The note to residents said anyone implicated must get another test on Saturday July 17.
Residents susaid they were unable to find the location listed as a venue of concern on the NSW Health website.
It was added minutes ago via a tweet by NSW Health as a venue of concern.

Paul Garvey 5.00pm: WA tightens border with Victoria amid latest outbreak
Western Australia has tightened its border with Victoria in light of Melbourne’s latest Covid-19 outbreak.
WA premier Mark McGowan said all arrivals into WA from Victoria would now be required to self-quarantine for 14 days. They will also have to be tested for the virus on arrival and on their 11th day of quarantine.
The change has been made with immediate effect
The state has already shut its border to arrivals from NSW and Queensland.
“I understand these changes may be disruptive for WA families. However, our strengthened border controls are an important tool for us to keep this dangerous virus out of WA,” Mr McGowan said.
Only arrivals from South Australia, the Northern Territory and Tasmania are currently allowed to enter WA without needing to isolate.
Meanwhile, WA police will meet Geelong’s footballers on the tarmac in Perth on Wednesday.
The Cats are due to play Fremantle at Optus Stadium on Thursday night but will undergo Covid-19 testing as soon as possible.
Geelong played Carlton at the MCG on Saturday night, with a section of the MCG Members Stand now listed as an exposure site.
There were about 2000 fans seated in the section and they have been advised to undergo a test and then isolate.
AFL chief executive Gillon McLachlan said he was not aware of suggestions partners and family members of one of the clubs in involved were seated in the area. Health authorities are currently going through contact tracing information.
The AFL is awaiting further advice from Victorian health authorities but said games will progress with crowds at this stage.
The AFL is consulting with the clubs and also the Queensland, Northern Territory and Victorian Governments regarding the prospect of a quarantine hub for the families and partners of those players. — with Courtney Walsh

Rhiannon Down 4.40pm: AFL teams test, alarm over 2000 contacts at MCG
Victorian health authorities are racing to track 25 close contacts and 2000 casual contacts after a confirmed case attended the Carlton vs Geelong game on Saturday, AFL boss Gillon McLachlan says.
“The Victorian government is currently contacting everyone who were on level two of the MCG members section which I think is roughly 2000 people and they need to isolate until they get a negative test,” he said.
“And they will also be in touch with their close contacts who we think will be about 25 and they will be having to isolate for a 14 day period.”
Mr McLachlan announced that all teams would be tested this week out of an “abundance of caution”, confirming that so far the match schedule remained unchanged despert the “emerging situation” in Victoria.
“Out of an abundance of caution all Victorian teams will get tested, and have an additional test this week,” he said.
“The Geelong team who are in the air and may well have landed will be met by WA police on the tarmac on the other end and will go and get a test in Perth.
“And beyond that I don’t have any updates on any other changes this weekend either in Victoria with crowds or others… but as we know things change on a day to day basis or any hourly basis.”

Rachel Baxendale 4.30pm: Andrews govenment meets on tighter restictions
Victorian health authorities and the Andrews government are meeting on Wednesday afternoon to discuss boosting coronavirus restrictions following the discovery of seven new cases linked to two separated incursions from NSW.
The Australian understands restrictions — which are likely to include wearing masks in all indoor venues and limits on visits to households — could be announced as soon as Thursday.
A return to seated service, a ban on dancing, and limits on patron numbers and density in hospitality venues are also being considered.
Victoria had begun to return to a level of normality following 11 days with no new community acquired cases before the latest incursions from NSW.
Currently household visits are capped at 15 people per day, with density limits of one person per two square metres in hospitality venues.

Rachel Baxendale 4.10pm: NSW removalists at centre of Vic outbreak unmasked
Three Sydney removalists at the centre of one of Victoria’s latest coronavirus outbreaks were not wearing masks while unloading furniture at the apartment building now linked to six virus transmissions, Victorian health authorities have revealed.
Covid-19 logistics chief Jeroen Weimar also confirmed on Tuesday that the removalists had taken almost 48 hours to reveal that they were travelling with a second truck and visited an additional set of exposure sites during their journey last Thursday from Sydney to Melbourne and on to Adelaide.
The southbound Caltex service station and Hungry Jack’s at Kalkallo, 30km north of Melbourne, were added to Victoria’s list of exposure sites on Tuesday night, after a removalist visited them between 9:07am and 10:06am last Thursday.
“Books will be thrown when it’s appropriate to throw them,” Mr Weimar said when asked whether the removalists would be punished.
“I’m exceptionally frustrated at the pace and transparency of information coming from the removalists’ exposure. That’s been a real matter of concern.
“We’ve now identified that we’ve got two vehicles.
“It’s not my job to worry about, you know, how safely those operations are run, but it is my concern that we haven’t had as quick and transparent exposure of all the information.
“That’s why we’re talking about Kalkallo now, you know, 24 hours after we started talking about the first site, which is a source of frustration to all of us.
“I would still not be surprised if we’re standing here tomorrow with yet another exposure site.”
Mr Weimar said residents of the Ariele Maribyrnong apartment building in Melbourne’s west, now linked to at least six coronavirus cases, had told authorities the removalists were not wearing masks while working there, “which is a breach of their permit condition”.

COVID-19 Australia: Cumulative vaccinations by state
Rachel Baxendale 3.20pm: Too early to make call on Vic restrictions: Weimar
Victorian Covid-19 logistics chief Jeroen Weimar says it’s too early to say whether restrictions will tighten in Victoria as a result of the seven new coronavirus cases detected in the state on Wednesday.
The Australian understands the Andrews government is not planning to hold another press conference on Wednesday at this stage.
“The Chief Health Officer and his deputies are extremely busy at the moment, working through these cases, and there’s a whole team who will do exactly that work, we will always review restrictions as evidence emerges,” Mr Weimar said.
“At this point in time, my very strong message for Victorians is let’s make sure we’re using the directions and the restrictions that are in place at the moment.
“They’re there for a reason. We have caps at the football for a reason, we have mask-wearing indoors when you can’t socially distance for a reason. Please just make sure we use those restrictions to the full. “The health team, the public health team will continue to review all the settings. My absolute focus is about getting these two chains of transmission under control as quickly as I can.
“We have a lot of test results to come in over the course of the coming hours to see what picture we’re starting to build, and as we’ve always done in Victoria, we will take fast and aggressive action, as we think is appropriate. We did that with the Ariele apartment complex only 36 hours ago. We will continue to work on that basis.”

Jacquelin Magnay 2.58pm: Only 50 Aussies to march at Tokyo opening ceremony
Tokyo: Just one in ten Australian athletes competing at the Tokyo Olympics will march in the opening ceremony on July 23.
Australian chef de mission Ian Chesterman announced that as few as 50 athletes including flag bearers Patty Mills and Cate Campbell will march, along with just six officials.
In late developments, another 16 athletes have been added to the Australian Olympic team taking the current numbers to 488.
Mr Chesterman said the low numbers of athletes marching were largely because of Covid restrictions which prevent athletes checking into the Olympic village until five days before their competition.
“I think 50 is a pretty good number when you consider with these games athletes can only arrive just before you compete and those that will compete in the second week (of competition) won’t even be in Tokyo (for the opening ceremony),’’ he said.
Some other athletes will be looking to minimise contact so that they are not ruled out of their competitions because of any contact with a positive Covid case. Ninety-eight per cent of Australian athletes will be fully vaccinated, Mr Chesterman said, adding that in the Olympic village he believed 85 per cent of all international athletes will be vaccinated.
Under the Tokyo 2020 rules, athletes can still compete despite being considered a close contact of a positive case if they can show they have been wearing their mask at all times.
More than 80 athletes marched at the Rio 2016 Olympics.
The governor of the Japanese capital says a high speed vaccination program means the city is ready to host a "safe" Olympics.
Japanese officials have already scaled back the opulence of the opening ceremony to reflect the difficulties faced around the world in dealing with the pandemic.
In Tokyo there are mixed feelings about the Olympics going ahead and the mood of the city is muted, especially as athletes and officials are banned from walking outside and mixing with the locals.
However a huge influx of athletes will arrive this weekend which will create more of a buzz in the Olympic village.
Mr Chesterman said these Olympics will give a generation of youth something other than Covid to focus upon. He said his children had ‘’only heard of Covid, Covid, Covid” in the past 18 months, but that with the outstanding triumph of Ash Barty at Wimbledon and the upcoming Olympic competition it will provide the younger generation with a huge boost to their morale.
He said today at the first Australian press conference in Tokyo: “I am very excited about the games, excited about our athletes getting out there to compete. The morale of this team is going to be fantastic, we have been through a lot, there has been great adversity, yet they’ve managed to get to Japan and come together. I think there’s a special spirit in the Australian team and a special spirit in the Olympic village because it's the same for all 206 countries coming together and creating something very memorable.”

Remy Varga 2.52pm: Ambulance arrives at Melbourne unit under lockdown
An ambulance has arrived at the Ariele apartment complex in Maribyrnong which was visited by a team of Sydney removalists last Thursday and has been placed in lockdown.
Paramedics wearing hazmat suits are preparing to enter the building where four residents have tested positive.
Rachel Baxendale 2.48pm: Five households in breach of red zone rules
Victorian Covid-19 logistics chief Jeroen Weimar says five households appeared to be in breach of home quarantine requirements when authorities checked on them on Tuesday.
There were 1600 red zone permits issued on Tuesday to people returning from New South Wales, on top of more than 9400 issued to Monday.
Melbourne has detected seven new cases of COVID-19 which have been linked to Sydney removalists and a man who breached self-isolation orders. The removalists were not wearing masks and COVID-19 Testing Commander Jeroen Weimar revealed they were not forthcoming with the authorities after they said they had come in one car before admitting it was two. A Maribyrnong apartment complex is already under lockdown and more exposure sites are being discovered with a shopping centre and the MCG being identified. The man who was under self-isolation orders left to go to Coles Craigieburn whilst infectious and authorities have so far tracked another positive case from the visit.
“I think what we can see from the story of the last day or so is the absolute critical importance of red zone arrivals isolating, getting tested and maintaining isolation,” Mr Weimar said.
“We made over 250 home visits yesterday to red zone arrivals. Five of those, regrettably, either weren’t co-operating or we believe were absent and they’re being taken forward by the appropriate authorities.”
Authorities have opted not to punish a member of a City of Hume family who breached quarantine to visit Craigieburn Coles in Melbourne’s outer north last Saturday, infecting a fellow customer.
Mr Weimar said on Tuesday that the family had otherwise “done the right thing” given they tested negative on arrival in Victoria but got tested again when they developed symptoms over the weekend.

Max Maddison 2.35pm: Fairfield testing a cluster in both senses: Bowen
Opposition climate and energy minister Chris Bowen has blasted the NSW government for failing to supply adequate virus testing facilities in Sydney’s west, despite requiring essential workers to get tested every three days.
The suburb of Fairfield has become the centre of the Greater Sydney outbreak, the Berejiklian government issued an edict requiring anyone who leaves the local government area for essentials, placing enormous demand pressures on local testing facilities.
With people waiting up to eight hours to get tested, Mr Bowen, whose federal seat of McMahon encompasses the Fairfield LGA, took aim at the failure of the state government to meet surging demand, saying the huge imposition should have been met with the necessary resources.
“To tell the people of Fairfield to get tested every three days, essential workers, they’ve been waiting six hours, eight hours; there were lines at 3am this morning – it’s simply not good enough, it’s a two-way street,” Mr Bowen told Sky News on Wednesday afternoon.
“The state government needs to put testing in here with the same speed that they put policing in here earlier in the week.
“This is a cluster in both senses of the word. This is a cluster under both definitions, this testing facility has been open for a little over an hour you can tell the people of Fairfield, want to do the right thing.”
He said the local community felt “targeted” by the police, with reports of “arrests, parties and car games” misrepresenting what was actually happening in the suburb.

David Ross 2.22pm: Sydney lockdown to take 1.4pc off GDP in Q3: CBA
Commonwealth Bank economist Gareth Aird is forecasting the latest lockdown in the Greater Sydney area is likely to slice 1.4 per cent off GDP in the third quarter of 2021. if it goes longer than seven weeks.
Mr Aird forecasts the national economy could contract as much as 0.7 per cent over the September quarter.
CBA had put an upbeat view on the 2021 economic outlook on the basis that outbreaks would be traced and quickly contained.
“Up until this point that assumption has held up. But the current lockdown of Greater Sydney and the rate of community transmission of Covid-19 poses a significant risk to the Australian economy over H2 21,” Mr Aird said.
“The blow to income, however, is cushioned by government payments to households and businesses. Support from industry, particularly the banking sector, will also minimise the medium to longer term damage from the lockdown.”
“By the same token GDP growth would be stronger in Q4 21 due to an easing of restrictions. The total hit to GDP in 2021 would be around 0.4 per cent because the lost production over the September quarter represents a permanent loss in output.”

Rachel Baxendale 2.11pm: Alert for shoppers at Craigieburn Coles
Victorian Covid-19 logistics chief Jeroen Weimar has urged anyone who shopped at Coles Craigieburn Central between 5:30pm and 6:30pm last Saturday to get tested for coronavirus immediately.
A member of a family of four who had recently returned from Sydney breached home quarantine to visit the store, with the Health Department’s QR code system showing about 50 people were present over the same period.
Victorian Commander of Testing Jeroen Weimar says there are seven new Covid cases with the majority linked to a locked-down Maribyrnong apartment block and the MCG and Highpoint after an infected man visited them
“Clearly the 50 odd people who were on the QR code system have already been contacted, and we’ll be ensuring they continue to come forward and get tested, and they will need to remain in isolation, but if you were in Craigieburn Coles between 5:30 and 6:30 on Saturday the 10th of July, if you didn’t use the QR code system, I need you to come forward and get tested,” Mr Weimar said.
“It’s really, really important that we have a good understanding of anybody else who might have been in that building, in that shop, to come forward and get tested very quickly.”

Rachel Baxendale 1.30pm: Victoria adds yet more sites to growing exposure list
Victorian health authorities have added yet more exposure sites, including iconic Melbourne pub Young & Jackson, and a coffee shop in the southeastern suburbs.
The sites come after the Health Department became aware of seven new coronavirus cases in the early hours of Wednesday morning.
Six of those cases are linked to a Maribyrnong apartment building in the city’s west which was visited by Sydney removalists last Thursday.
The seventh case appears to have been transmitted at Craigieburn Central Coles in Melbourne’s outer north, after a member of a family who had recently returned from Sydney breached home quarantine and visited their local supermarket.
The new exposure sites include:
Tier 1:
– Young & Jackson, 1 Swanston St, Melbourne between 2:40pm and 4:10pm last Saturday July 10;
– Vanilla Lounge, 17-21 Eaton Mall, Oakleigh (southeastern suburbs) between 2:45pm and 4:30pm last Friday July 9;
– Maribyrnong Aquatic Centre, 1 Aquatic Drive, Maribyrnong between 10am and 11:30am last Saturday July 10;
– The Reject Shop, Highpoint Shopping Centre Level 2, 120-200 Rosamond Rd, Maribyrnong between 11:30am and 12:10pm last Friday July 9;
– SkinKandy, Highpoint Shopping Centre Level 2, 120-200 Rosamond Rd, Maribyrnong between 11:15am and 12:35pm last Friday July 9;
– Ferguson Plarre Bakehouses, Highpoint Shopping Centre Level 2, 120-200 Rosamond Rd, Maribyrnong between 10:00am and 10:40am last Friday July 9;
Tier 2:
– Highpoint Shopping Centre North Carpark, 120-200 Rosamond Rd, Maribyrnong between 11:10am and 11:40am last Friday July 9;
– Highpoint Shopping Centre North Carpark, 120-200 Rosamond Rd, Maribyrnong between 12:00pm and 12:30pm last Friday July 9;
People who attended Tier 1 sites must isolate for 14 days, those who visited Tier 2 sites must get tested and isolate until they receive a negative result.

Rachel Baxendale 12.47pm: Frydenberg and family in narrow miss
Josh Frydenberg and his family appear to have narrowly avoided visiting a coronavirus exposure site.
The federal Treasurer attended Saturday’s clash between Carlton and Geelong at the MCG, where Level 2 of the MCC Members’ Reserve has been listed as a Tier 2 exposure site, after a Covid-positive man went to the game.
A keen Blues fan, Mr Frydenberg posted a photo on social media of himself at the match with children Gemma and Blake and Carlton legend Chris Judd .
However, he says they were luckily not seated in the relevant stand.
“We were not sitting in the MCC Level 2 area which is a Tier 2 exposure site,” Mr Frydenberg said.
Like everyone else who was among the crowd of 31,834 but was not sitting in MCC Level 2, the Frydenbergs will only need to monitor for symptoms, rather than being required to test and isolate.

Rachel Baxendale 12.36pm: Victoria adds four new exposure sites
Victorian Health authorities have added four new coronavirus exposure sites linked to a Covid-positive man in his 60s and family of three who live in the Ariele apartment building in Maribyrnong.
The sites are:
Tier 1:
– Highpoint Kinder Haven, 2A Mephan St, Maribyrnong between 9:15am and 5pm on Monday July 12;
Tier 2:
– ALDI Maribyrnong, 11 Edgewater Boulevard, Maribyrnong between 5:30pm and 6:10pm on Friday July 9;
– Level 2 of MCC Members’ Reserve, Carlton vs Geelong AFL game, MCG, Brunton Ave, Richmond between 4pm and 8pm on Saturday July 10;
Tier 3:
– Carlton vs Geelong AFL game (excluding) Level 2 of MCC Members’ Reserve, MCG, Brunton Ave, Richmond between 4pm and 8pm on Saturday July 10;
People who attended Tier 1 sites must isolate for 14 days, those who visited Tier 2 sites must get tested and isolate until they receive a negative result, and those who visited Tier 3 sites should monitor for symptoms.

Jess Malcolm 12.15pm: Take this seriously and stay home: Chant
A further extension of Sydney’s lockdown is dependent on people reducing their mobility and the ability of contact tracers to find new cases, NSW Chief Health Officer Kerry Chant has confirmed.
While authorities were unable to provide transparent modelling to the community, Dr Chant said it was predicated on the decreasing people’s movement in the community.
New South Wales Chief Health Officer Dr Kerry Chant says the state has recorded 97 new locally acquired case of COVID-19, 70 of those cases originating from southwest Sydney. “While we are intensively focused on supporting communities in Fairfield to identify cases and stop spreading that to keep the community safe, it is important that we don’t keep losing focus on the adjacent local government areas of Liverpool and Canterbury-Bankstown,” she said. Dr Chant said people from southwestern and western Sydney should be cautious in their interactions, warning the Delta variant could lead to hospitalisations for people of all ages. “That really reinforced the message that whenever you leave the house, you’ve got to assume you can come into contact with someone who is infectious with Covid.”
“We need to take this seriously and contemplate our need to leave the home,” she said.
“We want to look closely at that mobility data. We have seen some response but it needs to be better. We need less mobility to get a handle on this.”
While Gladys Berejiklian again rebuffed calls to provide a definition of essential work, she urged essential workers to have a discussion with their employer today in light of the new stimulus packages.
“If your business is suffering as a result, come to Service NSW to get help,” she said.
“If you’re an individual person experiencing stress because we’ve asked you to stay at home, please ring Services Australia where the federal government is providing that support.
“We want everyone to stay at home, no matter what your circumstances. Now there’s the dollars to support you in that decision.”

Rachel Baxendale 11.57am: BREAKING: Seven new cases found in Victoria
Victorian Health Authorities have identified seven new coronavirus cases, six of which are linked to the Ariele apartment complex visited by a team of Sydney removalists last Thursday.
The cases include a man in his 60s and a household of three people, all of whom live on the third floor of the Maribyrnong apartment building in Melbourne’s west, which was visited by the removalists.
The man’s parents, aged 89 and 90, have also tested positive for the virus.
The elderly couple live in Craigieburn, in Melbourne’s outer north.
Exposure sites already linked to the man include the Carlton-Geelong match at the MCG on Saturday, and the busy Highpoint shopping centre in Maribyrnong.
Separately, a fourth member of a family in the City of Hume in Melbourne’s outer north has tested positive.
One member of that family breached home quarantine to visit a Craigieburn Coles on Saturday, and a man in his 30s who was at the supermarket during the same period has also tested positive.
Victorian Covid-19 logistics chief Jeroen Weimar said 70 personal close contacts had been identified at the Craigieburn Coles visited by the member of the City of Hume family, 45 had been identified at the Ballan service station and McDonalds visited by the removalists and 134 had been identified at the Ariele apartments.
He said 70 per cent of Ariele apartment block residents had so far tested negative for the virus, with more test results expected to be returned in coming hours.

Jess Malcolm 11.55am: HSC students may get special concessions
The NSW government is looking at implementing special lockdown concessions for Year 12 students who will face their HSC trials in lockdown.
Gladys Berejiklian said NSW Health is working with the department of education to ensure students are accommodated and students are being asked to follow the advice of their individual school.
“They will have a plan in place for school as some schools have particular classes or students doing particular subjects,” she said.
New South Wales Treasurer Dominic Perrottet has encouraged all landlords to talk with their tenants as he further explains the financial assistance available. “We also provided yesterday important protections for tenants. Whether you are a commercial tenant, a retail tenant or residential, there will be no lockouts or evictions,” he said. “As a residential tenant there will be no forced evictions for 60 days. Mandatory mediation is in place and also financial support. “I encourage all landlords to speak to their tenants … and, if your tenant is struggling, to engage with them in a payment plan, a reduction in rent and we will provide an equivalent offset in terms of your land tax obligations. “And for landlords in the residential space who don't pay land tax, we will provide up to $1,500 for you to pass that on to your tenant to help them through this difficult period.”
“There’s not a whole lot of detail at this stage on what those concessions actually are and how much they have or haven’t changed from previous conditions, but if you are in Year 12 or have a family member who is, keep an eye on any correspondence from your school about this.”
The NSW Premier said only one per cent of students turned up at school in the Fairfield local government area yesterday, and in other parts attendance was as low as three to five per cent.

Jess Malcolm 11.44am: Singles must share bubbles in outdoor spaces
People who live alone and would like to share a bubble with another single person are still being advised to meet up in outdoor spaces.
Under extenuating circumstances, people may visit each other for care and compassionate reasons but are being advised to meet on a balcony or in an outdoor garden.
Health minister Brad Hazzard said the rules are in place to ensure people are safe.
“If they can be outside and go for a walk, that is better, if two people would do it because as we’ve said many times, you are far safer from getting the virus outside,” Mr Hazzard said.
“If that’s not possible, if you’re going into someone’s house for care and compassion and you are one person visiting, do it out on the balcony or out in the garden.”
“It’s keeping people safe and applying whatever you think would be the safest way to try and do it in an open-air environment.”
Health authorities are also urging people living in apartment blocks to wear masks in common areas and to not share rides in lifts.
Jess Malcolm 11.37am: Premier clarifies essential worker testing rules
Gladys Berejiklian has advised essential workers from Fairfield who are required to get tested every three days can go to testing sites outside of the local government area to reduce pressure on the system.
This comes after Fairfield testing sites were overwhelmed overnight, with enormous queues, traffic jams and some people waiting up to six hours to get a test.
Member for Fairfield Guy Zangari has criticised the lack of resources for Covid testing saying it was “carmageddon” in Fairfield after essential workers were told they must have a test every three days. Essential workers who live in the Fairfield local government area but travel to other suburbs for work are required to be tested every three days following a new public health order announced on Tuesday. “The people of Fairfield have come out and done the right thing, gone out to get tested,” Mr Zangari said. “They’ve listened to the government’s requirements, but the government hasn’t provided for the people of Fairfield. “Last night we saw one major site shut by 7:30, people waiting for hours and then being turned away by police to other sites and those sites were just in absolute gridlock. “It’s carmageddon on the streets of Fairfield. “What I’m calling on the government to do today … immediately, is to ensure there are more 24-hour testing sites for Covid, more healthcare professionals to facilitate that, and more resources for Covid testing. “What happened last night and this morning is not working, people are frustrated.”
The NSW Premier said people who do not have symptoms may go to testing sites outside of Fairfield, but have asked people who are symptomatic to stay in their local government area.
“We need to be flexible and nimble during this pandemic,” Ms Berejiklian said. “We have to respond to what is going on and we will always be upfront and say it like it is.”
Chief health officer Kerry Chant said health authorities are considering boosting capacity for home testing as case numbers surge.
“We are continuing to look at any testing methods that can target people and we have different processes in place for close contacts and people at risk because they need to get tested quickly, but for this surveillance testing, please drop off at a clinic on your way to essential work.”
Jess Malcolm 11.28am: ‘No crystal ball’: Berejiklian won’t guess when it will end
Gladys Berejiklian says she will not provide “guesswork” to the community on whether the lockdown could be extended past its new end date of July 30.
Health authorities will be monitoring the data closer to the end of the month to decide on whether lockdown restrictions can be lifted.
While the NSW Premier has been pleased with a reduction in mobility across Sydney, she conceded there would likely be a few more days of high case numbers.
“The impact of some of the changes we have put in place will not be felt for the next few days,” she said. “It is important for us to assess all the advice we have which will be based on data and that will take us the next two weeks to make that assessment.”
“None of us have a crystal ball.
“Our success in getting the case numbers down and those infectious rates down to as close to zero as possible depends on all of us and how we respond.”
Authorities said they are working with the education department to ensure robust contingency plans are in place for parents, teachers and children who will now face another two weeks of home learning.
People are also being urged to reassess whether their jobs are essential in light of the new joint stimulus package announced by the federal and state government.

Rachel Baxendale 11.19am: Melbourne tower resident tests positive
A resident of the locked down Ariele apartment complex in Maribyrnong, in Melbourne’s west, has tested positive for coronavirus.
The Herald Sun is reporting the man in his 60s is believed to be unvaccinated and is extremely unwell.
The Health Department is yet to confirm that the new case is the same new case reported in Wednesday’s numbers.
The department earlier reported that Wednesday’s new case involved a quarantined close contact of a previous case.
The Ariele complex of 78 apartments went into a fortnight of hard lockdown on Monday night, after it emerged a team of three Sydney removalists had collected furniture from one of the apartments last Thursday, accessing numerous common areas and coming into contact with other residents.
Two of the removalists have since tested positive for the virus, with the third reportedly symptomatic.
Victorian Covid-19 logistics chief Jeroen Weimar is due to provide an update at 11.30am.
Jess Malcolm 11.17am: Where the new cases are coming from
The vast majority of today’s cases were from southwest Sydney, Chief Health Officer Kerry Chant has confirmed.
Fairfield, Liverpool and Canterbury-Bankstown continue to be of great concern for health authorities with 70 new cases overnight.
There are now 71 people being treated in hospital for Covid-19, with 20 people in intensive care and four of whom are ventilated.
“Of the 21 people in ICU, one is in their 20s, two are in their 30s, two in their 40s, five in their 50s, five in the 60s, three in 70s, and two in 80s,” Dr Chant said.
“The reason I take the time to read out those age profiles, it really is to dispel the misconception that Covid is mild for younger age groups. It can impact anyone.”
NSW Police issued 201 tickets in the past 24 hours for non-compliance to stay-at-home orders, with the vast majority given in southwest Sydney.
The areas of concern are Fairfield local government area, Roselands, Rosebery, Canterbury, Belmore, Sutherland shire, the St George area, Windsor, St Ives, Penrith and Bayside local government area.
Jess Malcolm 11.12am: NSW restrictions in place until July 30
The NSW government has extended the lockdown in greater Sydney for at least two weeks.
Gladys Berejiklian said the current settings will be in place until Friday 30th, with stay-at-home orders and home learning to remain.
New daily cases in New South Wales
The NSW Premier said the government’s stimulus package should help support businesses and individuals during this time.
She also urged Canterbury-Bankstown and Liverpool LGAs to reduce their mobility, but thanked Fairfield residents for complying with Covid rules after transport data showed a drastic reduction in movement.
“I want to thank everyone for the work we’ve been doing,” she said.
“We are all in this together. No matter where we live, the virus can come to us.”
Teachers and aged care workers will also now be prioritised in the vaccination rollout in areas where the outbreak is worst, and NSW Health will be bolstering testing capacity after it was overwhelmed in the last 24 hours.

Jess Malcolm 11.01am: NSW records 97 new cases, vast majority in Fairfield
NSW has recorded 97 new locally acquired cases of Covid-19 in the past 24 hours.
Over 24 cases were infectious in the community whilst infectious.
Of these locally acquired cases, 61 are linked to a known case or cluster with 45 of those household contacts and 16 close contacts.
The source of infection for 36 cases remains under investigation.
There were over 65,000 tests conducted yesterday.
Gladys Berejiklian says the Greater Sydney lockdown will extend another two weeks.
Jess Malcolm 10.29am: ‘Victoria knows if NSW does well, so does the country’
NSW Treasurer Dominic Perrottet has hosed down claims from the Victorian government of state favouritism in the commonwealth’s stimulus package for people struggling in the NSW lockdown.
Speaking to Sky News on Wednesday, Mr Perrottet said Victorians would welcome any package designed to help boost the NSW economy as it was good for the entire nation’s recovery.
“We have a robust and constructive relationship with the commonwealth,” he said.
“Victoria welcomes the package to some degree – if they know NSW does well the country will go well.”
Mr Perrottet also confirmed he had received advice from Victorian Premier Tim Pallas when fleshing out the details of the new stimulus package.
“The Victorian government has been very good in providing support for the package as well,” he said.
“Tim Pallas has been in regular contact in relation to the support during the lockdown measures, and the constructive relationship and engagement between state treasurers has been great.”

Jess Malcolm 10.11am: Writers festival cancelled, music bash postponed
Several regional events across NSW have been cancelled due to the unfolding Covid outbreak and protracted lockdown in Sydney.
Organisers of the Byron Writers Festival released a statement on Tuesday confirming the event will be cancelled this year due to the outbreak.
The event was scheduled to run in early August, but given the large portion of participating writers are located in Sydney or interstate organisers said it would be impossible for the event to go ahead.
“As positive cases continue to emerge and borders are closed to NSW, it has become clear that the current restrictions will push too close to the festival to make it feasible to proceed in early August,” it read.
“Our primary and abiding concern is, as ever, the health of everyone involved in the festival – presenters, attendees, volunteers, staff and of course the safety of the wider Northern Rivers community.”
Broken Hill’s Mundi Mundi Bash has also been postponed, initially set to run in September.
Organisers have made the decision to postpone the event by five weeks given various state border restrictions associated with the current Sydney outbreak.
“Due to the various state border restrictions associated with the current Covid outbreak in greater Sydney, along with our focus on the health and wellbeing of community members and our patrons, we have made the decision to postpone the 2021 Broken Hill Mundi Mundi Bash by five weeks.”

Hannah Moore 10.03am: Treasurer issues apology over hours-long testing queues
NSW Treasurer Dominic Perrottet has apologised to residents in Sydney’s west forced to queue for hours for Covid-19 tests due to tough new rules introduced by the state government.
Testing queues in the Fairfield LGA stretched back kilometres on Wednesday morning, with locals told there would be at least a four-hour wait before they could be seen.
People have flocked to testing venues after the NSW government announced new rules in a bid to keep the city’s rapidly-growing Covid-19 outbreak at bay.
Under the rules, people living in the western Sydney local government area of Fairfield who need to leave the area for work will be required to take a Covid-19 test every three days, regardless of if they have symptoms. Police can ask for proof of a recent, negative test from Saturday.
A local worker named Wayne told 2GB he had waited in a queue at the 24-hour testing facility in Smithfield from 1am on Wednesday, before being forced to turn around and head to work hours later.
“The guy told me there was still a four-hour wait at that hour,” he said.
Speaking to 2GB host Ben Fordham later in the morning, Mr Perrottet responded to the chaotic situation in the region and said the NSW government was looking for solutions.
He stressed the new rules won’t come into effect until Saturday and affected people can get tested at venues outside their local government area.
“Can I just, on behalf of the government, apologise to everyone in Fairfield for this significant inconvenience,” he said. “But also thank them, because it’s the sacrifice that they’re making … that keeps people safe.”
Local MP Guy Zangari told 2GB police were turning residents away from testing sites on Tuesday night, when the wait for a test stretched to six hours.
He described the situation as “chaos” and demanded more testing facilities were opened to keep up with demand.
“It’s time for Gladys Berejiklian to put her money where her mouth is by increasing 24-hour testing sites, having more health care professionals on the ground …. because what we saw last night was a slap in the face to the hardworking people of Fairfield,” he said.
Mr Zangari later told the ABC it had been a brutal few weeks for the community.
“All residents of the Fairfield local government area who over the last three weeks have had the finger pointed at them, they have been shamed and blamed and they are doing the right thing here.
“Commendations to all the residents, but they need a Government that is going to support them with all the resources possible.” – NCA Newswire
Lydia Lynch 9.54am: Three ‘probably’ infected on flight to Brisbane
Five overseas arrivals have tested positive in Queensland overnight, three of those were probably contagious on their flight to Brisbane.
Deputy Premier Steven Miles said the trio tested positive on the first day of their quarantine stay so authorities would closely monitor other passengers.
No local cases were detected.
Mr Miles said the NSW outbreak was still largely contained around Sydney, confirmed by routine sewage testing.
“We do not yet need to put in place greater border restrictions here,” he said.
“We continue to closely monitor the situation in NSW.”

The case is a close primary contact who has been in isolation during their infectious period.
There was one other case recorded in hotel quarantine.
The state conducted 33,037 tests yesterday, and administered 14,989 vaccines.
There are currently 19 active cases in the state.

Jess Malcolm 8.42am: Case numbers above 40 a day until September: modelling
Infectious disease expert Mike Toole says modelling done by the Burnet institute forecasts it would take NSW until the beginning of September to drive cases down to 40 per day under the current restrictions.
Gladys Berejiklian has repeatedly said authorities would need to see zero cases in the community to be able to lift any restrictions.
Despite national cabinet agreeing that lockdowns should be a last resort, the one in NSW is "gearing up" to be similar in length to that of Melbourne's lockdown last year, says PR Counsel Principal Kristy McSweeney. "We had the Covid four-phase map out for Australia which was heavily dependent on getting enough of the population vaccinated," she told Sky News host Peter Gleeson. "And it did say lockdowns were a last resort – that was agreed to at national cabinet. "And I think we all thought that's over to the extent they might be shorter and less economically damaging. "But it looks like this one in NSW is gearing up to be … certainly a significant length of time similar to the one we had in Melbourne last year which went for about three and a half to four months."
But expert modelling which compared Victoria’s stage four lockdown to the current outbreak in Sydney showed restrictions would need to be tightened if the state had any chance of reaching the Premier’s target.
“At the current level of restrictions, which is stage three point five under our modelling, that will flatten the curve and lead to gradually decreasing cases but it will not be enough to lift those restrictions,” he told ABC’s Radio National.
“It would appear there would be 40 cases a day at the beginning of September. If you applied stage four in the modelling you would get to less than five cases a day by September.”
Professor Toole said the NSW government should introduce a 5km-radius limit and shut down non-essential retail.
“The economic relief package now introduced means there’s really no excuse,” he said.
“The restrictions are just not good enough, it has to be more and that’s based on experience last year. This modelling is not made up overnight.”

Max Maddison 8.18am: Andrews ‘rejected offer to split stimulus bill’
Josh Frydenberg says Victorian Premier Daniel Andrews “rejected” an offer from the federal government to split the bill for the state’s economic stimulus package, as he says NSW hasn’t received any more money than their southern counterparts.
Amid allegations from Mr Andrews the federal government has engaged in “double standards”, accusing Scott Morrison of being the “prime minister for NSW”, the Treasurer pointed to the $750 million provided by the commonwealth during the middle of the Victorian lockdown.
“Let me put the facts on the table. Indeed on a per capita basis under JobKeeper, Victoria received more than any other state or territory,” Mr Frydenberg told ABC News.
“We offered Victoria a 50/50 split with business and income support. They rejected it, deciding they would alone pay for business support and the Federal Government will pay for income support.”

Max Maddison 8.05am: Fiscal package ‘more targeted than JobKeeper’
Josh Frydenberg has defended the decision not to reintroduce JobKeeper, saying the current fiscal package is a “more targeted response” with the ability to target different sized businesses.
After the much lauded success of the wage subsidy program, which shielded the Australian economy from the brunt of the pandemic-induced economic downturn, many have called on the Treasurer to reimplement the program.
Treasurer Josh Frydenberg says New South Wales has “absolutely not” received any preferential treatment in the support package which was announced on Tuesday despite complaints from Victoria. Under the newly announced arrangements, businesses which have suffered more than a 30 per cent decrease in revenue will be eligible for payments up to $10,000 a week provided they retain their employees. Mr Frydenberg told Sky News NSW was receiving the additional support because the lockdown was dragging on longer than the two-week lockdown Victorians recently lived through. “NSW got exactly what Victoria got for the first two weeks of the lockdown,” he said. “The second point is we offered Victoria a 50-50 split and they rejected it. They decided they would pay for business support; we would pay for income support." Mr Frydenberg also pointed out Victoria was provided “more on a per capita basis under JobKeeper” than any other state due to the 112 day lockdown last year. “What we have agreed with NSW is now a template that can be applied in … any other state that goes into an extensive lockdown in the period ahead,” he said. “So people are sick and tired of the whinging and the whining from the Victorian Labor government.”
But Mr Frydenberg said with the economy at a considerably different stage to last year, different measures were necessary to address the current crisis, which he said had been applauded by some academics. He pointed to the 134,000 payments which had already been processed in NSW.
“Now we’re applying more targeted responses based on the experience in different states, as well as, and then to take into account the hotspot definition but also targeting different sized businesses,” Mr Frydenberg told ABC’s Radio National on Wednesday morning.
“And so we’ve come up with a program and like I say, academics are out there today saying it’s a better response for what the situation in NSW requires.”

Jess Malcolm 7.58am: Victorians ‘have every right to be filthy’
Opposition treasury spokesman Jim Chalmers says Victorians have every right to be “filthy” over the federal government’s commonwealth support plan.
The Prime Minister announced a joint support plan with NSW on for individuals and businesses struggling under harsh lockdown on Tuesday, including income support of $600 a week and businesses a cash flow boost of up to $10,000
Speaking to ABC’s Radio National on Wednesday morning, Dr Chalmers said the new scheme was set to “antagonise Victorians” and that Victorians had been “left in the lurch”.
“They’re certainly being treated differently,’’ he said. “It’s entirely reasonable for Victorians to be angry. They came forward for a package that looked very different.
“I think Victorians have got every right to be filthy at the petty politics being played by Scott Morrison and Josh Frydenberg.”
He said the Sydney lockdown will have economic implications for the whole country, but that it’s federal government’s responsibility which could have been avoided with a faster vaccination rollout.
“The Treasurer said last night that the economy is bleeding something like $700 million a week in lost economic activity as a consequence of these lockdowns,” he said.
“You can’t have a first-rate economic recovery with a third rate vaccine rollout, that’s very clear, we’re seeing that in Sydney at the moment.”

Max Maddison 7.45am: PM points out differences in NSW, Victoria lockdowns
Scott Morrison has sought to differentiate between the outbreak in Greater Sydney and Melbourne’s second wave, as he responds to criticism the federal government has played favourites with their most recent economic support package.
A joint fiscal package with the Berejiklian government will see taxpayers spend $1.5 billion a fortnight to alleviate the financial burden of businesses and workers across NSW, as Greater Sydney stares down the barrel of an indefinite lockdown.
But with the federal government coming under attack for not coming to the aid of each state equally, Mr Morrison rejected the analysis, defended the package saying it was comparable to Victoria, which received $13.4 billion of direct support to employers and employees.
“What happened in NSW is exactly what has happened in Victoria. It’s the same support provided by the commonwealth,” Mr Morrison told Sunrise on Seven.
“We are now going into a longer lockdown. When Victoria needed the country last year in that long lockdown in the second wave, the commonwealth was putting in three quarters of a $1 billion into Victoria every week.”
Mr Morrison also pointed to the deadliness of the Delta variant, as he defended NSW Premier Gladys Berejiklian’s “lockdown lite”, noting there had been “a lot of learning” and some “pretty big failings” during Victoria’s second wave.
“NSW has responded, as they always have, with the best information they have. This trend is far more deadly, which is why they’ve gone in early. They’ve gone in far earlier than what we saw last year,” he said.
“The other thing I note in NSW, is that even though they’re going through now, they are still taking half the international arrivals into Australia. They’re still carrying the load for Australia.”

Opposition Leader Anthony Albanese has moved to support the Victorian government in its attack on the commonwealth, criticising the federal treasurer for inflaming tension between the two levels of government.
Speaking to ABC News Breakfast on Wednesday, Mr Albanese hit out at the commonwealth for its reaction to comments made initially by Victorian Premier Daniel Andrews , who accused Canberra of making the state “beg for every scrap from the federal government”.
“I’m not surprised that they feel concerned because the truth is this government has pointed the finger at Victoria,” he told ABC News Breakfast.
“They have spoken about the gold standard in New South Wales and the truth is that Victoria went through a tough time and New South Wales is going through a tough time now.”
“I think the federal government, in particular the federal treasurer who is from Victoria, I think some of his comments over a period of many months now are what has caused this tension.”
Mr Albanese also used the Prime Minister’s financial assistance package to criticise the commonwealth’s vaccination rollout.
“We’re going to need these packages for as long as lockdowns occur and lockdowns will continue to occur while this government doesn’t fix the rollout of the vaccine and doesn’t have national quarantine facilities.”

Jess Malcolm 7.19am: NSW getting no more money than Victoria: Frydenberg
Josh Frydenberg has doubled down on his criticism of the Victorian Premier Daniel Andrews , accusing him of “whinging and whining” and politicising the crisis after Mr Andrews accused the federal government of giving special treatment to NSW.
The Andrews government laid out a war of words yesterday accusing the commonwealth of making it “beg for every scrap of support from the federal government.”
Treasurer Josh Frydenberg has assured the federal government will continue to provide “significant economic support” until the COVID-19 pandemic is over. On Tuesday, the government announced a recurring disaster support payment for workers and further support for businesses and sole traders. The federal and NSW government will provide joint support in order to see the economy through the extended lockdown facing Sydneysiders as they battle the Delta variant. “I believe that the economy is very resilient,” Mr Frydenberg told Sky News host Paul Murray. “I believe that the New South Wales health officials are going to work diligently and professionally to get on top of this virus. “But until this virus ends, the Morrison Government will continue to provide significant economic support not just to New South Wales, but right across the country.”
Speaking to Sky News on Wednesday, the Treasurer said the commonwealth had provided more support on a per capita basis during Victoria’s 112-day lockdown, dismissing any claims of double standards.
“What this fails to recognise is the facts that I’ve laid out,” he said. “They were offered a 50/50 split and NSW has got no more money than Victoria did for the length of the Victorian lockdown.
“Anytime that someone challenges the Victorian Labor government, the bots and the trots from the trade halls get sent out into the sewer of social media to undermine the accountability that gets brought to bear on the Victorian government.”
Mr Frydenberg said the structure of the new stimulus package will apply to all states that endure more than one week of lockdown.

Hannah Moore 7.12am: Four-hour waits for tests after new rules
Testing queues in the Fairfield LGA are stretched back kilometres, with locals told there would be a four-hour wait before they can be seen.
Residents have flocked to testing venues on Wednesday morning after the NSW government announced tough new rules in a bid to keep the rapidly-growing Covid-19 outbreak at bay.
Under the new rules, people living in the western Sydney local government area of Fairfield who need to leave the area for work will be required to take a Covid-19 test every three days.
“If you live in the Fairfield local government area, you need to have regular Covid tests to demonstrate that you are Covid free, even if you don’t have symptoms,” Premier Gladys Berejiklian said on Tuesday.
Days before the new rules regarding regular tests come into place, testing queues are already stretching kilometres.
“The Health Minister did sign a new health order which mandates that everybody who leaves the local government area for work is tested every three days to demonstrate that they are negative.”
Police can ask for proof of a recent test from Saturday.
A local worker named Wayne told 2GB he had waited in a queue at the 24-hour testing facility in Smithfield from 1am, before being forced to turn around and head to work hours later.
“The guy told me there was still a four-hour wait at that hour,” he said.
Fairfield Mayor Frank Carbone shared shocking video of the line at 10pm on Tuesday night, calling for more resources after locals flocked to be tested immediately after the 11am announcement.
“We support more testing but adequate resources need to be put in place, today has been a terrible experience with a 6 hour wait and the NSW government needs to put more testing sites across Fairfield,” he wrote.
“Endeavour reserve testing clinic has blocked all of The Boulevard, Avenell St and every other road leading into the Park for kilometres, crossing over into Hamilton Road.
“These poor residents who need to go to work tomorrow are having to wait hours due to the new testing rules that apply to Fairfield residents who are required to get tested every 3 days if they work outside our area.”
New South Wales recorded 89 new cases on Tuesday, with Sydney’s lockdown expected to be extended for a second time later on Wednesday. — NCA Newswire

Jess Malcolm 6.55am: ATU: Prioritise aviation workers for jab
The Australian Transport Union says the nation has a “gaping hole” in its defence against Covid after a survey found 46 per cent of aviation workers have not been vaccinated.
National Secretary Michael Kaine criticised the federal government for not prioritising aviation workers, calling for vaccination priority and frequent testing.
“Fewer than a third of workers are fully vaccinated,” he told ABC’s Radio National. “This is another example of an ad hoc approach by the federal government.”
“In New Zealand they’re a tick away from 85 per cent of aviation workers fully vaccinated. They don’t have high levels of vaccination in their community but they have put workers in a priority for a vaccination queue.”
“Band aid fixes are not going to do the job.”
Mr Caine has also called for mandatory rapid pre-flight testing on domestic flights for passengers and crew.
The calls come after Sydney’s outbreak and protracted lockdown was sparked by an unvaccinated and unmasked limo driver catching the virus while transporting aircrew.

Sid Maher 6.40am: Frydenberg lashes ‘whingeing’ Andrews
Josh Frydenberg has hit back at Victorian Premier Daniel Andrews , accusing him of “whingeing’’ and politicising the NSW lockdown after the Victorian government accused Canberra of making the state “beg for every scrap of support from the federal government’’.
Appearing on the ABC’s 7:30, the federal Treasurer dismissed suggestions the commonwealth was demonstrating double standards by providing extra support to NSW during its current Covid crisis and initially not Victoria during its last lockdown.
Mr Frydenberg said the federal government had “provided more support on a per capita basis to Victoria through JobKeeper.” “Victoria was offered a 50-50 split and decided to reject it,” he said.
He also said the current situation in NSW was different to Victoria’s extended lockdown last year, arguing that the state was not dealing with the Delta variant. “They had a massive quarantine failure,” the Treasurer said. “Then they had an inquiry that didn’t find anyone took responsibility or made the decision.”
“People are sick of his whingeing and his politicking of the crisis,’’ Mr Frydenberg said.
When anyone challenged Mr Andrews, including the ABC’s Leigh Sales, “the bots and the trots’’ attacked them.

Jess Malcolm 6.35am: Fairfield workers furious at mandatory testing
NSW is anxiously awaiting an decision about a lockdown extension this morning as the state recorded its second death linked to the outbreak and restrictions were tightened further on Tuesday.
Essential workers who are working or living in Fairfield are now required to be tested every three days causing enormous queues in local testing sites. These people do not have to isolate themselves until they receive a result unless they are showing symptoms.
NSW Health has ramped up testing facilities in the area through the night, but locals are angry about a lack of consultation with the local community with many waiting hours to get a test. The restrictions come after an infected worker travelled from southwest Sydney to Goulburn, placing regional NSW on high alert.
There were 89 cases recorded in NSW on Tuesday with more than three quarters of the new cases being close family contacts. Gladys Berejiklian warned that the lower numbers were “not a trend” and urged people to stay home.
Nine people have now been infected with the virus in a growing cluster in a Bondi Junction apartment block in the city’s east. The apartment has gone into full lockdown with police guard ensuring nobody enters or leaves.
Hundreds of people in a Melbourne apartment block are also locked down after two Sydney removalists delivered furniture to one of the apartments whilst infectious. Several new exposure sites have been added overnight including a Kalkallo Hungry Jacks and a Caltex. The workers have been interviewed by health authorities who are reporting they have not been “forthcoming” about their whereabouts.
Another family in the city’s north was infected with the virus after travelling from Sydney with the third member testing positive on Tuesday.
The outbreaks come as the federal government outlined its Covid relief package for NSW as the state endures a protracted lockdown.

Natasha Robinson 6.00am: Hotspot ‘young’ urged to get AZ jab
The nation’s top advisers on immunisation have urged people aged under 60 in coronavirus outbreak zones to consider being vaccinated with AstraZeneca if they do not have immediate access to Pfizer in another adjustment to the national vaccine rollout.
The Australian Technical Advisory Group on Immunisation has also recommended a shorter interval of between four and eight weeks between first and second doses of AstraZeneca for those in Delta-variant outbreak zones.
The Australian’s Media Writer Sophie Elsworth says the government’s graphic vaccine ad campaign is “just trying to scare the wits out of people”.
The ATAGI said its advice that Pfizer was the preferred vaccine for those aged under 60 remained unchanged, but those aged under 60 living in areas of Covid-19 outbreaks should consider the benefit of being immediately vaccinated with AstraZeneca if they could not access Pfizer.
“In the context of a Covid-19 outbreak where the supply of Comirnaty (Pfizer) is constrained, adults younger than 60 years old, who do not have immediate access to Comirnaty (Pfizer), should reassess the benefits to them and their contacts from being vaccinated with Covid-19 vaccine ­AstraZeneca versus the rare risk of a serious side effect,” ATAGI said.
The risks presented by the rare but serious blood clotting syndrome that can be triggered by the AstraZeneca vaccine prompted the ATAGI to recommend that vaccine be given only to those aged over 60 while Pfizer was preferred for those under 60.
That advice was based on a risk-benefit equation that took into account the fact Australia had very low case numbers of Covid-19, and zero deaths or hospitalisations. That scenario has now changed, with the NSW Delta outbreak such that the risks posed by the virus for those aged under 60 in outbreak zones is greater than the risk posed by the AstraZeneca vaccine.

Rhiannon Down 5.45am: Sydney exposure list balloons, longer lockdown looms
More medical centres have become exposure sites, along with food and retail outlets across Sydney’s west.
The BHC Medical Centre in Lakemba and Primary Health Care Medical and Dental Centre pharmacy in Bankstown were added to the exposure list late on Tuesday, continuing a worrying trend in possible exposures in medical centres and pharmacies.
G James Glass and Aluminium in Smithfield and Sydney Wide Building Materials in Greenacre were also added to the list as close contact exposure sites, with anyone who visited the construction outlets asked to get tested and isolate for 14 days.
Kaffeine & Co in Yagoona and Chubby Buns Burger in Punchbowl were also added as close contact sites.
Punchbowl Woolworths, the Belrose Hotel Bottle Shop, Adam’s Kebabs and Pizza-Pide in Hurstville, O’Loughlin’s Medical Pharmacy in St Ives, Espresso Warriors in Blacktown and Cotton On and Cotton on Body also in Blacktown were among the locations listed as casual contact sites.
The full list is available on the NSW Health website.
Ewin Hannan 5.30am: Fears over no jab aviation workers
Almost one in two aviation workers is not vaccinated, according to a survey of nearly 800 cabin crew, pilots, cleaners, baggage handlers and ground workers, sparking warnings the community is being put at risk because of the low number of vaccinated airport employees.
One-third of aviation workers have had two vaccine shots and 22 per cent have had one shot, with the Transport Workers Union saying poor vaccination rates at “one of our most at-risk locations should ring alarm bells that there is a gaping hole in our fight to reduce the risk of Covid spread”.
More than 70 per cent of cabin crew said they did not feel safe flying into hotspot locations, citing the risk of getting Covid-19 and the fear of passing it to family members and the wider community.
Fifty-four per cent of cleaners and ground crew said they did not feel safe servicing aircraft from hotpots. Cabin crew and pilots overwhelmingly supported rapid pre-flight tests of crew and passengers to help reduce risks.
Many aviation workers said they had not been vaccinated because of a lack of vaccine timeslot availability and because it was difficult organising their vaccination ahead of roster changes with the potential of losing work.
Seventy per cent of those vaccinated organised the shot themselves, with the other 30 per cent assisted by their employer.

Full text: The final State of Origin rugby league match has been moved to Queensland after NSW recorded its worst daily tally of new Covid cases since the latest outbreak began, with 50 people testing positive in 24 hours. Premier Gladys Berejiklian has hinted at extending the current lockdown into a fourth week and pleaded with people to tell truth ‘the first time’ to contact tracers battling to track the spread of the Delta variant.
COVID-19 Australia: Cumulative vaccinations by state
Staff reporters 11.50pm: Crackdown on breaches as Sydney rules tightened
Surveillance of possibly illegal gatherings in Sydney has been heightened as the NSW capital region faces the possibility of an extended lockdown after Covid restrictions were toughened on Friday night.
A total of 167 infringement notices were issued across Sydney on Friday, 67 of them in southwest Sydney, where 100 police officers were deployed to enforce stricter stay-at-home orders. Fifty new infections were recorded in the 24 hours to 8pm on Friday.
“Overwhelmingly, the response by police, when I speak to them, is that the vast majority of people in southwest Sydney are being compliant,” NSW Police Deputy Commissioner Gary Worboys said on Saturday.
“They are staying at home when they’re out, they are wearing a mask, the efforts by people in southwest Sydney in this first 24 hours have been commendable.’’
But police have started conducting compliance checks at Sydney hotels after six people staying at the Meriton Suites on Kent Street were found to have breached the lockdown, the ABC reported.
Eight people were fined at a gathering in Randwick, in Sydney’s east, while six people were caught at a birthday party on the Central Coast, the ABC said.
NSW cabinet ministers have begun preparing for a prolonged lockdown across Greater Sydney, amid growing concerns the current Covid-19 outbreak will not be contained without extensive and firmer measures forcing people to stay indoors.
NSW Premier Gladys Berejiklian has indicated Sydneysiders — already entering their third week of Covid lockdown — should brace themselves for the possibility of further extensions to stay-at-home orders.
“The only conclusion we can draw is that things are going to get worse before they get better,” she said on Saturday, after announcing 50 new local cases of Covid in 24 hours.
Ms Berejiklian, who expressed frustration at people continuing to flout lockdown rules and lying to contact tracers, knocked back suggestions she should have called a lockdown earlier, and said she had “full confidence” in the advice she received at the time.
Restrictions for Greater Sydney include: Outdoor public gatherings are limited to two people (excluding members of the same household); people must stay in their local government area or within 10kms of home for exercise and outdoor recreation, with no carpooling between non-household members; browsing in shops is prohibited, plus only one person per household, per day may leave the home for shopping.
Other states including Queensland, Western Australia and Victoria have threatened to shut their borders with NSW if the outbreak in the Sydney region worsens.

New South Wales Premier Gladys Berejiklian says “things will get worse before they get better” for Sydneysiders enduring a 3-week lockdown. Friday night to 8pm there were 50 cases of community transmission recorded in New South Wales, with 26 of those infectious in the community. Most of the cases recorded were close family or friends of those with COVID-19. “The only conclusion we can draw is things will get worse before they get better," Ms Berejiklian said. “One person who’s been infectious in the community is likely to give it to those closest to them. “It’s pretty clear, that unless we reduce that level of people in the community that are infectious, we won’t be able to turn things around as quickly as we can or as quickly as we should.”
Agencies 11pm: Delta puts brakes on return to post-Covid normality
Nations across the globe hit new pandemic highs and reimposed Covid-19 restrictions on Saturday as the highly contagious Delta variant forced governments to put the brakes on plans to return to normality.
The highly transmissible Delta variant, first detected in India, is sweeping the globe as countries race to inoculate their populations to ward off fresh outbreaks and allow for economies and daily life to recover.
The European Union — lambasted early on in the pandemic response for a botched vaccine acquisition program — said on Saturday it has distributed enough shots to cover 70 per cent of the bloc’s population.
But according to the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control, the proportion of adults aged 18 years or over fully vaccinated in the EU and European Economic Area was still only 44.1 per cent.
While vaccines have been successful in mitigating the worst effects of infections, concerns have been raised about how well some of them will cope with more virulent strains.
In Indonesia, which is fighting a ferocious wave of infections, more than a dozen fully inoculated frontline health workers have died, according to the country’s medical association.
Authorities said on Friday that medics would be given a third booster jab using the vaccine made by US company Moderna, to provide them extra protection.
The Southeast Asian nation has been depending heavily on China’s Sinovax shots amid the global shortage of alternatives that have been mostly supplied to rich nations.
The rapid spread of the Delta variant across Asia, Africa and Latin America is exposing crucial vaccine supply shortages for some of the world’s most poorest and most vulnerable populations.
Senegal, the EU, the US, several European governments and other partners, signed an accord in Dakar on Friday to finance vaccine production in the West African state.
And Cuba approved its home-grown Abdala vaccine for emergency use, the first Latin American coronavirus jab to get the green light and a possible lifeline for a region trying to battle a killer pandemic with modest means.
The pandemic has killed at least 4,013,756 people since the virus first emerged in December 2019, according to an AFP compilation of official data.
The US is the worst-affected country with 606,476 deaths, followed by Brazil with 530,179, India with 405,939, Mexico with 234,458 and Peru 193,909.
The World Health Organisation says up to three times more people have died directly or indirectly because of the pandemic than official figures suggest.

Brent Read 8.30pm: NRL Origin final moved to Gold Coast
The third and final match of the State of Origin 2021 rugby league series has been moved to the Gold Coast in Queensland after the NSW government banned Newcastle from hosting a major crowd event because of the Sydney-region Covid-19 outbreak.
The government informed the NRL that no fans would be allowed if the game went ahead there.
The NSW-Queensland match would be held at Cbus Super Stadium for the first time in the Gold Coast’s history. A capacity crowd of over 27,000 would be allowed to attend Wednesday night’s game, the NRL announced.
It is also the first time a full Origin series has been played in Queensland.
The Queensland Maroons face a possible 3-0 series loss to the Blues after 50-6 and 26-0 defeats in the first two games of the 2021 matches.

State of Origin III has been moved from Newcastle to the Gold Coast with the NSW Government expressing fears the clash could see COVID-19 spread into regional centres. It will be the first time a State of Origin game has been played on the Gold Coast and the first series to be entirely played within Queensland.
Natasha Robinson 7.45pm: GPs split over dosing interval for AstraZeneca
Doctors say they will decide on a “case-by-case basis” whether to give the AstraZeneca vaccine to patients as soon as eight weeks after their first dose as thousands of people rush to gain earlier ­appointments.
The nation’s chief medical officer, Paul Kelly, has endorsed advice that people in Covid-19 hotspot areas of Sydney should be given their second AstraZeneca vaccine eight weeks after their first dose instead of 12.
The advice has seen patients around Australia inundate doctors’ surgeries to ask whether they can also shorten the interval between their first and second AstraZeneca shots, but general practitioners have been giving differing advice.
The president of the Australian Medical Association (NSW), Danielle McMullen, said Scott Morrison’s announcement about shortening the dosing interval came as a surprise to doctors.
“We weren’t given any warning that a change or a change of guidance was imminent,” Dr McMullen said.
“GPs have been flooded with calls. We do know that a 12-week interval gives you better protection, but given the Sydney outbreak, it does seem reasonable that if people want to bring forward their second dose to eight or 10 weeks, they can do that providing they can get an appointment.
“We’ve got to remember that GP clinics are already booked up with people who have booked their 12-week dose. Clinics may or may not have the capacity in the vaccine supply to be able to bring forward doses.”
A study in the Lancet published earlier this year found that the AstraZeneca vaccine provided 81.3 per cent protection when two doses were given 12 weeks apart, but efficacy fell to 60 per cent when doses were given between six and eight weeks apart.

Agencies 7.25pm: South Korea hits third straight record high in cases
South Korea reported 1378 new coronavirus cases on Saturday, a record high for the third day in a row as the country prepared to impose its highest-level curbs in the greater capital area next week.
The country had previously been held up as a model of how to combat the pandemic, with the public largely following social distancing and other rules, but it was slow to start its vaccine roll-out due to supply shortages.
More than 1000 of the new cases were in the capital Seoul and its surrounding areas, home to around half the South Korean population.
Clusters have recently surfaced in areas including schools, offices and shopping malls, with people in their 20s and 30s — most of whom are not yet eligible for vaccinations — driving up the numbers.
Only about 11 per cent of the country’s 52 million population is fully vaccinated, according to health authorities.
North Korea has rejected planned shipments of the AstraZeneca vaccine over fears of side effects. The country had been promised more than two million doses by the COVAX scheme but is seeking alternative vaccination options. North Korea has not reported any COVID-19 cases but the United States and South Korean officials have questioned the position.
On Friday, the country’s Prime Minister Kim Boo-kyum said the record spike in new cases left authorities no choice but to implement the highest-level curbs.
Under the new restrictions, set to come into force on Monday and last for two weeks, gatherings of more than two people will be banned after 6pm and schools will be closed.
Bars and clubs will be shut, while cafes and restaurants are allowed limited seating and dine-in services are prohibited after 10pm.

Agencies 7.10pm: EU hits goal of delivering vaccines for 70pc of adults
The European Union had hit its target of delivering enough coronavirus vaccine to cover 70 per cent of the adult population, EU Commission president Ursula von der Leyen said on Saturday.
The 27 EU governments are responsible for administering the vaccines to citizens, and some are working much faster than others, but Ms von der Leyen stressed that: “The EU has kept its word.” The EU joint vaccine purchasing scheme, run by Ms von der Leyen’s European Commission, has delivered 330 million BioNTech-Pfizer shots, 100 million AstraZeneca, 50 million from Moderna and 20 million Johnson & Johnson.
All but the J & J jab require two doses to achieve full efficacy, and the EU is home to an estimated 366 million adults.
“This weekend, we delivered enough vaccine to member states to fully vaccinate at least 70 per cent of the adult population this month. By tomorrow, some 500 million doses will have been distributed to all regions of Europe,” Ms von der Leyen said.
“Covid-19 is not yet defeated. But we are prepared to continue supplying vaccines — also against new variants. Now the member states must do everything they can to ensure that vaccinations move forward. Only then will we all be safe.”
Russia reported 752 coronavirus deaths on Saturday, a national record of pandemic-related fatalities over a 24-hour period, as the country battles a third wave.
The country’s official virus caseload passed 5.75 million on Saturday, making it the fifth-worst hit nation worldwide, according to an AFP tally.
As of Saturday, just 18.9m of Russia’s population of about 146 million people had been fully vaccinated, according to the Gogov website, which tallies Covid data from the regions.

Melissa Iaria 6.50pm: Sydney woman flies into ACT in breach of rules
A Sydney woman has been caught allegedly travelling to the ACT in breach of Covid rules.
The 24-year-old Paddington woman allegedly flew to the territory without having the necessary exemption to public health orders.
She was identified by police as a Sydney resident when she got off the flight from Sydney on Friday night.
Checks with ACT Health confirmed she had not been granted an exemption to enter the ACT.
ACT Policing said the woman was escorted to a hotel at the airport and ordered to stay there at her own expense, before being escorted to a return flight home on Saturday morning.
However, about 11.45pm, hotel staff notified ACT police the woman had guests and was preparing to leave the hotel in breach of ACT Health directions.
Police arrived as a rideshare vehicle departed with the woman inside.
The vehicle was stopped by officers about 12.05am on Saturday on Kings Ave, Russell, where the woman was arrested and taken to the ACT Watch House.
She was expected to face the ACT Magistrates Court, charged with failing to comply with a direction by the chief medical officer.
ACT Policing will also notify NSW police of an alleged breach of the NSW Health stay-at-home directions.

Jasper Bruce 6.40pm: NRL referees dropped from game over case contact
Two NRL match officials have been caught up in a Covid-19 scare, forcing the league to make last-minute changes to Saturday night’s game between the Bulldogs and Roosters.
The referees have been classified as possible casual contacts of a Covid-19 case after attending an exposure site while shopping this week.
Both are awaiting the results of Covid-19 tests.
As a precaution, Grant Atkins, Belinda Sharpe and Liam Kennedy have been relieved of their duties for Saturday night’s game.
Adam Gee, Peter Gough and David Munro, the officials who oversaw Thursday night’s clash between the Raiders and Sea Eagles, will take their place.
Gee, Gough and Munro did not train with the referees squad on Thursday or Friday so have not come into contact with those who attended the exposure site.
The league said the last-minute change was made “as an abundance of caution”.
Like NRL players and coaching staff, on-field match officials are subject to the league’s Level 4 Biosecurity Protocols, meaning they are unable to leave their homes other than for games, training or an essential reason.
The match officials are not thought to have breached the NSW Government’s health orders nor the NRL’s directives.
The news comes as the NRL contemplates relocating the competition amid Sydney’s Covid-19 outbreak.
“At the moment we are doing our utmost to make it the least inconvenience for the players and their families,” ARLC chairman Peter V’landys told News Corp on Friday.

Rhiannon Tuffield 5.48pm: Isolation order as Qantas passenger tests positive
Sixty-one passengers on a Qantas flight have been told to isolate after a health worker who left Tasmania and travelled via Melbourne to the UK tested positive to the virus.
In a daily Covid-19 update on Saturday, Victorian testing head Jeroen Weimar said the person travelled via Melbourne on QF1542, which departed Launceston at 10.15am on July 2.
The person tested positive more than 72 hours after leaving Melbourne, and 61 passengers on the Qantas flight have been told to isolate and get a test.
“It is an exceptionally long shot, but out of an abundance of caution both ourselves … (and the) Tasmanian public health team have decided to take that very precautious stance to make sure that any remote chance of this person being positive while they were in Tasmania, or the four hours (they were) in Melbourne, that we just run that to ground,” Mr Weimar said.
“My thanks to 61 passengers who have been contacted.”
Mr Weimar said the person spent four hours in Melbourne.
The boss of Canberra Airport is calling for flights from Perth and Adelaide to be banned from arriving in retaliation to the states both closing the border to the ACT despite the territory not recording a local case since 2020.
Tasmanian health authorities on Friday were investigating the movements of the health-worker, who had been working at the Launceston General Hospital before travelling around the state and flying home to London.
The health-worker and a colleague both had Covid-19 tests on June 30 and returned negative results.
The pair flew to Singapore and on to London, arriving on July 3, where a day later one of them tested positive for COVID-19.
Both had received Pfizer vaccinations in March and April this year and authorities believe the virus may have been picked up between Singapore and London.

Dozens of passengers on board an international Qantas flight are being told to get tested and isolate after a person who flew to the United Kingdom via Melbourne tested positive for COVID-19. The traveller had flown on flight QF-1542 from Tasmania which left Launceston on July 2. The passenger subsequently returned a positive result more than 72 hours after leaving Melbourne.
Oliver Wright 5.33pm: Covid passports on the way for UK’s autumn wave
Covid-19 certificates will be required for customers to enter bars, restaurants and nightclubs under plans to tackle a fourth wave of the virus in a move that experts hope will boost jab rates among the young.
Entertainment venues in England would be forced to make customers use so-called vaccination passports from autumn, to prove that they had either had both doses or a negative test the day before. Recent figures have shown a reduction in the take-up of vaccines with first doses halving in two weeks. Fewer than 100,000 a day are being given out on average for the first time since April.
Unvaccinated young Britons are believed to be behind a rise in cases. One in 160 people in England were thought to have the coronavirus after a 58 per cent rise over seven days, according to the Office for National Statistics. It estimates that 332,900 people had the virus in the week ending July 3, similar to levels in mid-October, with cases more than ten times higher in those aged 16-24 than the over-70s.

Ellie Dudley 4.49pm: Labor calls for more economic support in NSW
NSW Labor leader Chris Minns has called for further economic support be given to businesses, workers and the tourism sector.
Treasurer Dominic Perrottet last week announced a support package for small businesses to access grants between $5000 and $10,000 to ease the effects of the lockdown period.
Prime Minister Scott Morrison also announced he would scrap the pre-existing $10,000 liquid asset requirement for the Covid Disaster Payment, so anyone out of work during the lockdown could access $500 weekly payments.
But Mr Minns took to Twitter on Saturday to say more needed to be done.
“With the lockdown set to continue, the NSW government now must do more to help businesses and workers save their livelihood,” he wrote.
He said the Labor government would extend business support, extend worker support, create a tourist recovery plan, initiate a rent relief program, and create an economic stimulus package similar to the Dine and Discover program.

Agencies 4.15pm: Spain, Netherlands reimpose restrictions as Delta wreaks havoc
The Spanish region of Catalonia is today set to reimpose virus restrictions in the face of rising coronavirus infections, as the highly contagious Delta strain forces nations worldwide to put the brakes on a long-awaited return to normalcy.
The highly transmissible Delta variant, first detected in India, is sweeping the globe as countries race to inoculate their populations to ward off fresh outbreaks that are increasingly affecting the unvaccinated young.
After an “exponential” rise in cases in recent days, officials in the autonomous region in the northeast of Spain said they had no choice but to reimpose restrictions.
Nightclubs will be closed as of this weekend and a negative Covid-19 test or proof of vaccination will be needed to take part in outdoor activities involving more than 500 people.
“The pandemic has not ended, the new variants are very contagious and we still have significant segments of the population that are not vaccinated,” Patricia Plaja, a spokeswoman for the regional government told a news conference.
Also set to reimpose controls Saturday is the Netherlands, where infections rose sevenfold in one week, a surge officials have blamed on the Delta variant.
Prime Minister Mark Rutte ordered the closure of all nightclubs and the curbing of restaurant hours, with visitors to eateries now required to adhere to a 1.5-metre social distancing rule.

Ellie Dudley 3.35pm: National vaccine doses top nine million
The total number of vaccine doses administered in Australia has passed nine million, after over 142,000 doses were given on Friday.
Some 5,121,480 of the total doses have been administered by the Commonwealth, while 3,892,592 have been given through the state and territory’s roll out.
8.8 per cent of eligible Australians are now fully vaccinated.

Ellie Dudley 3.16pm: WA records no new local cases
Western Australia has recorded no new community-transmitted cases of Covid-19, not any in hotel quarantine.
WA Health is monitoring 10 COVID-19 cases: five linked to the Perth northern suburbs cluster, four among returned travellers in hotel quarantine and the seafarer transferred from the MV Emerald Indah.
He remains isolated in Sir Charles Gairdner Hospital in a stable condition, a statement from WA Health read.
On Friday, 5672 people turned out for Covid-19 testing.
Western Australia Premier Mark McGowan is refusing to rule out an indefinite hard border with New South Wales should its lockdown end with COVID-19 still circulating in the community.

Ellie Dudley 2.51pm: Victoria threatens hard border with NSW as outbreak worsens
New South Wales has been warned Victoria could impose a hard border with the entire state, after 50 new infections were recorded on Saturday.
Victoria’s Chief Testing Commander Jeroen Weimar described the unfolding outbreak as “very high risk” and said there was a “significant likelihood” of their border slamming shut for the whole state.
Currently, Greater Sydney is a red zone, while regional NSW remains an orange zone under Victoria’s traffic light system.
“We are watching the situation literally hour by hour … the situation continues to evolve very, very rapidly,” Mr Weimar said.
“We are exceptionally concerned about the ongoing spread of the virus in the Greater Sydney area.”

Editorial staff writers 2.35pm: Tough decisions on opening up amid Sydney outbreak
After 18 months of being guided almost entirely by health experts in making major decisions about the pandemic, Scott Morrison and state and territory leaders have made a significant step in taking control of the issue of when to open borders and lift Covid-19 restrictions on business and the economy.
The risk assessment and recommendations of the Doherty Institute about what level of national vaccination will be required to prevent a new surge of Covid-19 and a demand on hospitals and intensive care units will be important.
Prime Minister Scott Morrison has urged Australians to "get some perspective" in our fight against coronavirus and hopes of seeing lockdown freedom.
The institute is expected to provide advice to the Prime Minister by the end of this month. It will be considered by federal, state and territory governments. But the final decision on the level of vaccination thresholds and lifting of travel and business restrictions will be made by the people’s elected representatives.
That makes sense. As Mr Morrison told Dennis Shanahan: “Only government leaders can balance all the needs and risks for both the economy and the health system.” With key decisions to be made by political leaders, they undoubtedly will spark intense community and business debate.

Ellie Dudley 2pm: Not a single Covid ICU patient fully vaccinated: Chant
Of the 47 Covid-19 cases admitted to intensive care in NSW hospitals, none have received both doses of the vaccine, chief health officer Kerry Chant has said.
“No-one who has received two doses is in hospital, and that’s a key message with this,” she said.
“Two doses of either the AstraZeneca or Pfizer vaccine is incredibly effective at preventing hospitalisation and death.”
Several police cars have been filmed in Bass Hill amid western Sydney's lockdown order.
Four had received the first dose of the AstraZeneca jab, and one had received the first jab of Pfizer.
A teenager is among those battling in ICU, hammering home the seriousness of the virus strain, Dr Chant said on Saturday.

Ellie Dudley 1.40pm: Lockdown drives online shopping surge
Almost four million Australian households have bought something online in the past fortnight, as online shopping surges in response to Sydney’s latest lockdown.
Over the past two weeks, New South Wales accounted for over a third (35.1 per cent) of all online purchases nationally and Queensland almost a fifth, new data from Australia Post revealed.
Western Australia and the Northern Territory have also grown strongly up 20.3 and 17.2 per cent respectively.
“We know that when restrictions tighten people buy more online. In fact, during lockdowns online purchase growth almost doubles when compared to non-lockdown periods,” Australia Post General Manager Parcel and Express services Ben Franzi.
“With this latest wave of the pandemic affecting different areas of the country, we’ve seen different growth patterns as many Australians experienced tight public health restrictions for the first time,” said Mr Franzi.
Sydneysiders have been banned from “browsing” while shopping in person, and are directed to “get in and get out” when purchasing groceries.

Today marks one year since the ACT has recorded a new case of locally-acquired Covid-19.
The last case, recorded on July 10 last year, was a woman in her 20s who was infected on a trip to Melbourne.
On Saturday, the territory reported no new cases of community transmission, nor none overseas.

Chris Griffiths 12.48pm: ‘Vaccine’ hunt to shield data from hackers
Just as humanity has grappled with creating a vaccine for coronavirus, some technologists say we desperately need a ‘vaccine’ for ransomware.
Ransomware is now running rampant. Hackers trick users into downloading malicious computer code that encrypts files on every device in a computer network, making code unreadable and computer systems inoperable.
Hackers demand thousands, sometimes millions of dollars, for a special key they can give you which unravels the encrypted code and your data.
In 2021 hackers are impregnating ransomware on an industrial scale and are making millions.
Colonial Pipeline in the US, JBS, the world’s biggest meat works, and this week network software provider Kaseya have been victims of recent ransomware attacks. In Kaseya’s case, hackers demanded a ransom of $US70m.

Ellie Dudley 12.15pm: Premier won’t define what constitutes an essential business
NSW Premier Gladys Berejiklian has resisted pressure to define what an essential business is, as department and clothing stores remain open across locked-down Sydney.
When pressed to define an ‘essential business’ — given some furniture and jewellery stores remained open despite a ban on browsing in shops — the Premier said health authorities simply didn’t want “anyone leaving their home unless you absolutely have to”.
“What we also appreciate is some circumstances people need to attain or essential goods, and we get that, but … certainly what police are reporting [is] that most retail outlets at the moment are completely empty,” she said.
Sydneysiders are not permitted to browse in stores, and have been directed when grocery shopping to “get in and get out.”
“As Dr (Kerry) Chant and I have been saying for days, if you can go online, click and collect. We are saying people to stay home, only leave home if you absolutely have to,” Ms Berejiklian said.
“Please plan ahead. Work out logistically what will ensure minimal contact with anybody else.”

Ellie Dudley 11.40am: Premier hints at longer lockdown
NSW Premier Gladys Berejiklian has indicated Sydneysiders — already entering their third week of Covid lockdown — should brace themselves for the very real possibility of further extensions to stay-at-home orders.
“The only conclusion we can draw is that things are going to get worse before they get better,” she said, after announcing 50 new local cases of Covid in 24 hours.
“I think it is pretty clear that unless we reduce that level of people in the community that are infectious, we won’t be able to turn things around as quickly as we can or as quickly as we should.”
Ms Berejiklian, who expressed frustration at people continuing to flout lockdown rules and lying to contact tracers, knocked back suggestions she should have called a lockdown earlier, and said she had “full confidence” in the advice she received at the time.
“What I do know is we have some of the best health experts, best advisers from contributions from the private sector, from business, contributing to the New South Wales Government’s ability to make decisions, and I have full confidence in the experts we rely on,” she said.
“The length of this lockdown is up to each and every one of us,” she said.
“I wouldn’t give you a date or tell you a date unless we have more evidence and know that we’ve turned things around.
“But as soon as we do know, as soon as we do have any information, of course we will convey it.”
She added the “full effect” of the lockdown wouldn’t be known for another “few days.”

Ellie Dudley 11.25am: Parties broken up as police crack down
A total of 167 infringement notices were issued across Sydney on Friday, 67 in southwest Sydney, where 100 police officers were deployed to enforce stricter stay-at-home orders.
“Overwhelmingly, the response by police, when I speak to them, is that the vast majority of people in southwest Sydney are being compliant,” NSW Police Deputy Commissioner Gary Worboys said.
“They are staying at home when they’re out, they are wearing a mask, the efforts by people in southwest Sydney in this first 24 hours have been commendable.”
Deputy Commissioner Worboys said two parties — one in Randwick in Sydney’s east, and one on the Central Coast — had been broken up yesterday after people were found to have breached the public health orders.
“The Premier has made it very clear, in terms of the critical space that we are in at the moment, when people invite others to their house, it is a conscious decision to go against the public health order and put the health of themselves,” he said.

Ellie Dudley 11.15am: Teen now among those in ICU
NSW chief health officer Kerry Chant has urged Sydneysiders to “hunker down” this weekend, and get tested if “the most minimal of symptoms” arise.
Dr Chant reminded the state that Covid-19 is a “severe disease” associated with hospitalisation, for people of all ages.
“Of the 16 people in ICU, one is in their teens,” she said.
“One is in their 20s. One is in their 30s. One is in their 40s. Three are in their 50s, six are in their 60s, two are in their 70s, one is in their 80s.
Dr Chant echoed the words of Premier Gladys Berejiklian, urging people who test positive to “tell us the truth the first time”.

“We know that everyone is human and makes poor decisions at certain times, but please don’t compound that initial mistake by not telling us the truth the first time,” she said.
“At the moment, as we’re trying to get ahead of the spread of the virus, we haven’t got time to waste unpicking stories, going back and cross-checking and verifying. It is really essential to tell us the first time.”

Ellie Dudley 11.02am: NSW records 50 new local cases
NSW has recorded 50 new local cases of Covid-19, the largest daily number since the latest outbreak began.
More than half — 26 cases — were infectious in the community.
“When you know that when there are 26 cases infectious in the community, the only conclusion we can draw is that things are going to get worse before they get better,” Premier Gladys Berejiklian said.
Twenty-nine new cases were detected in southwest Sydney, with a further 16 in the city’s east.
More than 40 people have now been hospitalised with the illness.
Ms Berejiklian used a press conference on Saturday morning to plead with people to tell the truth to contact tracers “the first time”, suggesting people have not been honest about their movements while infectious.
The Premier said the state could not “turn things around” until the level of infectious people in the community was reduced.
A total of 42,023 tests were conducted over the past 24 hours
Ms Berjiklian stressed that the “vast majority” of new cases were family of existing infections, again urging Sydneysiders to “stick to the rules.”
“People are getting the virus and then spreading it to those closest to them,” she said.
“If you truly love your parents, your sisters, your best friends, please stick to the rules.”
Ms Berejiklian said “cutting corners” or “flouting the rules” would prolong the lockdown.

Ellie Dudley 10.26am: Education department recovers from cyber attack
While teachers and students across Sydney prepare for online learning next week, the NSW Department of Education is recovering from a cyber attack.
Staff, including principals and teachers, lost access to emails and priority applications such as Zoom and Microsoft Office over the past week.
The Department assured staff that the system is now in recovery, and they will regain access this week.
“I want to thank all staff for their patience as we have worked through our response,” Georgina Harrisson, NSW Education Secretary, said.
“I know the timing of this attack has been challenging for our principals, teachers and administrative staff so I am grateful for the understanding shown and for the messages of support we’ve received.”

Chandni Vasandani 10.05am: ‘Turned away by hospitals to die slowly’
Fenita had already been turned away by dozens of hospitals by the time she turned in desperation to social media, sending out an SOS for an ICU bed for her critically ill father who was struggling to breathe and losing consciousness three days after testing positive for the coronavirus.
The family from Tangerang, on the western fringe of Indonesia’s teeming capital Jakarta, had bought an oxygen cylinder for 3.8 million rupiah ($350) from a local e-commerce site — almost five times the usual retail price — but it had become rapidly clear it was not going to be enough to keep her 60-year-old father alive.
“We must have gone to at least 20 hospitals and called dozens more, but all of them turned us away … they were all overloaded,” Fenita told The Weekend Australian. “Five hours after I posted for help, my father died.”
One hospital had offered Fenita’s father a wheelchair to sit on in its emergency waiting room, but could not promise he would get the medical attention he needed and would not allow any family to accompany him. Afraid that their father might die alone in a busy hospital corridor, the family turned down the offer.
“At least this way he died at home, with his family around him,” Fenita said of her father, who died early Sunday night.
Indonesia is in the grip of a deadly coronavirus surge that many public health officials had warned would be the inevitable result of a mass movement of more than six million people in May during the Eid holiday.
The country recorded more than 1000 deaths on Wednesday — but many more probably went unrecorded in the archipelagic nation’s more remote islands — leading to “a queue of ambulances” outside Jakarta’s allotted Covid-19 burial grounds.

Lydia Lynch 8am: States set to slam borders shut
Queensland and Victoria are considering closing their borders to NSW as the state’s Covid-19 outbreak grows and health authorities grapple with concerns some Sydneysiders aren’t complying with public health orders.
The threat of longer, tougher border restrictions has business and tourism leaders concerned about ongoing decimation of consumer confidence.
Australia’s tourism industry is faced with a choice of “bad or very bad”, Queensland Tourism Industry Council chief executive Daniel Gschwind said.
“Either borders are closed, we lose business but can maintain a more relaxed environment here in Queensland, or we have permeable borders but more drastic social distancing measures,” Mr Gschwind said.
“The brief lockdown in Brisbane and more extended lockdown in Sydney have caused enormous economic hardship in our industry and it is becoming far more difficult to recover from these impacts the more often they occur.
“We need a long-term national solution, we need to get our vaccination rates a lot higher so we can do away with these lockdowns altogether.”

Dennis Shanahan 7.30am: Vaccine thresholds set higher here than in US and UK
Australians face higher Covid-19 vaccination thresholds to reopen the nation than in Britain or the US because of much lower levels of community immunity from people who have already contracted and recovered from the virus.
Scott Morrison and state and territory leaders have agreed to take control of the final decision on the vaccination targets that will be used to ease Covid-19 restrictions on business and reopen the borders under the Prime Minister’s four-step plan.
Mr Morrison told The Weekend Australian: “Only government leaders can balance all the needs and risks for both the economy and the health system.”
The Doherty Institute will provide initial advice on scientific modelling for the setting of vaccine thresholds, a spectrum of risk assessments and the potential impact on state health systems.
The institute will also provide recommendations on tiered vaccine thresholds for cross-demographic groups.
Despite public calls from business leaders and some MPs for relatively low, simple vaccination thresholds to be set under the four-step plan endorsed by national cabinet last week, there will not be a single “magic bullet” number.

Yoni Bashan 7am: State braces for a long dark Covid winter
NSW cabinet ministers have begun preparing for a prolonged lockdown across Greater Sydney, amid growing concerns the current Covid-19 outbreak will not be contained without extensive and firmer measures forcing people to stay indoors.
Signalling a marked change in rhetoric, Premier Gladys Berejiklian tightened Covid restrictions across Sydney on Friday and said the state would not be able to live with the virus, as some colleagues had suggested, until vaccination rates substantially improved.
She said it was unlikely the ­current lockdown settings would be eased without a substantial drop in case numbers, which was unlikely to eventuate over the coming days due to high ­numbers of infected people continuing to be identified in the community.
As her government tries to balance public safety with the pleas of shuttered businesses, a stoush has erupted with the commonwealth over who should pay for further funding assistance, with the federal government telling state officials to finance their own rescue package by going further into debt.
State officials have likewise asked the commonwealth to do the same.
A spokesman for NSW Treasurer Dominic Perrottet said talks were continuing with federal Treasurer Josh Frydenberg, but a second official familiar with the matter blasted the commonwealth for its position.
The official said: “We’re in this mess because we’ve carried the burden on quarantine. (The) feds have blundered (the) vaccine rollout. Why do they think they should not contribute? The virus isn’t a state issue.”

Full text: If 60 per cent of adults and children over the age of five are vaccinated by some time next year and Australia opens borders to a managed number of people from countries with low Covid-19 case numbers, it is likely we would record between two and three infections a day and 23 deaths in a year.
That’s one scenario revealed in modelling completed by University of Melbourne epidemiologists, who have estimated case numbers and deaths depending on how many infected travellers are allowed in to the country plotted against vaccination rates.
Tony Blakely, who led the team that completed the modelling, based on Victoria’s second wave, said it was unlikely Australia would be able to fully open up to all travellers with no quarantine requirements before 2023.
Scott Morrison last week laid out a four-stage plan to Australia’s return to normal life living with Covid-19, and he has pinned each stage to as yet undetermined vaccination rates.
But Professor Blakely said the milestones should be more nuanced and should include consideration of mitigation strategies such as masking and the ongoing role of contact tracing.
“Vaccines alone will not get us herd immunity,” Professor Blakely said. “We need to start thinking about what our risk tolerance is. One of the things we have the most control over is the number of people coming into Australia per day who are infected.
“The really good news is that we can actually make that pretty low.” He said by requiring inter­national travellers to be vaccinated and to have a PCR test before flying here, it would be possible to keep the number of infected travellers entering the country to just 0.2 a day if those travellers were coming from countries with low Covid-19 case numbers such as Vietnam.
Australia could allow 4250 people from countries with low infection rates a day to enter the country, half the pre-Covid-19 volume, and still keep the number of infected travellers to 0.2.
Professor Blakely’s modelling assumes that the Delta variant or subsequent variants have a reproductive number of five or six, although he thinks six is most likely.
If children were not vaccinated, case numbers at these settings would be higher at between 22 per day with 186 deaths a year.
If only 50 per cent of the whole population including children was vaccinated, applying the same settings, case number would be 16 a day, with 171 deaths a year. Deaths a year would drop to just 6.1 if 80 per cent of the whole adult population was vaccinated.

Full text: If 60 per cent of adults and children over the age of five are vaccinated by some time next year and Australia opens borders to a managed number of people from countries with low Covid-19 case numbers, it is likely we would record between two and three infections a day and 23 deaths in a year.
That’s one scenario revealed in modelling completed by University of Melbourne epidemiologists, who have estimated case numbers and deaths depending on how many infected travellers are allowed in to the country plotted against vaccination rates.
Tony Blakely, who led the team that completed the modelling, based on Victoria’s second wave, said it was unlikely Australia would be able to fully open up to all travellers with no quarantine requirements before 2023.
Scott Morrison last week laid out a four-stage plan to Australia’s return to normal life living with Covid-19, and he has pinned each stage to as yet undetermined vaccination rates.
But Professor Blakely said the milestones should be more nuanced and should include consideration of mitigation strategies such as masking and the ongoing role of contact tracing.
“Vaccines alone will not get us herd immunity,” Professor Blakely said. “We need to start thinking about what our risk tolerance is. One of the things we have the most control over is the number of people coming into Australia per day who are infected.
“The really good news is that we can actually make that pretty low.” He said by requiring inter­national travellers to be vaccinated and to have a PCR test before flying here, it would be possible to keep the number of infected travellers entering the country to just 0.2 a day if those travellers were coming from countries with low Covid-19 case numbers such as Vietnam.
Australia could allow 4250 people from countries with low infection rates a day to enter the country, half the pre-Covid-19 volume, and still keep the number of infected travellers to 0.2.
Professor Blakely’s modelling assumes that the Delta variant or subsequent variants have a reproductive number of five or six, although he thinks six is most likely.
If children were not vaccinated, case numbers at these settings would be higher at between 22 per day with 186 deaths a year.
If only 50 per cent of the whole population including children was vaccinated, applying the same settings, case number would be 16 a day, with 171 deaths a year. Deaths a year would drop to just 6.1 if 80 per cent of the whole adult population was vaccinated.

Lockdowns ‘can stop in two months’ when Covid-19 vaccines hit 30pc

Full text: As the number of vaccinations hit a daily record of more than 163,000 on Friday, Deakin University’s chair in epidemiology Catherine Bennett said the proportion of people fully vaccinated to avoid the need for lockdowns would be in the order of 30 per cent – a prospect that was likely to be only a couple of months away.
“Thirty per cent is probably enough that it slows the spread of the virus and means contact tracers should be able to do their job,” she said. “It should mean that we’re less likely to need to go to these extreme measures.”
Once the vaccination rate reached between 50 and 65 per cent of a population, transmission of Covid-19 was significantly slowed, allowing the easing of restrictions and a gradual opening of international borders while keeping mitigation measures such as home quarantine in place.
More than 30 per cent of Australians now have received at least one vaccine dose, with 7,970,153 doses administered. The proportion of the population fully vaccinated is 8.37 per cent, and this will rise quickly within the coming weeks with millions of people scheduled to receive their second AstraZeneca shot.
Almost all residential aged-care facilities have been visited for first and second doses, with only three more facilities remaining for second-dose visits.
International modelling has indicated that vaccine coverage of about 80 per cent would be required to allow for fully open borders and the easing of all restrictions aimed at curbing Covid-19. Professor Bennett said Australia might never get to that level.
“Eighty per cent coverage is what people would like to see, but that’s completely opening up and removing your quarantine,” Professor Bennett said.
“So it’s about how you step your way up to that. But at the end of the day, I think if you say ‘actually, we’re opening up the borders regardless at the end of March’, because that’s when everyone can be vaccinated, then I think you can’t be saying ‘we haven’t quite met the 80 per cent, therefore we’re not going to do it’.”
COVID-19 Australia: Cumulative vaccinations by state
The federal government has commissioned modelling to identify the threshold of vaccination required to begin to open up international borders and that work is not yet complete.
Burnet Institute director Brendan Crabb said announcing that the threshold level was yet to be determined was “honest” of the Prime Minister.
“The reason why being cautious is important is because you can start to open without relying on some force shield immunity,” Professor Crabb said. “Of course we want herd immunity, that’s the ultimate goal, but we could be waiting forever for that.”
He said a minimum threshold for beginning to open up borders in a managed way was 60 per cent of all people vaccinated, including children.
“If your only goal is preventing serious illness and death you’d need less vaccine coverage than if your goal was preventing all transmission,” he said. “But I think 60 per cent is the point at which you can start to think there is a chance that community-based immunity is going to stop transmission chains.
“What should be the aim is high enough vaccine coverage with non-vaccine mitigations including mask wearing, the judicious use of border protection and, most importantly, well-ventilated workplaces and recreational facilities of any sort.”
La Trobe University epidemiologist Hassan Vally agreed about 60 per cent vaccine coverage was likely to have a significant impact on disease transmission and would see minimal deaths and hospitalisations. But he was doubtful herd immunity could ever be achieved.

Epidemiologist Tony Blakely says children should be vaccinated against Covid

Full text: If we can squash the latest outbreak, and if people keep getting vaccinated, and if quarantine arrangements improve, the future will nevertheless be blotted with alarms, mistakes and misjudgements.
Blakely likens 2022 to a plane taking off, when the flight is buffeted by cumulus clouds before reaching cruising altitude. The ifs are myriad, and Blakely’s professional calling, a kind of scientific crystal ball gazing, is all about the ifs.
He applies the available information for his forecast.
AstraZeneca is vital to the fight, he says, but it has weaknesses. AstraZeneca is very good at protecting a person from serious illness, not so good (perhaps 50 per cent reduction in getting infected) at limiting transmissions.
Blakely hypothesises that if more than 70 per cent of the adult population gets vaccinated, decision-makers will look to open connections with other countries.
Herein lies his first point — the need for purpose-built quarantine facilities, such as those announced Friday. Their absence has cost Australia, and Victoria, again and again.
Lessons from aerosol transmission have been ignored, which explains why Melbourne is in its fourth lockdown.
Specialised hubs, which rate risks according to country of origin, could reduce quarantine breaches by about 90 per cent.
Under Blakely’s scenario, virus outbreaks, therefore, will continue from time to time. Contact tracers will be busy for years.
In some good news, Blakely is confident that contact tracing – once a particularly Victorian failing — can mop up spreads before they flourish.
But something in the projections continues to be overlooked, he warns. Children may be largely protected from the ravages of Covid. Yet kids still contract and transmit the virus.
Blakely turns to rough maths. If 70 per cent of the adult population is vaccinated, and if adults comprise more than three in four Australians, then about 50 per cent of the total population will be buffered from virus spread. The other half will be exposed to catching and spreading the virus.

SHOULD KIDS BE VACCINATED? Blakely foreshadows a national conversation that has yet to be had — to vaccinate our children.
“Kids will have to be vaccinated, in my view, or 100 per cent of adults, which we won’t achieve,” he says.
“Kids being vaccinated is going to be an interesting dilemma, because the kids don’t get much personal protection from it. Mum and Dad are going to be sitting there going, ‘why should I vaccinate my kid?’ We will need to start talking about this in a couple of months’ time but we can start articulating it now a little bit.”
Like weather forecasting, epidemiology is the science of reading the clues, sorting them according to which will prevail or dim. Blakely likes a pinball machine analogy, a kind of scientific moving of the flippers to see what effect it will have on the pinball’s movement.
Epidemiology has never been so vital, its purview so immediate and urgent As with weather people, Melburnians can now identify their favoured epidemiologists.
Bearers of wisdom, epidemiologists are also the bringers of bad tidings. Their unfettered judgments can double as the voices of reason. They are driven by the science, as opposed to the politics of policymaking.
As it happens, Blakely lives in the next suburb, so we meet in a nearby park, a peculiarly Melbourne choice of venue in lockdown.
Oaks soar above. Replica cannons — a preferred backdrop for Jeff Kennett press conferences when he was premier — stand nearby.
Older couples sip coffee amid the falling leaves, and so do not watch Acting Premier James Merlino announcing a week extension to the current lockdown.
Blakely unhitches his bike helmet and starts talking – fast. He is hurry, hurry, as you might expect of a pandemic expert during a pandemic, and fond of words such as “bonkers” and “bollocks” to describe poor policy choices.
He rose to prominence last year. He modelled the road map which the Andrews Government applied to a second 111-day lockdown last year, though he emphasises that his work was based on science and not policy, a distinction that can often go unappreciated.
An “explainer”, as he fashioned himself, the University of Melbourne professor described the projected virtues and pitfalls of containing an entire population for months on end.
He was in “the right place at the right time”, he says. But it was fraught. Hate mail grew, and he was pilloried by some in the media. He was cast as a “puppeteer”, and blamed for an at times demoralising elimination strategy which relied on a sustained lockdown.
He was untethered to political imperatives, unafraid of the “E — word” (elimination), which he came to advocate, not as an ideal so much as a consequence of an aggressive suppression approach.
For a time, Blakely deliberately stepped back from public pronouncements. But it was short-lived, perhaps a few days. He felt compelled to tell Melburnians why this or that was happening and extrapolate what might happen next.
This public perch can be “nerve-racking”. Yet Blakely has been unafraid to identify sustained failings, such as contact tracing in Victoria last year, or the continuing failures of hotel quarantine, to apply his analysis of the past, present and future scenarios.
He happily admits when he has got it wrong. Last year, he tended to favour a 10-case-a-day trigger for the easing of Melbourne restrictions. The Andrews Government went with a higher bar – and subsequently longer lockdown period – of only five cases a day.
“I was surprised the government went for five a day, I expected 10 a day, but they were right,” he says.
“Allen Cheng and Brett Sutton made a brave call, we’ll go for five, and obviously what was in the back of their mind was the good chance of elimination. Their foresight and bravery at holding at five cases a day deserves accolades.”
Accused of being “Dan’s Man”, to his amusement and frustration, Blakely also finds plenty to criticise about last year’s approach. He is cautious about accepting the current government line of the super-infectious virus variant.
Instead, he suspects that contact tracing last year was so cumbersome – largely because the Health Department was so under-resourced – that investigators can now make connections in virus chains that they once could not.
Blakely lucked in with the timing his long-hoped for move to Melbourne, from Wellington in New Zealand. His marriage had broken down; his now partner also works at the University of Melbourne.
He arrived in January, 2019. Within 12 months his diverging professional interests, including tobacco use, obesity and diet, were whittled to the one subject that all of Melbourne could not ignore.
He was an outsider – on the inside.
Early in his career, a former New Zealand prime minister working on behalf of the tobacco industry, publicly called out Blakely’s research. It can be “tricky”, he says in describing an occupational hazard, when modelling and estimates are only as reliable as the information to hand.

Virus more likely to have leaked from a lab in Wuhan
New information has shifted Blakely’s view on the virus origin. He now tends to think, after reading recent studies of the virus’ genetic make-up, that the spread was more likely to have leaked from a lab in Wuhan than through an intermediary animal host.
Natural evolution seems unlikely to explain the genetic changes. Tests on 80,000 animals between the bat population and Wuhan itself show no evidence of intermediary hosts.
“What does it mean for us right now?” he asks. “Not a lot. What does it mean for us going forward? Well, it means we have to relook at our lab biosecurity.”
Blakely marvels at the political pointscoring that drives so much of the Australian pandemic discourse. There will be more pandemics, he says. They are inevitable.
“There are some big lessons from this and one is that human beings sense of self-sanctimony, that we are somehow different to the animal kingdom,” he says.
“No, we’re not, we’re part of the same ecology, and infections spread between animals, and that will happen again in the future.”
More immediately, we need to keep refining our responses to the current crisis.
“What struck me when the pandemic took off was that the people with most expertise to help the public with understanding were essentially gagged,” he says.
“They were on committees in which they basically couldn’t speak up. I think that’s part of that silo research here (in Australia), that there’s not enough generalist research activity.
“Because I was new to the country, and wasn’t on committees like that, I happened to be in a position where I could talk freely. And I did.”

Full text: New Zealand’s bold call to “go hard and go early” one year ago has been further validated by new modelling suggesting Covid-19 elimination was the best option for the economy and public health.
The new Australian study has offered a glimpse at what New Zealand might have faced in 2020, had it picked trying to live with the virus over opting to wipe it out altogether with hard-line measures such as lockdown.
The study simulated four different responses in the state of Victoria – which has a similar age, population and income structure to New Zealand – then analysed how each of them performed against various health and economic indicators.
“From where I sit, this is possibly the best paper yet to try to integrate the epidemiology and economics, so we can ask what’s best for society,” said lead author Professor Tony Blakely, a Kiwi epidemiologist at the University of Melbourne.
The four modelled responses included “aggressive” and “moderate” elimination – both of which aimed to stamp out the virus altogether, but at different paces.
Blakely described aggressive elimination as “going hard”, and likened it to New Zealand’s rapid, zero-tolerance approach.
Moderate elimination was more akin to New South Wales’ method, which Blakely said was “not so aggressive, but getting there all the same”.
The other two strategies – “tight” and “loose” suppression – effectively aimed to minimise spread while living with the virus, and had respective targets of keeping daily cases per million people to between one and five, and five and 25.
The study, published online ahead of peer review, also used two different types of models.
One was an “agent-based” model to estimate daily infection rates and the time it took to reduce them across Victoria’s four-stage system, which was similar to New Zealand’s.
The other model captured a wider picture, estimating long-term health impacts arising from the virus along with costs to the health system, and to GDP.
The study found that while the number of days in hard lockdown were similar across all four strategies, “aggressive” elimination came with the highest percentage of days with the lowest level of restrictions.
It also showed the long-term health impacts of aggressive and moderate elimination were similar, and relatively low, but those for tight and loose suppression were nearly eight and 40 times higher, respectively.
In terms of virus-related deaths over a year-long period, aggressive and moderate elimination kept mortality numbers to 58 and 64 – while the two suppression approaches came with 483 and 2249 deaths.
The total cost to the economy was estimated to be relatively similar between all strategies, but, from the perspective of health-system related costs, aggressive elimination proved the best option.
For instance, health expenditure costs for the first year came in at $3.7m for aggressive elimination, compared with $117m for loose suppression.
Blakely said those results were relevant to New Zealand, which made for a “fairly good substitute” for the state.
He said while there some uncertainties and overlaps between the four modelled responses, “when you weigh it up across them, the elimination responses are optimal”.
“That’s probably as good as we’re ever going to get to being able to understand what we should have done in 2020,” he said.
“And I think it’s very reassuring for both Australia and New Zealand that we pursued an elimination goal.”
Blakely added that the study also captured possible unintended effects of lockdown, like anxiety and depression, but found these didn’t change the overall conclusions.
University of Canterbury and Te Punaha Matatini Covid-19 modeller Professor Michael Plank agreed the results could generally apply to New Zealand.
He pointed specifically to the far fewer deaths and hospitalisations that came with elimination — and all at similar economic cost.
“This suggests when short sharp lockdowns are needed to control outbreaks, the short term pain is worth the long term gain,” Plank said.
“This will continue to be the case until we reach a high level of vaccine coverage in the population.”

Full text: Jason Thompson was driving north on the Midland Highway when Daniel Andrews came over the car radio to announce Victoria's road map out of COVID-19 lockdown. As the Premier detailed the stringent conditions that would need to be met, Thompson found himself admiring the chutzpah. "I was actually surprised they went for it," he says.
It was September 6 and Thompson, a clinical psychologist and senior research fellow from the Melbourne School of Design, had emerged as an unlikely influencer behind a decision that would affect everyone in the state.
With Victoria on the downslope of its second wave and new case numbers falling below 100 a day, heavy hitters in the Victorian and national business communities had demanded the road map.
Prime Minister Scott Morrison and Federal Treasurer Josh Frydenberg were publicly campaigning for it. Restaurant and cafe owners were desperate, as were people who'd been cut off from friends and family for two months.
Thompson was a member of a Melbourne University research team, led by epidemiologist Tony Blakely, asked to provide scientific modelling to inform the exit strategy. The modelling didn't tell the Andrews government what it should do, but provided a series of projections about the risk of a further epidemic before Christmas.
The most important variable - essentially a political one - was how far the government was willing to push case numbers down before it allowed things to reopen. Although Andrews didn't say it out loud, it was clear to Thompson as he drove from his Castlemaine home to Bendigo that the government had decided to go all-in; it planned to eliminate the virus.
Chief Health Officer Brett Sutton had already framed a message for the new phase of the public health campaign: "We're going for zero."
The road map modelling provided something straight epidemiology doesn't. It was as much an exercise in predicting and forecasting human behaviour as the infection patterns of a virus.
This is where Thompson brought something different to the team. He had worked in client research for Victoria's Transport Accident Commission, where he reshaped how the government's statutory third-party liability insurer thought about road injuries.
Since its establishment, the TAC hadn't kept records about whose fault an accident was. As a no-fault insurer, what did it matter?
Thompson had a hunch that it did. He combed through old police records and discovered people injured in an accident that wasn't their fault took substantially longer to return to work and were more likely to experience depression than drivers with similar injuries from an accident that was their fault. The failure to understand this human response to culpability had cost Victorian taxpayers a lot of money.
The Melbourne University model was an attempt to take the flat, mathematical science of epidemiology and see how it played in the real world. It was less worried about flattening the curve of Melbourne's second wave, already on a downward trajectory, than in ensuring that once the virus was contained it wouldn't come back.
"It was a different way of thinking about what their options were," Thompson says.
Those options provoked intense debate within the crisis council of cabinet, seven ministers handpicked by Andrews to oversee Victoria's pandemic response. The sticking point was whether Victoria should take the biggest step - lifting stay-at-home orders, removing the curfew and allowing retail and hospitality to reopen - once the daily average of new infections had dropped to 10, or to hold until it dropped to an average of five.
The crisis council was split between ministers pushing for a less conservative approach and those for whom the fear of a third wave was overwhelming.
The advice from Sutton was that Victoria needed to ensure all community transmission had been snuffed out.
The Premier was torn between going for elimination of all community transmission and his concern that a longer lockdown would erode public support.
As Thompson continued driving, the Premier reached the most critical junction in the road map. Retail and hospitality would remain shut until there was an average of just five new cases a day.
"That's gutsy to go for five," Thompson thought to himself. "There is going to be a lot of pain between 10 and five. You will end up in a better position, but it is extremely politically gutsy."
Not everyone was convinced. On August 31, the Monday before the road map was announced, about 150 people representing businesses across the state and nation dialled into a Zoom meeting with Department of Jobs, Precincts and Regions Secretary Simon Phemister and Deputy Chief Health Officer Allen Cheng.
There were too many people on the call for anyone to ask a question. The longer it went on, the more the frustration of business owners and representatives grew.
Throughout the pandemic, a contrast had emerged between the way businesses were able to engage with the government of Gladys Berejiklian in NSW and the Andrews government in Victoria.
Throughout the initial, national lockdown introduced in March, the NSW Treasury established weekly meetings with business groups and leaders, while the federal government called in Gordon De Brouwer, a former environment and energy secretary, to lead a business liaison unit. In both these forums, information flowed freely between government and business.
"It was democracy at its best; constant discussion, weekly meetings, highly structured," says Business Council of Australia chief executive Jennifer Westacott. "Decisions were made early on that allowed the country to come back more strongly."
In Victoria, business found it difficult to access basic information from the Andrews government or meaningfully engage with decision makers.
"It was collaborative in Queensland, it was collaborative in South Australia it was collaborative in NSW and the ACT," says Restaurant & Catering Australia chief Wes Lambert. "In Victoria we weren't part of the decision process, we were just being told what was going to happen."
"Nobody was disputing we had to take drastic action at 700 cases a day," Westacott tells The Age. "What we were saying was 'let us help you problem-solve our way through this so we don't end up with other consequences, like entire industries having to shut down'."
By the time the Andrews government announced its road map, its relationship with business had turned toxic. Ben Logan, a former opera singer who discovered a second career running the city restaurant of chef Ronnie di Stasio, found himself channelling the anger of an industry scorned.
What began as a series whimsical messages on his LinkedIn account morphed into an online message board for restaurant owners, waitstaff and chefs locked out of their own kitchens.
The pot boiled over on October 25 when Andrews announced a "cautious pause" — a 24-hour delay on easing restrictions. The next morning, Logan was invited onto Fran Kelly's ABC Radio National program.
"It has been Armageddon for the hospitality industry. We need people and honestly, people need to get back to restaurants," he began.
"The Premier has lied to Victorians. The Premier has time and time again given Victorians a road map. Today, if you look at the numbers, there are no new cases of COVID-19 in Victoria today. There is none. There has not been one single death. For the past however many hundred days we have had Dan's daily sermon. The man has come out and said 'just hold faith, hold the line, today is a good day'. Well, it is not a good day, Dan, when my children only had the opportunity to go back to school today."
Looking back from where Melbourne is today, it is tempting to dismiss Logan's outburst as an overreaction. What was one more day, given Melbourne had been locked down for 110?
"Throughout that real hard lockdown, there was no hope," Logan tells The Age. "When there was the expectation that things would ease we had hope again, only for the rug to be pulled out from underneath our feet. It was a pause but it was just shattering."
Westacott says Logan was not alone in this view. "It's that lack of respect for business," she says.
In response to these criticisms, the Andrews mantra was clear: until you defeat the virus, you cannot rebuild the economy. This did little to appease business but resonated strongly elsewhere in the community. Until the final day of lockdown, the overwhelming majority of Victorians remained resolutely compliant with the restrictions in place.
The economic cost of Victoria's second wave has started to emerge. Federal Treasury Deputy Secretary Luke Yeaman, called to give evidence to Senate estimates on the day of Victoria's "cautious pause", laid bare the bleak calculus confronting the state. For every day that Melbourne was locked down in August and September, an average of 1200 people lost their jobs and $100 million in economic activity was foregone.
These figures do not make the case that Melbourne shouldn't have gone into lockdown. When Andrews announced stage four restrictions on August 2, the decision was supported by Morrison, welcomed by other state and territory leaders and not opposed by Victorian Opposition Leader Michael O'Brien. "We simply must prevail and get this virus back under control, despite how bitter the medicine is," O'Brien said.
As Melbourne University professor of economics Bruce Preston pointed out to The Age at the time, the greatest cost to the economy was the virus, not lockdown, and either way a recession was unavoidable.
The worst part of the economic tale will be in the tail; the lingering unemployment every recession brings. In his November budget, Victorian Treasurer Tim Pallas forecast unemployment should be peaking about now at 8.25 per cent. Yeaman told the Senate hearing the effective unemployment rate in Victoria was already 14.5 per cent. This counts people receiving the JobKeeper subsidy as well as the JobSeeker payment.
The jobs tally will become evident at the end of March, when the JobKeeper scheme runs out.
Other costs are more difficult to calculate. On May 15, shortly before the first COVID-19 case broke out of hotel quarantine, Professor Patrick McGorry presented a sobering insight into what the pandemic would mean for the mental health of Victorian teenagers and young adults.
Standing next to Martin Foley, Victoria's Minister for Mental Health, McGorry warned that as many as 370,000 additional Victorians, including 82,000 between the ages of 12 and 25, would experience mental health disorders.
The prediction was based on modelling conducted by health economist Matthew Hamilton and commissioned by Orygen, a Melbourne-based organisation specialising in youth mental health.
It showed the greatest risk to young people was not the virus but disengagement from school, work and friends and loss of employment prospects. The "mental health wave" would peak three years from now.
McGorry, who is executive director of Orygen, says the modelling has proven accurate, with one caveat; where Hamilton expected there to be a delay in young people presenting with mental health problems related to the pandemic, they have come in a rush.
"We are seeing a 30 per cent rise in need for care and that is spilling into the emergency departments because our system is at capacity," McGorry says.
"If you talk to any emergency department directors that is what they are seeing, especially young people with self-harm and suicidal behaviour."
Mental health problems are often multi-faceted. This makes it difficult to attribute causation to either Melbourne's second wave or the lockdown.
But McGorry has no doubt the COVID-19 crisis and public health response were diabolical for mental health. Writing last month in the Australian Journal of Medicine, he explained: "After acute disasters, most people experience a transitory wave of distress that is considered normal and they do not generally require professional care. COVID-19 is fundamentally different.
"It is not a single shock, but a vast, expanding disaster with no end in sight, producing chronic stress, disruption and multiple losses, and many of the usual mitigation strategies are banned or unavailable.
"Modelling and earlier recessions show that it is the economic consequences, especially financial stress, unemployment and educational failure, that fuel mental ill health and suicide risk.
"This impact ... will produce a long, deep second wave of mental ill health and suicide."
Andrews described Victoria's second wave as a public health bushfire. Professor Ian Hickie, the co-director of health and policy at the University of Sydney's Brain and Mind Centre, says the mental health impact is worse.
"Chronic, unpredictable stress is much worse than acute, predictable stress," he says.
"While terrible things happen like bushfires and floods, their longer-term mental health effects are mitigated by the fact they are over quickly and communities pull together. This thing is chronic, unpredictable, ongoing and socially dislocating."
Hickie says Victoria's lockdown, although successful in snuffing out the virus, was a "very draconian, very law and order-type approach" driven by a top-down focus on case numbers at the expense of other public health considerations.
Nathan Grills, an expert in public health at Melbourne University, makes a similar point: "If you come from an infectious disease background all you can see is the infectious disease or the virus. From a public health point of view you look at the bigger picture; what is the effect of the lockdown on the community, what is a proportionate response given the impact on education, mental health, the economy or livelihoods?
"That doesn't mean the lockdowns and interventions weren't correct. It is a matter of doing it with balance."
No one blames this government alone for the parlous state of public health in Victoria, a consequence of decisions made 25 years ago, when the Kennett government devolved the health system.
As Australian Medical Association Victorian president Julian Rait points out, when Victoria was hollowing out its public health resources, NSW was establishing the regional and suburban units which responded so effectively to outbreaks across Sydney.
Deakin University epidemiologist Professor Catherine Bennett says she can't remember another time when her field of scientific expertise has been so politicised. Throughout the pandemic, she became a familiar voice of calm, measured dissent, increasingly concerned at how and why decisions were being made.
She questioned the scientific justification of the curfew and five-kilometre rule and more broadly, why the government was intent on linking the spread of the virus to the movement of people in the absence of data supporting this.
She questioned why masks needed to be worn in the open and why, beneath the damning headline of the genomic report which linked the entire second wave to hotel quarantine, the government was unable to recognise its own success in stopping the first wave.
"We had every chance, if it hadn't been for hotel quarantine, to have eliminated transmission Australia-wide back in June," she says. "Fear and guilt prevented the government from learning from what it did right first time round."
Victoria's response to the COVID-19 crisis is scaling down. The DHHS has nearly 1000 contact tracers paid up until next June but thankfully they are without a case to trace.
Professor Allen Cheng, brought into DHHS at the height of the crisis, has nearly finished his secondment and will soon be back at his day job at The Alfred hospital.
Before he goes, he would like us to consider one last thing: The "prevention paradox" of public health. When public health is doing its job the community feels safe and sooner or later, governments question whether they can cut things a little to save money.
"Prevention is always difficult to get funding for," he says.
"I hope this has shown the value of a good public health system and thinking about it long-term and setting up structures that will endure."

Full text: Two weeks worth of class members at a popular F45 in Sydney must go into isolation immediately, after a new case was diagnosed on Thursday. Victorian Premier Daniel Andrews has revealed almost $2m worth of taxpayer-funded research done for his government by a Labor strategist who boasts that “public opinion is a fluid thing that we can squeeze, pump and stir” has been classified as “cabinet in confidence” and will be kept secret from the public who paid for it.
Victoria’s hotel quarantine inquiry will be extended by six weeks and won’t report until December 21 after receiving new material from key players.

Rachel Baxendale, Damon Johnston 10.30pm: Andrews: I’m no Manchurian candidate
Daniel Andrews has declared he’s no “Manchurian candidate” as he dismissed any link between his $2m spin doctor and his own key phrases during Victoria’s deadly coronavirus pandemic.
While describing QDOS’s work as important and revealing his reports had been classified as cabinet-in-confidence documents, and therefore would never be released publicly, the Victorian Premier said the firm played no role in developing the language he used during the coronavirus.
QDOS, run by veteran Labor pollster and strategist John Armitage, has been employed by the Premier’s Department for six years to conduct a program monitoring the views of Victorians, pocketing $2m in taxpayers funds.
As well as claiming it can help shape public opinion, change public behaviour and win elections, QDOS says it uses social research to “convert ... into accessible and persuasive language”.

Chris Griffith 10pm: Comment: Check-in system: DIY in five minutes
Comment: The issue of Victoria not yet having an integrated QR code system for contact tracing at shops and venues doesn’t mean businesses can’t implement their own. It appears to be an easy five-minute job.
Victorian Premier Daniel And­rews has defended the state’s failure to have a QR code check-in system up and running before retail and hospitality businesses reopened, citing incompatibility with the IT platform for contact tracing.
Mr Andrews’ new QR code system sounds a case of using a sledgehammer to crack a walnut, but it might have whiz-bang features such as the ability to cross-reference contacts with other businesses where COVID-19 is detected. It may substantially speed up tracing and be well worth the wait.
However, if the idea is to simply create a register of patrons at any time, and retrieve their name, mobile number and email address in the event someone has the virus, setting up a QR code system is a five-minute job that any Victorian business can do now as an interim measure.

Ewin Hannan, Rachel Baxendale 9.30pm: Inquiry deadline extended six weeks
Victoria’s hotel quarantine inquiry has had to extend its final reporting date by six weeks after the emergence of critical new evidence and delays in receiving Health Department documents.
Inquiry chairwoman Jennifer Coate said an interim report outlining recommendations for a proposed quarantine program would be released on November 6, which had been the due date for its entire findings into the botched­ scheme.
While Ms Coate said the report­ would be released by December­ 21, it is believed the ­inquiry is confident it can unveil its findings by early December.
Rachel Baxendale 9pm: We’ll end up ahead of NSW: Andrews
Victorian Premier Daniel And­rews says his state will end up “well ahead” of NSW in integrating a QR code check-in system with contact tracing software, ­despite being unable to say when the program will be up and running more than a month after NSW and the ACT introduced their schemes.
NSW and the ACT have had quick response code technology up and running since last month, allowing users to scan their contact details using a smartphone app as they visit venues such as shops, restaurants and gyms.
Despite having had weeks to prepare ahead of retail and hospit­ality businesses reopening on Wednesday for the first time in 16 weeks, Mr Andrews was unable to say when Victoria’s system would be fully operational.
Businesses can easily download their own QR code systems from a plethora of products available online, or use pen and paper, but neither method has been integ­rated with the state Department of Health and Human Services­’­ new contact tracing IT system developed by software company Salesforce.

AFP 8.30pm: India passes eight million cases
India passed eight million coronavirus cases on Thursday, with the world’s second-worst-hit country bracing for a new wave of the pandemic.
There have also been more than 120,000 deaths across the country of 1.3 billion people, according to the latest government figures.
Only the US has seen more infections, with 9.1 million confirmed cases and nearly 230,000 deaths.
India has one of the world’s lowest death rates and the government has highlighted the slowing number of new infections in recent weeks.
But authorities are preparing for a new surge after Diwali, the country’s most important religious festival on November 14. Textiles Minister Smriti Irani has become the latest of several cabinet members to test positive.
“All states need to be careful during the coming festive season. This caution must be exercised for the next three months at least,” Health Minister Harsh Vardhan said in a recent statement.

Glynis Traill-Nash 8pm: Fashion fans get a virtual front-row seat
Drones and camera crews will put customers in the front row for David Jones this season.
The department store presents its first virtual runway on Friday evening, a showcase of new--season fashion it hopes will generate both excitement and sales.
It’s another example of the changes taking place in the fashion industry globally because of COVID-19 and the increasing power of consumers.
“Obviously a virtual runway is the safest way to do a runway (at the moment),” said Bridget Veals, general manager womenswear for David Jones. “It’s an opportunity to invite a huge amount of customers. People are ready for it.”
The filming took place this week at the iconic Harry Seidler house in Joadja, overlooking bushland in the NSW Southern Highlands.

John Stensholt 7.05pm: Derby Day grounded as the Eagle soars
Melbourne is slowly emerging from COVID-19 lockdown, but it won’t be in time for what is usually one of the city’s biggest party days of the year.
There’s more fun to be had in Sydney on Saturday instead, where the upstart $7.5m Golden Eagle horse race looks to take the attention from Derby Day down south at Flemington.
The Victoria Derby meet at Flemington usually marks the ¬beginning of a festival that continues on Tuesday with the Melbourne Cup and then more big meets with Oaks Day two days later and Stakes Day on the ¬Saturday. The week-long celebrations barely pause.
Derby Day is the biggest day of them all. Think of the Bird Cage on Flemington’s straight, where billionaires, A-listers, footy players and assorted glammed-up hangers-on run amok.

Oliver Moody 6.41pm: Sweden herd immunity ‘immoral’
The pandemic is approaching a “critical juncture” in Sweden after the number of daily cases rose by 70 per cent in a week, according to the country’s chief epidemiologist.
Anders Tegnell, the public face of Sweden’s official coronavirus response, said that it would be futile and immoral for a state to deliberately pursue herd immunity, where a large enough number of the population has been infected that the disease struggles to spread.
“There has up to now been no infectious disease whose transmission was fully halted by herd immunity without a vaccine,” Dr Tegnell told Die Zeit, a German newspaper.
Sweden’s infection rate has climbed precipitously over the past two months, rising about eightfold since the start of the autumn. It is increasing in 17 of Sweden’s 21 regions.

- Saturday October 17, 8.10am – 9.10am
- Sunday October 18, 8.55am – 9.40am
- Monday October 19, 5.50am – 6.35am
- Tuesday October 20, 5.50am – 6.35am
- Wednesday October 21, 5.15pm – 6pm
- Thursday October 22, 6.45am – 7.30am
- Friday October 23, 9.35am – 10.20am

Anyone who attended a class that was scheduled to begin five minutes before or five minutes after one of the classes listed above, or a class immediately before or after the sessions, is considered a casual contact.
These people are urged to monitor for symptoms and get tested immediately if they arise. They, must then remain in isolation until a negative result is received.
Additionally, anyone who attended Ali Baba Charcoal Chicken, 2 Civic Rd, Auburn on Sunday October 18 from 4-5pm is considered a casual contact.
Ewin Hannan 5.15pm: Aged-care paid pandemic leave stays, Fair Work rules
Workers in residential aged-care facilities have secured ­access to paid pandemic leave until at least March next year after the Fair Work Commission rejected employer attempts to stop the entitlement.
However, the commission did not back an ACTU bid to keep the entitlement in place until the COVID-19 pandemic was over.
Employers said they were only prepared to support extending the entitlement until November 30 because that was when government funding that covers the cost of employees being absent for Covid-related reasons was due to expire.
But the federal Health Department told the commission that the “timeframe may be extended as needed”.
A commission full bench said it was appropriate to extend the entitlement until March next year.
“It was only a matter of weeks ago that the resilience of the aged care sector and its staffing model was under severe pressure, at least in Victoria,” it said.
“It is too early to say that the current improving situation will be sustained, and it is essential that infection control measures such as the paid pandemic leave entitlement remain in place for the time being.”

Agencies 4.45pm: Keep schools open, UN and World Bank plead
The UN and World Bank have pleaded in a new report for schools to remain open despite Covid-19 risks, highlighting the damage the pandemic has inflicted on children’s education, especially in poor nations, AFP reports .
Children in impoverished countries have been deprived of close to four months of schooling since the pandemic began early this year, while pupils in rich nations benefiting from remote learning have lost six weeks, the report said.
“Prioritising reopening schools and providing much-needed catch-up classes are critical,” said Robert Jenkins, education chief at the UN children’s fund UNICEF.
“We don’t need to look far to see the devastation the pandemic has caused to children’s learning across the world,” he added in a statement.
The devastation has been magnified in low- and middle-income nations, where there has been a lack of access to distance learning, higher chances of delays for school reopenings and fewer resources to mitigate health risks.
UN cultural agency UNESCO and the World Bank also said it is essential for countries to invest immediately in school systems to reduce the widening gap between the education provided in poor and rich countries because of the pandemic.
The report from UNICEF, UNESCO and the World Bank was based on information collected from nearly 150 nations between June and October.

Jack Paynter 4.10pm: Truckie virus super spreader fined
The truck driver who spread the Chadstone coronavirus cluster to regional Victoria has been fined by police.
Victoria Police Chief Commissioner Shane Patton confirmed on Thursday morning the man had been fined $1652 for dining at a cafe in Kilmore on September 30.
He said the man was fined on October 17 after it was revealed he had spread the virus to the regional Victorian towns of Kilmore and Shepparton.
The man had a valid work permit to leave metropolitan Melbourne but was not permitted to eat in regional Victorian restaurants or cafes at the time.
The truck driver, who was connected to the Chadstone cluster by a family member who worked at The Butcher Club, didn’t know he was a close contact or positive when he travelled.
Three people contracted coronavirus in Shepparton and six tested positive in Kilmore, but the outbreak has now been brought under control.

Charlie Peel 3.55pm: LNP releases election commitment costings
A Liberal National Party government would pay for its election commitments through a combination of borrowings, efficiency dividends across departments, better procurement processes, and extending Labor’s replacement freeze for non-frontline employees.
The party’s costings, released on Thursday after sustained attacks from Labor over supposed cuts for public service employees, show no cuts through forced redundancies or asset sales and no new taxes.
An LNP government would continue with part of Labor’s multi-billion dollar borrowing plan to pay for the commitments made during the election campaign.
Treasurer Cameron Dick in September outlined Labor would borrow $4bn to stimulate the economy and LNP deputy premier Tim Mander on Thursday announced that the LNP would spend $1.7m of the loan.
Mr Mander reaffirmed his commitment that an LNP government would deliver a budget surplus within four years.
The party’s two key election infrastructure projects - the New Bradfield scheme and the duplication of the Bruce Highway - would still be years away from construction, with only enough funding provided for planning and studies.
Mr Mander said it would give an LNP government time to “make sure we do the right planning and get this right”.
It means the “$26bn spend” trumpeted by Labor throughout the campaign is actually $5.05bn.

Tessa Akerman 3.37pm: Victorian train boss sacked over alleged bribes
The head of Victoria’s regional train service V/Line has been sacked after four days of damning evidence in an inquiry investigating alleged corruption.
The Independent Broad-based Anti-corruption Commission hearing has heard evidence of alleged corruption with V/Line chief executive James Pinder and Metro Trains head of fleet operational support Peter Bollas allegedly receiving bribes from the cleaning supplier Transclean managing director George Haritos.
V/Line chair Gabrielle Bell issued a statement on Thursday saying the board of directors had terminated Mr Pinder’s employment following the public hearings.
“The V/Line Board has also provided notice of termination of the contract with cleaning supplier Transclean Facilities Pty Ltd,” she said.
“The alleged conduct of both Mr Pinder and Transclean is not acceptable to V/Line under any circumstances.
“All V/Line employees and contractors are expected to uphold the highest levels of integrity and the Board of Directors is committed to ensuring this happens at all times.”

Rachel Baxendale 3.20pm: Andrews to keep $2m research on Victorians secret
Victorian Premier Daniel Andrews has revealed almost $2m worth of taxpayer-funded research done for his government by a Labor strategist who boasts that “public opinion is a fluid thing that we can squeeze, pump and stir” has been classified as “cabinet in confidence” and will be kept secret from the public who paid for it.
The Australian revealed on Thursday veteran Labor pollster and strategist John Armitage‘s company QDOS was handed a $1.1m contract in December last year, without a competitive tender process.The deal expires in October 2022, just days before the government enters caretaker mode ahead of the November state election.QDOS was also paid $786,555 to conduct research for Mr ­Andrews’ department between 2016-2018.
Asked what taxpayers had got for almost $2m, why his office had refused a request for details of the work performed, and whether he agreed with the claim on the QDOS website that: “Fortunately public opinion is a fluid thing that we can squeeze, pump and stir, and sometimes just opening a little gate lets it rush into a brand new space,“ Mr Andrews said he would not comment on ”what is on a website that I don‘t think I have ever visited”.
“In terms of monitoring where the community’s at and what the community‘s views are, I would have thought that during a pandemic that was critically important,” Mr Andrews said.

Jade Gailberger 3.14pm: Two-way travel with New Zealand ‘very close’
Two-way travel between Australia and New Zealand is “very close”, foreign affairs officials say.
Twenty flights carrying a combined 1895 passengers from New Zealand have entered Australia without having to quarantine.
A further 10 “green flights” – where passengers don’t have to quarantine – are expected to arrive in Australian by November 10.
Department of Foreign Affairs official Jenny Da Rin told a Senate estimates hearing on Thursday that one-way travel from New Zealand had enabled procedures to be tested.
“We’ve been working on arrangements for two-way travel since June,” Ms Da Rin said.
“Those arrangements are not yet finalised.
“We are getting very close.”
NSW is the only state or territory to so far receive international flights from Auckland.
The Northern Territory has also agreed to exempt people from New Zealand to enter without quarantining.
The ACT and South Australia have also expressed an interest to receive flights from Auckland.
“A number of states and territories have expressed interest in opening with NZ, but first the arrangements need to be settled between the two countries to enable that to occur,” Ms Da Rin said.
“They’ll need to put the planning in place to enable that to happen, and the airlines will have to decide to schedule flights.”

Staff writers 3.03pm: PM call prompts NRL backflip on national anthem
A phone call from Prime Minister Scott Morrison is believed to have jolted the NRL into an embarrassing backflip on playing the national anthem before the looming State of Origin series.
In a dramatic few hours on Thursday, NRL chief executive Andrew Abdo revealed that the anthem would not be played before the NSW-Queensland matches on November 4, 11 and 18.
The decision to scrap the anthem would have made this season’s series the first not to feature Advance Australia Fair in its 40-year history.
It followed criticism and protests by Indigenous players including Cody Walker, Blake Ferguson, Latrell Mitchell Josh Addo-Carr, who refused to sing it in 2019.
But The Daily Telegraph reports Mr Morrison contacted rugby league chairman Peter V’landys on Thursday about the move.
“It is believed Morrison told V’landys that after a year of heartbreak it has never been more important to be singing the national anthem,” The Daily Telegraph reports.

Ben Packham 3.00pm: MPs boycott Qatari ambassador dinner
Members of the parliament’s powerful intelligence and security committee will no longer attend a scheduled official dinner with the Qatari Ambassador “due to the mistreatment of Australian women at Doha Airport”.
The committee’s chair Andrew Hastie and deputy chair Anthony Byrne announced the move in a statement today.
“On Monday 19th October, the Chair of the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Intelligence and Security met with the Qatari Ambassador at Australian Parliament House,” they said.
“An invitation was given to the Chair and PJCIS members to attend a formal dinner at the Ambassador’s residence on Monday 9th November.
“Due to the mistreatment of Australian women at Doha Airport, we decline this invitation. We fully anticipate that the Qatari government will investigate the mistreatment of Australian citizens and provide a detailed report to the Australian government.”

Ben Packham 2.37pm: Diplomat warns: Beijing seeks to divide us
The nation’s top diplomat has warned Beijing is using Australian public commentary over China to portray Australia as intolerant and discriminatory.
Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade secretary Frances Adamson said while Australia rightly valued free speech and democracy, public figures needed to be aware that what they said about China would be recorded and used by Chinese state media.
“What, to be very frank, I think Beijing is looking for is division, and where they are able to show division,” Ms Adamson told a budget estimates hearing.
“They project an image of Australia that is intolerant, that is divided, that discriminates against various groups within our society.”
The comments follow a debate over Liberal backbencher Eric Abetz’s demands that Chinese Australians appearing before a Senate committee “unconditionally condemn the Chinese Communist party dictatorship”. Senator Abetz has defended the demand, saying he was not questioning the loyalty of Chinese Australians.
But Ms Adamson warned such comments were “damaging for us in China.”
She said public figures should remember “the cameras in Beijing … will capture what you say”.
“They will play it back into their own population — 1.4 billion people, mostly pretty attentive to what is coming out through state media - and they will form an opinion of us, Australians and Australia, which is very different I think from the way we would like ourselves to be portrayed,” Ms Adamson said.
“The Chinese are increasingly resorting to project - not only in their own country but potentially elsewhere — images of Australia which do not … represent who we are.”

Richard Ferguson 2.12pm: Labor MP Chris Hayes collapses mid-speech
Labor MP Chris Hayes is recovering in hospital after he collapsed in the middle of an emotional parliamentary speech about child sex abuse.
Mr Hayes clutched his chest while speaking about abuse in the Federation Chamber earlier on Tuesday, and doctor MPs Mike Freelander and David Gillespie rushed to his aid.
Anthony Albanese said Mr Hayes, the opposition’s chief whip, was rebounding in hospital.
“He is in good spirits, and we all wish him a very speedy recovery,” the Opposition Leader told the House.
“And I say to the chief opposition whip, if you want to leave he should just ask for it, there are easier ways to get it then what occurred this morning.
“But I look forward to him being back in this chamber in good health.”
Scott Morrison praised Mr Hayes and his wife Bernadette, saying it was a shared view across parliament that the chief opposition whip is a “good bloke.”
“We may disagree on many things in this place but we all agree Chris Hayes is a very good bloke,” the Prime Minister said.
“And many of us know Bernadette as well, she has been a welcome person here around this place for many years and is well known to many of our partners and spouses in this place as well.”
Rachel Baxendale 2.08pm: Lack of quarantine probe documents ‘disturbing’
Opposition health spokeswoman Georgie Crozier and legal affairs spokesman Ed O’Donohue said it was “disturbing” that the Andrews government had still not provided all additional documents requested by the hotel quarantine inquiry, “despite several notices to produce”.
“This highlights the lack of forthright cooperation,” the opposition said.
“From day one, all we’ve seen is cover-ups and blame shifting from the Andrews Labor government. Victorians deserve the truth.
“The Liberal Nationals welcome the hotel quarantine Inquiry having additional time and again call on the inquiry to schedule further public hearings of key witnesses to get to the bottom of this sorry mess.
“Let’s hope the remarkable bouts of amnesia have now passed and witnesses including the Premier, former Minister Mikakos, former DPC Secretary Chris Eccles, the Emergency Management Commissioner Andrew Crisp, Ministers Lisa Neville and Martin Pakula, former Chief Commissioner Graham Ashton and others that have left so many unanswered questions can be further tested.
“Daniel Andrews’ chief of staff must also give evidence to clarify her role in this fiasco.”
Rachel Baxendale 2.06pm: Andrews happy to agree to hotel inquiry delay
Victorian Premier Daniel Andrews said he had been happy to agree to the hotel quarantine inquiry’s request for more time to deliver its final report by December 21, with an interim report dealing with the resumption of the program due next Friday November 6.
Premier Daniel Andrews has announced a revamped hotel quarantine scheme could be set up in Victoria by the end of November, allowing flights to Victoria to restart before Christmas.
“This is an independent process, it’s a board of inquiry charged with a very important task and there was no sense in my mind that we wouldn’t agree to the request that they had made,” Mr Andrews said.
“They need more time, the government has given them more time, and I’m confident they will use that time well to provide us with a report that sits squarely against the terms of reference that we have given them.”
The inquiry said in its statement on Thursday morning that “several documents and affidavits” it had requested were “outstanding and may lead to further inquiries”.
Asked whether he knew what those documents were, Mr Andrews said: “I can only speak to the requests that have been made of me.”
“There was an affidavit and for completeness’ sake, questions that were put to me. We complied with the timeline, which if memory serves correctly was last Thursday or maybe Friday, but we certainly delivered all of my material back when it was there, and if they need further information from me, and I don’t for a moment think they do, but if they did, then of course we would comply,” he said.
“I can’t speak for whoever else has been asked, and whether they’ve been asked questions and what they’ve been asked.”
Asked whether the Department of Health and Human Services still had requests for documents outstanding, Mr Andrews said: “I’m not certain. You’d need to speak to the board about that. I don’t want to be a commentator or a spokesman for them.”
“I do know there was some supplementary material requested. I’m not certain whether the deadline for the production of that material has actually passed,” he said.
“There might still be time for them to, they could of course deliver it early, but I don’t think that they’re beyond time.”
Some of the supplementary information requested from DHHS relates to emails which appear to contradict written and verbal evidence given to the inquiry by Chief Health Officer Brett Sutton, that he was not aware security guards were being used in hotel quarantine until coronavirus cases emerged at the end of May.
Paige Taylor 2.01pm: WA set to make decision on border reopening
West Australian Education Minister Sue Ellery has confirmed The Australian’s report on Thursday that the McGowan government is about to make a decision about the reopening of the state’s border as a result of new health advice. Ms Ellery said at a press conference on Thursday that the document from Chief Health Officer Andy Roberton would underpin discussions at a special meeting on Friday.
“I’m not going to speculate on what is in it, or what we will decide, other than we will consider that advice tomorrow,” she said.
“Obviously, events across the rest of Australia will inform that advice as well.”
WA’s hard border — introduced in response to the pandemic in April — is the strictest in the nation and even some of the state’s own residents have been unable to get home after travelling interstate to work or see family. Stories of parents separated from their children for months and people unable to see dying relatives have become uncomfortable for the McGowan government as cases in other states fall.
The absence of any known cases of coronavirus in the WA community since April has created a relaxed and even fearless attitude and The Australian has been told health authorities are fearful that once the interstate border comes down, it could be virtually impossible to compel West Australians to social distance or adhere to contract tracing measures like the QR codes in place in NSW.
Dr Robertson’s last advice to the WA government on October 14 was that it should reconsider its state border measures once Victorian cases fell below five a day on a rolling five day average.

Tessa Akerman 1.50pm: Lockdown stopped thousands of cases: Victorian health report
The Andrews’ government’s second lockdown avoided tens of thousands of new cases in July and as many as 9200 Victorians presenting to hospital every day, according to modelling presented in the Department of Health and Human Services annual report released on Thursday.
The report said the government’s response to the pandemic included an exponential increase in the contract tracing and public health team from 57 people at the start of COVID-19 to 1891 in June 2020.
Premier Daniel Andrews has praised Victorians after 24,000 COVID-19 tests were conducted on Wednesday.
It said the success of improvements to contract tracing were evident with 98.6 per cent of new cases interviewed within a day of the case being notified to the health department at the beginning of October and 99.7 per cent of all known contacts notified within 48 hours..
“Research from the Burnet Institute shows that if every case and all their contacts are isolated within 48 hours from the first test result being received, this can prevent 80 per cent of new infections,” the report said.
The department cited modelling by Monash University and the Doherty Institute to support its physical distancing restrictions, claiming if they had not been in place during the first wave of the pandemic, Victoria would have seen up to 58,888 new cases every day in April.

Jack McKay 1.39pm: Palaszczuk’s mixed messages on quarantine
Queensland Premier Annastacia Palaszczuk insists the state has a very “robust” hotel quarantine system, despite telling voters on Wednesday that it “cannot cope at the moment”.
Ms Palaszczuk appeared to back away from the comments today – saying Queensland “can absolutely cope” with what it needs to do for international arrivals.
But she said Queensland would not rush internal student arrivals, pointing to infections in other parts of the world.
“The priority is to get Queenslanders and Australians home and families reunited,” she said.
“What I said very clearly is if we had a rush of international students coming into Queensland, that could put at risk our hotel quarantine and put at risk the health of Queenslanders.”
The Premier was quizzed about international students at last night’s The Courier-Mail/Sky News People’s Forum, where she said: “Our hotel quarantine cannot cope at the moment.”
She also said hotels were keeping up with demand, but warned that Queensland could not extend its resources.
Touring the LNP stronghold of the Gold Coast today, Ms Palaszczuk said the state’s hotel quarantine “can cope now”.
“But you cannot stretch hotel quarantine, you cannot go too quickly and too fast,” the Premier said.
“Our hotel quarantine is very robust.”

Richard Ferguson 1.16pm: Dutton defends Payne over Qatar strip search handling
Home Affairs Minister Peter Dutton has defended Foreign Minister Marise Payne’s handling of allegations 13 Australian women were forced to endure invasive physical procedures in Qatar.
Senator Payne is under fire from Labor for not yet calling the Qatari foreign minister over the invasive procedures, which were undertaken after a baby was found in a bin at Doha Airport.
Mr Dutton said on Thursday that Senator Payne was working hard behind the scenes on the Qatari case.
“I have never seen somebody more committed to what is in our country’s best interests, in particular protection of women, both here and abroad and she’s a first-class Foreign Affairs Minister,” he said in Canberra.
“She will work in many of these cases behind the scenes, not in the public light because, in many cases, particularly when you are dealing with countries right across the world.
“It is best to deal with those issues in the background and I found that Marise has achieved incredible outcomes for our country as a result of that.”

Jack Paynter 1.11pm: Truck driver at centre of Shepparton cluster fined
The truck driver who spread the Chadstone coronavirus cluster to regional Victoria has been fined by police.
Victoria Police Chief Commissioner Shane Patton confirmed on Thursday morning the man had been fined $1652 for dining at a cafe in Kilmore on September 30.
He said the man was fined on October 17 after it was revealed he had spread the virus to the regional Victorian towns of Kilmore and Shepparton.
The man had a valid work permit to leave metropolitan Melbourne but was not permitted to eat in regional Victorian restaurants or cafes at the time.
The truck driver, who was connected to the Chadstone cluster by a family member who worked at The Butcher Club, didn’t know he was a close contact or positive when he travelled.
Three people contracted coronavirus in Shepparton and six tested positive in Kilmore, but the outbreak has now been brought under control.
Mr Patton said Victoria Police detectives went and spoke to the tyre delivery driver after the case was referred from the Department of Health and Human Services following their contact tracing investigation.
“It was for dining in (at) Kilmore,” he said.
“He was remorseful I’m told but nonetheless we issued an infringement to him in the circumstances because his conduct required it.”
Mr Patton said the man wasn’t charged for failing to mention to contact tracers for almost two weeks that he had also visited Shepparton on September 30.
Up until now breaches of the chief health officer’s restrictions identified during contact tracing have generally not been given infringements as health authorities believed it was much more valuable to get the full story from positive cases.
Premier Daniel Andrews previously said he didn’t want anyone to be fearful of coming forward.
“You don’t need to be a Rhodes scholar that people will not answer truthfully (if they were going to be fined),” he said.

Charlie Peel 12.48pm: Frecklington sets off on two-day city blitz
Deb Frecklington has set off on a Brisbane blitz two days out from polling day, visiting polling booths around the city.
The Opposition Leader spent the morning at the Caravan and Outdoor Expo at the RNA showgrounds, spruiking her $300 registration rebate and her promise to cut the luxury vehicle tax, dubbed the “grey nomad tax”, applied to caravans and motorhomes.
She then visited a polling booth in Fortitude Valley, in the electorate of McConnel, held by Labor frontbencher Grace Grace.
Ms Grace and Ms Frecklington came face to face, touching elbows in an amicable encounter.
A disgruntled Labor volunteer was less friendly, shouting out at the LNP leader and asking, “What school will you cut next?”.
“Not cuts,” Ms Frecklington replied.
LNP candidate Pinky Singh echoed the response.
LNP deputy leader Tim Mander is due to release the party’s costings today after weeks of badgering from Labor over how Ms Frecklington planned to pay for her election commitments.

Geoff Chambers 12.43pm: ANZ climate change plan ‘disappointing’
Resources and Water Minister Keith Pitt says regional Australians should look around “for a better deal”, describing the ANZ climate change plan as “disappointing”.
“At a time when the rest of Australia is focused on economic recovery and getting back to work, it is extraordinary that ANZ’s priority is to play environmental activist. It is singling out industry sectors that continue to make a significant contribution to Australia’s economy – and ANZ’s wealth,” Mr Pitt said.
“I’d suggest ANZ would be better off focusing on its core business and help the 1.2 million Australians employed directly or indirectly in the resources sector buy their own homes and cars, and invest for their future. I would encourage Australians, particularly those in the regions who feel let down by ANZ’s decision, to look around for a better deal.
“Right now, the priority of banks should be winning back the trust of all Australians following the revelations of the banking royal commission, not playing eco-warrior.”
Nationals MP Barnaby Joyce suggested the ANZ “should lose international Unit Bank Credit because of their position on lending Ag and their climate policy”.
“They should also lose access to (the) RBA giving them access to funds at 0.33 per cent,” Mr Joyce said.

Chris Griffith 11.47am: Victorian businesses don’t need to wait for QR code
The issue of Victoria not yet having an integrated QR code system for contact tracing at shops and venues doesn’t mean businesses can’t implement their own interim one now. It appears to be an easy five-minute job.
Victorian Premier Daniel And­rews has defended the state’s failure to have a QR code check-in system up and running ahead of retail and hospitality businesses reopening. He cited compatibility with the existing IT platform for contact tracing.
Mr Andrews’ new QR code system sounds a case of using a sledgehammer to crack a walnut, but it might have whizz-bang features such as the ability to cross reference contacts with other businesses where COVID-19 is detected. It may substantially speed up contact tracing and be well worth the wait.
QR code at Shenannigans
However, if the idea is to simply create a register of patrons at any time, and retrieve their name, mobile number and email address in the event someone has the virus, setting up a QR code system is a five-minute job that any Victorian business can do now as an interim measure.
Businesses will at least have a QR code check-in system up and running while waiting for the Victorian Government’s Rolls Royce version to roll out.
It’s a matter of registering at one of the websites that offers this service for free, or near to free.
Covidtracer.com.au lets you obtain a QR code for your business and quickly set-up a form for collecting customer details. It’s free if you only need one QR code and account. You can export contact details to a .CSV file and hand it over to contact tracers if the data is ever needed. You can monitor who has checked into your premises at any time.

Rachel Baxendale 11.41am: Active Victorian virus cases down to 76
Victoria now has 76 active cases of coronavirus, down from 80 on Wednesday, with three new cases reported in the 24 hours to Thursday.
Premier Daniel Andrews said one of the three cases was a close contact of members of the northern metropolitan Melbourne cluster who is already in quarantine, while the two others are under investigation and subject to an expert panel review to determine whether they are new cases, or cases of prior infections where the virus is still being shed.
One of these people has previously tested positive for the virus, while the other has previously been a close contact of a positive case.
Cases on the rise in Victoria
The three new cases on Thursday are in Darebin, in Melbourne’s north, Boroondara in the east, and Casey in the outer southeast.
There are five people in Victorian hospitals with coronavirus on Thursday, none of whom are in intensive care. This is an increase of two in hospital since Wednesday.
There were 24,135 tests processed in the 24 hours to Thursday, with a positive test rate of 0.1 per cent, bringing the total number processed in Victoria since the pandemic began to 3,130,788.

In head-to-head markets, Biden is $1.50 to win the election ahead of Trump at $2.70. The Blues are $1.37 to beat the Maroons ($3.10).

Imogen Reid 11.19am: NSW records four new locally acquired virus cases
There have been four new locally acquired cases in New South Wales in the last 24 hours.
Two of the locally acquired cases are students from the Malek Fahd Islamic School in Hoxton Park, which has been closed for cleaning after a student tested positive to the virus.
Premier Gladys Berejiklian said NSW Health is confident the source of the virus will be traced to an existing outbreak.
“Overnight, we did have four cases of COVID in New South Wales, three of which were community transmission,” she said.
Ms Berejiklain said the three cases were from the same household.
“Health is working and is confident there will be an established link to an existing cluster, although that’s not yet confirmed,” she said.
One case was diagnosed in an overseas traveller in hotel quarantine.
NSW Health’s information is at odds with Ms Berejiklian’s statement, citing four local cases

One Twitter user said he had dinner in an inner city restaurant and was not asked to sign in.
Another said she noticed groups of people who were not socially distancing and said no precautions were taken by the venue to ensure they have details for contact tracing.
One person used the social media platform to urge residents to avoid venues that do not have COVID-safe plan.
Under current restrictions, tables must be 1.5 metre apart and group numbers are limited to ten.

Tokyo residents react after Prime Minister Yoshihide Suga set a 2050 deadline for the world's third-largest economy to become carbon neutral, significantly firming up the country's climate change commitments.
“It is not for us to welcome or not welcome things. They are matters for those countries.
“They are decisions made domestically by those countries and they are a matter for them,” she told Senate estimates.
“Those announcements made by other countries we acknowledge. Of course we do.
“They are a matter for them and we are focused on meeting our Paris commitments.”

Ewin Hannan 9.52am: Victoria’s hotel quarantine inquiry to be extended
Victoria’s hotel quarantine inquiry will be extended by six weeks and won’t report until December 21 after receiving new material from key players.
Inquiry chair Jennifer Coate said an interim report would be handed down on November 6 containing recommendations for a proposed quarantine program, based on evidence and information currently available to the board.
But she said a final report examining the setting up of the initial hotel quarantine program, and any further recommendations, would be released by December 21.
“This unfortunate delay is due to the provision of additional material which occurred after the conclusion of closing submissions on 28 September 2020, as detailed at the extraordinary sitting on 20 October 2020,” Ms Coate said.
“As a result of this additional material, the board has issued several further notices to produce and requests for affidavits. Several documents and affidavits are presently outstanding and may lead to further enquiries.”
Ms Coate wrote to Daniel Andrews on Wednesday to propose the revised timetable and the Premier responded on Thursday, saying he agreed the board’s final reporting date should be extended.
The inquiry has received new statements as well as copies of the phone records of key players, including staff in the Premier’s private office.
Chief Health Officer Brett Sutton and the secretary of the Department of Health and Human Services Kym Peake provided new statements.
As well as Mr Andrews, the Police Minister Lisa Neville, former police chief commissioner, Graham Ashton and the former secretary of the Department of Premier and Cabinet Chris Eccles also made new statements.
The inquiry is considering who decided to engage private security guards for the hotel quarantine program in late March instead of using police and Australian Defence Force officers, a decision now seen as a catalyst for allowing the coronavirus to escape and spread across Melbourne.

Robert Gottliebsen 9.22am: Holgate was a trap and Morrison fell for it
For the first time in his prime ministership, Scott Morrison has fallen into a carefully laid Labor trap.
The prime ministerial “mistake” has paralysed Australia Post’s top management and threatens its ability to deliver the unprecedented number of online parcels that retailers are looking to send out this Christmas.
As retailers wake up to the devastation that the PM’s actions may cause, they are desperately phoning government ministers and politicians trying to make them understand how serious this is for the nation.
In this commentary I will first set out what actually happened in AusPost; then explain how Labor used that situation to trap the Prime Minister and then offer a simple solution.

Robyn Ironside 9.18am: From nowhere to somewhere: Qantas flies again
Buoyed by the success of its seven-hour scenic “flight to nowhere” which sold out in 10 minutes, Qantas has announced a series of scenic “flights to somewhere”.
Designed to highlight key Australian holiday destinations as state borders reopen, the first flight will carry 110 passengers on a Boeing 737 from Sydney to Uluru for an overnight stay on December 5.
Details of other scenic flights are being kept under wraps but Qantas CEO Alan Joyce said they were intended to “get people thinking about where they might holiday”.

Imogen Reid 8.54am: Why NSW keeps finding new virus cases
NSW Health’s Dr Jeremy McAnulty says the state’s recent outbreaks are a reminder that COVID-19 “hides under the surface” as it continues to spread.
NED-2545-How-long-covid-virus-can-survive
“We have seen several days in recent times without any local cases, but it is the nature of the virus, it just hides under the surface,” he told Today.
Dr McAnulty said it was critical for people to keep coming forward for testing to help control the rate of community transmission.
“We all need to be vigilant for even mild symptoms. It could be COVID,” he said.
“People might think it is just a cold and you might think, ‘I will see if it goes away’, Don’t do that. Get tested right away because the more days it takes to get tested… the more people who may be put at risk.”

Sarah Elks 8.43am: How undecided voters scored Queensland leaders’ debate
Queensland Premier Annastacia Palaszczuk has “concerns” about reopening the state for one of its biggest industries — international education — warning it would overwhelm the already stretched hotel quarantine system.
In the first debate of the campaign ahead of Saturday’s knife-edge election, the Palaszczuk government’s handling of COVID-19 dominated a sometimes-fiery exchange between Ms Palaszczuk and Opposition ­Leader Deb Frecklington.
Undecided voters awarded the debate to Ms Palaszczuk, with 53 per cent, or 25 of the 47 swinging voters at the Sky and The Courier-Mail People’s Forum, backing Labor, while 30 per cent, or 14, chose Ms Frecklington’s Liberal National Party. Eight, or 17 per cent, remained undecided.
Ms Frecklington focused her attack on the government’s five-year economic record before the coronavirus hit, citing high unemployment, bankruptcies and Labor’s ambivalence towards the resources industry.
“(We) cannot sit back in Queensland and accept being at the bottom of the economic ladder … you don’t want to be below those people (in Tasmania and South Australia),” Ms Frecklington said.

Rachel Baxendale 8.20am: Victoria records three new virus cases
Victoria has recorded three new cases of coronavirus in the 24 hours to Thursday, and no deaths.
Victorians will be hoping all three are among close contacts who are already in quarantine, as was the case with Wednesday’s two cases.
The cases come after Victoria achieved two consecutive days of no new cases on Monday and Tuesday, for the first time since early March when there had only been a total of 10 cases in the state.
There have been no deaths recorded in the past 24 hours, after two deaths which occurred some weeks ago were on Wednesday added to Victoria’s toll, bringing the number caused by the second wave of the virus to 800, including 652 linked to aged care, with the total death toll at 819.
The number of cases with an unknown source of infection in Melbourne has risen by one to four on Thursday, for the most recent fortnight for which the statistic is available, spanning October 13 to October 26.
It is not clear which day’s figures this new “mystery” case comes from, given there were no new cases on Monday — the most recent day added to that fortnight.
Melbourne’s 14 day daily average number of new cases is now 2.4, down from 2.7 on Wednesday and 6.1 the previous Thursday.
There have been no new cases in regional Victoria for more than a fortnight, with 80 active cases in Melbourne as of Wednesday.

Imogen Reid 7.58am: Former AMA president’s warning to Victoria
The former president of the Australian Medical Association (AMA) has issued a warning to Victorians enjoying life after lockdown, reminding them that COVID-19 is still in the community.
Dr Tony Bartone told Today that remaining vigilant and adhering to social distancing rules was critical in the state’s ongoing battle against the virus.
“It was great to see people out enjoying their new found freedom, but we have to remember that we have to keep the measures in place, remembering the social distancing and mask wearing in crowds and respecting that this virus still is not gone out of the community. It is still there, albeit in extremely, extremely low numbers,” he said.
“But we need to remember that it could only just take one episode and unfortunately we could have a cluster, we could have an outbreak again.”

Jack Paynter 7.52am: BMW crashes into ‘ring of steel’
A BMW driver has allegedly smashed into one of Melbourne’s “ring of steel” coronavirus checkpoints.
The man, 33, crashed into the vehicle checkpoint on the Calder Highway in Gisborne South about 4.15am on Thursday, police allege.
With the Melbourne lockdown being one of the strictest in the world, some of the reasons people are using to get out of fines are ridiculous.
A Victoria Police spokeswoman said the black BMW X5 crashed through bollards and hit a parked car before coming to a stop.
She said no police or defence force personnel were injured during the incident.

Damon Johnston 7.25am: Spin guru’s $2m to put words in Dan’s mouth
A Labor strategist who boasts that “public opinion is a fluid thing that we can squeeze, pump and stir” has been paid almost $2m by Daniel Andrews’ own department to run a secretive project to monitor the views of Victorians.
Despite Victorians bankrolling the confidential activity charting public sentiment and ­reaction to policies, the research will remain under wraps, with the Department of Premier and Cabinet refusing to release it.
In December last year, QDOS Research was handed a $1.1m contract, without a competitive tender process. The deal expires in October 2022, just days before the government enters caretaker mode ahead of the November state election.
The Australian has confirmed QDOS was also paid $786,555 to conduct research for Mr ­Andrews’ department between 2016-2018.

Imogen Reid 6.50am: Sydney school shut after student tests positive
Contact tracing is underway at a school in Sydney’s west after a student tested positive for coronavirus.
Health officials have advised students and staff members at the Hoxton Park campus of the Malek Fahd Islamic School to self isolate while the school is cleaned and to get tested if they experience any virus related symptoms.
“NSW Health has requested anyone who has been unwell or if you develop any symptoms to be tested at one of the COVID-19 testing clinics,” the school said in a statement.
The school’s other campuses in Greenacre and Beaumont Hill have not been affected.

Jacquelin Magnay 6.40am: France enters new national lockdown
French President Emmanuel Macron has announced a fresh national lockdown of France until at least mid-December but has insisted schools remain open, work to continue and aged care homes to allow visitors.
Mr Macron said “we are all taken aback by the pace this virus has spread” and warned every second counts to try and reign the spread of the virus.
He added: “It may be tiresome and breaking your heart, but in these difficult times we call on your heart and solidarity.”
Mr Macron said the country risked being “overwhelmed by a second wave that no doubt will be harder than the first”.
Mr Macron said even further measures may need to be introduced at fortnightly assessments of the situation and said the country had to move from the current 40,000 cases of coronavirus a day to down to 5000 a day.
He said the country had been conducting 1.9m tests a week but the test and trace system “just isn’t working”.
He rejected allowing the virus to spread uncontrolled or to ask the most vulnerable and elderly isolate.
He said people in households should even wear a mask inside the home to protect other family members as the virus “was mutating into more dangerous forms impacting younger generations”.
Mr Macron said unlike the total lockdown in March, this time “the economy must not come to a halt” but encouraged working from home as much as possible.
“What is different is we will have to continue working, all public services, construction sites will continue,” he said.
But all shops, restaurants and bars are to close and there is a travel ban between French regions. The external French border is closed except to people coming from other Schengen countries.
On Tuesday French medical teams detected 34,000 infections of coronavirus and in the past 24 hours there were 524 deaths related to COVID-19. These levels have not been seen since April.

Rachel Baxendale 6.20am: QR code won’t fit with Victoria’s IT platform
Victorian Premier Daniel And­rews has defended the state’s failure to have a QR code check-in system up and running ahead of retail and hospitality businesses reopening on Wednesday, citing­ the issue of compatibility with the existing IT platform for contact tracing.
NSW and the ACT have had QR (or quick response) code technology up and running since last month, allowing users to scan their contact details using a smartphone app as they visit shops, restaurants and gyms.
But despite having had longer to get organised before reopening, Mr Andrews said on Wednesday he could not announce a date by which Victoria would have the system established.

Greg Sheridan 6.00am: Comment: Let’s pray we don’t have a third wave
This column has no desire to be depressing, to spread gloom and despond as they say, but don’t discount­ the strong possibility of Australia experiencing a crippling third wave of COVID-19 in due course.
Can we trust the competence of Daniel Andrews’ government in Victoria to lead us out of lockdown into a situation where we can contai­n future outbreaks?
If the past is any guide to the future­, the question answers itself, and should lead us all to embrace the power of prayer.
Still, let’s acknowledge achieve­ment. The Victorian people­, and the Victorian government, have achieved the lockdown objective, which was the radical suppression of the virus. Victoria had its peak of new infections on August 5, with 725 new infections. On August 1, Britain had 771 new infections.

David Murray 5.31am: Drug use soars in the time of Covid
Capital city cocaine and cannabis use and regional “ice” and heroin use have soared to record levels, according to the first snapshot of the nation’s drug consumption since the start of COVID-19.
Border and business closures and restrictions on movement and gatherings disrupted but did not stop Australia’s illicit drug market, wastewater analysis for the Australian Criminal Intelligence Commission shows.

Agencies 5.10am: European nations impose drastic new virus restrictions
Germany imposed drastic curbs on people’s daily lives to contain a surge in coronavirus cases and France was set to follow suit as 516,898 infections were reported worldwide in a new daily record.
Reflecting the bleak outlook, European and US stock markets tumbled as investors fretted over looming stringent measures that are likely to further hurt the economy.
Faced with soaring cases, Germany ordered shut restaurants, bars and cafes, offering up to €10 billion in aid to struggling sectors to cushion the blow.
The restrictions, which kick in Monday and last to the end of November, will also limit the number of people gathering to a maximum of 10 individuals from two households, Chancellor Angela Merkel announced.
Schools and shops will be allowed to stay open, but swimming pools and other sporting facilities will be shut, and professional sports ordered behind closed doors, she added, acknowledging the measures were “strict” and “arduous.”
French President Emmanuel Macron is set to follow suit later today (AEDT) and announce new measures that a government official said were likely to be “unpopular”, as doctors warn that many hospitals are days away from being overrun.
There is widespread speculation that he will decree a lockdown until the end of November, though it will likely be less strict than the stay-at-home orders in place earlier this year.
In Belgium, which has the most cases per capita in the world, the number of coronavirus hospital admissions has almost matched the level in the first wave in the spring, a public health institute said.
Medics in one hospital in Liege are so overstretched that some staff who are themselves infected with COVID-19 are continuing to treat patients.
Prime Minister Alexander de Croo could announce more stringent measures soon.
Anger over anti-coronavirus curbs has already boiled over in Spain and Italy, where thousands have protested in recent days.
On Wednesday, chefs and restaurateurs rallied in Rome, kicking off protests in 24 cities against rules forcing restaurants, bars, gyms and other businesses to close their doors at 6:00 pm.
Some protests have turned violent in recent days, but health workers counter the curbs are crucial.
“Go on like this, you risk dying in an ambulance or at home, as happened in the spring,” said Maurizio Viecca , head of cardiology at Sacco di Milano hospital in the Lombardy region, Italy’s worst-hit in the first wave.
Across the world, the coronavirus has infected more than 44 million people, with close to 1.2 million deaths.

Greg Brown 5am: Greens staffer offered secret JobKeeper deal
One of the Queensland Greens’ most senior officials offered an outgoing employee a “good deal’’ where he would delay his formal resignation and take JobKeeper payments without doing any work in what would have been a misuse of the ­payment.
The deal offered by Queensland Greens secretary Kitty Carra to former party campaigner John Meyer would have lasted four weeks from August 31 to October 2. The Greens would not have paid him during this period and he was to resign at the end of it.
He said he had “legal recordings” of the conversations that he was willing to give to authorities, allowing them to investigate.
The Australian Taxation Office on Wednesday declined to comment on the Greens case, but second commissioner Jeremy Hirschorn told Senate estimates earlier this week that such a practice was “not allowed” as the JobKeeper program was intended to restore the link between employers and their workers.
Mr Meyer, who rejected the offer, outlined for The Australian the substance of phone conver­sations he had with Ms Carra and the party’s sole state MP, Michael Berkman , in relation to the offer.

Hannah Moore 4.45am: Bali Nine member contracts Covid in Kerobokan prison
A member of the infamous Bali Nine drug smuggling ring has contracted coronavirus inside the notorious Kerobokan prison on the Indonesian island.
Si Yi Chen , now 35, is one of three Australian prisoners who have been infected with the virus and have been moved into an isolation wing, Nine News reported.
Brendon Johnsson , convicted of cocaine possession, and paedophile Robert Andrew Fiddes Ellis are the other Australians who have been isolated.
Chen is serving a life sentence for his part in attempting to smuggle 8.3kg of heroin out of Indonesia, into Australia in 2005.
Ringleaders of the group, Andrew Chan and Myuran Sukumaran , were sentenced to death and executed on April 29, 2015, while six other members including Chen were given life sentences.
The ninth member of the group, Renae Lawrence , was given a 20-year sentence, which was commuted in 2018, leading to her early release.

David Penberthy 4.15am: Aussie wine exports show some sparkle
Australian wine exports have weathered the pandemic and brushed aside any sabre-rattling from Beijing to register a 4 per cent jump in value to almost $3bn, driven by increased sales to every key export market including China.
In the 12 months to September, total Australian wine exports reached $2.998bn, with growth recorded in each of the top five markets.
Wine Australia’s latest Export Report showed the growth was driven by premium wines and the cheap and cheerful, with the three least expensive categories of wines valued at up $7.49 a litre all recording solid growth, and the biggest surges recorded in high-end categories fuelled by demand from Chinese wine enthusiasts.
Demand for wines priced at between $50 and $99 a litre soared by 42 per cent, a $92m ­increase on exports in the previous year, while the most ­expensive category of wines valued at $200 a litre and more ­jumped by 32 per cent, an increase in value of $16m.
Wine Australia chief executive Andreas Clark said the overall value was at the highest level since exports reached $3bn in the second half of 2007.

Andrew McMillen 4am: Music longs for a crowded house
When tens of thousands of sports fans gathered for the NRL and AFL grand finals at the weekend, concert promoters had good reason to scratch their heads and wonder: what about music?
“It’s hard not to feel like our ­industry is being discriminated against,” said Jessica Ducrou , co-founder of the annual NSW winter music festival Splendour in the Grass. “We need a level playing field, and the allowances and ­relaxations that are afforded to sporting and racing events should apply to the live entertainment ­industry.”
Since the pandemic forced a sudden end to all mass gatherings in March, the major sporting codes worked within health department guidelines to gradually increase spectator numbers from zero to the tens of thousands allowed at last weekend’s grand ­finals in Brisbane and Sydney.
Yet live music has been able to resume only in fits and starts, as entertainment venue owners in some states have experimented with seated shows, table service, temperature scanners and careful monitoring of social distancing in order for shows to go on.
While that approach has been adopted by smaller venue owners, many of whom are operating at a loss under such restrictions, for festivals such as Splendour in the Grass — which ordinarily ­attracts about 42,000 people a day to its site near Byron Bay — a clear road map to upscaling events is needed.

Low blow: Covid goal too hard

Full text: A senior World Health Organisation adviser has warned that Victoria’s targets for easing lockdown are “very challenging” and the state should instead boost its capacity to manage outbreaks to live with higher infection rates.
Dale Fisher, who ran Singapore’s early successful COVID-19 program, said it was not clear why there needed to be fewer than five daily infections before a curfew and stay-at-home restrictions in Melbourne could be lifted.
“Why does (Daniel Andrews) need the numbers to be so low, to be less than five,” Professor Fisher said. “Why can’t it be less than 10 or less than 20? He would probably say that, above that, you exceed the capacity to manage.
“You don’t have to be an infectious disease professor to realise: increase your capacity to manage.
“If the concern is that the ­contact-tracing teams will get overwhelmed, you simply wonder why you can’t have more contact-tracing teams.” Professor Fisher’s comments came as other senior infectious disease experts expressed scepticism about the road map and modelling announced by the Victorian Premier on Sunday, and federal Health Department secretary Brendan Murphy labelled the plan “very conservative”.
Professor Murphy, the former chief medical officer, said: “There’s no rule book for this virus but I think some of us feel that, if there were more confidence in the public health response capability, you could take some slightly more generous triggers.” Under the road map, most restrictions in Melbourne will not ease until there are fewer than five daily cases on average for a ­fortnight and there are fewer than five cases with unknown sources. Public gatherings of up to 50 people, and home visits of up to 20 people, will not be allowed until November 23 — and only if there are no new cases across the state for 14 days.
“There are not many countries achieving that and there is usually a significant price to pay,” Professor Fisher said.
“I think it is very challenging to get those sort of numbers across a state the size of Victoria.” However, Professor Fisher said setting targets as the road map had was “incredibly community-­empowering”. “It really is up to the community — the government can’t do everything,” he said.
Business Council of Australia chief executive Jennifer Westacott used public concerns expressed by some of the country’s leading ­epidemiologists on Monday to question why the modelling on which the Victorian road map was based had not yet been released by the government.
“The authors of the modelling themselves have ­described the modelling as a guide, and we understand it’s a challenge to model, but that’s why we need transparency of data and sharing of information,” she said.
The modelling was prepared by Melbourne University researchers Jason Thompson, Mark Stevenson and Tony Blakely, and University of New England health academic Rod McClure.
After running 1000 simulations, it concluded that easing ­restrictions when daily new coronavirus cases reached a fortnightly average of 25 would lead to a 60 per cent chance of Melbourne having to return to lockdown before Christmas.
UNSW epidemiologist Raina MacIntyre said that was a solid basis for the government’s road map, . “You have to have some kind of goalposts and measurable outcomes,” she said. “You need to set targets and then work to achieve them and that‘s the only way to get to suppression or elimination. I think that is achievable and the numbers are going in the right direction.” Deakin University’s senior epidemiologist, Catherine Bennett, questioned if the modelling had looked at scenarios beyond the worst-case stage 4 restrictions.
“Modelling can be useful for policymakers to test different scenarios, but it appears the modellers were not asked to test stage 3 restrictions, even if they have this option within their model,” Professor Bennett said.
For metropolitan Melbourne to reach tep 3 of the road map on October 26, there must be fewer than five new COVID-19 cases per day across a 14-day average.
If this threshold is reached, the 9pm curfew will be lifted, some students will return to school and people will no longer be restricted from leaving home.
Archie Clements, epidemiologist and pro-vice chancellor of health sciences at Curtin University, said: “Five is a little conservative. At five cases you are down to random-variation territory, and making policy on that number is tricky. I think you could go ­somewhat higher than five and still get on top of instances of local transmission. At five or 20 cases, public health authorities would be successful in containing local transmission.” Peter Collignon, an infectious diseases physician at Canberra Hospital, said Victoria was locking itself into very tough criteria to meet.
“While they don’t say it, the (Victorian) government is going for elimination, not suppression,” Professor Collignon said. “This is okay in the short term, but until a vaccine is 90 per cent effective it is extremely hard to sustain.
“I think Victoria has opted for a very hard measure. On the Melbourne criteria Sydney would be in lockdown now.
Jodie McVernon, the Doherty Institute’s director of epidemiology, said limiting cases in Melbourne to fewer than five a day by late October would be “very challenging”, and a simple daily maximum was too blunt an instrument.
“In looking at thresholds for numbers coming out, five cases in family members of healthcare workers at home is very different from unknown cases,” Professor McVernon said.
With the daily COVID-19 case count at 41 on Monday, Victorian Chief Health Officer Brett Sutton didn’t rule out moving through the road map more quickly than envisaged. “I think we would always go through a process of review, that we wouldn’t say different circumstances shouldn’t lead to a re-look at how we’re tracking and the risk of moving to a different stage,” Professor Sutton said.
Professor Blakely has previously said that improved contact tracing is the key to suppressing the future outbreaks predicted by the modelling. “If we do our contact tracing better than we did three months ago, the contact tracers may be able to hold the case count without it going up again as badly as our model suggests,“ he said on Sunday.

I think you could go ­somewhat higher than five and still get on top of instances of local transmission. At five or 20 cases, public health authorities would be successful in containing local transmission.” Peter Collignon, an infectious diseases physician at Canberra Hospital, said Victoria was locking itself into very tough criteria to meet.
“While they don’t say it, the (Victorian) government is going for elimination, not suppression,” Professor Collignon said. “This is okay in the short term, but until a vaccine is 90 per cent effective it is extremely hard to sustain.
“I think Victoria has opted for a very hard measure. On the Melbourne criteria Sydney would be in lockdown now.
Jodie McVernon, the Doherty Institute’s director of epidemiology, said limiting cases in Melbourne to fewer than five a day by late October would be “very challenging”, and a simple daily maximum was too blunt an instrument.
“In looking at thresholds for numbers coming out, five cases in family members of healthcare workers at home is very different from unknown cases,” Professor McVernon said.
With the daily COVID-19 case count at 41 on Monday, Victorian Chief Health Officer Brett Sutton didn’t rule out moving through the road map more quickly than envisaged. “I think we would always go through a process of review, that we wouldn’t say different circumstances shouldn’t lead to a re-look at how we’re tracking and the risk of moving to a different stage,” Professor Sutton said.
Professor Blakely has previously said that improved contact tracing is the key to suppressing the future outbreaks predicted by the modelling. “If we do our contact tracing better than we did three months ago, the contact tracers may be able to hold the case count without it going up again as badly as our model suggests,“ he said on Sunday.

Full text: Australia's policymakers were in March bracing for up to 150,000 deaths from the coronavirus pandemic as the virus spread globally and health officials warned that hospitals might not be able to cope.
Ten weeks later, with just 103 deaths, some experts say the modelling behind the national cabinet's decisions was flawed and some commentators say the response went too far.
When Prime Minister Scott Morrison announced a ban on gatherings of more than 500 people on March 13, Australians seeing widespread lockdowns imposed overseas began to ask for the modelling that lay behind the national cabinet's decisions.
Two days later, Deputy Chief Medical Officer Paul Kelly was quizzed about the expected numbers at a press conference and laid out an astonishing scenario, saying the number of infections could range between 20 per cent and 60 per cent of the population.
"The death rate is around 1 per cent. You can do the maths," Professor Kelly said, urging the public to avoid large gatherings. The maths worked out to between 50,000 and 150,000 deaths.
On Tuesday Chief Medical Officer Brendan Murphy told the Senate inquiry into the Morrison government's response to the pandemic that Australia had avoided 14,000 deaths by implementing strict social distancing measures, considerably fewer than the initial warning.
Grattan Institute health economist Stephen Duckett said: "The estimate of deaths in those early days, they assumed no lockdowns and no action. If you let the disease rip, you'd have a huge number of deaths."
UNSW Business School professor of economics Gigi Foster, who has been a vocal critic of the decision to lock down, said the small number of deaths vindicated her argument that governments had gone too far.
"That's an order of magnitude lower than what the modelling initially expected," Professor Foster said, warning models that over-estimated the spread could mean blanket restrictions that were "far more costly" than they needed to be.
ANU infectious diseases professor Peter Collignon said the modelling prepared for the government by the Doherty Institute released in April was also flawed as it assumed that every person infected would pass it on to 2.5 others. He also took issue with the assumption people's behaviour would not change as the risk of interacting with others became clear.
The Doherty Institute modelling made no reference to a potential 150,000 deaths or of 60 per cent of the population becoming infected.
Professor Kelly attributed the 60 per cent figure to German Chancellor Angela Merkel and the lower estimate of 20 per cent to NSW chief health officer Kerry Chant.
The expert modellers from the Doherty Institute have defended their work against accusations it overestimated the risk.
Professor James McCaw last week tweeted the modelling didn't overestimate the risk; "rather it underestimated society's ability to respond and prevent transmission".
The institute's Professor Jodie McVernon said the modelling was based on the assumption that "only fairly modest levels of social restriction to reduce transmission would be achievable in Australia".

Full text: ITS JOB IS TO PREPARE FOR A PUBLIC HEALTH CRISIS - AND WHEN COVID-19 HIT, THE DOHERTY INSTITUTE WAS ALREADY A JUMP AHEAD
This virus doesn’t want to kill us. It has no brain, no will. It just wants to grow and reproduce, to obey the laws of evolution and natural selection.” So says Professor Peter Doherty, a man who knows a thing or two about unpicking a virus. If the virus that causes Covid-19 did have a brain it would probably avoid coming up against the 79-year-old, Brisbane-raised, Nobel Prize-winning immunologist who in the mid-1990s unlocked the secret of how our body’s immune system gives viruses a good kicking. His name has suddenly been thrust into the spotlight again as patron of the research and public health organisation that bears his name, the Peter Doherty Institute for Infection and Immunity. No organisation in Australia has been more prominent in tackling Covid-19, not only in the lab but in shaping government policy through the findings of its public health scenario modellings. “I’d just written my retirement book,” Doherty laughs down the phone from his home in Melbourne, where his age means he’s under strict isolation. “I thought I was fading into the distance and now suddenly I’m back as a talking head.” There’s a lot to talk about. If we are in an enviable position in this war against Covid-19, with the tantalising prospect of life returning to normal seeming closer every day, it’s in part due to the early work of scientists at the Doherty Institute.
It’s easy to forget those early days back in January, when bushfires preoccupied the country and no one suspected a mysterious virus in China would within two months result in unimaginable global upheaval. But in the age of globalisation, viruses can move faster than even the news cycle, and so can those who fight them. Within hours of Australia’s first confirmed case of Covid-19 landing on our shores, the Doherty Institute had grown the virus in culture and shared it with the world (the first lab outside China to do so), sequenced the entire genome of the virus, mapped the human body’s immune response to the infection and was supplying the modelling that informed the Federal Government’s response in imposing the lockdown restrictions. Now its scientists are collaborating on a vaccine and testing possible treatments. Things have happened so fast that you could almost swear they were waiting for this virus.
Actually, they were. Doherty director Sharon Lewin calls it “peacetime preparations”: all the work that goes on when you’re not in the grip of a pandemic, when you’re not sure what sort of infectious disease will hit next but you know it will and you’d better be ready for it. It was SARS that primed the institute for Covid-19, but its breadand-butter work is annual outbreaks of influenza, tracking cases in the community and developing new vaccines and treatments. “SARS was very infectious but the difference was people would only spread the virus when they were unwell,” says Lewin, “so you knew who was spreading it because they were sick and usually in hospital. But nothing like this new coronavirus has ever affected us.” A collaboration between The University of Melbourne and Royal Melbourne Hospital, the Doherty Institute was born out of another disaster – the Global Financial Crisis – as a recipient of the Rudd government’s 2009 stimulus splash in the tertiary sector. It was established to deal with the exact sort of crisis we’re in right now.
The first cases of a mysterious pneumonia-like illness emerged from the wet markets of Wuhan, China in late December. It was soon confirmed to be a new type of coronavirus, and on January 7 China revealed to the world its genetic sequence – like sharing a fingerprint from a crime scene. “That’s when people started getting nervous,” says Lewin. “It was different to SARS. It set alarms off around the world.” The impetus for countries outside China was then on designing a diagnostic molecular test (called a PCR assay), so they’d know if the virus washed up on their shores. But Australia was a step ahead. We already had the test. “The tests were designed in the wake of SARS and MERS, predicting that this would happen again and we’d need a test capable of detecting an unknown coronavirus,” says Mike Catton, director of the Doherty Institute’s Victorian Infectious Diseases Reference Laboratory (VIDRL).
Having the virus’s genetic sequence meant Catton and his team could quickly tailor their test to the new virus. From January 15 they started testing samples from anyone arriving from Wuhan displaying cold-like symptoms. Catton jokes that if anything urgent is going to happen, it’ll be on the Friday night before a long weekend. On Friday January 24, the lab got a call from Monash Hospital. Another return traveller from China had presented with coronavirus symptoms and a sample from the patient was taken back to the lab for testing. By 2am they had preliminary results, and by 4am had completed the entire genome sequencing, confirming the matter beyond all doubt that the fingerprints matched. Covid-19 was here.
Getting a positive ID was just the beginning. The next step was to try to grow the virus in cell culture. If growing a virus is an artform then Julian Druce is the artist. Druce is the senior scientist at VIDRL’s viral identification laboratory, where he tends to cultures in flasks with the tender touch of the finest orchid grower. Other labs had failed to get it to sprout, but Catton says if anyone in the world could grow it, Druce could. The practice of growing cultures was once de rigueur, but is now almost antiquated since the molecular test revolutionised virology in the late 1980s. While a molecular test will place your suspect at the crime scene, only by having a viable virus strain grown in culture can you fully interrogate the virus and learn its nature and characteristics, allowing you to potentially design anti-viral drugs and vaccines.
Over the weekend Druce and Catton watched their virus grow, sometimes in the lab during the day, sometimes in the middle of the night. When unable to sleep, they would periodically open the laptop and hook into a webcam pointed at the flask back at the office. “It was really exciting,” says Catton, adding drolly: “if that’s your idea of excitement.” By the time Australians were back at work on the Tuesday, VIDRL had uploaded the genome sequence to an international database and were spreading the virus round the world, but in a good way, with the hope it could still be contained.
Sharing the virus before having it accepted into an academic journal was a bold and unusual move. Researchers will usually keep their discoveries closely guarded until the findings can be published. It’s possible that at least two other labs around the world had grown the virus before the Doherty Institute, but were sitting on it. Julian Druce says they didn’t have time for that. “We wanted to get the genie back in the bottle. It was clear to us here that public health came before publication.” Collaboration would also come before commercialisation, with the Covid-19 crisis heralding an unprecedented flurry of global scientific co-operation through the sharing of information, materials, expertise and facilities. “I think it sent a message to the world about how we should be playing this thing,” says Catton.
Immediately after sharing the virus, VIDRL focused on helping public health labs, diagnosing samples sent in from New Zealand and states without local capacity. Throughout March the focus was on getting Victorian hospitals and community pathology labs set up with their own testing programs. Australia now has the highest per capita testing rate in the world.
Having a viable virus in the lab meant that labs around the world could start work designing anti-viral drugs to treat patients, test vaccine candidates and begin serology testing to detect antibodies deployed by our immune system to fight the virus.
At the same time as VIDRL was growing the virus, the institute was claiming another worldfirst. An early patient had her immune response to the virus scrutinised, providing vital information on how the body fights Covid-19. The 47-year-old woman from Wuhan became the first person in Australia to be tested under a platform called Sentinel Travellers and Research Preparedness Platform for Emerging Infectious Disease (SETREP-ID). Doherty Institute infectious disease physician Irani Thevarajan helped set up SETREP-ID two years ago, around the time when the world was getting jumpy over new diseases such as Ebola and Zika. The platform – with pre-approved ethics – allows for testing and research of any travellers returning to the country with an emerging infectious disease. “We set it up knowing that new infections could walk through the door any day,” says Thevarajan. “So we wanted to be able to do immediate detection and research, to gain an understanding of it when it arrived.” Thevarajan activated SETREP-ID on January 7, back when the world wasn’t even sure if human to human transmission was possible, and calibrated it to recruit data from any return travellers from China. When the woman arrived at hospital in late January and tested positive to Covid-19, a team led by Dr Oanh Nguyen and Dr Katherine Kedzierska immediately started taking blood samples and mapping her immune system response.
“We wanted to know right away what the immune system does when it sees this new coronavirus, because no one knew at that stage,” Thevarajan says. It was mild case of Covid-19 but the study revealed valuable information about the immune response. However, Thevarajan says a vital part of the puzzle is still missing. “What we don’t fully understand is what’s driving the really severe disease. We don’t yet fully understand why most people recover but some don’t.”
Nor do we fully understand what we stand to lose as collateral damage in the battle against Covid-19. On February 3, a collaboration of researchers led by the Doherty Institute convened a workshop with the Office of Health Protection and jurisdictional representatives in Canberra to discuss modelling the impact of Covid-19 on our health system.
Modelling was released to the public on April 7, two months after being provided to the Federal Government, which used it to inform its public health response. It’s this modelling and the delay in releasing it to the public that’s subsequently become the most controversial and debated element of the early initiatives, and the one that may prove to have the most serious long-term consequences. Doherty director of epidemiology Jodie McVernon led the team that built the model. She says at that early meeting the team proposed a “very broad brush set of initial scenarios based on influenza pandemic preparedness assumptions about severity, which was then highly uncertain”.
Back in 2009, McVernon had led a team of modellers responding to the H1N1 influenza pandemic that killed half a million people globally. So when Covid-19 came along and a preparedness model was needed in a hurry they brought out the influenza plan as a template, updating data specific for Covid-19 as it came in. “It’s our business to be surprised. That’s what emergencies are about,” says McVernon. “The reason this [modelling] could be done so fast was because the government had invested in preparedness for a very long time. So the toolkit, the thinking and the strategies were ready, but as the data came in it became clear this was beyond the influenza scenarios.” The modelling, though, came in for criticism for basing its assumptions on overseas data, for not taking into account Australia’s case numbers, different demographics, geography and health care system. Australia never saw the widespread virus transmission of places like Italy, Spain and New York. Some say this is because of the strict social distancing measures the government put in place. Others say it’s because Australia never had the effective reproduction number (the number of people infected by each person carrying the virus) that Wuhan did, our population isn’t as elderly as Italy’s, our rate of smoking is relatively low, we don’t have high-density slums, and a thousand other differences that mean a one-size-fits-all model was never going to be an accurate representation.
McVernon says they had no choice but to use overseas data, as that’s where the epidemics were occurring. She says they simply didn’t have time to wait. “We’re acutely attuned to the fact we have to contextualise this to our local setting,” she says, “but you have to start with what you have. Yes, there were uncertainties, but the model is there to help you come to a consistent set of decisions. You ask yourself if any of those uncertainties would change your decisions.” The modelling revealed that an unmitigated Covid-19 epidemic in Australia would have been a disaster, quickly overwhelming the health system. Suddenly “flattening the curve” became a phrase every Australian was familiar with. The curve was soon flattened, but at what cost? We won’t know until later the legacy of shutting down the economy, consigning so many Australians to the unemployment queue, or the other social impacts. One million Australians have become unemployed, and the Federal Government’s economic support packages are costing the country $320 billion.
McVernon admits she’s nervous about the collateral damage but stands by the measures. She says it was their job to avert a crisis. “It’s not a stretch to compare Covid-19 with the plague. People are saying that public health is being allowed to run the government. Well, I think there was definitely a need for public health to lead the charge to avert a catastrophe. That was our single task.”
The world waits for a vaccine. Doherty Institute virologist Dr Damian Purcell says more than 100 vaccine concepts are being worked on. “It doesn’t take a lot of time to produce a vaccine candidate,” he says, “what really takes time is the testing.” The institute’s collaboration with the University of Queensland to design a vaccine is one of those 100. Purcell says UQ started the work on January 20 and it’s now being tested on ferrets in the Netherlands prior to human trials. Elsewhere overseas, other vaccine candidates are already at the human trial stage. In-house, the institute is working on its own vaccine candidates, thanks to a $3.2 million donation from the Jack Ma Foundation. Meanwhile, two international groups, one from Britain’s Oxford University and another from US group Inovio, are testing vaccine candidates at the CSIRO in Geelong. CSIRO has partnered with the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations (CEPI), part of a global alliance aiming to speed up the development of vaccines, and in April was given $220 million by the Federal Government to upgrade its biosecurity research facilities and help expedite the quest for a vaccine.
Purcell says international collaboration and funding are the keys to unlocking a vaccine. “Funding is the thing that fires up the rocket sled. But things are highly accelerated now because people are sharing information in real time. A lot of the problems with vaccine development is it’s so expensive to manufacture at a high grade and going through the larger scale testing, so we’re speeding up the process of the early phase testing. As soon as things look remotely good and we get the safety signals, we pull the trigger and manufacture.” If it sounds simple, don’t kid yourself. Developing a vaccine is one thing, but working out how to safely mass produce what is a very complex biological product for the consumption of millions, to fight a virus we still don’t know a lot about, and doing it by yesterday, requires navigating seemingly insurmountable problems. Purcell believes we will get a vaccine, but he’s just not sure if it will be the elixir the world is expecting. “It may be difficult to achieve effective vaccination of the elderly, we just don’t know. Therapeutic antibodies or anti-viral drugs may turn out to be more important. That’s why we need to advance all fronts.” Other fronts include a trial led by the institute involving 2500 people in more than 80 hospitals in Australia and New Zealand (called the ASCOT trial) to assess the effectiveness of two anti-viral drugs, lopinavir/ritonavir (used to treat HIV) and hydroxychloroquine, the antimalarial drug touted by Donald Trump and Clive Palmer. It’s also partnering with Monash University on a study of the anti-parasitic drug Ivermectin. Early experiments done at the Doherty Institute days after the virus was identified in Australia showed that Ivermectin killed SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes Covid-19, within 48 hours in cell culture. Dr Kylie Wagstaff from Monash Biomedical Discovery Institute says anecdotal evidence is good, but getting the dosing right is the key before human trials in Australia can start.
Peter Doherty, who still has a key research advisory role with the institute, remains relaxed and grounded, an endearing everyman infected with an incurable case of humility. On April 27 he tweeted what was meant to be a Google search: “Dan Murphy opening hours.” Even strict isolation comes with occasional caveats. Rather than delete the tweet, he let it stay and gather likes and laughs. “Only flawed humans can be loved,” he later tweeted. “And I certainly qualify.” The real work is more sobering. Doherty says the worst virus he’s ever seen is smallpox. It killed about 300 million people in the 20th century, about 30 per cent of those it infected. Ironically, it’s also the only human infectious disease ever to be eradicated, the last case occurring in 1978. “We’re probably not going to eradicate Covid-19,” says Doherty. “So whatever people think of what’s being done, we need to build up the armamentarium against this thing. It’s lethal.”

Full text: An unmitigated countrywide outbreak of the coronavirus would have completely overwhelmed intensive care beds with a peak daily demand of 35,000 beds, Chief Medical Officer Brendan Murphy revealed on Tuesday.
That was a "horrendous" scenario and the demand on intensive care beds would have been "completely beyond the realm of any country to create", Professor Murphy said.
But he stressed that it was not a realistic scenario since it was based on more than 23 million people being infected, or 89 per cent of the population. Authorities did not expect an infection rate that high.
In the unmitigated scenario, 38 per cent of people would need medical care. Demand would peak in week 18 of the outbreak.
The modelling, from the Doherty Institute, analyses different scenarios to bring the epidemic under control and ensure the health system doesn't get overrun.
Its report, by director of epidemiology Professor Jodie McVernon, says an unmitigated COVID-19 epidemic "would dramatically exceed the capacity of the Australian health system, over a prolonged period".
Isolating people and quarantining contacts would not be enough to bring it under control, with social restrictions also necessary.
With quarantine and isolation measures, the peak shifts to week 25, with a daily demand of more than 16,000 intensive care beds on the worst day, which was also outside Australia's capacity. Under that scenario 68 per cent would be infected, with 29 per cent needing medical care.
With quarantine, isolation and social distancing, authorities believe they can keep the peak demand on intensive care beds in the event of a countrywide outbreak to just under 5000 beds.
If transmission is cut 25 per cent from social distancing measures, 38 per cent of people would become infected, with 16 per cent needing medical care, still outside capacity.
But if transmission is cut by 33 per cent, 12 per cent of people are infected and 5 per cent need medical care, bringing numbers under control.
The peak is pushed out beyond week 41, which is near the end of the year.
On March 7, Australia had 2300 intensive care beds, with the ability to ramp up quickly to more like 5000 by using ventilators and spaces in other parts of hospitals, according to the Intensive Care Society.
The modelling, which has finally been released after weeks of pressure on the government, explains the increasingly strict measures the government has taken to limit the spread of the virus.
On Tuesday, case numbers reached 5844, with 44 dead. Professor Murphy said there were fewer than 100 people in intensive care and fewer than 40 on ventilators.
Professor Murphy stressed that the modelling was highly theoretical, not based on Australian data and was not a prediction of what would happen, but was designed to help authorities plan.
Professor Murphy said complacency was the biggest risk.
"The thing that concerns us most is the more than 500 people who have acquired this virus from someone in the community who doesn't know that they've had it," Professor Murphy said.
"If we in any way lose that rigour that the Australian community has embraced, particularly at Easter, it could all come undone. We've seen what the virus can do in a cruise ship [and] at a wedding."
Professor McVernon said it had been clear early on from Wuhan that "this disease was well beyond our experience of influenza pandemic preparedness".
"What we were seeing in terms of the rate of growth and early indicators of severity were really very marked and based on that we've since seen similar experiences in Europe and in the UK and in the US. It's been terrible to see those pandemics unfold," she said.
"When we went up with models early on it was very hard to comprehend the extent of severity but our government believed us."
She said it was clear very early that an unmitigated epidemic would be well beyond the capacity of any high-income country.
Professor of Mathematical Biology James McCaw said the next few weeks were crucial. While it would see an increase in hospitalisations, admissions to intensive care and deaths, that wave was driven by past cases and did not mean there was a loss of control, he said.
"We're in a very lucky position where we can think about the next steps and the very challenging questions ahead but from a position of relative calm as opposed to crisos we don't have an overwhelmed hospital system yet and we may never have one if we continue to base our responses on the best available evidence."

As case numbers increased, Australian data would be used and the modelling would be broken down to state and territory level.
The data would help authorities "plan the way out", he said.
"For now and certainly over the weeks ahead the lesson is simple, we must continue to do what we are doing, that is how we get through this," he said.

Full text: An unmitigated countrywide outbreak of the coronavirus would have completely overwhelmed intensive care beds with a peak daily demand of 35,000 beds, Chief Medical Officer Brendan Murphy revealed on Tuesday.
That was a "horrendous" scenario and the demand on intensive care beds would have been "completely beyond the realm of any country to create", Professor Murphy said.
But he stressed that it was not a realistic scenario since it was based on more than 23 million people being infected, or 89 per cent of the population. Authorities did not expect an infection rate that high.
In the unmitigated scenario, 38 per cent of people would need medical care. Demand would peak in week 18 of the outbreak.
The modelling, from the Doherty Institute, analyses different scenarios to bring the epidemic under control and ensure the health system doesn't get overrun.
Its report, by director of epidemiology Professor Jodie McVernon, says an unmitigated COVID-19 epidemic "would dramatically exceed the capacity of the Australian health system, over a prolonged period".
Isolating people and quarantining contacts would not be enough to bring it under control, with social restrictions also necessary.
With quarantine and isolation measures, the peak shifts to week 25, with a daily demand of more than 16,000 intensive care beds on the worst day, which was also outside Australia's capacity. Under that scenario 68 per cent would be infected, with 29 per cent needing medical care.
With quarantine, isolation and social distancing, authorities believe they can keep the peak demand on intensive care beds in the event of a countrywide outbreak to just under 5000 beds.
If transmission is cut 25 per cent from social distancing measures, 38 per cent of people would become infected, with 16 per cent needing medical care, still outside capacity.
But if transmission is cut by 33 per cent, 12 per cent of people are infected and 5 per cent need medical care, bringing numbers under control.
The peak is pushed out beyond week 41, which is near the end of the year.
On March 7, Australia had 2300 intensive care beds, with the ability to ramp up quickly to more like 5000 by using ventilators and spaces in other parts of hospitals, according to the Intensive Care Society.
The modelling, which has finally been released after weeks of pressure on the government, explains the increasingly strict measures the government has taken to limit the spread of the virus.
On Tuesday, case numbers reached 5844, with 44 dead. Professor Murphy said there were fewer than 100 people in intensive care and fewer than 40 on ventilators.
Professor Murphy stressed that the modelling was highly theoretical, not based on Australian data and was not a prediction of what would happen, but was designed to help authorities plan.
Professor Murphy said complacency was the biggest risk.
"The thing that concerns us most is the more than 500 people who have acquired this virus from someone in the community who doesn't know that they've had it," Professor Murphy said.
"If we in any way lose that rigour that the Australian community has embraced, particularly at Easter, it could all come undone. We've seen what the virus can do in a cruise ship [and] at a wedding."
Professor McVernon said it had been clear early on from Wuhan that "this disease was well beyond our experience of influenza pandemic preparedness".
"What we were seeing in terms of the rate of growth and early indicators of severity were really very marked and based on that we've since seen similar experiences in Europe and in the UK and in the US. It's been terrible to see those pandemics unfold," she said.
"When we went up with models early on it was very hard to comprehend the extent of severity but our government believed us."
She said it was clear very early that an unmitigated epidemic would be well beyond the capacity of any high-income country.
Professor of Mathematical Biology James McCaw said the next few weeks were crucial. While it would see an increase in hospitalisations, admissions to intensive care and deaths, that wave was driven by past cases and did not mean there was a loss of control, he said.
"We're in a very lucky position where we can think about the next steps and the very challenging questions ahead but from a position of relative calm as opposed to crisos we don't have an overwhelmed hospital system yet and we may never have one if we continue to base our responses on the best available evidence."

As case numbers increased, Australian data would be used and the modelling would be broken down to state and territory level.
The data would help authorities "plan the way out", he said.
"For now and certainly over the weeks ahead the lesson is simple, we must continue to do what we are doing, that is how we get through this," he said.

'A matter of trust': Experts demand to see modelling

Full text: Infectious disease experts say the Morrison government should release the scientific modelling underlying its response to the deadly coronavirus, warning the public may grow tired of restrictions if they are not given access to the detailed expert advice.
Raina MacIntyre, head of biosecurity at the NSW Kirby Institute, said Australia should follow the lead of the United Kingdom, New Zealand and United States in making its modelling public to "inform the community and elicit their cooperation".
"The purpose of modelling is to inform disease control strategies and to engage and bring people along with the necessary measures to control COVID-19," Professor MacIntyre said.
Deputy Chief Medical Office Paul Kelly on Wednesday appeared to backtrack from an earlier commitment to "unlock" the modelling, saying it could be misinterpreted.
Australian Medical Association NSW president Kean-Seng Lim said while modelling was never perfect - particularly when drawing upon overseas data - the government should still release it for the sake of transparency.
"It's important that we're all able to maintain trust in the system," Dr Lim said.
"As a community, [we need] to be able to see the data which has been used for modelling and to have an informed discussion."
In March, the Herald reported on Professor Kelly's revelation the government was preparing for between 50,000 and 150,000 deaths from COVID-19.
The government has refused to release the detailed modelling behind these figures, or an updated version, despite Professor Kelly on Monday saying: "We need to be more transparent."
Health Minister Greg Hunt said on Wednesday that Professor Kelly would host an epidemiology workshop later this week, that would inform an updated version of the modelling.
"That will be provided once it has been assessed and completed," Mr Hunt said.
It remained unclear whether the full, detailed modelling would be released; the minister cited the Herald's previous story as an example of the government releasing its earlier modelling.
AMA ethics committee chairman Chris Moy said the fact the modelling was being withheld had left a "vacuum" that was being filled by "armchair experts weighing in".
University of Melbourne epidemiologist Tony Blakely said the expert panel of modellers "have had sufficient time ... to prepare the narrative" and should share the modelling with the public.
"The decisions being made are some of the most important decisions Australia will make this century," Professor Blakely said.
Professor MacIntyre said the government's refusal to make the modelling public was creating suspicion.
