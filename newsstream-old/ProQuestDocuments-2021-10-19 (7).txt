Full text: BALLARAT COVID UPDATE, THURSDAY OCTOBER 14
NEW CASES: 5 (down from nine yesterday)
ACTIVE CASES: 71 (up from 66 yesterday)
UPDATE, 12.15pm: Ballarat has recorded five new COVID-19 cases in the 24 hours to midnight on Wednesday.
Of the five new cases, three are in the 3350 postcode and two are in the 3352 postcode.
Three of the cases are under investigation and two are linked.
Compared to other regional centres, Ballarat continues to fare reasonably well in terms of daily numbers.
Golden Plains recorded one case and Moorabool recorded three.
Health authorities are becoming increasingly worried about COVID spread in regional Victoria, which has set a new record for daily infections.
There were 170 cases in the regions confirmed on Thursday, included in the statewide tally of 2,297 new cases.
There are now 1289 active cases outside of Melbourne.

COVID Commander Jeroen Weimar did not specifically mention Ballarat in his daily press conference on Thursday, but said there were troubling figures in Geelong, Shepparton, Mildura and Latrobe.
He said there were 32 cases in Geelong, 30 in Shepparton, 23 in the Mildura area and 17 cases in both the Latrobe and Baw Baw shires.
There was also a death recorded in Shepparton; a man in his 70s.
"We can now see a significant number of cases again in our regional communities, that we're working very hard on with local players," Mr Weimar said.
"Although we can see our way through along the road map, we knew this was going to be difficult. The numbers today highlight how challenging this is, not only for all of us as Victorians to navigate our way through this COVID pandemic, but particularly those catching COVID and those who are becoming seriously ill with it.
"Please, everybody use this as a reminder for the last few weeks to do whatever we can to minimise transmission."
Meanwhile, year 12 students exposed to COVID-19 will still be able to sit their final exams in Victoria under changes that will see them put in separate rooms from their fellow pupils.
From next week, those deemed primary close contacts will have to get tested for coronavirus every 48 hours for the first week of their exposure, then again on day 13.
They will sit their exams in dedicated rooms with their own entrances, while otherwise complying with isolation orders of 14 days for unvaccinated students and seven days for those fully vaccinated.
"They will be supervised by staff wearing face shields and healthcare worker level PPE, the rooms will be safely ventilated and cleaned between each use," Education Minister James Merlino said on Thursday.

EARLIER, 9am: Victoria has recorded its biggest day ever of COVID-19 infections.
There were 2,297 cases recorded in the 24 hours to midnight on Wednesday, comfortably the biggest day on record.
There were also 11 deaths recorded.
There was a massive 82,762 cases returned.
The huge spike in numbers followed seemingly steady numbers in terms of new infections.
There was 1571 yesterday, 1466 cases on Tuesday, 1612 on Monday, 1890 new cases on Sunday and 1965 cases on Saturday.
Premier Daniel Andrews yesterday hinted the next step towards opening up Victoria could happen ahead of schedule.
Melbourne is set to exit lockdown on October 26 and regional Victoria will encounter a slight easing of restrictions once the state hits 70% double-does vaccination levels.
However, that could potentially be brought forward with projected vaccination rates about five days ahead of schedule.
An announcement on the possible easing of rules is expected later this week.
In Ballarat, there were nine new cases confirmed on Wednesday, with seven of them linked, according to the health department.
Today's Ballarat figures will be released later today.
However, more cases are expected with a new outbreak at a Miners Rest horse racing stable.
Further outside Ballarat, there has been a suite of new Tier One exposure sites listed in Halls Gap.
A young Ballarat COVID survivor has also shared her tale of contracting COVID and ending up in hospital, urging people to get vaccinated as soon as possible.
Meanwhile, Victoria's health boss is open to throwing off the shackles of Melbourne's COVID-19 lockdown before next weekend and possibly jettisoning a ban on home visits.
The state is on pace to reach its 70 per cent double vaccination target ahead of the indicative date of October 26, triggering the end of Melbourne's long- running sixth lockdown.
Chief Health Officer Brett Sutton confirmed a decision could be announced as early as this weekend based on firmer vaccination projections as well as intensive care and hospital case numbers.
Under the state's COVID-19 roadmap, home visits were set to be banned until 80 per cent of its 16-plus population received both vaccine doses.
But Professor Sutton said he was open to tweaking home gathering restrictions at the 70 per cent mark.
"We've always said, if we can do more, we will do more," he told ABC Radio on Wednesday afternoon.
"We're acutely aware of home gatherings leading to spikes and that was definitely a feature of (the AFL) grand final. They were people that didn't normally come together.
"It's different for families. If we can limit numbers, if we think the epidemiology looks okay, (I'm) absolutely open to that as well."
Victoria recorded 1571 new locally acquired infections and 13 deaths on Wednesday, the state's deadliest day of its third wave.
Prof Sutton noted the Doherty Institute modelling forecasts hundreds more deaths in coming months as restrictions ease across the state.
"The reality is our seasonal flu, year-on-year, causes an estimated 3000 excess deaths in Australia," he said.
"That's what we live with every year with flu. So we need to minimise to the fullest extent possible the deaths that we can."

Full text: While doomsayers may predict disaster as NSW opens back up, the good news is that around the world well-protected societies have been able to reclaim their freedom and live, work and travel as before, and avoid new rounds of crippling lockdowns. JAMES MORROW dives into the numbers and finds seven good reasons not to worry and enjoy the day.
1 GLOBALLY, DEATHS ARE DROPPING While Covid is by no means conquered, the seven-day average of global reported deaths from Covid is as low as it has been in 11 months. And a look at numbers also shows that, while at this time last year deaths were trending upwards as the northern hemisphere entered the winter months, this year the trend is pointing decidedly downwards.
2 VACCINES ARE WORKING … Across the globe, heavily vaccinated countries that have opened back up have broken the link between cases and deaths. Iceland made headlines around the world when it experienced a surge of cases in August, despite having more than 85 per cent jabbed. Yet that “surge” was associated with only three deaths. Singapore is often pointed to as a warning as well, but despite a spike in cases – more than 3000 a day – the country is experiencing fewer fatalities than locked-down NSW, with an average six deaths daily.
3 ...WHILE RESTRICTIONS AREN’T A funny thing happened on September 1, the day virtually all restrictions were lifted on Denmark’s 5.8 million citizens. The country, which has an adult vaccination rate of 80 per cent, was on 825 cases a day. As of Saturday, they were at a seven-day average of 500. Even better, the nation is suffering just one Covid fatality per week.
4 NORMAL IS POSSIBLE NSW medico Kerry Chant recently warned of a “new world order” going forward, but there is little reason we can’t get back to normal. Great Britain was one of the most Covid-ravaged nations on Earth last year and, has seen more than eight million cases and 138,000 deaths. Yet, ever since Prime Minister Boris Johnson declared “freedom day” on July 19, Brits have been getting on with it.
5 EXPERTS ARE WRONG … AND THAT’S A GOOD THING Around the world, supposedly expert pandemic modelling has proven itself to be needlessly alarmist, scaring policy makers into draconian restrictions – and Australia was not immune. At the start of the pandemic deputy chief medical officer Paul Kelly said that under a “best case” scenario, 50,000 Aussies might die. The real number has turned out to be closer to 1000. British epidemiologist Neil Ferguson last week had to admit that his predictions of 100,000 daily cases after re-opening was wrong – and said that future lockdowns were “unlikely” to be necessary.
6 MODELS ARE BROKEN Public health groups such as Melbourne’s Burnet Instiute keep predicting that Covid disaster is just around the corner for the state – but happily, they seem to keep getting it wrong. Even before NSW began opening up, Burnet was predicting that up to 3900 patients might need hospitalisation at any one time in Sydney. But numbers peaked at half that and remain trending in the right direction.
7 ASTRAZENECA IS BETTER & SAFER THAN WE THOUGHT If ever there was a reason to keep politics out of a pandemic, the saga of the AstraZeneca vaccine is it. Remember when Queensland CHO Jeannette Young said, “I said I didn’t want 18-year-olds to have AstraZeneca and I still don’t,” citing a rare risk of blood clots? It turns out the already miniscule risk turns out to be just one-fifth of what experts originally thought it was. And, there’s even some evidence suggesting the jab could be more effective than Pfizer.

Queensland records two new local Covid cases overnight

Author: Cameron, Domanii; Morwood, Maddy; Stolz, Greg

Full text: The two new cases are children of the man announced as a confirmed Covid case on Friday who had been on the Gold Coast for four days.
Chief health officer Dr Jeannette Young said it was still too early to say whether Queensland had avoided a lockdown despite no unlinked community transmission.
“I desperately hope we have,” she said.
“I think the response from Queenslanders is absolutely amazing.
“Here we have seen six people (aviation cluster) get infected at a workplace and they’re all vaccinated and they’ve passed it onto their household members.”
Dr Young said large crowds at the NRL grand final did concern her but masks were helping and were critical.
She urged anyone with the slightest of symptoms to stay home.
Premier Annastacia Palaszczuk on Friday said the borders would reopen when it was “safe”.
Asked what a safe level was, Dr Young said when as many people as possible were vaccinated.
“At a minimum I need them to have been given the opportunity to be vaccinated,” she said.
Health Minister Yvette D’Ath said Saturday’s new cases were detected while in home quarantine, but authorities were still looking at whether they had spent any time in the community.
Meanwhile, the state government is still refusing to say if the border will open when 80 per cent of the population is vaccinated.
Ms D’Ath insisted the 80 per cent vaccination rate was just one element of the Doherty modelling, and that national cabinet was still doing more work around it.
“I have said continuously around the 80 per cent threshold that the Doherty Institute modelling is not just about percentage,” Ms D’Ath said.
“It’s also … the number of outbreaks you’ve got.”
Ms D’Ath said if Queensland wants to be open for Christmas, people needed to get vaccinated.
“If you want to go see family and friends around the country, the best thing you can do … is getting vaccinated.”
Ms D’Ath said Queensland would wait to see how the “trial” with international travel went and that the state wasn’t closed off to the idea.
She said didn’t think people would want to be flying to Bali at the moment citing the number of cases the country is recording.
“I’m not sure how many people are going to be jumping on planes to Bali,” she said.
Dr Young said the two new cases were children of the man announced on Friday who had been on the Gold Coast for four days.
“We’re double checking there weren’t any other venues they attended,” she said.
“But now every single day that we don’t have community transmission is another day that more than 50,000 Queenslanders have the opportunity to get vaccinated.
“We have plenty of vaccine.”
It comes as the truck driver who was reported on Friday as being an animal handler on the Gold Coast was a negative positive.
Ms D’Ath said that case was no longer a concern which was great news.
There were more than 21,100 Covid tests on Friday and 22,395 vaccinations were administered.
Ms D’Ath said the Richmond Valley Local Government Area would be declared a hot spot after the NSW Government put Casino into lockdown.
All Queensland Health community vaccination hubs will be open their normal hours on the Monday public holiday.
Asked about the NRL Grand Final on Sunday, Ms D’Ath said a day was a “long time in Covid” but things were looking very positive.
It comes after a new Covid case on the Gold Coast – linked to the Brisbane aviation cluster.
The Covid-positive man spent four days in the community while infectious.
There are also fears of a new case in Hamilton, but Queensland Health could not confirm overnight whether it was new or one already linked to the area.
Premier Annastacia Palaszczuk on Friday declared that she would not hesitate to call a lockdown.
“This is serious … we will go hard, we will go fast if necessary,” she said. “The fundamental reason we’re not in lockdown is because we don’t have any seeding or unlinked community transmission.”
Meanwhile, long queues have formed at vaccine testing centres on the southern Gold Coast after the area was identified as the state’s latest Covid-19 hotspot.
A raft of exposure sites linked to the Brisbane aviation cluster have been named by Queensland Health on the Gold Coast, most in the city’s south.
They include a Kirra holiday resort, two surf clubs, shops, service stations and cafes.
Traffic has been banked up more than a kilometre at the Galleon Way testing centre at Currumbin Waters as anxious locals and visitors rush to get tested.

South-west Victorian students to return to classroom from next week

Full text: All regional students will be back in the classroom from October 26.
It will be a staggered return, Victorian Education Minister James Merlino told regional media outlets on Thursday afternoon.
From Monday next week all Prep to Year 2 students and all final year students return to the classroom full-time, as they were at the end of Term Three.
From Wednesday October 6, once final year students have completed the GAT, all remaining Year 11 students will return to school full-time.
From Monday October 11, Term 2, all students will return back to the classroom at least part-time.
Years 3-4 and 8-9 will return on Tuesdays and Wednesdays, and Year 5-6, and Year 10, will attend on Thursdays and Fridays.
Year 7 students will return five days a week.
"This is an earlier return than metropolitan Melbourne," Minister Merlino said. "This is a positive step forward returning to live in a COVID-normal way."
The only exceptions will be the City of Latrobe and Mitchell Shire, which are currently under stay-at-home restrictions.
Minister Merlino told The Standard Warrnambool will still be included in the regional return to school despite the city's growing COVID-19 cluster.

'We're in a really critical time': 12 new COVID-19 cases confirmed in Warrnambool Warrnambool supermarket worker tests positive to COVID-19 South-west Victoria: Where are all the exposure sites? He said if cases continued to escalate in Warrnambool the public health team would consider bringing the city in line with metropolitan Melbourne's return to school.
"There will be targeted wastewater detection in place in areas of higher risk so we can get the earliest advice possible," he said.
"For you in Warrnambool the plan is: Prep, 1, 2s and final year students back next week, and then all other students back fulltime or part time in week two.
"The public health team remain concerned about the potential for for other outbreaks across rural and regional Victoria. If that's the case, then we'll deal with that on the local government area bases, just like we have with Latrobe and Mitchell."
The news has been met with confusion from some south-west residents.
"They couldn't go to school when we had zero cases now we are getting cases all of a sudden it's safe for kids to go to school? How the hell does that work?" reader Taleah Ledner asked.
Mr Merlino said it was a decision based on the Burnet Institute modelling.
"The Burnet modelling, and the broader public health advice looks at the epidemiology of the situation across the whole of Victoria," he said. "That's what the back to school plan is based on... and that's based on public health advice about making cautious steps where you limit movement of people.
"If we did an all at once across the whole the state of Victoria, that's a million students across 2200 schools, plus all the teachers and staff, plus all the parents and carers.
"The staggered nature for both settings - rural and regional and metropolitan Melbourne - is based on public health advice and is based on the modeling that has been provided.
"The response in Warrnambool and the response in other parts of rural and regional Victoria in terms of getting the jab has been nothing short of outstanding. It's the one thing that we can all do - get vaccinated as soon as you can.
"That's the best way to ensure that our kids stay at school face-to-face."
Students living in regional Victoria going to school metropolitan Melbourne or vice versa will be able to attend learning on-site learning with their year level.
"Students from metropolitan Melbourne will be able to go to school with their peers in regional Victoria," the minister said.
"For staff and final year students required to cross the metropolitan border, staff and final year students must be double vaccinated or be two-weekly tested."
The first delivery of the government's 51,000 air purifiers has arrived in Victoria to be installed in schools throughout Term Four to remove infectious particles from classrooms and prevent any potential spread of the virus.
All government and low-fee non-government schools across the state will also receive a grant of up to $25,000 to purchase shade sails, as part of a $60 million to create more outdoor learning spaces and make it easy for classes to be conducted outside as the warmer months approach.
School communities are leading the way when it comes to vaccinations. Already, 98 per cent of the 40,000 government school staff who have responded to a voluntary survey have received at least one dose of the vaccine - while single dose rates for 16-18 year olds are above 70 per cent, and above 40 per cent per cent for 12-15 year olds.
Masks are strongly encouraged for students as a way to ensure safety and limit the risk of transmission in school settings. Masks will remain mandatory for all students 12 and older, and all adults.
Schools have already implemented measures like staggered pick-up and drop-off times, QR code check-ins for any essential visitors, and as much physical distancing as is possible in classrooms - and when students return, will limit mixing among year levels and use large spaces like halls and gyms where possible.

Full text: EIGHT weeks ago Premier Daniel Andrews consulted his virus model and hit Melbourne with its sixth lockdown.
“I don’t want us to finish up like Sydney,” he said.
Congratulations, Premier: Melbourne today looks nothing like Sydney. It’s worse. Victoria’s infections are rising faster than Sydney’s ever did – 950 new cases on Wednesday, compared to 863 in NSW, a bigger state.
Melbourne also has the nastiest lockdown, plus curfew and mass protests, while Sydney is without a curfew and opening up.
What’s clear is not just that Andrews’ lockdowns have been pointlessly cruel. It’s also clear that the models premiers cite to justify their lockdowns are little better than junk. They’re like the climate models which predict disasters that don’t happen.
If these virus models – computer simulations of outcomes of various policies – were right, Melbourne would be free and Sydney the basket case.
But they’re not.
Just two weeks ago, Professor Raina MacIntyre, a Kirby Institute epidemiologist, criticised the softer lockdown in NSW, warning “our model estimates there will still be numbers in the high thousands by middle of October”.
Instead, new infections in NSW have fallen to one-10th that number. That won’t deter MacIntyre, who remains a media favourite even though her scary models keep flopping.
In March last year, she warned that “hundreds of thousands” of Australians could die of the virus. True death toll: less than 1300.
She then warned that Christmas last year would be “ a ticking time bomb” spreading infections through NSW, which “could be looking at 3000 cases by January 8”.
True number of cases on January 8: just four.
But it’s not just MacIntyre who should chuck whatever she’s using for her models.
Right at the start of this pandemic, the Prime Minister’s advisers said their own models predicted at least 50,000 of us would die.
Another dud model, reported in the Medical Journal of Australia, warned in March last year that “Australia could run out of ICU beds to treat coronavirus patients in as few as 10 days”.
When those 10 days were up – with many hundreds of ICU beds to spare – Australia’s then chief medical officer doubled down: “This is a horrendous scenario. A daily demand for new intensive care beds of 35,000-plus.” True number of Australians with Covid-19 in intensive care today: fewer than 300.
Yet this farce continues.
The Burnet Institute two months ago urged a harder lockdown of Sydney, because unless new controls worked “our model projects that Sydney will have about 7700 cases per day four weeks from now”.
Instead, the NSW government eased its restrictions and infections never topped 1600 a day and are now half that.
The Burnet Institute, undaunted, now advises the Victorian government, predicting up to 2900 daily cases a month from now, but note the critical difference.
In Victoria, Premier Andrews seems to treat models as holy writ, either to cover his backside or maybe because they tell him what he wants to hear: go in even harder.
In contrast, the NSW government now takes such models with a pinch of salt. On Tuesday, NSW Health Minister Brad Hazzard explained why: he said he well remembered being told that models showed 20,000 people in his state would die by last Christmas.
But why are these virus models always so pessimistic? Why are global warming models also so ludicrously catastrophic?
Blame human nature. Which expert is safest and heard more eagerly: the one who predicts the worst and then is pleasantly surprised, or the one who says “don’t panic” and then gets scapegoated when governments are caught out unprepared?
I suspect some virus experts – like global warming academics – also know the kind of models their political masters often prefer. They like ones that falsely predict catastrophe, so they can later take credit for saving us from horrors that were never going to happen.
Brett Sutton, Victoria’s chief health officer, has played that game. Already in April last year, he touted modelling by Monash University and the Doherty Institute to boast that the government’s lockdown had helped save up to 36,000 Victorians from death.
“Hundreds of thousands of Victorians would have been infected if we just had isolation and quarantine.” That’s plainly crazy. Sweden – with twice Victoria’s population and no ocean moat to keep out the infected – had no hard lockdowns and now lives with no restrictions. Yet its death toll is 14,000. Sutton should file his models under “trash” and check the real word. As should we all.

Covid and borders: Peter Gutwein reveals what opening up will mean for Tassie

Full text: The timing and conditions for the state’s border reopening remains unclear.
Digging in around a reopening dependent on double dose vax rates reaching 90 per cent in defiance of the Prime Minister’s call for easing restrictions at 80 per cent, Mr Gutwein told reporters it would not happen before December.
He described New South Wales’ plan to open early as “ a recipe for an acceleration of the spread of the virus”.
Mr Gutwein said Tasmania would await modelling on the impact of the Delta variant of Covid-19 and watch the larger states reopening over the next two months and see how they fared.
>> OPINION: Why it’s time for Tasmania to set the course for normal<<
“We do know and there is no doubt about this that if we were to relax border restrictions at 80 per cent that Covid would enter Tasmania and it would take off,” he said.
“Some people would get sick, some people would get very sick. And unfortunately, some Tasmanians would lose their lives.”
NED-4601
Mr Gutwein said based on existing projections, Tasmania would experience 14,900 cases, up to 590 hospital admissions, 97 people in intensive care admissions and nearly 100 deaths within six months.
The annual flu death toll, by comparison, is 50 to 100 deaths.
“I haven’t sugar coated things,” Mr Gutwein said.
“As we move forward and prepare ourselves for when Delta will one day be here it’s important we take every step we can to protect ourselves and importantly vaccinate ourselves.”
The government is awaiting modelling from the Garvan Institute on the likely prognosis for a local easing of travel restrictions before making an announcement.
When inbound travel resumes, Mr Gutwein warned that it was likely that it would be for double-vaxxed travellers only, who might be subject to testing before and after travel and short periods of quarantine.
“To be very clear Victoria and New South Wales have reopening plans because they are currently closed. Their communities are locked down,” he said.
“Now, under their plans while they get some freedoms back at 80% for fully vaccinated people, even at 90 per cent, as foreshadowed by New South Wales, which they expect to achieve by the 1st of December, they will only come back to being broadly in line with the restrictions that we have in place here.”
NED-4150-Pathway-out-of-pandemic
“Now we have the benefit of watching these two largest states reopen over the next two months, we’re going to have the benefit of watching one of the largest social and health experiments in the country’s history unfold as they attempt to bring their communities broadly into line with where we are here in Tasmania today.”
Director of Public Health Mark Veitch would not say what level of deaths would be considered acceptable, but noted modelling was predictive only, not authoritative.
“What we will do when we get information from the Garvan [Institute], is we will look at the information that it provides the projections of what might happen at various [vaccination] rates we will also look at the Doherty Institute information.
“We’re looking at other states in Australia, what’s happening internationally. So we’ll use multiple pieces of information to inform the decisions about, you know, not just one particular source.”
Tasmania reveals new high risk Queensland areas | September 28 TASMANIA has stopped short of locking the border to Queensland but has declared several high-risk premises following the emergence of six new Covid cases in the mainland state.
Those locations include Brisbane Airport and two separate domestic flights, with possible exposure times between September 17 and 27.
COVID-19 Stats - Horizontal with Lazy Load
Tasmanian Public Health Director Mark Veitch said anyone who had spent time at any of the locations at the specified dates and times would not be allowed to travel to Tasmania.
Dr Veitch said anyone now in Tasmania who had been at any of the sites should immediately isolate and call the Public Health Hotline on 1800 671 738 for advice.
NED-1859 State of our borders
“At this stage, Public Health believes the risk to the Tasmanian community is low and no further restrictions are required,’’ he said.
“However, it will continue to closely monitor the situation in Queensland and respond as necessary to protect the Tasmanian community.”
NED-4476-Australia-Vaccinations-by-LGA
Queensland’s six new cases revealed on Tuesday were divided between two clusters.
Tasmania currently has border restrictions with every Australian state and territory except the Northern Territory.
The entirety of Victoria, New South Wales and the ACT are declared high-risk, while high-risk premises are declared in Queensland, South Australia and Western Australia.

Vaccinating children ‘to slash hospital rates’

Full text: High rates of vaccination among 12 to 15-year-olds is likely to slash the number of hospitalisations for Covid-19 by 20 per cent once the country starts opening up.
That’s the assessment of epidemiologist Tony Blakely, who says vaccinating children would reduce the number of days that states would need to remain in lockdown to halt the spread of the virus.
Younger teenagers have been taking up vaccination at an astonishing rate, with 30.8 per cent now having received at least one dose since vaccines were first made available to the 12 to 15-year age group two weeks ago, The take up of vaccination among 12 to 15 year olds in the past two weeks has been highest in NSW, where an impressive 44.46 per cent of this age group has had one dose. This is followed by the ACT with 41.76 per cent and Victoria with 37.08 per cent.
Almost 29 per cent of 12 to 15 year olds have had at least one dose in the Northern Territory while in Queensland it’s 19.45 per cent. The rates are lowest in South Australia at 12.91 per cent, Tasmania at 12 per cent, and WA at 10.76 per cent.
Professor Blakely said if Australia began to open up at 80 per cent of everyone aged over 16 vaccinated, hospitalisations from Covid-19 would be about 4000 a year. If 80 per cent of the population aged over five years were vaccinated, hospitalisations would reduce to 1000. With 80 per cent of those over 12 vaccinated, the number of hospitalisations might be about 3200. All of those models were predicated on density limits on hospitality venues and social distancing and mask wearing remaining in place.
Even though young teenagers are being vaccinated, Australia’s public reporting of its percentage of the population vaccinated is only for those aged over 16, in contrast to the way numbers are reported in many other countries.
“I think we should definitely be including 12 to 15 year olds in the reporting,” Professor Blakely said.
“Should we be changing the targets? I don’t think so. I think the targets at the moment work to ­incentivise the population to be vaccinated.
“For next year when we’re trying to reach that goal of living with the virus, yes, we should be including all five-plus year olds in our vaccination targets.” Paediatric intensive care doctor Greg Kelly, a spokesman for the group OzSAGE, said he believed children should be included in vaccination targets.
“Should we include children in our percentages? I think the answer to that is we absolutely should, for a few reasons,” Dr Kelly said.
“One, it’s transparent and honest. The second reason is it makes international comparisons possible. Australians, because we are just a little bit behind in the time curve, have the advantage of being able to look overseas and say, well, we want to be more like Denmark or Singapore and less like the UK in terms of the spread of the virus.
“But if everyone’s measuring their percentages differently, it makes it really impossible to ­decide.” Dr Kelly said it was a controversial area as to whether vaccinating young teenagers and children made a significant difference to the spread of the virus.
Doherty Institute modelling indicates it makes only a small amount of difference.
“What we now know, in contrast to earlier, is that children can definitely get Covid, they can definitely spread it to other kids and to their families and to teachers,” Dr Kelly said. “The question about how much they contribute to spread is an active one.” University of Melbourne clinical epidemiologist Nancy Baxter said she agreed that children should be included in vaccination reporting and targets. “I think we should be reporting a percentage of the whole population. That would be more in line with other countries,” she said.

Emergency call record raises health system alarm

Full text: Calls to triple-zero on Monday reached levels not seen since the 2016 thunderstorm asthma event and a record-breaking number of people clogged a major hospital's emergency department, prompting warnings that the Victorian health system will struggle to cope with an expected rise in hospitalisations from COVID-19.
Emergency Services Telecommunications Authority chief executive Marty Smyth said 3250 Victorians called for ambulances on Monday, when a night-time spike caused average call waits to rise above three minutes and up to 24 calls were on hold at once. Between 1600 to 2000 calls were received a day this time last year, he said.
Call volumes have continued to grow during this year's lockdown and modelling predicts a sustained increase as more COVID-infected people require care and injuries in the community rise when lockdown rules are eased.
Authorities will investigate the case of a three-year-old girl who died from cardiac arrest near Bendigo on Monday night after the family's triple-zero call was placed on hold for a minute and 41 seconds - longer than the target time of five seconds almost always met before the pandemic.
At the same time, a video uploaded to social media on Monday showed a line of more than a dozen ambulances parked outside the Northern Hospital waiting to offload patients. The hospital serves Melbourne's northern suburbs, which are at the epicentre of the current COVID-19 outbreak.
Northern Health's acting chief operating officer, Debra Bourne, said about 320 patients presented to emergency in person and about 80 via a virtual portal (which allows COVID-19 patients to see a doctor online), compared to an average of 280 daily emergency presentations at the hospital.
Ms Bourne said it was not the first time a large number of ambulances had waited outside the hospital, but demand on Monday was unprecedented.
She said a number of factors, including the demands of more than 60 COVID-19 patients being cared for at the hospital, combined to create an "extreme challenge".
"We have three wards that have now been converted to COVID wards and we're treating patients that are really unwell," she said.
High demand at the emergency call centre means Victorians dialling triple zero may soon have their calls picked up by interstate operators. Strain on the emergency call system led to some people being put on hold for up to 13 minutes.
Mr Smyth said the demand was comparable to that seen elsewhere in the world but it was the highest since the thunderstorm asthma episode five years ago in which 1900 emergency calls were received in just five hours.
He said Monday's surge could not have been foreseen and flagged plans to divert calls to interstate agencies during surge periods. Unions said the Emergency Services Telecommunications Authority was chronically understaffed.
Mr Smyth said the Bendigo girl's case would be investigated internally and by the Inspector-General for Emergency Management because of the time it took to answer the call.
"We send our condolences to the family ... It's a real concern," he said, adding it was too early to say whether the call wait contributed to the outcome.
Ambulance Victoria's acting regional director for Loddon Mallee, Trevor Weston, said paramedics arrived 14 minutes after the call - within the target time of 15 minutes - and were met some time later by MICA paramedics, who have a higher level of training. The girl did not survive.
Victorian Ambulance Union secretary Danny Hill said even a one-minute delay for a cardiac arrest "could mean the difference between life and death". "Those calls need to be answered within seconds," he said.
The Emergency Services Telecommunications Authority, which was funded to receive 43 new staff in the last state budget, answered about 95 per cent of calls within the target time before the pandemic but call volumes spiked in 2021, driven partly by the poor health of Victorians who deferred care during lockdowns.
A Victorian government spokeswoman said the authority would review its ability to cope with ballooning demand and report back to the government. "Our sincerest condolences and thoughts go out to the family on this tragic incident, and to the paramedics in attendance yesterday," the spokeswoman said.
Victoria's hospitals have faced soaring demand, and increased numbers of patients needing emergency care have led to longer wait times in emergency departments.
Doctors had reported that patients were arriving sicker after putting off treatment or having had their surgeries delayed due to the pandemic. There was widespread concern of burnout among healthcare workers, even before the worst of the expected wave of coronavirus patients.
There are about 375 Victorians in hospital with COVID-19, but that number could increase tenfold by the end of the year, according to Burnet Institute modelling produced for the government.
While images of lines of ambulances idling outside hospitals may shock the public, paramedics and emergency doctors say similar situations occur outside major Melbourne hospitals most days.
But Australasian College for Emergency Medicine president John Bonning said ambulance ramping was a symptom of a stretched health system and the COVID-19 pandemic had exacerbated long-standing issues.
Ambulance Employees Australia Victorian secretary Brett Adie has been among those warning the health system is already at capacity. He called for a more cautious reopening from lockdown to avoid the scenario forecast by the Burnet Institute, in which 3000 or more COVID-19 patients were hospitalised by mid-December.
Mr Adie said it was only possible to push healthcare workers so far before they burnt out and were no longer willing or able to work extra shifts, leading to preventable deaths. "The message that is coming from many people out there is 'too bad, the hospital system just needs to cope'," he said.

Full text: Acting Prime Minister and Member for New England Barnaby Joyce has echoed the message of local doctors that vaccination is the only protection against a COVID crippled health system.
Last week the chair of the New England Division of General Practice, Dr Maree Puxty, told the Armidale Express that getting our community double vaccinated and maintaining mask-wearing in public and social distancing was crucial to managing the opening up of society after lockdown.
Dr Maree Puxty has been a GP since 1993 and is also the chair of the Hunter New England Central Coast Primary Health Network Rural Clinical Council, one of the practice owners of West Armidale Medical Centre, and a senior lecturer in rural health for the University of New England School of Rural Medicine.
She said the ongoing problem of the doctor shortage and the aging population of medical professionals across New England could not be fixed overnight. It was essential we get as many people vaccinated as possible to prevent an overwhelming demand for the hospitalisation of patients with COVID-19, Dr Puxty said.

Council raises health and housing concerns with Barilaro 'We're booked out': Moderna vaccine arrives in Armidale COVID raises the stakes - is our health system ready? When Mr Joyce came to Armidale last Friday to meet with small business owners, the Express asked him if he was concerned about the threat COVID-19 posed to his electorates' health facilities and if the federal government had done high-level planning to support the states' stretched health systems.
Mr Joyce said it all came back to double vaccinating to prevent overburdening hospitals' intensive care units.
"Once we get to a point when 80 per cent of people have been double vaccinated, then we can basically open the show up, and that will be around mid to the end of October," Mr Joyce said.
"Then we will have more vaccines around than people who want to get vaccinated, and we can say if you choose not to be vaccinated, that is your choice, we won't be pushing for any passports, but you must accept the risk.
"The vast majority will not be affected, some will get sick, some will get very sick, and some people will die."
Mr Joyce said once lockdowns ease, there will be a 'mini pandemic, and it will be amongst the people who aren't vaccinated. Those people will get sick, he says, but the effect on the health system could also have dire consequences for those who are vaccinated.
"To get as few people dying as possible, we need as many people inoculated as possible," he said.
"Otherwise, the Armidale ICU beds will fill up with people who have COVID, and then there will be a car crash up the road, and there will be a 14-year-old boy injured, and the ICU beds will be full, and he will die - and that is not just. So to play your part - don't argue against epidemiology."
But the rate of opening up and the double vax numbers that trigger it differ between the medical professional and the politician.
Dr Puxty says most epidemiologists recommend waiting until we reach levels of 90 per cent of the community double vaccinated, and she thinks we should open up gradually and continue to use periodic stay at home and local government area isolation strategies to limit the spread of the virus.
"I'm not sure things will ever return to how they were two years ago," she said.
Mr Joyce said the federal government is guided by the Doherty Institute report and wants to open up as soon as double vaccination numbers reach 80 per cent because the economy cannot sustain a prolonged lockdown.
"If we make it too high, then you're going to go broke, businesses in Armidale are already going broke, and we also have the issue of mental health - we've seen an increase in the suicide rate during these lockdowns," he said.
"You've got to balance that off, and we've been advised that 80 per cent is the figure - it is a complete juggle. Test, vaccinate, isolate is part of the Doherty plan, but shutting whole areas down will not happen because the economy just can't sustain it. We can't afford to pay for it, and the impact on mental health is becoming a bigger concern in some areas than the possibility of dying from COVID."

Mr Joyces' comments came the day after the Doherty Institute Director of Epidemiology, Jodie McVernon, told an NSW parliamentary hearing on Thursday that modelling by the institute used when setting targets of 70 and 80 per cent vaccination coverage for reopening did not reflect the true virulence of the Delta strain.
New international research shows the severity of health outcomes from the Delta strain is worse than the original Alpha strain, and future Doherty modelling will now reflect this, she said.
If the severity from Delta is about twice what was originally assumed, the numbers of hospitalisations of unvaccinated people will probably be double what has been predicted, Professor McVernon agreed.
Retired Tamworth GP Lyn Allen also says a high double vaccination rate is the only thing that will prevent a crisis in the health system. Dr Allen told Australian Community Media that doctors were not the only health staff we couldn't do without in a pandemic.
"We need more than more doctors; we need more everything," she said.
"I think that if coronavirus comes in our area, we don't have enough trained staff, we don't have enough intensive care beds. By trained staff, I don't mean the paramedics; I mean the nurses and the doctors, to handle it."
Dr Allen said a pandemic outbreak would put even more stress on an already stretched system and could see some patients triaged out.
"Just because we've got a pandemic doesn't mean everything else doesn't happen as well," she said.

Covid-19: NSW plots a scenario for unvaccinated to re-enter the economy

Full text: Officials are now working on three “road maps” for NSW’s exit from lockdown, including for unvaccinated residents, although ­discussions remain ongoing as to how the state will accommodate them and when this should occur.
The first road map is expected to take effect on October 11 once the state reaches its first benchmark of 70 per cent vaccination coverage; this will see a significant easing of restrictions applying to restaurants, retailers and other industry groups, allowing them to recommence trade.
A second plan will ease restrictions further once 80 per cent coverage is achieved; it is mooted to take effect from October 25, according to an official familiar with the matter, who said the third plan for unvaccinated residents remained a work in progress.
The NSW crisis cabinet discussed unvaccinated residents on Friday and reached a consensus that they should be permitted to participate in the economy later this year, most likely before Christmas, the official said.
This would coincide with vaccination rates reaching statewide double-dosage targets of 90 per cent, they added.
Central to discussions was the need to minimise the impact of a predicted jump in Covid-19 caseloads, which are forecast to overrun the health system in coming weeks and potentially overwhelm intensive care units.
On Sunday, the state had 961 fresh cases of the virus in the 24 hours to 8pm on Saturday and nine deaths among people in their 40s, 60s, 70s and 80s, eight of whom were unvaccinated; the ninth had one vaccine dose.
Modelling by the Burnet Institute for the NSW government during late August predicted a surge in hospitalisations during the latter half of October and first two weeks of November.
On the day the modelling was released - September 6 - 177 people were in ICUs receiving treatment for Covid-19. The institute’s forecasts predicted ICU admissions peaking at 560 Covid-19 cases, most likely during November, at which time they would overwhelm the hospital system.
Figures released on Sunday by NSW Health showed 1146 Covid-19 patients were being treated in hospital, with 222 people in intensive care.
At a press briefing on Sunday, Premier Gladys Berejiklian spoke optimistically about the outlook for NSW over coming months but conceded case numbers would spike as restrictions were eased.
She said residents considering intrastate travel during November and December could be assured their plans would not need to be put in jeopardy by the pandemic response, although some regions could return to lockdown if health officials deemed it necessary.
“It is safe to book for Christmas,” she said. “Definitely look at November as a month when you can start planning a trip that you may not have been able to have within NSW for a very long time.”
She said her preference was that the entire state open at the same time.

Opinion: Don’t bank on open borders for Christmas, Palaszczuk won’t allow it

Full text: The reason for keeping the borders closed is a moot point.
Whether she uses poor vaccination rates, Doherty Institute modelling or simply says it’s the “health advice”, the one thing Ms Palaszczuk will not waver on is keeping the state closed off from the rest of the world.
There are two primary reasons.
Firstly, the polling being received by the government shows Queenslanders want their liberty and freedom.
She also knows a massive Delta outbreak would undo all her political goodwill.
It’s the only thing this government has going for it - we kept you safe when the rest of the world suffered.
Secondly, the hospital system in Queensland will not cope with a mass outbreak.
Ramping is rife and Queensland Health is a basket case, poorly equipped to handle an escalating Covid crisis.
Queensland Vaccine Locator
So the hard border closures will remain, bubbles will continue to be burst and the exemptions unit will fail to recognise legitimate cases where people deserve the right to return to see loved ones.
When asked about a 90 per cent vax rate being the benchmark to open
up, the premier said she would rely on the Doherty Institute data.
The thing about data and statistics and modelling is that beauty is
in the eye of the beholder - the ones analysing the data hold the ace
card.
As far as the Palaszczuk government is concerned, the data is in -
Fortress Queensland is here to stay and only a brave person would
predict when it reopens again.

ICU needs overhaul to handle case surge

Publication info: The Age ; Melbourne, Vic. [Melbourne, Vic]. 21 Sep 2021: 1.

Full text: Doctors say Victoria's intensive care units would be forced to ration specialist staff and have them treat many more patients to cope if hundreds of seriously ill people hit hospitals by mid-December as predicted.
The forecast came as Premier Daniel Andrews walked back a pledge to establish 4000 extra ICU beds in the state, saying a scenario where thousands of beds were required at the Melbourne Convention and Exhibition Centre was "not what success looks like".
Burnet Institute modelling underpinning Victoria's road map out of lockdown estimates that by the middle of December there could be between 462 and 953 coronavirus patients needing intensive care, probably exceeding the system's current capacity.
Intensive care leaders said that caring for roughly 700 patients at once would be incredibly hard and require changes to the way intensive care units normally operate.
About 400 nurses were given training or refreshers in the field in the past year.
Australian and New Zealand Intensive Care Society president Anthony Holley said yesterday that Victoria had 403 intensive care beds staffed and available, and 57 COVID patients in these units. He said it would be possible to ramp that up to the levels predicted in the Burnet Institute modelling, but it would come at significant cost to staff and involve the need to expand into other areas of hospitals.
"I'm not saying it is easy and I'm not saying that this isn't a crisis. A lot of thought has gone into it and ... we will continue to deliver critical care at a very high standard," Dr Holley said. "I don't anticipate us ending up in a situation [that we've seen overseas] where people are dying in the waiting room."
The availability of critical care nurses remains the key challenge, and Dr Holley said one way to relieve their workload could be teams of allied health staff and nurses from other areas coming in to help turn or bathe patients.
Intensive care doctors, who typically oversee about 10 patients, would also be able to take on a higher number of people. "The longer it goes on, the harder it becomes to keep up the momentum," he said.
There are now 209 people with coronavirus in Victorian hospitals. Of those, 86 per cent were not vaccinated, 12 per cent were partially vaccinated and just three people were fully vaccinated.
The announcement of 567 new cases yesterday, the largest number this year, was followed by news that a woman in her 70s from Moreland had died from the disease.
In a boost to the state's supply of vaccines, the Pharmacy Guild of Australia's Victorian president, Anthony Tassone, said 440 pharmacies in Victoria would receive the Moderna vaccine this week, and an additional 281 pharmacies would get it in about a week.
There are signs the outbreak may be losing pace, prompting hope that Victoria can defy the Burnet Institute's predictions of thousands of daily cases by December and peak lower than NSW's outbreak, which may have reached a ceiling around the 1500 mark.
Only 935 new cases were reported in NSW yesterday, though Premier Gladys Berejiklian said it was still expected that October would be the worst month for the state's hospitals.
Deakin University epidemiology chair Catherine Bennett said the reproduction number of Victoria's outbreak had dropped close to 1.2.
If the rate dropped to 1.1, Victoria would start easing restrictions at a much lower number than forecast, which might mean the assumptions made in the modelling are too pessimistic.
In April last year, the Victorian government announced $1.3 billion would be spent to quickly establish an extra 4000 ICU beds and "secure the ICU equipment, staff and space we need".
But yesterday, the Premier said it was never going to be possible to have "4000 beds down at a warehouse somewhere" with nurses ready to go.
"While we've made many investments to increase the number of staff, it's not like a switch where you can suddenly turn a nurse into a critical care-qualified nurse," Mr Andrews said.
One of Australia's leading health economists, Stephen Duckett, said while current best practice is one ICU nurse per patient, this could be shifted to one ICU nurse staffing two beds alongside another nurse without intensive care experience.
Stephen Warrillow, the director of intensive care at Melbourne's Austin Hospital, said caring for about 700 patients in Victoria's intensive care units at any one time would require all the usual staff to work, along with new recruits from departments with similar skills, including anaesthesia.

Full text: The politics of Covid-19 response is changing quickly for leaders The evidence from overseas is now clear that the worst health outcomes from the pandemic increasingly are being felt by the unvaccinated. Armed with this knowledge, governments at all levels must continue to do everything they can to encourage as many people as possible to get vaccinated before restrictions are removed. This said, there is no escaping the fact it is neither politically nor economically possible to keep the economy on ice and people confined indefinitely. As Acting Prime Minister Barnaby Joyce said on Monday, the country’s road map to reopening cannot be held back by Australians who choose to not get vaccinated. With Victoria approaching a world record for time spent in lockdown, the politics of Covid is changing. Tuesday’s Newspoll results show more people, 53 per cent, still are concerned about moving out of restrictions too early, resulting in poor health outcomes, than are worried about acting too late at the expense of the economy, 42 per cent. But the trend is clearly towards opening. When the same question was asked in April last year, the result was 72 per cent were more worried about opening up than the 24 per cent concerned about acting too quickly. On top of the two-party-preferred result showing the Coalition trailing Labor 47 per cent to 53 per cent, the poll results raise issues of concern for Scott Morrison. The Prime Minister is still preferred as leader over Anthony Albanese, 47 per cent to 35 per cent. But this is a big turnaround from the 56 per cent to 30 per cent poll result in April last year. The rating of Mr Morrison’s performance handling coronavirus has slumped from 85 per cent positive in April to 48 per cent positive today.
Among state leaders, Victorian Premier Daniel Andrews’ rating for handling the pandemic well has dropped from 85 per cent to 63 per cent. NSW Premier Gladys Berejiklian’s rating for handling the pandemic has fallen from 77 per cent to 56 per cent. Queensland Premier Annastacia Palaszczuk’s rating has fallen from 72 per cent to 67 per cent.
Mr Andrews and Ms Berejiklian have warned in recent days that residents of the two most populous states must expect a rise in Covid-19 cases and possible fatalities when restrictions are eased. Mr Andrews said Victoria’s health system would face intense pressure but he insisted the state would be able to pass through the reopening spike to a position where it could live with the virus. “We cannot perennially or permanently suppress this virus,” he said.
Ms Berejiklian cited the Doherty Institute modelling underpinning national cabinet’s plan for reopening when she said Australia needed to prepare to see high case numbers when her state reopened after reaching 80 per cent. “I say to all my colleagues that even when you get 80 per cent double dose and start opening up, you will get Covid-19 in your community. So please accept that and get ready for that,” she said on Sunday. “Numbers might be higher than we have ever seen. In fact, the Doherty report predicts that the case numbers that we will see are likely to be the highest cases we have seen in Australia.” The Doherty Institute on Monday detailed the results of revised modelling that showed if restrictions were eased at 70 per cent vaccination with thousands of cases in the community, there would be a spike in infections to tens of thousands of people. As coverage increased beyond 80 per cent for double-vaccinated people, the epidemic came under control. As a result, Doherty recommended that case numbers continued to be strongly suppressed until 80 per cent coverage was reached. There is a lot riding politically on what happens to case numbers and health outcomes when restrictions are eased, and greater domestic and international travel is resumed. If things go badly, leaders will be punished for acting too quickly and putting voters in danger. If things go well, the pandemic will recede quickly as an issue for leaders who have been brave enough to face it. State leaders outside NSW and Victoria also will have a lot riding on how things go. Whatever the outcome, however, the best strategy for all leaders remains to get as many of their citizens fully vaccinated as quickly as possible.

Premier walks tightrope in agonising path to freedom

Full text: Premier Daniel Andrews is in a wicked political position. For the next few months, he will walk a tightrope between the need to restore some measure of normality to people's lives and the importance of protecting lives, and our health system.
When presented with modelling from the Burnet Institute that suggests a "moderate" risk of the hospitals being overwhelmed even if no rules are eased, he and his Chief Health Officer Brett Sutton predictably erred on the side of caution.
Victoria will be in lockdown for another six weeks until the 70 per cent double-dose mark. Even after that, retail and hospitality businesses won't be able to trade indoors and people won't be able to meet at another person's house. Those milestones will not come until 80 per cent vaccination.
Gladys Berejiklian's government will do at 70 per cent what Victoria is planning to do at 80, and density limits will still apply.
Because NSW received emergency supplies of vaccines and is weeks ahead in its inoculation program, it means Victorians will probably need to wait a whole month after NSW reaches its 70 per cent target, forecast on October 9, to experience similar freedoms.
This will be jarring for Victorians.
The question Andrews government MPs will be pondering is whether the community can bear waiting even longer in return for protecting our health workers and their ability to provide an acceptable level of care to non-COVID patients. Labor politicians will also be wondering how many businesses will be able to reopen their doors come November.
Andrews yesterday was at pains to offer hope and the potential for a Christmas lunch with family. But each positive was followed by a warning about the fatal consequences of opening too quickly.
In the pandemic, polling showed Andrews' advantage over the Coalition lay largely in voters' belief that Labor was better at protecting people from COVID-19. The Premier cannot afford a situation where news bulletins are filled with hospitals struggling to cope, grieving families, and ambulances driven by soldiers because there are not enough paramedics.
The Premier governs with a laser focus on his voter base. His strong emphasis on protecting "nurses and ambos" is difficult to miss.
His focus on these groups is driven by an intention to save lives and maintain health services, but it is also political. These workers and their unions were crucial to his 2014 and 2018 election wins both in terms of their propensity to vote Labor and to knock on doors to campaign for him. "We will stand with you," the Premier told these workers yesterday.
Much of the community is deeply battered by stay-at-home rules and their weariness has led to a creeping unwillingness to abide by the letter of the laws. Rightly or wrongly, some may question whether Andrews places too much emphasis on health workers who signed up to do a difficult job.
None of the state's ministers want the hospital system to be put under pressure.
However, there have recently been differences of opinion on the reopening of schools and elements of the picnic plan. Some ministers are more worried about social and economic harm of further lockdowns, while Sutton, who obviously cares about these costs, has put a higher priority on keeping case numbers as low as possible.
More than anything else, Andrews - and Victorians - will be hoping the Burnet modelling is overly pessimistic. Its predictions are underpinned by an assumption that case numbers continue on the same trajectory as they were rising as at September 17.
However, the rate of growth has dropped in Victoria in the past week and slowed significantly in NSW, where the crucial reproduction rate is now less than 1. This could be a sign that vaccine uptake will soon start bending Victoria' epidemic curve downwards.
Could we ease more restrictions at 70 per cent if the real-world scenario panned out better than the Burnet model predicts? "I absolutely hope so," Andrews said yesterday.
Victorians, and Andrews, will cross their fingers in unison.

Hotspot borders set to be reviewed

Full text: The NSW government is reviewing hotspot boundaries, with pressure mounting to free suburbs from harsher restrictions as vaccination rates in some areas rise as much as 66 per cent in less than two months.
A review is under way to amend how health authorities target areas with rising case numbers, addressing concerns that alternatives to blanket lockdowns for local government areas could be needed in future outbreaks.
Liberal MPs have been urging Premier Gladys Berejiklian to rethink the boundaries dividing Sydney and release suburbs with low case numbers from harsher settings.
But modelling from the Burnet Institute released yesterday said harsher restrictions, and not rising vaccination rates, had the greatest impact on slowing the spread of coronavirus in south-west and western Sydney.
Under present restrictions, the institute said case numbers in other parts of Sydney would soon overtake the hotspots and warned against relying solely on vaccination to halt the spread.
"It may be necessary to impose greater restrictions ... in at least, in some of the LGAs with higher growth rates to curb this growth," the report said.
Daily numbers in Sydney hotspots plateaued only one week after restrictions, including curfews, store closures and one-hour outdoor exercise limits were introduced on August 23, the modelling found.
"Without these stricter measures, we expect about 2000 cases per day by now and about 4000 per day by the end of the month, instead of the 1000 per day currently in these 12 LGAs," the Burnett, a medical research organisation in Melbourne, found.
The analysis was not commissioned by the NSW government. It is separate from Burnet modelling released by the state government last week, which was conducted in August to predict the growth of the outbreak in this period and over the next three months.
Yesterday's modelling reveals "what's actually happened", said Professor Allan Saul, who worked on the project.
"This shows what worked and the implications in the future. We have seen a very sharp transition around August 29, when we expected to see the extra restrictions of August 23 take effect," he said.
NSW reported 1127 new local cases and two deaths yesterday. Numbers are down on Monday's figures, but authorities said it was too early to determine whether infections had peaked. The reproductive rate is ranging from 1 to 1.2.
Deputy Chief Health Officer Jeremy McAnulty fronted the media in the first COVID-19 update without Ms Berejiklian or a government minister since she announced an end to daily press conferences last week.
There are 1253 coronavirus patients admitted to hospital, with 231 in intensive care and 104 who require ventilation.
NSW is expected to hit 80 per cent first-dose vaccination coverage in people aged 16 and over today, following a significant push for shots in hotspots over the past two months.
Dr McAnulty said a rapid increase in immunisation in areas such as Cumberland Council, in Sydney's west, could have contributed to declining numbers.
Vaccine uptake has also jumped dramatically in hotspot areas such as Burwood, Campbelltown and Fairfield, where first dose coverage has increased by 64-65 percentage points in less than two months. University of Queensland vaccine researcher and infectious disease physician Paul Griffin said there was "no question" vaccination was having an impact on Sydney's numbers, but said it was going to be "a combination of everything that's been done".
Case numbers continue to rise in inner-city suburbs such as Redfern and Waterloo, but there have been no moves to name them as areas of concern.
In Sydney's west, Liberal member for Riverstone Kevin Conolly joined MPs calling on the Premier to lift some hotspot suburbs from harsher restrictions and to apply them by suburbs and not LGAs.
"I think it's time for the suburbs of northern Blacktown to be released because case numbers are coming down," he said.
Riverstone resident Kristin Carville said his 2765 postcode was unfairly captured by the lockdown covering Blacktown LGA despite having low case numbers and high vaccination.
"Our postcode covers eight suburbs spread across four LGAs. There are four suburbs in Hills LGA, two in Blacktown, one in Penrith and one more split between Hawkesbury and Blacktown," Mr Carville said.
"Potentially the majority of the cases for this postcode are in the Hills LGA, however it is Blacktown LGA that suffers."

Premier's gamble as NSW dices with deadly Delta

Publication info: Sydney Morning Herald ; Sydney, N.S.W. [Sydney, N.S.W]. 11 Sep 2021: 4.

Full text: Why now? That was the burning question Gladys Berejiklian failed to satisfactorily answer yesterday morning, announcing an end to daily 11am media briefings that have been a hallmark of the government's response to the state's crippling Delta outbreak.
As she herself warns, the darkest days for the health system lie ahead. She even had the head of the ambulance service, Dr Dominic Morgan, standing next to her acknowledging that right now every day is akin to the unrelenting demands of a New Year's Eve for paramedics.
Yet when Berejiklian most needs to maintain public trust, she cuts back the government's exposure to questioning. Health department bureaucrats will instead present an information bulletin each morning while she and senior ministers will front the media only when "we need to communicate something very important".
Meanwhile, the government has suspended Parliament and refused upper house sittings next week, despite approaches from Labor and the crossbenchers.
The controversial change in the communications strategy come as vaccination rates show signs of slowing. The rate of new people coming forward for a jab has dropped from around 1.5 per cent a day to 1 per cent, the Premier revealed on Friday. "We have seen in other places around the world that things start to slow down between 70 and 80 per cent ... we do not want to see that here" she warned.
Berejiklian and chief health officer Dr Kerry Chant take the lion's share of credit for chivvying NSW citizens into a position where the state now has a 77.3 per cent first dose take-up - heading towards 80 per cent next week. It makes the decision to walk away from the best platform they have for exhorting ever higher vaccination rates even harder to comprehend.
The government's fortunes hang on the long -awaited and ambitious road map for easing the lockdown, unveiled to a weary populace on Thursday. It will kick in on the Monday after 70 per cent double vaccination has been reached. On current projections that could be as soon as mid-October, though few would take the gamble of fixing as precise a date as celebrity chef Luke Mangan, who announced plans for a black-tie dinner on October 20.
The suite of freedoms proposed at 70 per cent double dose is broad. They encompass the re-opening (with limits) of pubs, hairdressers, gyms, non-essential retail, cinemas and theatres, as well as allowing up to 500 people at outdoor events. There will be dancing at weddings with up to 50 guests, and up to 50 mourners at funerals. Masks are to be worn at indoor venues.
It all comes wrapped in what one minister privately calls the "mother of all caveats": that health authorities will be able to clamp down on movement if coronavirus cases surge in certain suburbs or areas.
There was much enthusiastic spruiking from Treasurer Dominic Perrottet and Deputy Premier John Barilaro on Thursday, with a clearly relieved Treasurer anticipating an "incredibly bright summer". The business community welcomed the news with open arms, with the Committee for Sydney hailing it as "the road map we desperately needed".
Customer Service Minister Victor Dominello says the road map is about crystallising incentives and trying to further turbocharge vaccine uptake.
"It's basic behavioural science. We are the first state to provide a road map out and every state will follow. We are trying to show the nation how we can open up to the world."
Yet it's unquestionably a gamble, albeit a calculated one. There is a level of nervousness among some of Berejiklian's senior colleagues that belies the outward confidence they can pull the tightrope walk off. "At the end of the day it will depend on how our ICUs are tracking" one senior government figure admitted. "There is so much that could happen between now and then [the 70 per cent opening date]. This is the balancing act of trying to provide confidence and hope but being honest at the same time in the light of uncertainty".
Berejiklian counts on vaccine uptake kicking in quickly enough to put the brakes on case numbers and hospital admissions. Despite the insistence of Barilaro on Friday that public health advice had endorsed the road map, a senior government insider confirms Chant and her team remained worried about too much relaxation before a double vaccination rate closer to between 80 and 85 per cent. Chant danced around this when journalists attempted to grill her on Thursday, deflecting to underscore the need to get high vaccination rates.
She also avoided addressing whether she was comfortable sticking to the road map if the effective reproduction rate of the virus (the "Reff" or R rate) was above one at the time 70 per cent double dose is reached - ie still on a trajectory for increasing community transmission.
According to the University of Melbourne's James McCaw, a modeller who advises the federal government, the current R value in NSW is 1.07. That remains a concern.
There are also concerns about the Delta variant's potential to take root in parts of the community where vaccination rates are lower. In NSW there are about 66,000 people aged over 70 who are yet to have a first dose and about 330,000 people over 50 yet to have a first dose.
While first-dose figures in parts of the city's west surge past 80 per cent, rates of vaccination in the city's eastern suburbs and metro Sydney are low: only 36 per cent of people in City of Sydney have been fully vaccinated and only 60 per cent have had their first dose. Mosman is about 55 per cent fully vaccinated, Cumberland is at about 34 per cent.
Epidemiologist and global health researcher from the ANU Meru Sheel says another reason to take easing of restrictions cautiously is that unlike in Britain, where cases have risen but hospitalisations have so far been manageable, Australia has not had a high disease burden. The British populace "has naturally acquired immunity that Australia has not," Dr Sheel says.
Modelling released by Melbourne's Burnet Institute just last Monday projects ICU operations in NSW will tip over to "overwhelming" status in the next two months, with peaks of 3434 patients hospitalised and 947 patients in ICU.
Yet at the same time the city's pubs will see the return of eager (vaccinated) drinkers, fuelled by the city's warm pre-summer glow.
Brendan Crabb, director of the Burnet Institute, says the "assumption" in Monday's modelling was that restrictions would be maintained. "If restrictions ease, that will affect the [model]" Crabb warns.
"In addition to high vaccination rates we need very effective test, trace, quarantine and isolation to keep numbers low; that is critical. And [this] can only work well if numbers are low. I understand the desperation to open and to reward people to get vaccinated but it needs to be balanced."
Berejiklian frequently cites the national plan based on the Doherty Institute modelling as justification for the road map unveiled this week. Yet a close reading of Doherty shows it too recommends "optimal" test, tracing and isolation measures and "medium" settings for public health restrictions to ease at 70 per cent against the backdrop of a substantial case load.
Barilaro warns if there is a single active case in towns or regions, that could send them back immediately into lockdown for 14 days. "That is the commitment we have made to Health," he said on Thursday.
Sydney immunologist and public health expert Professor John Dwyer says there will have to be vigilant maintenance of public health measures throughout.
Even at 80 per cent coverage, he warns, there is no "magic figure and that it's over and done with".

Full text: This week the NSW Premier Gladys Berejikilian released the bare bones of a plan for how our healthcare system is going to cope under the growing pressure of COVID-19, particularly in Sydney and its 12 LGAs of concern.
The intensive care demand and capacity modelling, produced by the Burnet Institute for the state government, provides a small piece in the strategic puzzle for how our healthcare system is expected to manage peak demand for services. It has not yet grappled with what that looks like if the state starts to open back up when 70 per cent of the state's population is fully vaccinated.
At that point, health authorities will decide which restrictions may be eased and where. The mantra rolled out at 11am each day is that it comes down to how many people will need to be cared for in hospitals, how many people will need to be in an Intensive Care Unit (ICU) and how many of those will require ventilation.
What is the modelling based on? The Burnet Institute was asked to provide projections to the NSW government based on the state's case numbers to date, taking into account anticipated vaccine rollout, ongoing lockdowns, and assuming an 18-day average stay in hospital for people requiring hospitalisation. It is based on data available as at August 27, and in the reported scenario, public health restrictions are maintained. The calculations are based on the current rate of hospitalisation of COVID patients of about 11 per cent, as well as the pressure mounting on the NSW Ambulance Service, and the possible need to transfer patients into hospitals further from home.
It also considers the number and proportion of people receiving care in their homes, and underlying/ongoing activity in emergency departments, ICUs, and in hospitals generally.
The key findings It predicts that, within Sydney's LGAs of concern, cases are expected to continue increasing until mid-September to between 1100 and 2000 cases per day when it is anticipated sufficient vaccine-acquired immunity will kick in. It says a corresponding peak in hospital and ICU utilisation will follow, with between 2200 and 3900 people in the LGAs of concern requiring hospitalisation.
Critically, it suggests the city's health system will go into 'code black' mode in mid-October, when ICU occupancy across the state hits 947. That is a combination of the estimated number of people in ICU for non-COVID related issues (387), plus estimated COVID ICU demand (560) just after a peak in hospitalisations of 3434.
The premier says the state's ICU surge capacity is 1550 beds - way beyond the estimated demand of 947 beds. She has also flagged that this is the time she expects we will reach 70 per cent and start opening up.
What is 'code black'? The modelling involves a stepped approach, with four steps in a traffic light system from, green to black.
The health system is expected to enter 'code black' mode when the demand for intensive care units beds exceeds 947 patients, sparking the introduction of strategies including the possible ventilation of patients in operating theatres and nurses being asked to supervise more than one patient.
Level 0: Green - Minimal impact on daily operations of ICU - Less than 579 cases per day. The model suggests ICU pressure to move beyond Level 0 by mid-September.
Level 1: Yellow - ICU approaching maximal operational capacity - Moderate impact on daily operations of ICU (between 579 cases and 790 cases in ICU) Transfer of critically ill patients - who may be moved into other areas outside of ICU and may be cared for by non-ICU staff such as anaesthetists or nurses in an operating theatre or recovery area.
Level 2: Red - Severe impact on daily operations of ICU - Overall demand for critical care exceeding ICU operational capacity (791 to 926 cases) At this point, 'care alternative workforce strategies' will mean nurses care for more than one patient in a 'team nursing' approach, perhaps in operating theatres or other unused areas of the hospital.
Level 3: Black - Overwhelming impact on usual daily operations of ICU - demand for critical care services significantly exceeds organisation-wide capacity (more than 926 cases). At this stage, "NSW Pandemic Resource-based decision making" is activated but the details have not been released. It will include greater use of private hospitals, but health officials have said that field hospitals were not part of the plan, except in the worst-case scenario.
The response? Healthcare professionals have called on the state government to reveal more details of its planned 'roadmap' out of COVID-19 lockdowns, as well as how the healthcare system overall is going to cope, including those in rural and regional areas.
NSW President of the Australian Medical Association Danielle McCullen said on Tuesday there was no detail on what coping with COVID-related demand looks like if the state starts opening up with a vaccination rate of 70 per cent. "The government has released its modelling for ICU demand and capacity, and it has a plan for phased reopening based on vaccination numbers, but where is the plan for non-COVID care?"
Nurses, too, are concerned. Brett Holmes, General Secretary NSW Nurses and Midwives' Association, has said intensive care nurses were calling out, even before this latest wave of COVID-19, for improved staffing in ICU.

Full text: Children as young as five will need to be vaccinated against coronavirus to achieve herd immunity, according to new research.
Modelling from the Medical Journal of Australia shows the current mixed vaccination program will not be enough to protect the entire populous against COVID-19, until younger children between five and 16 can be fully vaccinated.
The data from MJA is based on the entire population rather the Doherty Institute modelling, which is based on 70 to 80 per cent inoculation rates of the adult population needed before lockdowns and state border closures can be eased.
MJA's revelation comes as the ACT government, from Monday onwards, begins prioritising year 12 students for Pfizer jabs to ensure exams can be conducted in physical classrooms.
RELATED: Victoria records 246 new COVID cases as outbreak hits new high
The James Cook University and Monash University report found vaccinating high-risk transmitters, such as children and younger people, would be a priority once most of the population had received two COVID-19 vaccines.
JCU infectious disease expert Emma McBryde said without vaccinating children between the ages of five and 15, the total population would only reach a herd immunity of about 60 to 70 per cent.
"Vaccinating the vulnerable first is the optimal policy at low coverage, but vaccinating high transmitters becomes more important in settings where reproduction numbers are lower and coverage is higher," Ms McBryde said.
"Australia is unlikely to achieve herd protection unless vaccination is extended to younger ages or combined with other measures.
"Australia should now prioritise delivering Pfizer vaccine to 12 to 40 year-olds."

Vaccination policy among younger children has become a heated debate with some states and territories flagging re-openings would not occur until children were eligible for immunisations.
Queensland Premier Annastacia Palaszczuk has faced criticism from the Morrison government for saying the state's border would remain closed until children were fully vaccinated.
The splintering of the national plan has also embroiled Western Australia and Tasmania, which have also flagged hesitation to reopen while case numbers surge in COVID-plagued states.
ATAGI and the federal government have approved Pfizer shots in children as young as 12 years old, however Home Affairs minister Karen Andrews, who took a swipe at the Queensland premier last Friday said no jurisdiction in the world had mandated vaccines for younger children.
Ms Palaszczuk has also been condemned for exaggerating Doherty figures, claiming once targets are reached, 80 people a day would still die from COVID-19.
The debate over children being eligible for a shot has also coincided with new figures showing the ACT is leading the country in the number of people who have received two doses of either vaccine.
The nearly 50 per cent of the Canberra population being vaccinated is in despite of 15 new cases being recorded in the 24 hours to Saturday at 8pm.
Meanwhile, federal minister Stuart Robert has left the door open to changing the national COVID-19 reopening plan amid growing reservations from state and territory leaders.
The close ally of the Prime Minister says the plan, which proposes that coronavirus restrictions ease once vaccination rates hit 70 and 80 per cent, is regarded as a guide that may need to be altered if circumstances change.
Asked on the ABC's Insiders program if the 80 per cent threshold might shift if there is worry about hospitals coping with COVID, Mr Robert responded with: "Goodness, anything could change next week."
"Well, of course plans change," he said. "Come on, nothing's set in stone. My goodness."
"Look at the last 12 months, things have been shifting on a daily and weekly basis. A plan is always a basis for change, it has to be."
So far, more than 35 per cent of the eligible Australian population aged over 16 are fully vaccinated with two doses.
Mr Robert said lockdown decisions were for premiers, but the national plan would provide guidance.
"At 80 per cent mark, you would be questioning why there are lockdowns," he said on Sunday.
ACT Chief Minister Andrew Barr said Mr Robert appeared to have "read the national plan".
"Even just a cursory glance at the one page document that constitutes the national plan does say that it is based on the current situation and subject to change," Mr Barr said.
Deputy Labor leader Richard Marles said it was important that the national plan was supported, but felt premiers had legitimate questions about children. "What's important is that the federal government is working with the states to bring them along," Mr Marles told Sky News' Sunday Agenda program.

Economy holding up but fiscal policy support still needed

Full text: A notable difference today, despite the emergence of the highly transmittable Delta variant, is the resilience of financial markets, led by continued risk appetite.
This resilience, if it is sustained, is one reason to be cautiously hopeful that the economic downturn in Australia, centred on the lockdowns in southeastern states and the ACT, will be less damaging than during the first Covid wave last year.
Indeed, the latest June quarter national accounts showed strong momentum in domestic spending ahead of the lockdowns.
In particular, the development of vaccines and their subsequent availability in richer nations has allowed major economies with relatively high vaccination rates to remain open.
This has supported risk appetite, allowing global markets to look ahead to continued growth in profits, despite the rebound in infections with the spread of the Delta strain. For example, share prices in the US and Europe are at record levels.
A further differentiating factor is that unlike when the pandemic hit in 2020, monetary and fiscal policies in most economies today are already at emergency levels of stimulus.
With continued gains in financial and asset prices, household and business balance sheets have been fortified while ultra-low interest rates, large dividend payments by companies, and financial injections from governments have backstopped incomes and spending.
In Australia’s case, the lower vaccination rates have meant it has not been possible to avoid lockdowns in jurisdictions where there have been new waves of infections caused by the Delta strain.
Large case numbers, particularly in NSW, have placed significant pressure on the health system, while households, communities and businesses most exposed to lockdowns, restrictions and the closed international border have suffered renewed financial stress.
The September quarter in Australia will see a large drop in production and a sharp rise in underemployment. GDP could fall by 2 to 3 per cent, a recession on any objective measure, and underemployment, which takes account of the reduced hours being worked, could rise to 10 to 11 per cent in the next few months.
Fortunately, there are some early signs that the downturn is not accelerating. Financial conditions have remained highly accommodative, share prices rose further in July and August, albeit at a slower pace than in the US and Europe, and the weekly reads on consumer sentiment have steadied after falling in late July/early August. Further, information from purchasing managers also points to a steadying in service sector activity this month after a sharp drop in July, and at levels well above those during the first wave. Consistent with this, capex plans by companies in service sectors have held up during July and early August.
That said, it is probable that the expected rebound in the final months of the year, as vaccination rates hopefully rise to 70 to 80 per cent, will only partially recover the ground lost during the downturn. This is because lockdowns and restrictions in NSW, Victoria and possibly the ACT are likely to persist into at least part of the December quarter.
Even in NSW where the vaccination rate has jumped sharply, daily case numbers have continued to rise and the 70 per cent vaccination target nominated by Premier Berejiklian to afford some easing of restrictions is not projected to be reached until next month.
There is also uncertainty around the timing and extent to which state borders might reopen even when vaccination rates pass 70 per cent.
Doherty Institute modelling indicated that even with a 70 per cent vaccination rate, if there is ongoing community transmission, contact tracing, isolation and quarantine will only be partially effective in managing cases within the capacity of the health system.
As a result, the modelling showed that strict or moderate lockdowns would be required until the vaccination coverage is assumed to have reached 80 per cent in those jurisdictions with ongoing community transmission.
This means that there could still be a drag on the recovery during at least some of the December quarter of around $1bn per week. The experience of rapid recoveries from previous lockdowns may only partially be the relevant template this time.
Therefore, it is important that direct income support for affected households and businesses is not ended prematurely.
Indeed, the dialling up of additional but temporary support by the federal and state governments as lockdowns and restrictions were reimposed in the past two months was entirely appropriate.
By targeting those most in need and taking advantage of the record low level of funding costs, it also is a more effective response than relying on further monetary policy measures.
Indeed, at last month’s meeting the RBA board acknowledged that fiscal policy is the most appropriate instrument to deal with temporary reductions of income.
It is unlikely to change this view at next Tuesday’s meeting given that rising vaccination rates are still on track to allow the lockdown states to ease lockdown restrictions ahead of the end of the year.

Vaccination policy among younger children has become a heated debate with some states and territories flagging re-openings would not occur until children were eligible for immunisations.
Queensland Premier Annastacia Palaszczuk has faced criticism from the Morrison government for saying the state's border would remain closed until children were fully vaccinated.
The splintering of the national plan has also embroiled Western Australia and Tasmania, which have also flagged hesitation to reopen while case numbers surge in COVID-plagued states.
ATAGI and the federal government have approved Pfizer shots in children as young as 12 years old, however Home Affairs minister Karen Andrews, who took a swipe at the Queensland premier last Friday said no jurisdiction in the world had mandated vaccines for younger children.
Ms Palaszczuk has also been condemned for exaggerating Doherty figures, claiming once targets are reached, 80 people a day would still die from COVID-19.
The debate over children being eligible for a shot has also coincided with new figures showing the ACT is leading the country in the number of people who have received two doses of either vaccine.
The nearly 50 per cent of the Canberra population being vaccinated is in despite of 15 new cases being recorded in the 24 hours to Saturday at 8pm.
Meanwhile, federal minister Stuart Robert has left the door open to changing the national COVID-19 reopening plan amid growing reservations from state and territory leaders.
The close ally of the Prime Minister says the plan, which proposes that coronavirus restrictions ease once vaccination rates hit 70 and 80 per cent, is regarded as a guide that may need to be altered if circumstances change.
Asked on the ABC's Insiders program if the 80 per cent threshold might shift if there is worry about hospitals coping with COVID, Mr Robert responded with: "Goodness, anything could change next week."
"Well, of course plans change," he said. "Come on, nothing's set in stone. My goodness."
"Look at the last 12 months, things have been shifting on a daily and weekly basis. A plan is always a basis for change, it has to be."
So far, more than 35 per cent of the eligible Australian population aged over 16 are fully vaccinated with two doses.
Mr Robert said lockdown decisions were for premiers, but the national plan would provide guidance.
"At 80 per cent mark, you would be questioning why there are lockdowns," he said on Sunday.
ACT Chief Minister Andrew Barr said Mr Robert appeared to have "read the national plan".
"Even just a cursory glance at the one page document that constitutes the national plan does say that it is based on the current situation and subject to change," Mr Barr said.
Deputy Labor leader Richard Marles said it was important that the national plan was supported, but felt premiers had legitimate questions about children. "What's important is that the federal government is working with the states to bring them along," Mr Marles told Sky News' Sunday Agenda program.

Full text: Children as young as five will need to be vaccinated against coronavirus to achieve herd immunity, according to new research.
Modelling from the Medical Journal of Australia shows the current mixed vaccination program will not be enough to protect the entire populous against COVID-19, until younger children between five and 16 can be fully vaccinated.
The data from MJA is based on the entire population rather the Doherty Institute modelling, which is based on 70 to 80 per cent inoculation rates of the adult population needed before lockdowns and state border closures can be eased.
MJA's revelation comes as the ACT government, from Monday onwards, begins prioritising year 12 students for Pfizer jabs to ensure exams can be conducted in physical classrooms.
The James Cook University and Monash University report found vaccinating high-risk transmitters, such as children and younger people, would be a priority once most of the population had received two COVID-19 vaccines.
JCU infectious disease expert Emma McBryde said without vaccinating children between the ages of five and 15, the total population would only reach a herd immunity of about 60 to 70 per cent.
"Vaccinating the vulnerable first is the optimal policy at low coverage, but vaccinating high transmitters becomes more important in settings where reproduction numbers are lower and coverage is higher," Ms McBryde said.
"Australia is unlikely to achieve herd protection unless vaccination is extended to younger ages or combined with other measures.
"Australia should now prioritise delivering Pfizer vaccine to 12 to 40 year-olds."

It’s a jabs rate race to stall inevitable

Full text: The Queensland Premier held off on locking down the state at the weekend but remains “concerned” about a group of people exposed to the Delta strain at a nail salon in Logan, south of Brisbane, last week.
Contact tracers are still “struggling” to track down the group who visited the salon at the same time as a Covid-infected truck driver.
“It is imperative you get vaccinated because this virus will pop up in the near future,” Ms Palas­zczuk said. “I cannot stress to you enough … if you’re sitting at home and you’re thinking, well, I might just wait, don’t wait.
“Every single person that gets vaccinated is protecting us from having a huge outbreak.”
As of September 4, 34 per cent of eligible Queenslanders were double-dosed compared with 45 per cent in Tasmania and the ACT.
In NSW, 40 per cent of the eligible population is fully vaccinated, as the state added another 1485 cases to its Covid tally on Sunday and three deaths.
Seventy per cent of the eligible population has received one dose of the vaccine, which Gladys Bere­jiklian said was “pleasing”.
The NSW Premier blasted other state leaders who had not committed to reopening state borders even when Australia reached its 80 per cent vaccination target.
“Once we hit 80 per cent double dose, all internal borders in Australia should not exist and by that stage NSW would welcome home thousands of Australians every week,” Ms Bere­jiklian said.
“We certainly will not have to have a statewide lockdown ever again when we hit the 80 per cent double-dose vaccination rate, which is what we’re looking forward to.
She warned other state leaders that a major outbreak was imminent, urging them to stick to the national plan.
“NSW has had to confront some issues because a major outbreak happened here first but other states will have to go through this,” she said.
“Victoria is going through it. If you follow the rate of cases at the time we had ours, you will see the pattern.”
Ms Palaszczuk said she was “trying so hard” to move the state’s border checkpoint further south to allow families to reunite, and was continuing discussions with her NSW counterpart.
Separated families gathered along the Queensland/NSW ­border on Father’s Day to share hugs and kisses, despite stay-at-home orders for all NSW ­residents.
Crowds of up to 200 gathered along barricades and Acting Chief Superintendent Rhys Wildman said police took a “compassionate” approach by handing out several hundred masks rather than fines.
In Victoria, another 183 infections were reported as Premier Daniel Andrews said it was “highly likely” a wide range of public events would be open only to vaccinated people once 80 per cent of Victorians had had two doses.
“We are going to move from a situation where to protect the health system we have everybody locked down … to a situation where to protect the health system we are going to lock out ­people who are not vaccinated and can be,” he said.
“If you’re making the choice not to get vaccinated, then you are making the wrong choice.”
Mr Andrews said people concerned about the impact of corona­virus on children once Australia reopened should be aware that those aged under 12 were considered in the Doherty Institute modelling that formed the basis for national cabinet’s recommendation of achieving 70 per cent and 80 per cent vaccination thresholds.

Our confederacy of dunces

Full text: From 1898 to 1900, the six separate British colonies on the land known as Australia each held referendums on whether to federate. Most voters in each state voted "yes". The result was the creation of the entity we now think of as Australia. It was a historic first. It was the first nation to vote itself into existence.
If those referenda were held today, would we get the same outcome? Would most voters in each state vote "yes" to unification as the Commonwealth of Australia? With pandemic parochialism and political hucksterism running amok, it's not too hard to imagine that federation referendums would fail.
Just now, the Australian federation is looking like a confederacy of dunces. Attempts at the intelligent management of the pandemic have devolved into a political trench war. Both sides are delivering some real health benefits. But, at the same time, both sides are campaigning to extract political benefit from a national crisis. And both are peddling unrealities to their people.
First, the hucksters. The Morrison government belatedly is delivering adequate vaccine supplies to a country where most of the population is suffering under stay-at-home orders. And, while an unabashed Prime Minister waits to be congratulated by a grateful people, he's taken on a huckster's hubris.
Every day now, he demands the premiers prepare to dismantle the protective measures they've put in place. "Get out of the cave," he urges. His Treasurer, Josh Frydenberg, has taken to threatening that he'll withhold support payments from naughty states. The Attorney-General, Michaelia Cash, has warned that Western Australia's border closure might be vulnerable to a High Court challenge.
Morrison's deputy, Barnaby Joyce, yesterday said "the Australian people, I know, want their liberties and freedoms they were born with back".
Of course, where Australia is in "the cave", it's because premiers have been seeking to protect citizens in the face of vaccine shortages. And foremost among people's "liberties and freedoms" is the right to live. It drives the premiers crazy to hear Morrison campaigning against them.
Morrison sees advantage in championing "opening up" and "freedom". He's anticipating the day when enough of the population has been vaccinated that stay-at-home orders can be lifted and closed state borders opened. He wants to cement himself in the public mind as the great liberator, and Labor as officious nannies and maddening control freaks.
It is important to generate a sense of hope in a time of great anxiety. But the Prime Minister is also peddling an unreality. The expectations he's setting up for a glorious and unrestrained freedom are unrealistically rosy.
Today, the outbreaks in the two most populous states are still growing by the hour. People are dying in increasing numbers, in spite of curfews and strict lockdowns. The lockdowns are effective: "The number of cases would be doubling every two days if they had no restrictions, but instead it's doubling every 10 to 11 days," says virologist Brendan Crabb, chief executive of the Burnet Institute.
But the lockdowns cannot eliminate it. The premiers of NSW and Victoria have conceded exactly this. The eradication policies that worked with the original virus last year do not work with the Delta mutation.
Today the plan is to retard the plague while accelerating the vaccinations, hoping that vaccinations will spread faster than the disease.
On yesterday NSW registered a record 1431 new cases and the daily death count moved into double digits for the first time, with 12 fatalities. South-western Sydney hospitals already are reaching capacity. Premier Gladys Berejiklian has had to move to emergency mobilisation of private hospitals to increase available ICU beds and ventilators.
She said yesterday that the standing number of intensive care unit beds in NSW hospitals was 500 to 600. With 170 now occupied, emergency measures would double or treble the total available, she said. "We are anticipating October to be the worst month for our hospital system," Berejiklian said. But she assured us that NSW was prepared and ready to cope.
The Victorian outbreak is in a much earlier phase, with 208 new cases on yesterday and one death.
Is Morrison really sure he wants to go through the next two months hectoring the premiers to "get out of the cave" as the two biggest states go through a deepening crisis of hospitalisations and death, while the COVID-free states work to protect themselves? If he's wise, he'll dial it down.
And the unreality Morrison peddles? It's the impression that he gives. The national plan is based on modelling by the Doherty Institute that relies on the assumption that, once 80 per cent of the eligible population is double-jabbed, restraints can be eased.
This is the message that Morrison hammers daily. Wisely, he sometimes qualifies this with the Doherty Institute's advice that protection should not depend upon vaccination alone but that, as Morrison puts it, "you keep having other sensible, commonsense precautions in place". But while most of the population has absorbed the message that 80 per cent equals freedom, how many have absorbed the qualifier? "That," as the Doherty report notes, even after the 80 per cent threshold is reached, "stringent PHSM [public health safety measures] might need to be used intermittently to reduce caseloads to prevent overwhelming the health sector." The definition of "stringent" includes stay-at-home orders and possibly curfews.
As Crabb puts it, "the strategy can't work with high vax rates only, it has to be high vax rates plus" other measures including testing, tracing, isolation and quarantine measures, improved airflow in enclosed spaces such as gyms and schools, and face masks. For months, says Crabb, and perhaps for years.
Most Australians have not heard this critical condition attached to the Doherty modelling. It sits very uneasily with the simple "freedom" slogan that the Morrison government likes to spruik. Crabb says that if a country applies high vax rates only, and not the "plus", you get Israel or Britain. Israel is the world's poster child for rapid and widespread vaccination. It achieved 80 per cent double-dose vaccination and by June thought it had triumphed over the pandemic. Almost all restrictions were lifted.
But the Delta variant has now driven its daily case numbers to new records; restrictions have been reintroduced. Students returned to school this week but Prime Minister Naftali Bennett says he can't guarantee that classes can continue. In the past few days Israel has reported COVID death tolls of about 30 to 60 people a day. The government "decided we shouldn't impose restrictions, we will rely on vaccines for protection", said Cyrille Cohen, head of the immunotherapy at Bar-Ilan University. "But then we realised that it is very difficult to stop the infections with the Delta variant. What we should have done is to keep some restrictions - for example, wearing of the mask inside."
Second, the pandemic parochialists. The standouts here are Queensland's Premier Annastacia Palaszczuk and Western Australia's Mark McGowan, Labor leaders both. As long as their residents have remained within their state borders, they've been largely unconstrained during the entire pandemic. To Morrison's exhortation for premiers to "get out of the cave", McGowan retorted: "We are not living in caves - we are living a normal life. We are not in lockdown, we are the freest community anywhere in Australia, perhaps anywhere in the world."
These two premiers have astronomically high approval ratings. They're on a three-way winner - public health, freedom of movement and political popularity. They are riding such success that they fear to dismount. They feel threatened by the prospect of opening state borders. They reacted furiously to Morrison's urgings.
"Why are they on this mission to bring COVID into WA to infect our public?" McGowan demanded. "Haven't they seen what's happening in NSW." Palaszczuk went further to resist the notion of opening borders - she cherry-picked the worst-case scenario from the Doherty work to conjure 2240 dead people per month. She's been damned for scare-mongering, and rightly so.
The federal government doesn't have the power to force these states to open their borders. And politically it wouldn't be smart to try. Yet these premiers also are peddling an unreality - the impression that their states can remain hermetically sealed indefinitely. In truth, by coaching Queenslanders and West Australians in complacency, they are exposing them to potentially savage outbreaks when, inevitably, one arrives.
Each side of the political trench war campaigns on a partial truth. You need to put the two together for the intelligent approach to successful pandemic management - high vaccination rates are necessary but insufficient, and some measure of social and population control will be required for a long time, possibly years.
But asking a confederacy of dunces to get smart, when they think they can profit politically by campaigning dumb, is a fool's errand.

Full text: From 1898 to 1900, the six separate British colonies on the land known as Australia each held referendums on whether to federate. Most voters in each state voted "yes". The result was the creation of the entity we now think of as Australia. It was a historic first. It was the first nation to vote itself into existence.
If those referenda were held today, would we get the same outcome? Would most voters in each state vote "yes" to unification as the Commonwealth of Australia? With pandemic parochialism and political hucksterism running amok, it's not too hard to imagine that federation referendums would fail.
Just now, the Australian federation is looking like a confederacy of dunces. Attempts at the intelligent management of the pandemic have devolved into a political trench war. Both sides are delivering some real health benefits. But, at the same time, both sides are campaigning to extract political benefit from a national crisis. And both are peddling unrealities to their people.
First, the hucksters. The Morrison government belatedly is delivering adequate vaccine supplies to a country where most of the population is suffering under stay-at-home orders. And, while an unabashed Prime Minister waits to be congratulated by a grateful people, he's taken on a huckster's hubris.
Every day now, he demands the premiers prepare to dismantle the protective measures they've put in place. "Get out of the cave," he urges. His Treasurer, Josh Frydenberg, has taken to threatening that he'll withhold support payments from naughty states. The Attorney-General, Michaelia Cash, has warned that Western Australia's border closure might be vulnerable to a High Court challenge.
Morrison's deputy, Barnaby Joyce, yesterday said "the Australian people, I know, want their liberties and freedoms they were born with back".
Of course, where Australia is in "the cave", it's because premiers have been seeking to protect citizens in the face of vaccine shortages. And foremost among people's "liberties and freedoms" is the right to live. It drives the premiers crazy to hear Morrison campaigning against them. Morrison sees advantage in championing "opening up" and "freedom". He's anticipating the day when enough of the population has been vaccinated that stay-at-home orders can be lifted and closed state borders opened. He wants to cement himself in the public mind as the great liberator, and Labor as officious nannies and maddening control freaks.
It is important to generate a sense of hope in a time of great anxiety. But the Prime Minister is also peddling an unreality. The expectations he's setting up for a glorious and unrestrained freedom are unrealistically rosy.
Today, the outbreaks in the two most populous states are still growing by the hour. People are dying in increasing numbers, in spite of curfews and strict lockdowns. The lockdowns are effective: "The number of cases would be doubling every two days if they had no restrictions, but instead it's doubling every 10 to 11 days," says virologist Brendan Crabb, chief executive of the Burnet Institute.
But the lockdowns cannot eliminate it. The premiers of NSW and Victoria have conceded exactly this. The eradication policies that worked with the original virus last year do not work with the Delta mutation.
Today the plan is to retard the plague while accelerating the vaccinations, hoping that vaccinations will spread faster than the disease.
On yesterday NSW registered a record 1431 new cases and the daily death count moved into double digits for the first time, with 12 fatalities. South-western Sydney hospitals already are reaching capacity. Premier Gladys Berejiklian has had to move to emergency mobilisation of private hospitals to increase available ICU beds and ventilators.
She said yesterday that the standing number of intensive care unit beds in NSW hospitals was 500 to 600. With 170 now occupied, emergency measures would double or treble the total available, she said. "We are anticipating October to be the worst month for our hospital system," Berejiklian said. But she assured us that NSW was prepared and ready to cope.
The Victorian outbreak is in a much earlier phase, with 208 new cases on yesterday and one death.
Is Morrison really sure he wants to go through the next two months hectoring the premiers to "get out of the cave" as the two biggest states go through a deepening crisis of hospitalisations and death, while the COVID-free states work to protect themselves? If he's wise, he'll dial it down.
And the unreality Morrison peddles? It's the impression that he gives. The national plan is based on modelling by the Doherty Institute that relies on the assumption that, once 80 per cent of the eligible population is double-jabbed, restraints can be eased.
This is the message that Morrison hammers daily. Wisely, he sometimes qualifies this with the Doherty Institute's advice that protection should not depend upon vaccination alone but that, as Morrison puts it, "you keep having other sensible, commonsense precautions in place". But while most of the population has absorbed the message that 80 per cent equals freedom, how many have absorbed the qualifier? "That," as the Doherty report notes, even after the 80 per cent threshold is reached, "stringent PHSM [public health safety measures] might need to be used intermittently to reduce caseloads to prevent overwhelming the health sector." The definition of "stringent" includes stay-at-home orders and possibly curfews.
As Crabb puts it, "the strategy can't work with high vax rates only, it has to be high vax rates plus" other measures including testing, tracing, isolation and quarantine measures, improved airflow in enclosed spaces such as gyms and schools, and face masks. For months, says Crabb, and perhaps for years.
Most Australians have not heard this critical condition attached to the Doherty modelling. It sits very uneasily with the simple "freedom" slogan that the Morrison government likes to spruik. Crabb says that if a country applies high vax rates only, and not the "plus", you get Israel or Britain. Israel is the world's poster child for rapid and widespread vaccination. It achieved 80 per cent double-dose vaccination and by June thought it had triumphed over the pandemic. Almost all restrictions were lifted.
But the Delta variant has now driven its daily case numbers to new records; restrictions have been reintroduced. Students returned to school this week but Prime Minister Naftali Bennett says he can't guarantee that classes can continue. In the past few days Israel has reported COVID death tolls of about 30 to 60 people a day. The government "decided we shouldn't impose restrictions, we will rely on vaccines for protection", said Cyrille Cohen, head of the immunotherapy at Bar-Ilan University. "But then we realised that it is very difficult to stop the infections with the Delta variant. What we should have done is to keep some restrictions - for example, wearing of the mask inside."
Second, the pandemic parochialists. The standouts here are Queensland's Premier Annastacia Palaszczuk and Western Australia's Mark McGowan, Labor leaders both. As long as their residents have remained within their state borders, they've been largely unconstrained during the entire pandemic.

Full text: QUEENSLAND Premier Annastacia Palaszczuk has been condemned for “damaging public confidence” by misquoting Covid-19 death rate modelling and scaremongering about the illness infecting young children.
Following mass public outcry, Ms Palaszczuk (pictured) has also had to backtrack on a decision to block three-year-old boy Memphis Francie from returning home to his parents in Queensland from NSW.
And in bizarre scenes border town residents in NSW and Queensland have swarmed to the makeshift barriers dividing the two states, passing supplies, sharing hugs and ­offering assurances to family members trapped on either side.
Health Minister Greg Hunt was scathing in his ­response to Ms Palaszczuk’s misinterpretation of modelling by the Doherty Institute on Thursday, in which she claimed there would be 80 deaths a day, six months after Australia reopens at 70 per cent vaccination.
“Selectively misusing the Doherty modelling breaches good faith and damages public confidence,” he said.
Ms Palaszczuk’s claim ­assumed Australia never achieved a vaccination rate above 70 per cent, had minimal restrictions and only partially effective contact tracing and isolation for at least six months.
In reality, Australia’s nat­ional plan only moves to significant reopening at 80 per cent of the adult population vaccinated, while restrictions may still come and go.
Under this scenario, the Doherty Institute suggests there would be about 980 deaths in the first six months — about five per day.
Ms Palaszczuk also doubled down on her claim young children under 12 would be at risk of Covid-19 if she reopened her state before they were vaccinated.
That’s despite Australia’s Chief Medical Officer Paul Kelly said there was currently no vaccine available in the world for this age group, and that all the data showed they were far less impacted by serious Covid-19 disease.
Meanwhile, a charity flight organisation is ready to reunite Memphis with his parents in Queensland after the three-year-old spent almost two months in lockdown on his grandparent’s cattle station in southwestern NSW.
He hopes to jump on-board an Angel Flight rescue mission on Friday heading from Griffith to Hervey Bay provided that health authorities give the green light. On Thursday Queensland’s chief health officer Jeannette Young claimed Memphis’ family had not previously approached her ­department for an exemption for the child’s return, but health officials had since been “able to sort it all out”.

Full text: After a week of verballing the ­respected Doherty Institute and its detailed modelling of various ­vaccination scenarios, Scott ­Morrison has finally started to be honest about what that modelling says.
But only in targeted radio appearances and only in the low Covid-19 states of Queensland, South Australia and Western Australia. He is deliberately letting his false hope stand in other markets, especially Sydney.
Nowhere does the Doherty modelling say there is a magic number at which we can “open up”, “leave our cave like that girl in The Croods” or “live with the virus”.
It’s much more complicated than that.
Covid vaccines are a new and powerful tool to help control the virus and reduce hospitalisation and deaths. They come on top of the other public health tools that are available.
The effectiveness of each tool depends on compliance.
A lockdown will be more effective if 80 per cent comply than 70 per cent. Masks will be more effective if 80 per cent of people wear them than 70 per cent.
Vaccines are more effective when 80 per cent of people are vaccinated than 70 per cent.
Because vaccines are new, we will need fewer of the other tools. That is what the Doherty Modelling says.
From there, we need to make a collective decision about how much pressure we want to put on our hospitals, how many people’s lives we risk and how we protect those who cannot be vaccinated, think children, transplant recipients and cancer patients.
Decide how many people should die and work back from there – what level of vaccination you need and what other public health measures need to stay in place.
That is the complex, difficult, life-and-death decision that Scott Morrison tried to simplify down to a simple number and three-word slogan.
I think that even with his background in marketing, people will see it’s not that simple.
Especially as they watch the case numbers climb in NSW. As they see hospitals fill up and turn away patients with other conditions because intensive care units are full and there are not enough ICU-trained health professionals to open more.
His simple message of false hope might have been welcome in Sydney, where residents are holed up in their caves for a tenth straight week.
But not in Queensland, where masks and a tough border with NSW have so far kept the virus out and let us lead a relatively normal life outside our caves while we rush to reach our vaccination targets.
Up here, it looked more like a prime minister desperate to avoid responsibility after demanding the delay in lockdown which led to the Sydney outbreak.
A prime minister who has somehow spent the Sydney Covid-19 crisis talking about Queensland and WA.
His focus group research might have said Australians were ready to let the virus rip through their children, but that is not what Queenslanders have been telling me. Steven Miles is the Deputy Premier of Queensland

Full text: QUEENSLAND Premier Annastacia Palaszczuk has been condemned for “damaging public confidence” by misquoting Covid-19 death rate modelling and scaremongering about the illness infecting young children.
Following mass public outcry, Ms Palaszczuk (pictured) has also had to backtrack on a decision to block three-year-old boy Memphis Francis from returning home to his parents in Queensland from NSW.
And in bizarre scenes border town residents in NSW and Queensland have swarmed to the makeshift barriers dividing the two states, passing supplies, sharing hugs and ­offering assurances to family members trapped on either side.
Health Minister Greg Hunt was scathing in his ­response to Ms Palaszczuk’s misinterpretation of modelling by the Doherty Institute on Thursday, in which she claimed there would be 80 deaths a day, six months after Australia reopens at 70 per cent vaccination.
“Selectively misusing the Doherty modelling breaches good faith and damages public confidence,” he said.
Ms Palaszczuk’s claim ­assumed Australia never achieved a vaccination rate above 70 per cent, had minimal restrictions and only partially effective contact tracing and isolation for at least six months.
In reality, Australia’s nat­ional plan only moves to significant reopening at 80 per cent of the adult population vaccinated, while restrictions may still come and go.
Under this scenario, the Doherty Institute suggests there would be about 980 deaths in the first six months — about five per day.
Ms Palaszczuk also doubled down on her claim young children under 12 would be at risk of Covid-19 if she reopened her state before they were vaccinated.
That’s despite Australia’s chief medical officer Paul Kelly said there was currently no vaccine available in the world for this age group, and that all the data showed they were far less impacted by serious Covid-19 disease.
Meanwhile, a charity flight organisation is ready to reunite Memphis with his parents in Queensland after the three-year-old spent almost two months in lockdown on his grandparent’s cattle station in southwestern NSW.
He hopes to jump on-board an Angel Flight rescue mission on Friday heading from Griffith to Hervey Bay provided that health authorities give the green light. On Thursday Queensland’s chief health officer Jeannette Young claimed Memphis’ family had not previously approached her ­department for an exemption for the child’s return, but health officials had since been “able to sort it all out”.

Full text: This story will be updated, please refresh your browser for the latest information NSW is back at a near-record number of new COVID-19 cases as the state reached a milestone of seven million vaccine jabs.
NSW recorded 1288 new cases and seven deaths in the 24-hour period to 8pm Wednesday, just below the record of 1290 cases recorded on August 30.
Murrumbidgee Local Health District has continued to record zero new cases.
"Yesterday, 121,000 people in NSW came forward to get vaccinated and we passed, as we predicted, the seven million jab mark, which is outstanding," NSW Premier Gladys Berejiklian said on Thursday morning.
"In the 24 hours to 8:00pm last night, there were 1,288 cases of community transmission. Unfortunately, there were seven deaths and we extend our deepest condolences to the family and loved ones of those people who lost their lives.
"But it's really important to know that I've been commenting in the last few days that we anticipate October will be the worst month for the number of people that lose their lives and also for the rate of people in hospital."
The 24-hour period to 8pm on Tuesday saw 1116 new cases across NSW and a second positive result for coronavirus fragments in Temora's sewage.
Four venues across the region have been listed as casual contact sites after an essential worker travelled through West Wyalong, Hay and Tooleybuc between Thursday and Sunday.

"There's been two new cases notified this morning for Queanbeyan but luckily no exposure sites. They're linked to the Canberra outbreak," he said.
Of the 1,288 locally acquired cases reported to 8pm last night, 445 are from Western Sydney Local Health District (LHD), 387 are from South Western Sydney LHD, 149 are from Sydney LHD, 101 are from South Eastern Sydney LHD, 82 are from Nepean Blue Mountains LHD, 31 are from Northern Sydney LHD, 23 are from Western NSW LHD, 22 are from Illawarra Shoalhaven LHD, seven are from Central Coast LHD, five are from Far West LHD, four are from Hunter New England LHD, 11 are in a correctional centre and 21 cases are yet to be assigned to an LHD.
NSW Health's ongoing sewage surveillance program has recently detected fragments of the virus that causes COVID-19 at sewage treatment plants across NSW. Fragments were detected in Bega and Cooma in Southern NSW LHD and Bomaderry in Illawarra Shoalhaven LHD.
In response to questions about people overdosing on livestock medicine Ivermectin in an attempt to cure or prevent COVID-19, NSW Chief Health Officer Dr Kerry Chant urged people to follow qualified medical advice.
"Make sure that you've got your health care provided by a health care practitioner and that you seek advice before taking any medications. It is important to seek the best health advice," Dr Chant said.
"Our doctors in Australia are across the literature in terms of what drugs and therapies are useful in COVID. Please listen to them."
NSW Health has been notified of the deaths of seven people who had COVID-19, all people aged in the 50, 70s or 80s, in hospitals in Sydney.
Ms Berejiklian was asked about QLD Premier Annastacia Palaszczuk's comments that the Doherty report modelling used to justify reducing restrictions at 70 per cent fully vaccinated.
Ms Palaszczuk claimed that the modelling predicted Australia would see 80 deaths per day from COVID-19 during a period six months after restrictions were lifted.
"The sad reality is outside of a pandemic, we lose between 600 and 800 people every year to the flu. We have to put things into perspective," Ms Berejiklian responded.
"Nobody likes to talk about this because it is confronting. But we have to get back to living life as normal as possible, knowing that COVID is among us."
Ms Berejiklian said NSW was going to see deaths despite higher rates of vaccination and lower rates of hospitalisation.
"It is a tragedy, I was providing a supportive message to the heart disease foundation every day and 50 people every day lose their lives to heart disease. Death is horrible," she said.
"But we also need to put things into perspective, because at the moment there are 8 million citizens who do not have a choice in how they spend their free time, who do not have a choice about what they can do when they leave their homes. That is no way to live."

Full text: PATH TO FREEDOM FLAGGED AS KIDS SET TO GET THE JAB THE Palaszczuk government is under pressure to commit to reopening with the rest of the country once 80 per cent of over-16s are fully vaccinated, regardless of case numbers, after the Doherty Institute reiterated to National Cabinet it would be safe to do so.
The confirmation comes as almost 300,000 Queensland teenagers will be eligible to get the Pfizer Covid-19 jab from mid-September, with school-based vaccine programs now in the works.
The Australian Technical Advisory Group on Immunisation on Friday approved the broad use of the Pfizer jab in children aged 12-15, with authorities still working on ticking off use of the Moderna vaccine on children.
Children in the cohort will be able to book in for their jab from September 13, just as Australia’s stock of vaccines is set to increase from October.
After a week of back and forth between the federal government and the states and territories over the vaccination levels required to banish lockdowns, National Cabinet was given another briefing from Doherty Professor Jodie McVernon on the Institute’s draft modelling.
But National Cabinet was also told that some public measures such as mask wearing, contact tracing and localised “moderate restrictions” would still be necessary at between 70 and 80 per cent of vaccination coverage.
To allay concerns by some states that health systems around the country will struggle to handle the increase in case numbers once the country moves away from the current heavy suppression and elimination models, the nation’s leaders have agreed to establish a taskforce to look at hospital preparedness.
The taskforce, to be led by Health Department Secretary Brendan Murphy, will report back to National Cabinet next week on how to make sure Australia has enough intensive care beds and ventilators when the coronavirus begins to circulate around the country without lockdowns. It will also look at ways in which states can help each other to support their health and hospital systems when that time arrives.
Sources familiar with the meeting said Victorian Premier Daniel Andrews backed the Doherty modelling in his comments to the National Cabinet meeting.
But WA Premier Mark McGowan, who has expressed unhappiness at the Doherty plan, gave no guarantee in the meeting that he would adhere to the plan.
Speaking afterwards in Perth, where he was announcing that two infected truck drivers from NSW had entered the state, Mr McGowan hedged his bets.
“If there’s thousands of cases out there and those cases have been seeded into, if you like, into a jurisdiction without Covid then obviously the risk is much higher,” he said.
“That’s the problem that jurisdictions without Covid face – and I raised that point today – the idea that we just deliberately infect our citizens when we have no Covid when we get to 70 per cent vaccination, I just can’t do that because people will die.” Mr McGowan’s stance puts him on a collision course with the nation’s most senior corporate leaders, including WA-based Wesfarmers chief executive Rob Scott, who is among those demanding an opening of the economy once a 70 per cent vaccination threshold is hit.
Mr Scott warned the next few months would get tougher and that Australia was approaching a situation where lockdownswere doing more harm than good.
Meanwhile, vaccine rollout lead Lieutenant General John Frewen confirmed school-based vaccine programs were in the works, with the federal government to work with states and territories and with the private school system.
“You will see those programs taking shape over the next month or so,” he said. Allowing children to be vaccinated will further prevent spread of Covid-19 in the community and aid the safe reopening of schools.
Evidence from countries including Israel and the US, where Covid-19 restrictions have eased significantly, shows infections in young children have risen.
During Queensland’s most recent Delta-strain Covid-19 cluster, more than 90 children aged 19 or younger were among those infected.
Infectious disease expert Dr Paul Griffin said there was also emerging evidence that children could suffer from “long Covid”, which includes ongoing fatigue, “brain fog” and respiratory issues.
Prime Minister Scott Morrison (pictured left) thanked state and territory leaders for their expansion of state-run hotel quarantine systems for the 4100 evacuees from Afghanistan who have begun arriving in Australia.
The meeting was also addressed by Chief Medical Officer Paul Kelly, who took the leaders through the hotspots in the current outbreaks.
Nationally, the vaccination rollout continues to gather pace. So far 18.3 million vaccine doses have been given in Australia, including 307,090 on Thursday, with 55 per cent of people aged 16 years partially protected and more than a third fully vaccinated.

Full text: Marshall outlines reopening plans
SA HEALTH is trying to track the movements of two truck drivers from NSW who have tested positive for Covid-19 having driven to Western Australia via Victoria and South Australia, arriving in Perth on Thursday night.
An SA Health spokesman said it was not yet known whether the two men had stopped in SA.
“We are aware of the two positive cases and aware of them travelling through South Australia and we are undertaking a risk assessment,’’ the spokesman said.
WA Premier Mark Mc­Gow­an said the men, aged 23 and 29, had contact with only four people, stopping at the Yellowdine Roadhouse near Southern Cross, a service station in Norseman.
He said they had each had one dose of the Pfizer vaccine and wore masks while outside the truck. He said he had been advised that the risk was low.
The drivers are mildly symptomatic and quarantining at a medi-hotel in Perth. The news came as Premier Steven Marshall reserved the right to impose snap border closures to high-case states once vaccination targets were reached, but said this would not be needed because of reduced Covid-19 transmission.
Charting the state’s reopening path, Mr Marshall flagged more targeted border restrictions to exclude people who had been in Covid-19 hotspots but said he wanted to normalise borders once vaccine targets were reached.
He said he hoped to open state borders safely, repeating that health advice stated this could happen by Christmas, once vaccination rates hit 80 per cent.
“If there is a state which has got 1000 cases per day, it doesn’t make much sense to throw open your borders ­because, why introduce it to your state?” Mr Marshall told The Advertiser.
“But I’m strongly of the opinion, and the Doherty model (guiding national reopening) suggests that as we get a higher vaccination rate, we’re going to have a much lower transmission rate, which will mean lower-level infections interstate and they will become more localised.” Mr Marshall said a nation-first home quarantine trial in South Australia for low-risk travellers might be a game-changer, potentially, reducing isolation periods from 14 days. Forecasts have shown 70 per cent of SA’s adults older than 16 would be fully vaccinated by November and 80 per cent by December. But ­increased dosage rates suggest the 80 per cent target could be hit by mid-November.
National employer association Ai Group chief executive Innes Willox has urged the ­removal of barriers to business travellers and returning Australians, and extending SA’s home quarantine trial.
Increased income from property-related and payroll taxes, along with the GST, had improved revenue outlook but S&P had retained a negative outlook on SA because of risks from Covid-19 fallout and potential fiscal stress from the state’s stimulus program.
The Doherty Institute has reiterated to national cabinet that it will be safe to fully ­re-open Australia when 80 per cent of people 16 years and over are fully vaccinated, ­regardless of case numbers.
After a week of back and forth between the federal government and the states and territories over the vaccination levels required to banish lockdowns, national cabinet was given another briefing from Doherty Institute’s modelling scenarios. National cabinet was told that some public measures such as mask wearing, contact tracing and localised “moderate restrictions” would be needed at 70 to 80 per cent of vaccination.
Another 882 new cases of Covid-19 were recorded in NSW on Friday and two people died. From July 18, there has been a total of 12,500 locally acquired cases in NSW.
Victoria announced 79 new locally acquired cases, and the ACT announced 21 new cases. PAGES 34-35: NEVER TO BE FORGOTTEN

Full text: PATH TO FREEDOM FLAGGED AS KIDS SET TO GET THE JAB
THE Palaszczuk government is under pressure to commit to reopening with the rest of the country once 80 per cent of over-16s are fully vaccinated, regardless of case numbers, after the Doherty Institute reiterated to National Cabinet it would be safe to do so.
The confirmation comes as almost 300,000 Queensland teenagers will be eligible to get the Pfizer Covid-19 jab from mid-September, with school-based vaccine programs now in the works.
The Australian Technical Advisory Group on Immunisation on Friday approved the broad use of the Pfizer jab in children aged 12-15, with authorities still working on ticking off use of the Moderna vaccine on children.
Children in the cohort will be able to book in for their jab from September 13, just as Australia’s stock of vaccines is set to increase from October. After a week of back and forth between the federal government and the states and territories over the vaccination levels required to banish lockdowns, National Cabinet was given another briefing from Doherty Professor Jodie McVernon on the Institute’s draft modelling scenarios.
But National Cabinet was also told that some public measures such as mask wearing, contact tracing and localised “moderate restrictions” would still be necessary at between 70 and 80 per cent of vaccination coverage.
To allay concerns by some states that health systems around the country will struggle to handle the increase in case numbers once the country moves away from the current heavy suppression and elimination models, the nation’s leaders have agreed to establish a taskforce to look at hospital preparedness.
The taskforce, to be led by Health Department Secretary Brendan Murphy, will report back to National Cabinet next week on how to make sure Australia has enough intensive care beds and ventilators when the coronavirus begins to circulate around the country without lockdowns.
It will also look at ways in which states can help each other to support their health and hospital systems when that time arrives.
Sources familiar with the meeting said Victorian Premier Daniel Andrews backed the Doherty modelling in his comments to the National Cabinet meeting.
But WA Premier Mark McGowan, who has expressed unhappiness at the Doherty plan, gave no guarantee in the meeting that he would adhere to the plan.
Speaking afterwards in Perth, where he was announcing that two infected truck drivers from NSW had entered the state, Mr McGowan hedged his bets.
“If there’s thousands of cases out there and those cases have been seeded into, if you like, into a jurisdiction without Covid then obviously the risk is much higher,” he said.
“That’s the problem that jurisdictions without Covid face – and I raised that point today – the idea that we just deliberately infect our citizens when we have no Covid when we get to 70 per cent vaccination, I just can’t do that because people will die.” Vaccine rollout lead Lieutenant General John Frewen confirmed school-based vaccine programs were in the works, with the federal government to work with states and territories and with the private school system.
“You will see those programs taking shape over the next month or so,” he said. Allowing children to be vaccinated will further prevent spread of Covid-19 in the community and aid the safe reopening of schools.
Evidence from countries including Israel and the US, where Covid-19 restrictions have eased significantly, shows infections in young children have risen.
During Queensland’s most recent Delta-strain Covid-19 cluster, more than 90 children aged 19 or younger were among those infected.
Infectious disease expert Dr Paul Griffin said there was also emerging evidence that children could suffer from “long Covid”, which includes ongoing fatigue, “brain fog” and respiratory issues.
Prime Minister Scott Morrison (pictured left) thanked state and territory leaders for their expansion of state-run hotel quarantine systems for the 4100 evacuees from Afghanistan who have begun arriving in Australia.
The meeting was also addressed by Chief Medical Officer Paul Kelly, who took the leaders through the hotspots in the current outbreaks.
Nationally, the vaccination rollout continues to gather pace. So far 18.3 million vaccine doses have been given in Australia, including 307,090 on Thursday, with 55 per cent of people aged 16 years partially protected and more than a third fully vaccinated.

Why can't leaders agree on what a cautious reopening means for Australia?

Full text: Two months after the announcement of Australia's national reopening plan, the strategy behind it appears to have descended entirely into politics, rather than the purest distillation of medical advice and the best modelling.
The latter is what the public has come to expect, with leaders standing side-by-side with their chief health officers nearly every day, echoing their advice and letting everybody know that's where it came from - but that has always been largely a mirage. Policy is rarely that straightforward.
The Prime Minister and state and territory leaders have agreed to a four-phase plan, officially the National Plan to Transition Australia's National COVID-19 Response, that for all intents and purposes is the pathway to emerging from the pandemic underpinned by modelling from the Doherty Institute. At certain national percentage thresholds of the fully vaccinated - only counting those 16 and older - the country can reduce the number of restrictions and localise lockdowns to smaller patches of virus outbreaks.
Phase C is the most contentious. At 80 per cent of eligible vaccine recipients, equivalent to 64 per cent of the entire population, those vaccinated residents will enjoy far more freedoms, including exemption "from all domestic restrictions".
The problem is that it's a Schrodinger's reopening.
In the minds and rhetoric of leaders with communities crying out for freedom from lockdowns and even the return of international travel, it can be all those promises at once - a tidy package of incentivised hope that will very much come in handy when it comes time for re-election.
For the more cautious and the public health-minded, it can be a gradual building-up of community resistance to Covid's variants, with lockdowns and restrictions still in place so health workers won't be overwhelmed. When the borders reopen and seeding events become more frequent, these workers will be key to saving lives.
Until the box known as "Fortress Australia" is opened, nobody knows if the promised freedoms are real or dead on arrival - if the nation's health workforce capacities will be up for the workload from new seeding events.
Modelling can only tell us so much, and depend greatly on the assumptions built into them, says Professor Allan Saul, an expert in infectious diseases.
There is no reason to think the initial assumptions in the analysis done by the Doherty Institute aren't reasonable, he says, and the model itself is quite useful for policy planners. But the analysis also shows that the conclusions of the model are "terribly dependent on small changes" in testing, contact tracing, isolation and quarantine enforcement (TTIQ) capability.
That capability has seriously degraded in NSW, if around 80 per cent of newly reported cases each day are still under investigation up to 24 hours after first known to officials, Professor Saul says. There are many inputs into the models, and that may not be recognised by those making the policy decisions.
That's what happens at the interface of science and politics, he says.
"Scientists intrinsically know that this is a model, and it's sort of a guide. They'll waffle on and say more research is required," he says.
"For the politics, on the other hand, they want it really cut and dry. So you can say to the population, 'The Doherty model said this - bang! - we're going to open up at 80 per cent.'"
The Doherty model gives two different views of what happens at that point. Open up and don't do anything else? That leads to chaos. Two assumptions in the model were that there would be no degradation of TTIQ capability and that the reopening started with few cases across the whole of Australia. Neither are now accurate.
Professor Saul thinks that suppression might still happen, and that governments will adjust to what's happening next year instead of a plan decided last July.
The Australia Institute's chief economist, Richard Denniss, was one of many this week calling for a transparent conversation about whether the country has the capabilities to handle large numbers of mystery cases. That capability has been the front line of Australia's defence against Covid, he says.

But while Australia's TTIQ is world-class, it can and it will be overrun if case numbers are allowed to keep rising," he says.
From time to time throughout the pandemic, fault lines have emerged between the country's leaders. What's different now is that despite an agreed plan, some state leaders are threatening to walk away from some of its elements, claiming they aren't in the interests of their communities.
All leaders, including Morrison and NSW Premier Gladys Berejilkian, say they're on the side of a cautious reopening - but what that means is widely interpreted.
"So long as you have high rates of vaccination, Covid safety plans in place, [and] good information to the community ... we can show the rest of the world how we can have a managed way of life [back to] normality," Berejiklian said.
Western Australia and Queensland have beaten virus outbreaks. Queensland's latest success means a return to greater freedoms like dancing at nightclubs, Premier Annastacia Palaszczuk has confirmed. And she and WA's Mark McGowan are sick of being told what to do by the federal government.
The PM is banking that he, not the premiers, has the pulse of the nation.
"The seven to eight out of 10 Australians who have been fully vaccinated [when transitioning to the next phase of the national plan] will be a powerful voice in deciding what happens at that point," he has said.
His government did receive a small boost in the polls this week over Labor.
Politics, not epidemiology, will likely determine where we go from here.

Full text: Reopening Australia with thousands of Covid-19 cases active in the community will not lead to more deaths over six months than waiting for virus numbers to be contained at low numbers, updated modelling by the Doherty Institute is expected to find.
The Australian can reveal the modelling, to be discussed at a meeting of national cabinet on Friday, conducted analysis of three scenarios over a 180-day period based on Covid case numbers in the tens, hundreds and thousands when restrictions were lifted and found no material difference in ­expected fatality rates.
The updated modelling, provided to state and territory leaders on Wednesday, comes as Scott Morrison seeks to hold the premiers to the national cabinet agreement for restrictions to be eased at vaccination rates of 70 to 80 per cent.
The Doherty Institute said this week the original advice on its modelling still held, irrespective of case numbers.
The new analysis will quell concerns from state leaders about the outbreak in NSW by suggesting the spiralling number of infections does not present a major obstacle to proceeding with the national cabinet’s four-step reopening strategy.
NSW Premier Gladys Berejiklian on Thursday became the first state leader to commit to returning individual freedoms to fully vaccinated residents amid an outbreak, as the state recorded 1029 cases.
From September 13, restrictions in NSW will be eased for ­fully vaccinated people living outside local government areas of concern, allowing them to participate in outdoor gatherings with up to five people, including children, provided it is within their LGA or 5km from their home.
Residents within LGAs of concern will be able to gather outdoors for recreation, but it will be limited to one hour.
Further restrictions will be eased in October when 70 per cent of the state is fully inoculated.
National cabinet leaders are due to discuss the vaccine rollout among high school students, with the Australian Technical Advisory Group on Immunisation finalising its advice on jabs for children aged 12 to 15.
Responding to calls for children to be included in the national vaccine targets, the Prime Minister said this was not in the advice from the Doherty Institute which had based the transition between the four-steps of the national plan on increasing numbers of people aged 16 and over getting the jab.
“That does not by implication say there is no need to vaccinate children 12 to 15,” Mr Morrison said. “And, that will be a very clear decision of my government that we will need to go ahead and vaccinate children 12 to 15.
“These two objectives are not working against each other, I see them working completely together with each other.” A preliminary list of exemptions for vaccinated Australians – prepared by Victoria, Tasmania and the Northern Territory – is also on Friday’s national cabinet agenda. Momentum is building to allow returning Australians to isolate at home ahead of Christmas, with national cabinet preparing an overhaul of quarantine rules.
With the hotel quarantine system under stress, the national cabinet will use South Australia’s “at-home” pilot to support a new approach to Covid-19 quarantine arrangements when the country moves out of the suppression phase.
Under national cabinet’s reopening plan, international travel to green zone countries with high vaccine rates or limited Covid-19 cases would resume once the vaccination rate reached 80 per cent double dose coverage. Those countries could include Singapore, the US, Britain, Japan, South Korea and Pacific Island nations.
After Qantas declared it was planning to resume international travel in December, in line with projections that Australia would have reached 80 per cent vaccine coverage, Tourism Minister Dan Tehan said he hoped ­returning Australians could “quarantine at home in the lead-up to Christmas”.
In addition to the South Australia pilot program, former Health Department secretary Jane Halton is leading a second national review of hotel quarantine arrangements alongside Graeme Head, infectious disease expert Peter Collignon and professor Andrew Wilson.
Ms Halton’s first review last year warned that the hotel quarantine system was vulnerable to breaches that were “hard to eliminate”. “It is also an expensive resource and comes at a high cost to individual, social and economic wellbeing,” Ms Halton wrote.
The Australian Health Protection Principal Committee considered two options to quarantine international travellers in June last year, which included reducing the time of quarantine and combining it with home quarantine. The AHPPC opted for the 14-day, hotel-quarantine model because “the risk of Covid-19 in travellers returning from many countries is increasing”.
A senior source close to the process said it was unlikely Australians would “put up with hotel quarantine beyond this year”.
“They want to get life back to normal and they want to travel,” the source said. Qantas chief executive Alan Joyce, who spoke with Mr Morrison this week, said the resumption of international flights would be influenced by whether travellers could quarantine at home.
New Zealand, which is facing a Covid-19 outbreak of the Delta strain, this month announced it would adopt a UK-style traffic light system with a tiered ­approach to quarantine measures for returning citizens and travellers. Travellers from countries on its green list must take Covid-19 tests but are not required to quarantine. Unvaccinated travellers from amber countries can quarantine at home for 10 days.
Mr Morrison welcomed the launch of South Australia’s home quarantine program and said record surges in the vaccine rollout, off the back of 335,420 vaccines delivered on Wednesday, gave businesses the confidence to know “they can come through”.
“That their financiers and their investors can have that same confidence, that people will be able to get those hours back and go back to work. That people can get on the bus again and on the tram again and go to work,” Mr Morrison said. “That performers can get on the stage at live venues again. That people can gather in restaurants, and they can do it not just for a couple of days or a couple of weeks, but know that can be their life again going forward, and we can have the certainty.” Mr Tehan said the federal government expected to see the resumption of interstate travel once the 70 per cent target was achieved, warning any delays would further damage the tourism industry.
“The national plan is our way out of the pandemic, and it’s incredibly important for the tourism industry that we stick to the national plan — 660,000 jobs depend on it,” Mr Tehan said. Health Department analysis presented to the Prime Minister on Thursday showed that vaccinations had resulted in a much smaller number of deaths from Covid-19 infections in the NSW outbreak this year, about one in 160 cases, than in last year’s Victorian outbreak, when about one in 23 people with Covid-19 died.

COVID 19: How sick are our kids getting and when can they be vaccinated?

Full text: In July Australia's Therapeutic Goods Administration (TGA) provisionally approved the Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine for kids aged 12-15.
The Australian Technical Advisory group on Immunisation (ATAGI) subsequently recommended kids in this age group with underlying chronic medical conditions, Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander children and kids living in remote communities should be prioritised.
We're expecting advice from ATAGI as to whether the rollout should be extended to all 12 to 15-year-olds, as countries like the United States and Canada have done.
But where does that leave children under 12? We know they're making up a large proportion of new infections in Australia's current outbreaks, which was not the case last year.
Do they need to be vaccinated? What are the benefits of vaccinating children, both for the child and the community? And how will we know the vaccines are safe and effective for young children?
COVID in kids Throughout the pandemic, fortunately, we've seen children are very unlikely to get severely unwell or die from COVID-19.
Australian data from January 1 to August 1 this year show 2.5% of children aged up to nine and 2.9% children and teenagers aged 10-19 who contracted COVID were hospitalised. This is compared to 7.7% of young adults aged 20-29, with the rates continuing to increase with age.
Cases are on the rise among children in New South Wales, but to date this hasn't been accompanied by a large increase in paediatric hospitalisations.
Recent data show increased rates of hospitalisation among children in the US with COVID-19 compared to last year, alongside rising infections with the Delta variant.
But even though the rate has gone up, it remains low. In children and adolescents aged 17 and under the rate is 0.38 per 100,000 people, well below the rate in adults aged 60 to 69 (5.63 per 100,000) and those over 70 (8.07 per 100,000).
However, some kids who have chronic medical conditions are at a higher risk of getting really sick from COVID, which is why ATAGI has listed them as a priority group.

One of the complications of COVID-19 is long COVID where a person experiences lasting symptoms such as breathlessness, anxiety and "brain fog" (reductions in attention and concentration).
Reassuringly, a recent study found only a small proportion of children had symptoms beyond four weeks after their initial COVID infection, and almost all children had recovered by eight weeks.
So what are the benefits of vaccinating kids? While the Delta variant is more infectious than other strains of the coronavirus, and more kids are becoming infected, there's not a scientific consensus at this stage that it's causing more severe disease in children.
That said, a small minority will get sicker than others and need hospital care.
If vaccines are found to be safe and effective for younger children there would be benefit in protecting the individual child.
The TGA has approved the Pfizer vaccine for ages 12 and up. But we don't yet have a COVID vaccine for younger children. Shutterstock
What about collective benefits? Will vaccinating young children reduce transmission in the community and improve our herd protection?
Recent modelling from the Doherty Institute doesn't appear to consider whether vaccinating children under 12 would or wouldn't contribute to reducing community transmission.
Other modelling has suggested vaccinating younger children and adolescents will be important if Australia is to reach the elusive "herd immunity".
Trials are under way Clinical trials of the mRNA vaccines from Pfizer and Moderna in children aged 12 and up have shown good results (though at this stage Moderna is only approved in Australia for adults).
Before we move to vaccinating children under 12 we'll need safety and efficacy data from trials in this age group.
It's important to conduct clinical trials specifically in children because their immune systems are different. For example, children may experience different side effects following vaccination, and may need a smaller dose.
Read more: How to prepare your child for a COVID test
Trials of the COVID-19 mRNA vaccines in younger children are under way. The Moderna trial KidCOVE is currently recruiting in the US. So far close to 7,000 kids are enrolled.
Meanwhile, Pfizer is aiming to enrol 4,500 children under 12 across the US and other countries.
The studies are divided into children aged six to 11, aged two to five, and six months to less than two years old. They are aiming to assess safety and immune responses after two vaccinations with three different dose sizes.
For Pfizer, the three doses being trialled are 10 micrograms, 20 micrograms, and 30 micrograms (the latter is the dose given to older teens and adults).
A trial of AstraZeneca's COVID-19 vaccine in children aged 6-17 commenced in March 2021 in the United Kingdom. However this trial was paused as a precautionary measure following reports of blood clots in adults who received this vaccine.
Children who contract COVID-19 don't usually need hospital care. Shutterstock
What now? You may be wondering when children under 12 will be able to be vaccinated. The short answer is we don't know for sure.
We need strong safety and efficacy data from the clinical trials before considering vaccinating young children. Currently, it's anticipated the first data on children younger than 12 may be available for review later this year.
For now though, it's reassuring to know children still appear less likely to end up in hospital with COVID compared to adults.
Read more: Is it more infectious? Is it spreading in schools? This is what we know about the Delta variant and kids
Further, it seems many of the cases we're seeing in children are due to transmission in the household, often from an infected adult to the child.
So the best way to protect younger kids for now is to ensure as many adults as possible are fully vaccinated.
High vaccine coverage in the community will also benefit children by reducing the need for lockdowns and school closures, which we know can have negative effects on their education, socialisation and mental health.

Palaszczuk stays cagey on the plan to open up

Full text: PREMIER: I NEED TO SEE MODELLING PREMIER Annastacia Palas­zczuk has been accused of taking away hope for Queens­land to get out of the pandemic and avoid snap lockdowns, as her federal colleagues on Tuesday backed the national strategy for living with Covid.
The Premier boasted on Tuesday that the state remained open, with cafes trading and spectators attending sport, but devastated businesses say their doors will be forced to close without a ­pathway out of the pandemic, while families remain separated by border closures.
Ms Palaszczuk (inset) could not answer whether Queenslanders could look forward to an interstate holiday this Christmas.
Scott Morrison has ramped up the pressure, saying Australians want to see the national deal to start easing restrictions from 70 and 80 per cent vaccination milestones delivered.
“We have a plan to get out of this. We can’t stay in a cave forever,” the Prime Minister said.
Federal Labor health spokesman Mark Butler on Tuesday said lockdowns at 80 per cent vaccination rates would be “highly unlikely” .
When asked whether governments should be gearing towards a no-lockdown future after vaccination rates of 80 per cent, Mr Butler said “of course”. But he said the Prime Minister needed to provide assurances the testing, contact tracing and quarantine systems were able to cope in a future without lockdowns.
Ms Palaszczuk has consistently refused to confirm whether she remains supportive of the original Doherty plan to open up Australia. She said the modelling used was “predicated on 30 cases across Australia, not 13,000”.
“So I’m looking forward to seeing that modelling,” she said. “At the moment, the borders are shut and, you know, we don’t know when they’re going to come out of their ­current outbreak.” It is despite the Doherty Institute’s professor Sharon Lewin stating this week that the “advice still holds” and that the Delta strain was taken into account in the modelling.
The Premier’s comments provoked a devastated response from the state’s business community, eager for certainty and a way forward.
Queensland Tourism Industry Council chief executive Daniel Gschwind said people deserved a national “coherent plan”, with specifics around what they would and wouldn’t be able to do in the months ahead.
“We’ve lost a vision of the path forward,” he said.
“We’re in the darkness again and that’s maybe the worst aspect. We’ve lost hope. We need some plain speaking and some basic certainty.” Mr Gschwind said businesses and holiday-makers were “in limbo”, too afraid to make decisions.
Chamber of Commerce and Industry Queensland spokesman Gus Mandigora said it was “critical” Queensland stick to the agreement secured at national cabinet so businesses could plan for their recovery.
“They also need a forward-looking road map outlining how the Queensland government plans to handle the pandemic in future,” he said.
“Every time states warn of the potential of more snap lockdowns and trading restrictions, businesses and ­consumer confidence take a hit,” he said.
Queensland Morrison government ministers have lashed the Premier for backing away, saying the state would continue to languish in the vaccine rollout race without something to hope for.
Employment Minister Stuart Robert said while Queenslanders can watch sport and go to restaurants, livelihoods were being destroyed, workers could not cross borders and tourism businesses were suffering.
“We see families torn apart by not being able to grieve together. That is right now,” he said. “The Queensland Premier needs to stick to the plan, reopen under less-harsh and truly devastating restrictions once we meet the agreed national cabinet vaccination targets, because until we do so, Queensland isn’t truly open,” he said.
Assistant Minister for Women and Industrial Relations Amanda Stoker said the Premier’s comments were dangerous and encouraging vaccine complacency.
“The national plan is clear: vaccination is the path to ­stability, confidence and freedom. It’s irresponsible for Queensland Labor to undermine it,” she said. “I’m under 40 and had my first dose of ­AstraZeneca without problems; I encourage everyone to reject Labor’s politics of fear.” The Doherty Institute released a statement on its modelling describing the 70-80 per cent targets as the “light at the end of the tunnel”. “It won’t be possible to maintain a situation where there are no cases at all. The focus will shift to keeping the number of people going to hospital and dying at a minimum,” it stated. Meanwhile, NSW recorded 753 new Covid-19 cases, Victoria added another 50 to its tally and the ACT had a record 30 cases, with all three states in lockdown.

Full text: Australia's national plan to relax Covid restrictions risks a catastrophic death toll, new modelling shows, as the Prime Minister and NSW Premier continue to talk up easing restrictions before the community is protected.
Researchers from three of Australia's most prestigious universities warned tens of thousands of lives could be saved by revising the national plan to vaccinate children and reaching 90 per cent vaccination coverage among adults before "exposing Australians to uncontrolled COVID-19".
Their modelling shows Australia would see between 25,000 and 43,000 Covid deaths and more than 270,000 people with debilitating long Covid if governments and health officials follow the national plan.
That plan has Covid restrictions relaxed at a vaccination rate of 70 per cent of people aged 16 and over and almost no restrictions at 80 per cent.
In contrast, the original Doherty Institute modelling used to revise the current national plan, estimated between 1300 and 2300 deaths over 180 days from a seeding event of the virus. It did not estimate outcomes if the test-trace-isolate-quarantine strategy failed to clamp down an outbreak.
One author of the new modelling, Professor Quentin Grafton from Australian National University, said statements from Scott Morrison and Gladys Berejiklian in favour of easing restrictions at a flat rate of 70 per cent of adults was like handcuffing the nation's public health response while overtaxing its health workforce.
"We need much higher vaccination rates before we could contemplate handcuffing ourselves in relation to public health measures," Professor Grafton said.
"Although it's an epidemic in NSW now [with more than 800 new cases each day], it's a tiny fraction of what it could be if we open up and don't have proper public health measures and inadequate vaccination coverage."

The government should have decided what level of fatalities it would tolerate and work backwards to determine the vaccination rate needed to achieve that, but that was not how the national plan was developed, Professor Grafton said.
"It's a no-brainer - a simple calculation to make, and it doesn't therefore make sense from the Prime Minister's statement [on Monday] that at 70 per cent that we should stop having lockdowns because the cost is not worth it," Professor Grafton said.
"That's not what our modelling finds."
Children could also benefit from vaccination, he said. If Australia could achieve 75 per cent vaccination coverage among children and adolescents it could prevent a further 12,000 hospitalisations.
Dr Zoë Hyde, lead author of the new modelling, said premature relaxing of the restrictions would likely be irreversible, the resulting deaths unacceptable.
"It's simply too dangerous to treat COVID-19 like the flu," Dr Hyde said.
"We also can't forget about our children, who can get very sick from this virus and need protection before we open up."
As questions swirl around how relevant the Doherty Institute's modelling that underpins the national plan still is, the infection and immunity research centre released its own statement.
There is light at the end of the tunnel, it said, once Australia achieves 70-80 per cent vaccination, resulting in less transmissions and fewer hospitalisation and deaths.
"This level of vaccination will make it easier to live with the virus, as we do with other viruses such as the flu. However, it won't be possible to maintain a situation where there are no cases at all."
Any death is a tragedy, it noted, but the Australian health system can cope with the roughly 600 flu deaths every year.
With 70 per cent vaccine coverage of the adult population and partial public health measures, the institute predicted 1457 deaths over six months, or just 13 deaths with "optimal public health measures (and no lockdowns)".
"We've learned from watching countries that have removed all restrictions that there is no 'freedom day'."
Generalised lockdowns are unlikely to be needed, it said, if public health measures of test, trace, isolate and quarantine - known as TTIQ - can prevent outbreaks from growing with a reproduction rate below one.
With higher case loads however, it predicts vigilant public health interventions will be needed.
"It might seem that these 'test, trace, isolate and quarantine' measures aren't currently working - in New South Wales or Victoria. But they are. They are stopping transmissions and reducing the effective reproduction rate from 5 to closer to 1.3 in New South Wales."
The institute said it's modellers were working through implementation issues specific to the states and territories, specific populations and high risk settings.

The warning comes as Scott Morrison hit out at two premiers, Queensland's Annastacia Palaszczuk and WA's Mark McGowan, for indicating they will defy the Commonwealth's plan.
However, Ms Berejkilian urged people in NSW to focus on the vaccination rate rather than the number of Covid cases, which remain above 800 each day.
"Once we hit 70 per cent double dose, we will be able to live life more freely and once we hit 80 per cent double dose, essentially we would have normalised the way we treat Covid," she said.

How Delta variant impacts kids compared to adults

Full text: Paediatrician Professor Fiona Russell of the Murdoch Children’s Research Institute said children exhibited similar flu-like symptoms to adults but few had become seriously ill, even with the Delta strain. Long Covid also affected kids less, she said.
And new data from the federal Health Department has revealed that children are being treated in hospital in relatively low numbers.
Of the 11,672 Covid cases recorded nationwide between January 1 and August 20, just 3504 were under 20.
Just 2.85 per cent of infected under-20s were treated in hospital and 0.17 per cent in ICU, compared to 17.74 per cent in hospital and 2.47 per cent in ICU for those aged 20-plus.
The Murdoch Children’s Research Institute is working with the Doherty and Burnet institutes on modelling about the health impact on children.
Prof Russell said she expected childhood Covid case numbers would remain low.
“When we look at common things that there aren’t any vaccines for, such as RSV – the Respiratory Syncytial Virus – which is a respiratory virus, we see 6000 hospitalisations in Australia every year in children under five but we don’t ever see anybody worrying about that and I mean we should be and we should be getting a vaccine for that of course.’’
Australian deputy chief medical officer Professor Michael Kidd said a higher proportion of children under 16 had emerged among Covid cases compared to last year.
“This is due to the increased transmissibility of the Delta variant, the rapid spread of Covid-19 among household members, but it also reflects the protection provided by vaccination to older people, especially those aged 60 years and above,’’ Prof Kidd said.
“By age group, the proportion of people hospitalised or admitted to ICU is much lower in children aged less than 14 years, compared to older age groups.
Locally acquired COVID-19 cases by hospitalisation, ICU admission and associated death status
“The data continues to show that, thankfully, our children are at much lower risk than other Australians.’’
Murdoch Institute paediatrician Dr Shidan Tosif said research had shown that children’s innate immune system had enabled them to avoid the worst effects of the virus.
Although many children are infected at home, Prof Russell said, one way to rein in infections was to make schools and childcare safer. That meant improved ventilation, cleaning and ensuring teachers were vaccinated.
“We do know that Delta is transmissible and it’s highly transmissible in every age group.’’
Prof Russell said she expected the vaccination of healthy children from age 12 to start later this year. Of the 34 Victorians reported in hospital on Tuesday, one is an infant while 22 are under 40.
Covid-19 vaccines are available for children over 12 who have other health conditions while ATAGI is considering advice on vaccinations for all Australians 12 years and older.

Full text: Australia's national plan to relax Covid restrictions risks a catastrophic death toll, new modelling shows, as the Prime Minister and NSW Premier continue to talk up easing restrictions before the community is protected.
Researchers from three of Australia's most prestigious universities warned tens of thousands of lives could be saved by revising the national plan to vaccinate children and reaching 90 per cent vaccination coverage among adults before "exposing Australians to uncontrolled COVID-19".
Their modelling shows Australia would see between 25,000 and 43,000 Covid deaths and more than 270,000 people with debilitating long Covid if governments and health officials follow the national plan.
That plan has Covid restrictions relaxed at a vaccination rate of 70 per cent of people aged 16 and over and almost no restrictions at 80 per cent.
In contrast, the original Doherty Institute modelling used to revise the current national plan, estimated between 1300 and 2300 deaths over 180 days from a seeding event of the virus. It did not estimate outcomes if the test-trace-isolate-quarantine strategy failed to clamp down an outbreak.
One author of the new modelling, Professor Quentin Grafton from Australian National University, said statements from Scott Morrison and Gladys Berejiklian in favour of easing restrictions at a flat rate of 70 per cent of adults was like handcuffing the nation's public health response while overtaxing its health workforce.
"We need much higher vaccination rates before we could contemplate handcuffing ourselves in relation to public health measures," Professor Grafton said.
"Although it's an epidemic in NSW now [with more than 800 new cases each day], it's a tiny fraction of what it could be if we open up and don't have proper public health measures and inadequate vaccination coverage."

The government should have decided what level of fatalities it would tolerate and work backwards to determine the vaccination rate needed to achieve that, but that was not how the national plan was developed, Professor Grafton said.
"It's a no-brainer - a simple calculation to make, and it doesn't therefore make sense from the Prime Minister's statement [on Monday] that at 70 per cent that we should stop having lockdowns because the cost is not worth it," Professor Grafton said.
"That's not what our modelling finds."
Children could also benefit from vaccination, he said. If Australia could achieve 75 per cent vaccination coverage among children and adolescents it could prevent a further 12,000 hospitalisations.
Dr Zoë Hyde, lead author of the new modelling, said premature relaxing of the restrictions would likely be irreversible, the resulting deaths unacceptable.
"It's simply too dangerous to treat COVID-19 like the flu," Dr Hyde said.
"We also can't forget about our children, who can get very sick from this virus and need protection before we open up."
As questions swirl around how relevant the Doherty Institute's modelling that underpins the national plan still is, the infection and immunity research centre released its own statement.
There is light at the end of the tunnel, it said, once Australia achieves 70-80 per cent vaccination, resulting in less transmissions and fewer hospitalisation and deaths.
"This level of vaccination will make it easier to live with the virus, as we do with other viruses such as the flu. However, it won't be possible to maintain a situation where there are no cases at all."
Any death is a tragedy, it noted, but the Australian health system can cope with the roughly 600 flu deaths every year.
With 70 per cent vaccine coverage of the adult population and partial public health measures, the institute predicted 1457 deaths over six months, or just 13 deaths with "optimal public health measures (and no lockdowns)".
"We've learned from watching countries that have removed all restrictions that there is no 'freedom day'."
Generalised lockdowns are unlikely to be needed, it said, if public health measures of test, trace, isolate and quarantine - known as TTIQ - can prevent outbreaks from growing with a reproduction rate below one.
With higher case loads however, it predicts vigilant public health interventions will be needed.
"It might seem that these 'test, trace, isolate and quarantine' measures aren't currently working - in New South Wales or Victoria. But they are. They are stopping transmissions and reducing the effective reproduction rate from 5 to closer to 1.3 in New South Wales."
The institute said it's modellers were working through implementation issues specific to the states and territories, specific populations and high risk settings.

The warning comes as Scott Morrison hit out at two premiers, Queensland's Annastacia Palaszczuk and WA's Mark McGowan, for indicating they will defy the Commonwealth's plan.
However, Ms Berejkilian urged people in NSW to focus on the vaccination rate rather than the number of Covid cases, which remain above 800 each day.
"Once we hit 70 per cent double dose, we will be able to live life more freely and once we hit 80 per cent double dose, essentially we would have normalised the way we treat Covid," she said.

Full text: Prime Minister Scott Morrison has pledged to "reinforce" the health system to ensure Australia can emerge from lockdown without overloading its hospitals, promising help for states and territories as he fights off calls to delay a national cabinet plan to ease restrictions.
Assuring Australians the health system could take the strain from rising coronavirus cases, Mr Morrison promised more resources if needed to maintain services, as doctors warned of a "disaster" if they did not receive urgent help with equipment and staff.
The promise turns attention to the capacity of the healthcare system in the middle of a political row over the national cabinet target to ease lockdowns once vaccinations reach 70 per cent of people aged 16 and over, with Labor casting doubt on the goal.
"Where states may need further help or assistance, or whatever, that needs to be worked through, in the same way that we work through national disasters and things like that nature," Mr Morrison said.
"That work enables us to live with the virus."
The federal government is working on a "common operating picture" with the states to ensure healthcare systems can deal with the pressure of rising cases, part of regular assessments since the pandemic began but with an added focus on the 70 per cent target.
"We're seeing our public health system stand up very strongly, and I would envisage that in the time we have between now and when we reach those targets that there will be the opportunity to reinforce those plans," Mr Morrison said.
He said the work would ensure states and territories knew they could deal with the pandemic.
"Because we have to deal with it. Otherwise, we stay in the cave forever. And that's not a sustainable solution."
Mr Morrison said lockdowns could not go on because they were taking a heavy toll on the nation's mental, physical and economic health.
"It is always darkest before the dawn, and I think these lockdowns are demonstration of that, but the dawn is not far away and we are working towards that dawn," he said.
Victorian Premier Daniel Andrews stood by the 70 per cent target yesterday and NSW Premier Gladys Berejiklian promised people they would "live more freely" when the goal was reached.
Queensland Premier Annastacia Palaszczuk said the goal was "uncharted territory" and raised doubts about whether it could be met, while West Australian Premier Mark McGowan told people he wanted to eliminate COVID-19.
Australian Medical Association president Omar Khorshid said the plan to withstand rising case numbers in the health system was more important than the vaccination target.
"At the end of the day, if we're not ready, it doesn't matter what the number is, because it's still going to be a disaster," he said. Dr Khorshid said more funding would be needed to bolster the system as managing more widespread cases would be an added strain on hospitals and GPs.
"Every public hospital, every private hospital and many community facilities are struggling to find enough staff, doctors, nurses.
"The idea that you could send large numbers of nurses to a hotspot is going to be very tricky, you have to think of the consequences of that."
Labor health spokesman Mark Butler said systems were being strained in NSW.
"The question for Scott Morrison is, will he continue to push for restrictions to be lifted, even if tracing and other systems are not operating at best practice?" Mr Butler said. Labor leader Anthony Albanese used question time to dispute Mr Morrison's claim that modelling from the Doherty Institute showed the easing of restrictions at 70 and 80 per cent vaccination rates would work even with the high case numbers seen in NSW.
Mr Morrison said work done over the weekend confirmed that the starting point, with higher case numbers than originally thought, did not change the overall conclusion in the Doherty modelling, but he declined to release the work. Mr Albanese challenged the government to release the assessment conducted over the weekend, saying Australians should see it for themselves.
A federal government source said the latest assessment was based on conversations between Doherty Institute professor Jodie McVernon and Secretary of the Department of Prime Minister and Cabinet Phil Gaetjens.

Reopening Australia too early with lack of restrictions would cause ‘substantial mortality’, experts say

Full text: The study, which has not yet been peer reviewed, says tens of thousands Australians would likely die and hundreds of thousands would likely develop cases of long Covid if the federal government were to push the country into Phase D of the national plan prematurely.
Phase D is the final phase of the plan and would involve things being “normal” and managing Covid like the flu, including having international borders opened up.
Lockdowns would be “a thing of the past” under Phase D and all vaccinated people able to travel to Australia without being subjected to inbound arrival caps or quarantine.
“We found substantial morbidity and mortality is likely to occur if the Australian government sticks to the national plan,” ANU economics professor and study co-author Quentin Grafton said.
The federal government has not yet specified when the country will enter Phase D.
At this stage, Prime Minister Scott Morrison says Australia will enter Phase C of “baseline restrictions” when 80 per cent of the population is vaccinated.
The ANU-led modelling warns that if Australia reopens to Phase D with 70 per cent of Australians aged over 16 fully vaccinated, there could eventually be 6.9 million cases of Covid-19, 154,000 hospitalisations, and 29,000 fatalities.
“We simply can’t afford to do that, both in terms of lives and long-term illness from Covid,” Professor Grafton said.
But the federal government has pushed back against the academics’ modelling, stating it is “not based in reality and is not a model of anything the Prime Minister or national cabinet are pursuing to reopen Australia.”
“[The modelling] falsely assumes there will be no health protections after 70 per cent of the population is vaccinated, and it assumes vaccinations don’t increase past 70 per cent,” a government spokesman said.
“As The Doherty Institute itself has said, ‘There is light at the end of the tunnel’ – once we achieve 70 per cent to 80 per cent vaccination we will see less transmission of COVID-19 and fewer people with severe illness, and therefore fewer hospitalisations and deaths.”
The ANU-led modelling warns that even if the PM waits until 80 per cent of the adult population are vaccinated to enter Phase D, thousands of lives would be lost.
“Assuming 80 per cent vaccination coverage for only those over 16, as per the national plan, there could be approximately 25,000 fatalities and some 270,000 cases of long Covid,” Professor Grafton said.
Professor Grafton told NCA NewsWire that these 25,000 fatalities could reasonable occur within 12 months of the commencement of Phase D.
“The consequences of prematurely and fully relaxing public health measures to suppress Covid-19, even after vaccinating 80 per cent of adults, would likely be irreversible, and unacceptable to many Australians,” study co-author and University of Western Australia senior research officer Zoë Hyde said.
“It’s simply too dangerous to treat Covid-19 like the flu.”
According to the modelling, a vaccination rate of at least 90 per cent, which includes children under 16, is needed to prevent mass deaths and hospitalisations in Phase D.
“If children are also fully vaccinated, national fatalities – for all age groups – would be reduced to 19,000 with 80 per cent adult vaccination coverage. This would fall to 10,000 at a 90 per cent adult vaccination coverage,” Professor Grafton said.
“Children also directly benefit from vaccination. If we could achieve 75 cent vaccination coverage among children and adolescents, we could prevent 12,000 hospitalisations in these age groups.”
To give Australians a decent chance in a country without lockdowns or other restrictions, the researchers argue that four key steps must be achieved first:
- Vaccinating both children and adolescents
- Reaching 95 per cent full vaccination among people 60 and older as well as other vulnerable groups, including Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islanders

- Giving an mRNA booster shot to all Australians vaccinated with AstraZeneca, as well as a booster shot to those vaccinated with an mRNA vaccine, when appropriate

- Reaching more than 90 per cent vaccination coverage among all Australians

Study co-author and University of Melbourne environmental economics professor Tom Kompas warned his research had used the lower estimates of the severity of the Delta variant, meaning the real-life outcomes would likely be even worse than the modelling predicted.
“Our projections likely represent a lower estimate of the cumulative public health outcomes of fully relaxing public health measures at Phase D of the national plan,” he said.
But Professor Kompas said it wasn’t too late for the federal government to turn things around, noting there was still an opportunity to devise “a safe and affordable transition to a post-Covid-19 era”.
“If national cabinet revises its strategy to include our four vaccination steps, many lives will be saved, and many more, including children, will not suffer from debilitating long Covid,” he said.

Full text: From Page 1 "Does anyone seriously think that they are just going to abandon parts of Australia that are experiencing Covid outbreaks? I don't think they will, and I think it would be electoral suicide if they did," he told reporters.
Prime Minister Scott Morrison earlier on Sunday pushed for states and territories to follow the reopening plan, agreed at national cabinet this month, saying the use of lockdowns to suppress the virus after the nation hits a 70 per cent vaccination rate would do more harm than good.
He said while it was unlikely there would be a return to zero infections - as states and territories had earlier achieved through lockdowns and other restrictions - the goal was to suppress rather than eliminate Covid.
"You can't go with lockdowns forever, and at some point you need to make that gear change, and that's done at 70 per cent because that's where we're advised from the medical science, that you can make that gear change," he said.
"Once you do that, then you can move into focusing on the public health issues of hospitalisation and serious illness."
The Prime Minister said Covid case numbers were "not the whole story", and that reopening the nation with higher infection rates would not ultimately change case numbers later.
However states and territories are disputing the reopening plan and argue it was based on Doherty Institute modelling assuming the nation would reduce restrictions while it had low case numbers.
Mr Barr said under the reopening roadmap, at 70 and 80 per cent state and national vaccination rates, the use of lockdowns would be targeted and less frequent, and there would still be a need for other public health measures.
"We need to be very clear this broad brush language of 'open up' should not be taken to mean there will be no public health directions, no public health settings and nothing in place to support the unvaccinated," he said.
Under the national reopening plan, a state or territory can ease restrictions once it reaches a 70 per cent vaccination rate, and when the national average hits the same figure. Once the figures reach 80 per cent, lockdowns would be limited even further.
Federal Chief Medical Officer Paul Kelly acknowledged the Doherty Institute's modelling for the reopening plan was based on lower case numbers, and flagged it was doing further modelling to account for larger Covid case numbers.
He expected it would not result in major changes to the national plan to reopen.
"To be very clear, there is agreement at national cabinet at the moment, and all states were unanimous of that," he said.
"The more nuanced local elements of that will be worked out over the coming weeks with the Doherty modelling as part of but not the only element that we would consider in relation to that."
He said that ATAGI was working on advice about vaccinating people aged 12-15, and that he expected it would this week provide advice about a wider vaccination program for that age group.
Opposition Leader Anthony Albanese called for clarity about the reopening plan, saying the public wanted certainty.
The director of epidemiology at the Doherty Institute, Jodie McVernon, told Sky News on Sunday that the original plan envisaged low or minimal transmission for the country to be opened up at 70 and 80 per cent vaccination rates.
Professor McVernon said with a high caseload it was not possible to have a "freedom day" and restrictions had to be gradually eased.
The Prime Minister on Sunday also supported the use of lockdowns as Covid cases grew in NSW and Victoria, and continued emerging in the ACT.
"Right now, of course we need to make the lockdowns effective."

Full text: From Page 1 "Does anyone seriously think that they are just going to abandon parts of Australia that are experiencing Covid outbreaks? I don't think they will, and I think it would be electoral suicide if they did," he told reporters.
Prime Minister Scott Morrison earlier on Sunday pushed for states and territories to follow the reopening plan, agreed at national cabinet this month, saying the use of lockdowns to suppress the virus after the nation hits a 70 per cent vaccination rate would do more harm than good.
He said while it was unlikely there would be a return to zero infections - as states and territories had earlier achieved through lockdowns and other restrictions - the goal was to suppress rather than eliminate Covid.
"You can't go with lockdowns forever, and at some point you need to make that gear change, and that's done at 70 per cent because that's where we're advised from the medical science, that you can make that gear change," he said.
"Once you do that, then you can move into focusing on the public health issues of hospitalisation and serious illness."
The Prime Minister said Covid case numbers were "not the whole story", and that reopening the nation with higher infection rates would not ultimately change case numbers later.
However states and territories are disputing the reopening plan and argue it was based on Doherty Institute modelling assuming the nation would reduce restrictions while it had low case numbers.
Mr Barr said under the reopening roadmap, at 70 and 80 per cent state and national vaccination rates, the use of lockdowns would be targeted and less frequent, and there would still be a need for other public health measures.
"We need to be very clear this broad brush language of 'open up' should not be taken to mean there will be no public health directions, no public health settings and nothing in place to support the unvaccinated," he said.
Under the national reopening plan, a state or territory can ease restrictions once it reaches a 70 per cent vaccination rate, and when the national average hits the same figure. Once the figures reach 80 per cent, lockdowns would be limited even further.
Federal Chief Medical Officer Paul Kelly acknowledged the Doherty Institute's modelling for the reopening plan was based on lower case numbers, and flagged it was doing further modelling to account for larger Covid case numbers.
He expected it would not result in major changes to the national plan to reopen.
"To be very clear, there is agreement at national cabinet at the moment, and all states were unanimous of that," he said.
"The more nuanced local elements of that will be worked out over the coming weeks with the Doherty modelling as part of but not the only element that we would consider in relation to that."
He said that ATAGI was working on advice about vaccinating people aged 12-15, and that he expected it would this week provide advice about a wider vaccination program for that age group.
Opposition Leader Anthony Albanese called for clarity about the reopening plan, saying the public wanted certainty.
The director of epidemiology at the Doherty Institute, Jodie McVernon, told Sky News on Sunday that the original plan envisaged low or minimal transmission for the country to be opened up at 70 and 80 per cent vaccination rates.
Professor McVernon said with a high caseload it was not possible to have a "freedom day" and restrictions had to be gradually eased.
The Prime Minister on Sunday also supported the use of lockdowns as Covid cases grew in NSW and Victoria, and continued emerging in the ACT.
"Right now, of course we need to make the lockdowns effective."

NSW good to go with 70% jab rate: PM

Full text: Prime Minister Scott Morrison has moved to reassure NSW the state can reopen based on current vaccination targets regardless of daily COVID-19 case numbers, despite a pushback from other states amid debate about living with the virus.
The Sun-Herald has also been told by federal government sources the Doherty Institute provided additional advice to national cabinet saying reopening with hundreds of daily cases at 70 per cent vaccination would not dramatically change its modelling.
The modelling assumes case numbers will continue to rise and the reproduction rate of the virus will remain above one at 70 per cent, but hospitalisations and ICU admissions will fall as happens with influenza.
A spokesman for Mr Morrison said national cabinet had asked the Doherty Institute to continue its work to model reopening scenarios.
"However, when we reach the 70 per cent and 80 per cent thresholds the findings are clear that we can move forward with our reopening plan regardless of case numbers because there will be far less serious illness for our health system to manage," he said.
NSW Premier Gladys Berejiklian insisted yesterday that all states will have to live with the virus as case numbers increase but hospitalisations stabilise and the vaccine rollout ramps up.
Ms Berejiklian said the national plan to start opening up and allowing "greater freedoms" at 70 per cent double-dose vaccination coverage, and living "more freely" again at 80 per cent coverage, remained the target.
But even as Victoria, Queensland and Western Australia cast doubt on the plan if case numbers continue to remain high, Ms Berejiklian said she was "heartened" by changing conversations at national cabinet.
"There is definitely a change in attitude," Ms Berejiklian said. "In the last couple of days, I've noticed a change in attitude amongst all of us, we accept the Delta is here, we accept getting to zero across the nation, especially once you open up and live freely, will be an impossible task - no other place on the planet has done it.
"Every single state is going to have to come to terms with the fact that when you reduce your borders, when you start living freely, when you start allowing Australia to be one nation without internal borders, this is a national issue and Delta, unfortunately, is something we need to live with. Again, I stress, I'm grateful to my colleagues in national cabinet - I've noticed a seismic shift in the way people are now approaching this issue."
But national agreement over how to open up the country is fraying, with Victorian Premier Daniel Andrews pushing back against that suggestion and insisting "the plan is the plan".
"If you don't actively suppress this virus then when you do open up, we will have scenes the likes of which none of us have ever experienced in our hospitals," he said.
"That is why yesterday [at national cabinet], far from a sense of easing or a sense of moving away from the plan, there was an agreement, and quite some discussion about the need to update the Doherty modelling because the Doherty modelling is not predicated on 10, 12, 15, 20,000 active cases in any state or across our nation, it is in fact predicated on very small numbers of cases.
"We will get 70 [per cent vaccinated], we will get to 80, we will be able to make big changes, but we will be able to make more changes and have more freedom at 80 per cent if we go to 80 per cent with very low cases numbers."
His comments follow WA Premier Mark McGowan's blunt remarks after national cabinet on Friday that "I'd prefer Western Australia not to have COVID, and anyone who wants to argue that we should have COVID, I think they've got rocks in their head".
He pointed to an assumption in the Doherty modelling that opening up at 70 per cent would begin with about 30 cases in Australia and said that assumption was no longer in place.

Andrews set to extend lockdown

Full text: Premier Daniel Andrews says the signs are not good that Melbourne can emerge from its sixth lockdown this week as more than 500,000 newly acquired Pfizer vaccines are rushed to NSW in response to the deepening crisis there.
With Victorian health authorities still trying to track mystery cases of COVID-19 and the latest outbreak at a tipping point, Mr Andrews said there were too many mystery cases and too much non-compliance with health orders to allow the city to open up.
Of the 25 cases reported yesterday, four were mystery cases.
The Premier backed the decision by the federal government to send more than half the 1 million doses of the Pfizer vaccine newly procured from Poland to the worst-hit areas of Sydney, saying vaccination was NSW's only hope of emerging from its crisis and there was "no way they're getting to zero cases".
Mr Andrews flagged that Victoria's border with NSW, where 415 new cases were reported yesterday, would stay shut until case numbers there were under control, regardless of progress on vaccinations.
Prime Minister Scott Morrison announced the purchase of the doses yesterday, saying 533,000 of the jabs would go to Sydney and the rest would be distributed to states and territories on a per-capita basis, with Victoria to receive 175,000. They were due to start landing in Australia last night.
Mr Andrews yesterday all but confirmed the lockdown in Greater Melbourne would be extended beyond Friday, describing contact tracers' work battling eight "sub-clusters" as challenging.
"There are far too many cases, firstly," he said.
"There are a number of mystery cases and those numbers continue to grow, and that's really challenging. If we were to reopen the whole economy or reopen and let people move freely right now, then we will finish up ... where Sydney is at right now - thousands of cases, not cases in the 10s and 20s."
While the Premier said he did not know what Thursday's announcement on lockdowns would entail, he indicated that "these were not good signs". He said there had been too much non-compliance with the lockdown rules, citing a "pub crawl" in Richmond at the weekend, while COVID-19 response commander Jeroen Weimar called out families allowing their children to meet for play dates and said not enough people were getting tested.
At this stage of last month's outbreak, seeded by Sydney-based removalists and spread at a number of packed venues such as the MCG and Young and Jackson, COVID-19 case numbers had begun trending down.
Catherine Bennett, chair of epidemiology at Deakin University, agreed with Mr Weimar's assessment that Victoria was at a make-or-break juncture, pointing to similarities between the situation in Melbourne and that of NSW several weeks ago.
"Every day we're getting cases popping up that tell us we've got a wider spread than we realised," she said. "We don't know how far the virus has got out into the community and, without being alarmist, that's what happened in Sydney. They found the chains of transmission out into western Sydney only after they'd been there for a few weeks and then found how widespread it was."
Mr Weimar said Victoria was at a "tipping point" as the latest cluster was continuing to grow. The cluster started with a Newport teacher at Al-Taqwa College.
"We've now got three, four significant clusters that are being generated that we now have to focus on, and that's the area of concern at the moment, and that is why this is a real tipping point," he said. "We can deal with those new clusters - we can deal with [the mystery cases] in St Kilda East, we can deal with Middle Park, we can deal with Glenroy, but if there are more cases coming off the back of them, that's where you start to get issues."
Ten of yesterday's new cases were linked to Al Taqwa, seven to Glenroy West Primary School and three to Caroline Springs Square Shopping Centre.
Health authorities are particularly worried about an outbreak in Melbourne's Orthodox Jewish community, after two people in St Kilda East tested positive to coronavirus at the weekend. Contact tracers are investigating whether the duo attended an illegal gathering during lockdown.
Border closures look likely to persist into 2022 after West Australian Premier Mark McGowan said his state's hard border with NSW could stay for the rest of the year and Mr Andrews said he would not open up Victoria to its northern neighbour until case numbers there were under control, regardless of vaccination rates.
National cabinet has agreed, on advice from the Doherty Institute, that Australia could open up when the adult vaccination rate hits 70 per cent. But Mr Andrews said NSW residents would still not be allowed into Victoria if the case numbers remained in the hundreds each day.
"They won't be getting in here," the Premier said. "That [Doherty] modelling does not assume there are thousands of cases, and hundreds of cases every day. That modelling assumes there are very low numbers of cases.
"So if we want to be open, if we want to have a new set of rules as we go into a new year, if we want to preserve our health system for everyone who needs it ... then when we get to 70 or 80 per cent we have to have cases down here, not raging."
He backed the Prime Minister's decision to send the majority of the new Pfizer shots to NSW.
"They have to be given more vaccine in NSW because nothing else they're doing is working," Mr Andrews said.
Mr Morrison said the additional doses would be enough to vaccinate everyone in the 20-39 age bracket in Sydney's 12 highest-risk local government areas.
The remaining Pfizer doses are due to arrive in Australia this week.
Poland's Australian embassy said in a statement Australia had been added to the list of "low- and middle-income countries" with which Poland was sharing vaccines, such as in the Balkans, due to the recent outbreaks of the Delta strain of coronavirus. The doses were sold on a non-profit basis, according to the embassy.
"The decision to also add Australia to the list was taken against the backdrop of the current outbreak of Delta variant in the country, following the talks between both countries' officials," the statement said.

Full text: Victorian Premier Daniel Andrews has also extended the Melbourne lockdown for two weeks that come into effect from 11.59pm Monday night.
He said they need to “go harder, and go longer” and said he was “angry” about the party involving 69 people which has become a transmission event that was held illegally.
He also unleashed on others who were making “sh**ty choices” and took a swipe at Sydney, saying “I wish the thing had not come from NSW”.
“It is all very well for us to stand here and say we will do everything we can to keep the community safe,” he said.
“It is also all very well and I am deeply grateful and so proud of the millions and millions of Melburnians and Victorian whose are doing the right thing.
“But every time even a small number of people make really bad choices, selfish choices, it take as way from the hard work that so many millions more are doing, and it extends these lockdowns because it makes it more likely that we will have more cases.”
Mr Andrews also said he did not want Victoria to end up like those in Sydney where lockdowns are in force until everyone is vaccinated.
“I don’t want us to finish up like Sydney where it has fundamentally got away from them. They are not reopening any time soon,” he said.
“They are locked in until they get pretty much the whole place vaccinated. That will take months. We have an option, we have an opportunity to do differently and to do better than that. But we can’t do it on our own. We need every Victoria to play their part in that. Millions are. Some are choosing not to and I just appeal to those people, please make much
better choices.”
He said playgrounds, basketball courts, skate parks and exercise equipment despite the fact that it is outdoors will be closed from 11.59pm Monday night.
“This spreads amongst kids and we can’t have the potential transmission sites open. Religious broadcasts, they will be further limited. Same crew. It has to be the same people who produce those broadcasts, as important as they are, each and every time,” he said.
“Permits for authorised work will come back, not from tonight, but there will be a little bit of leeway so we can move to that system, but that’s from 11.59pm tomorrow night.”
He said some students and other workers will need a permit to go out and work.
Large construction projects will be reduced to 25 per cent. Smaller projects will have a maximum of five workers. There will be additional restrictions in relation to movement between sites where trades work multiple sites.
Melburnians can no longer remove their masks to drink alcohol either.
Victoria has recorded 22 new locally acquired Covid-19 cases on Monday as fears grow Melbourne’s lockdown will be extended for a second straight week.
The state’s health department confirmed the new local cases about 8.30am, and revealed five were mystery infections.
They said 17 of the 22 new local cases could be linked to existing outbreaks but only 14 positive people were in isolation during their infectious period.
It comes after five mystery cases were reported on Sunday and four on Friday.
There are now more than 530 exposure sites in multiple suburbs across metropolitan Melbourne.
There are 205 active cases across the state, up from 185 on Sunday.
No new cases were recorded in hotel quarantine on Monday.

SEVEN DIE IN NSW, 478 NEW CASES It comes as NSW Premier Gladys Berejiklian has confirmed there were 478 Covid cases and seven deaths as Australia’s first delivery of Pfizer vaccines from Poland arrived in Sydney overnight.
She said the numers were “disturbingly high” after close to 157,000 were tested.
391 people are in hospital, 66 are in ICU and 28 are on a ventilator.
Ms Berejiklian said from the seven deaths, only two of them had one dose of a vaccine and all the others were unvaccinated.
Tragically, the eighth death of Australia’s youngest teenager Osama Suduh also died in hospital with pneumococcal meningitis, which he died from. But he was also Covid positive.
The Premier said the suburbs of Marylands, Guildford, Granville, Blacktown, Mount Druitt, Yagoona, Greenacre and Bankstown as the suburbs where the growth of Covid cases is continuing.
There were 16 new cases in the Hunter New England region and 30 cases in the Nepean, Blue Mountains area.
“Don’t leave your house. Don’t cut corners, unless you absolutely have to, we just want people to stay still,” she said.
“In western NSW, we are very concerned about communities in west Dubbo and the
Walgett area and the remote communities in far western NSW. We ask everybody to stay home and not to move around.”
Chief Health Officer Dr Kerry Chant detailed the latest Covid casualities in the state.
“There was a man in his 80s from south-western Sydney who died at Campbelltown Hospital,” she said.
“He wasn’t vaccinated. A man in his 40s from south-western Sydney who had severe underlying health conditions and was not vaccinated.
“A woman in her 70s from Sydney’s northern suburbs died at Royal North Shore Hospital.
“A woman in her 80s from Sydney’s inner west died at Royal Prince Alfred Hospital.
“She was a resident of the Wyong residential aged care facility and is the third death linked to this cluster and she was unvaccinated.
“There was a man in his 70s from south-western Sydney and he died at Liverpool Hospital. “He was a patient at that hospital and was the eighth death linked to that outbreak.
“He had had one dose of AstraZeneca.
“A man in his 80s from south-western Sydney died at Campbelltown Hospital and he was not vaccinated.
“He had a number of comorbidities that sadly contributed to his death.
“There was a man in his 80s from Western Sydney at died at Nepean Hospital. He was not vaccinated. He also had severe underlying illness.”
NSW Covid Exposure Sites
NSW Police commissioner Mick Fuller says he is not currently considering requesting additional powers (such as curfew enforcement) from the NSW government.
But he warned those flouting the rules, they will face the full force of police and fines.
“We ask the police officers to go hard, not in those terms,” he said.
We were issuing four cautions for every ticket leading up to the Delta variant which is great community-based policing but it reaches a point where you say ‘people aren’t getting this’.
“In fairness, I have asked officers to be active in terms of taking strong action. They still have the power of discretion. I have asked them to do what they should be doing, which is recording the reason why they take action or they don’t take action.”
“Anywhere that is an LGA of concern, we have deemed recreation being unnecessary risk. We have left in exercise because it is easier for police to work through that. Recreation is extremely broad, as we know.
“We can do without people sunbaking in the middle of a pandemic in an LGA of concern. “Recreation in those areas within your own LGA is still accepted if you are not in an LGA of
concern.”
It comes as Prime Minister Scott Morrison told Sunrise he had struck “a normal transaction” to secure the extra one million doses that were signed off by Pfizer.
“We were very quickly on the phone,” he said.
“Theres a great affection for Australia ... it doesnt matter where you go in the world, people know people from Australia ... they’re very kind and supportive of Australia.”
Severe ­restrictions and lockdowns will ­remain in NSW until November, as Victoria and the ACT also face longer lockdowns.
An emergency shipment of Pfizer has touched down in Australia overnight.
Ms Berejiklian said she would not risk deaths by reopening. She said we “have to be real” and find a way to live with Delta after getting case numbers down.
But she said: “You can’t let it rip.”
She said they were undertaking a “dual strategy” of suppressing further outbreaks and ramping up vaccination, until people had received “double dose” vaccinations.
On current modelling, that could mean a lockdown is in place until mid-November.
Dr Chant delivered a grim warning telling everyone in NSW to stay at home.
“We need the community to stay with us,” she said.
“What I’m saying is it is a very, very bad picture if we don’t make that choice together. And everyone has a role to play.”
It also comes as Western Australia warned it may keep its borders closed despite a national agreement to open up after jab rates hit 70 to 80 per cent.
West Australian Premier Mark McGowan broke national cabinet ranks on Sunday by declaring he would pursue a zero-Covid policy even after WA reached 80 per cent vaccine coverage.
“Our preferred option is zero Covid, obviously, and that’s what we’ll attempt to do. When you get to 70, perhaps 80, if there is a lockdown it might be a lesser area rather than the entire metropolitan area. It might be a country town rather than the entire region,” Mr McGowan told Sky News. “We ­retain the right to put in place borders (restrictions). But some of the measures that are put in place might ease once we reach that level of vaccination.”
Covid-19 commander Jeroen Weimar said Victoria was at a “tipping point” in the latest Delta outbreak, where it could be locked down for months if new clusters continue to emerge with mystery cases.
Contact tracers are trying to connect five new mystery cases recorded on Sunday to existing clusters in Caroline Springs, Melton, Middle Park, Richmond, and Maribyrnong.

AUSTRALIA BUYS 1M PFIZER DOSES FROM POLAND Poland has sold one million Pfizer Covid vaccine doses to Australia as part of a “responsible policy of solidarity”, the Polish health minister said on Sunday.
Health Minister Adam Niedzieslki said that Poland’s vaccine purchases “allow us to meet the needs of our citizens and support others in need”.
Polish ambassador to Australia Michal Kolodziejski said: “In these tough times for our Australian friends, Poland has decided to share with Australia one million doses of Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine, with immediate delivery”.
Prime Minister Scott Morrison announced the major boost to Australia’s vaccine rollout, as
415 new cases of Covid were recorded in NSW on Sunday and four more deaths.
He said the vaccines were arriving “later tonight” and throughout the week. “In days, these jabs will start going into the arms of Australians,” Mr Morrison said at a press conference.
Mr Morrison said the new one million Pfizer doses will be targeted at Australians aged 20 to 39 years of age as they were identified in the Doherty modelling as peak transmitters for Covid-19.
“Five-hundred-and-thirty thousand of these doses will be prioritised for express delivery to the 12 Sydney local government areas where the COVID-19 outbreak continues to grow.”
Mr Morrison said the rest of the doses would be allocated to the other states and territories on a per capita basis.
“This allocation is based directly on the advice I received from the chief medical officer, Professor Kelly, his advice is based on the Doherty modelling and other work they have done about the transmissibility of the virus in those most affected areas and how they can be addressed through these additional doses,” he said.
“This will give everybody aged 20 to 39 in the 12 LGAs the opportunity to be vaccinated.”
Poland has fully vaccinated around 55 per cent of its population, but the rate of vaccinations has slowed sharply in recent months and many vaccination centres have been closed due to low demand.
Opinion polls indicate that up to a quarter of Poles are either opposed to vaccination or hesitant about getting one.
‘NO NEED TO BE OUT FOR HOURS’ Mr Morrison directly addressed the lockdown in NSW, urging residents not to socialise outside bluntly saying “do not do it”.
“My plea to fellow Sydneysiders is to stay at home. Stay at home. Only leave any absolute you have to,” the Prime Minister said.
“There is no need to be out for hours and hours per day. I know the rules provide for it, but please do not do it,” he added.
“We have been seeing the case numbers rise in Sydney and in New South Wales each day, and that is totally concerning.
“I need you to stay at home, and you needed more vaccines from us. More vaccines are underway, they will be that next week. So I need Sydneysiders to stay home.”
Mr Morrison insisted the lockdown was the key to containing NSW’s Covid crisis.
“Lockdown has to work. It must work and is why I implore people across Sydney, stay at home,” Mr Morrison said.
“Don’t get down to the beach for hours or meet up with others walking in pairs apart and catching up anyway.
“We all know what we’re talking about. Don’t do it. Please don’t do it. It is up to all of us … to make this lockdown work.”
ACT LOCKDOWN EXTENDS, 19 NEW CASES Canberra’s lockdown has been extended for an extra two weeks after 19 new local Covid cases were recorded.
The national capital’s outbreak has now grown to 28 cases.
With the two week extension, the ACT’s lockdown is now set to end on September 2 instead of August 19.
The new cases included a student from Lyneham high school and a worker from the Greenway Views retirement village in Tuggeranong.
Chief Health Minister Andrew Barr said the retirement village was now in full lockdown.
The worker who brought Covid-19 into the facility had received her first dose of the vaccine and was unknowingly infectious during her shift.
“This is a serious situation. We do not want to see the numbers continue to grow and we do not want to see exponential growth as we have seen in other jurisdictions,” he said.
Mr Barr said there was also “particular concern” for attendees at the University of Canberra High School Kaleen last Monday, urging anyone who were there at that time to get tested and quarantine immediately.
“This is a serious situation. We do not want to see the numbers continue to grow,” Mr Barr said on Monday.
Mr Barr urged Canberrans to continue following lockdown rules.
With 19 new community cases, the ACT has announced 11 new exposure sites. Anyone who attended the following locations at the dates and times specified must complete an ACT Contact Declaration Form , quarantine immediately , and get tested for COVID-19 .
NO NEW CASES IN QUEENSLAND There were no new Covid cases in Queensland as of Monday. The so-called “doughnut” day came after a one-year-old child was among one of six new locally acquired Covid-19 cases recorded 24 hours earlier on Saturday.
Those cases brought the state’s total number of active cases to 165 — up from 158.
Speaking on Saturday, Health Minister Yvette D’Ath confirmed all six local cases were linked to the state’s Indooroopilly cluster — now at 143 cases — and none of them have been infectious while in the community.
Deputy chief health officer Dr James Smith said the one-year-old was a sibling of a child already infected and was in hospital with the virus in a stable condition.
The remaining five cases were adults linked to either the Brisbane Boys‘ Grammar School or the Ironside State School. “The numbers are looking very reassuring,” Dr Smith said.
Chief health officer Jeannette Young warned more outbreaks were inevitable after seven local cases were identified.
“I can’t say if they’ll come out of NSW, if they’ll come out of our international borders, or if they’ll come from the cases they’ve clearly got in the ACT,” she said.
“They could come from anywhere.
“We will see more cases in our community so we need to be prepared for that.”
All of the seven cases were linked to the state’s Delta cluster; one connected to the Japanese language class at St Aidan’s Anglican Girls School while the others were connected to Ironside State School and Brisbane Grammar School.

MANDATORY JAB POWERS Australia’s workplace regulator has paved the way for employers to require ­mandatory vaccin­ations of workers against Covid-19 where businesses are running in ­lockdown hot spots.
However, in an expected legal guidance on the ­vaccination regimen, released on Thursday night, the Fair Work Ombudsman cautioned employers might not have the power to require mandatory ­vaccination where there had not been a Covid-19 transmission for a while, according to a report in The Australian.
The ombudsman said that ­employers could advise employees to be vaccinated if the direction was lawful and reasonable, but whether a direction was lawful and reasonable would be “fact-­dependent” and needed to be looked at on a case-by-case basis.
The advice will disappoint business groups, which have been pushing for legal certainty around the mandatory vaccinations of workers. Scott Morrison suggested last week that the federal government would not be legislating to aid mandatory vaccinations, saying employers would have to be ready to defend their ­actions in court.
The Fair Work Ombudsman’s advice was released as NSW recorded 345 new locally acquired cases of Covid-19 and two deaths.
NSW Premier Gladys Berejiklian tightened lockdown restrictions in the local government districts of Burwood, Strathfield and Bayside as infections spread into the these areas.
Canberra was also put into a snap seven-day lockdown on Thursday when a Covid case was discovered.
The Fair Work Ombudsman’s updated guidance came as the ­push to vaccinate 70 per cent of eligible Australians passed the halfway point, with 14.48 million doses now given.
National cabinet has set 70 per cent as the threshold for the initial easing of Covid restrictions.
Based on the current rollout trajectory, the 70 per cent threshold of having 14.43 million Australians aged 16 and over fully vaccinated should be reached during October.

Full text: Based on current averages, 70 per cent of Victorian adults will be fully vaccinated against Covid-19 by November 21 – five days after the nation reaches that critical mark to limit lockdowns and ease ­restrictions on the vaccinated.
Victoria is on pace to hit the 80 per cent target by December 13 – three weeks after NSW and also slower than Tasmania, the ACT and the Northern Territory. Under the national cabinet’s plan, states can progress through the reopening phases once the vaccine targets have been met both nationally and in their own jurisdictions.
Victoria Vaccine Locator
In NSW, the vaccination rate has drastically increased amid its worsening outbreak. Over the past week, NSW GPs delivered 398,940 doses compared to 172,405 doses by Victorian GPs.
The performance of state-run vaccination facilities across the two biggest states has been more comparable, with the jab rate in Victoria’s mass hubs now being lifted by the rush of people under 40 getting the ­Astra­Zeneca vaccine.
The Herald Sun can reveal that since Scott Morrison open­ed the door at the end of June for under-40s to access AstraZeneca, 31,510 young Victorians have received a first dose and 12,635 have had both.
Premier Daniel Andrews said on Tuesday that Victorians aged 18-39 were making an appointment every seven seconds for the jab.
A total of 2366 first doses of AstraZeneca were administered in that age group on Monday, which Health Minister Martin Foley said was a three-fold increase on the previous Monday. More than 13,000 young Victorians have also booked in to be vaccinated since the state government at the weekend ­allow­ed hubs to start giving Astra­Zeneca to under 40s.
But Wyndham Council on Tuesday night urgently called on the state government to provide a local seven-day-a-week vaccination hub for 18-39 year-olds. Mayor Adele Hegedich said the LGA’s young people had been ignored.
“Fifty-six per cent of Wyndham’s 280,000 residents are under 35 and, as the recent outbreak has demonstrated, they desperately need access to vaccinations,” she said.
“Currently, the closest state-run vaccination hub is in Sunshine or Geelong.”
NED-4292-Percentage-of-eligible-population-fully-vaccinated-by-state
In more concerning developments last night, the Caroline Springs Square Shopping Centre was deemed a Tier 1 exposure site from August 2 to August 5 for all staff.
Australian Medical Association state president Roderick McRae warned some GPs were feeling “jaded and fatigued”, and more had doses that were about to expire than problems obtaining more supplies. “Many GPs, and probably more their staff, have been abused by frustrated and angry people,” he said.
“They have had plenty of people cancel, particularly second AstraZeneca (doses).”
Dr McRae said he expected the rollout would accelerate as ­eligibility was expanded. “One of the key mechanisms of us all getting out of these recurrent lockdowns is to have a high per­cent­age of (us) vaccinated.”
University of South Australia biostatistics expert Professor Adrian Esterman said increasing supplies of Pfizer, coupled with the arrival of the Moderna vaccine next month, meant all jurisdictions would be able to significantly ramp up rollouts.
“The key there is not to rely on GPs but rely on pharmacists and vaccine hubs, which I’m sure the Victorian government will do,” he said. Victorians in their 30s are expected to get access to Pfizer and Moderna within weeks, in line with modelling from the Doherty Institute that showed younger adults were the most likely to spread the virus. Mr Foley said it was clear there was a “strong emphasis” among young people to get vaccinated.
Covid jab rollout rush
“Clearly, young people have assessed their personal situation in a strong and informed manner and many are determining that there are significant risks in remaining unvac­cinated during the Delta out­break, and during lockdown, and they’ve made a ­decision where their interests and the community’s interest lies,” he said.
“They’re doing it for themselves, for their family and for their local community and cultural organisations ”.

Covid normal demands big change of attitude

Full text: MOST of us don’t spend much time thinking about heuristics, the very things that define how we think.
They are mental shortcuts our brains create to fast-track decision-making based on past experiences. Heuristics are why we feel compelled to buy something that’s selling out, why we hurry up when we encounter someone in an alley at night, and why we tend to trust someone’s opinion if they are considered an expert.
In recent weeks, there’s been a bit of talk about the availability heuristic, and how it influences AstraZeneca vaccine hesitancy.
For someone under 50, the risk of dying from a clot caused by the jab is about 0.00009 per cent. Climbing a ladder, driving a car or drinking too much are all more likely to be fatal, and yet that risk would not prompt us to abandon such activities.
Some of us feel nervous about AstraZeneca because our brains subconsciously focus on the scary headlines and the shifting health advice. By contrast, the brain does not create similar shortcuts about other risks, because potential sources of fear are not available to it.
We can rationalise our way past the availability heuristic, as thousands of young Australians have done to get the AstraZeneca vaccine. Vaccine hesitancy can be overcome.
The bigger question is this – can we retrain the way our brains think about Covid-19 itself?
It is a measure of Australia’s relative success during the pandemic that the majority of the population is unwilling to live with the virus.
Does your heart rate quicken when your phone buzzes with the daily case numbers? Do you wonder why state borders aren’t closed as soon as an outbreak flares hundreds of kilometres away? Do you wish horrible things on anyone who brings the virus into your city?
Since Victoria’s second wave, state and federal leaders have progressively shifted their suppression strategy to a zero-Covid stance. Gladys Berejiklian was the last holdout – backed by Scott Morrison – and Sydney is paying the price.
As the PM declared this week, short and sharp lockdowns are now the preferred response. Eliminating the virus is the goal, and what our brains have been trained to expect.
Herein lies the challenge for Morrison this year. When 70 per cent of the adult population is vaccinated, he believes – quite rightly, according to modelling from the Doherty Institute – that Australia can flick a switch and live with Covid. No more lockdowns.
Will the nation accept this? The obvious answer is yes, because while Australia’s approach to Covid has saved thousands of lives, it has also deprived millions of freedoms they want back.
But Morrison should not underestimate the fear this virus causes, nor the difficulties he will face convincing Australians that it can be treated like any other infectious disease.
The modelling, upon which the vaccination target is based, confirms inoculating the nation is the only way out of the pandemic.
It also details a harsher truth, which Health Minister Greg Hunt has recently articulated: Covid will be with us for decades.
Consider this. Once 80 per cent of adults were vaccinated – and exempted from all domestic restrictions – there would be 230,164 symptomatic infections in a six-month outbreak, if we maintained only low-level social distancing and tracing, testing, isolation and quarantine measures struggled to keep up.
Hospitals would be inundated and 996 people would die.
It sounds frightening. For the sake of comparison, however, Australia averages 178,621 flu cases every year and 642 deaths.
With optimal containment measures, the Doherty experts expect Covid infections could be slashed to 1160 over six months, with only seven deaths.
This is merely a model, of course, but as chief medical officer Paul Kelly says: “We do need to accept that there will be cases. We need to accept that there will be hospitalisations, there will be ICU admissions and there will be deaths.” Morrison will not be able to prepare Australians for this reality, whatever the numbers, without the national cabinet’s support. While the state leaders have given their “in-principle” backing to the vaccination rates required to reopen the country, they have shown a penchant to go their own way throughout the pandemic, for practical and political reasons.
This time, the PM has painted it as a test of their “integrity and honesty with the Australian people”. To succeed, he will need a pact with Berejiklian and Daniel Andrews, who can bring the others with them and shift the Covid narrative so it no longer exploits voters’ fears.
This will not be easy, in the face of a virus that finds and rips open cracks in our political architecture with brutal efficiency, but it is Morrison’s best chance. Failure will have serious consequences for his leadership, let alone the country.
A unified national cabinet approach to life with Covid is even more important when we have simply no idea about life beyond Covid. To combat this uncertainty, they must present a clear vision of how vaccinated Australians will be exempt from ongoing restrictions.
That freedom will be the best incentive for the jab – and the best way to train our brains to live with the virus.

Is cost of living with virus too high?

Full text: We must understand the true price of committing to Christmas with Delta. It may not be worth paying.
Poor political decisions can have disastrous consequences. In August 1914, before World War I began, politicians on both sides assured their peoples that the conflict would be over by Christmas.
Instead, the maelstrom - unleashed by incompetent risk analysis - developed into a grinding stalemate that killed or maimed 40 million people. In 1918, the exhausted powers fell into an armistice but not before creating the conditions that brought on the great influenza pandemic that killed another 50 million.
Similarly, while nature created the coronavirus, poor political decisions created the COVID-19 pandemic. Now, as we contemplate what to do about the pandemic by Christmas, Australians are being asked to abandon hard-won freedoms secured under zero-COVID for the greatly inferior, if not illusory, liberty of "living with COVID".
The federal government wishes to link a specific vaccination rate of the "eligible population" to the opening of Australia's borders. Whatever the actual target, using the "eligible population" formulation means that the actual number protected by vaccines will be considerably lower. And focusing on numbers vaccinated at any level avoids the real driver of Delta infection which must be the numbers of people either unvaccinated or susceptible to infection.
In Australia, vaccine coverage varies widely according to income, with some less-affluent suburbs and regional centres still largely unvaccinated. Opening our borders before all are vaccinated will exact a disproportionately high price on poor, vulnerable and remote Australians.
Doherty Institute and Treasury modelling is a welcome contribution to the debate, but all modelling reflects the assumptions provided by those who commission it. And much of this analysis began before the full dimensions of the Delta crisis became apparent globally and now in NSW.
Abandoning the freedoms and prosperity achieved under COVID zero will affect, for the worse, the lives of all Australians. Democratic principle demands that such changes be put to the Australian people before, and not after, they are undertaken.
With increased vaccination rates finally in prospect, the Morrison government wishes to lay down an urgent timetable for dissolving the goal of a COVID-free Australia. But Australians should be asking, "Why rush to irrevocably join the ranks of COVID endemic countries?"
The supposed upside is "freedom". But if there is one thing we have learnt about this disease, it has never failed to disappoint on the downside.
By October 2020, the commitment of the Australian people, public health advisers along with the premiers and chief ministers delivered a sustainably COVID-free Australia. Most Australians enjoyed a remarkably prosperous golden summer that lasted until June 2021.
The freedoms of zero-COVID Australia disappeared when inexcusably lax NSW government administration of Sydney Airport quarantine let Delta into an almost unvaccinated country.
The federal government now insists that this hard-earned status be traded-in for a much less satisfactory future of "living alongside COVID". Like the generals at the outbreak of the World War I, Australia runs the risk of responding to last year's COVID, not this year's Delta, and what will almost certainly be next year's new variants.
Delta, which can be transmitted by the fully vaccinated, is trashing the optimistic assumptions made by countries that believed some elevated level of inoculation coverage would put the worst of the pandemic behind them. Delta is driving a global resurgence of cases and deaths, with a worsening situation emerging even in the United States and some European countries with much higher vaccination rates than Australia.
The almost certain consequence of allowing vaccinated Australians to travel abroad before Delta-proof quarantine is built and all Australians are fully vaccinated will be to import an ineradicable caseload of Delta with increased numbers of hospitalisations and deaths. No restrictions can be ruled out if things deteriorate.
The inability of the NSW government to bring the current Delta outbreak under control is an ominous portent of what might happen if we open too soon.
The Doherty Institute modelling details on the health, economic and social consequences of accepting "living with COVID" has now been published. Its underlying assumptions and scenarios should now be subject to the most rigorous debate and analysis by other academic institutions, the Australian people and their parliaments.
The aspiration of the Australian people is not to "live with COVID" but to protect themselves, their families and communities from the worst effects of the worsening global COVID pandemic.
In their wisdom, a fully informed Australian people may conclude that the price of committing to Christmas with COVID is not worth paying.

Moment of truth, for us — and for Morrison

Full text: It hinges entirely on vaccination. It will be a lengthy journey into 2022. Lockdowns will be permitted far into next year on a receding basis. But the heart of this national plan is its deeply ambitious vaccination thresholds – a 70 per cent national average to take the first step and move to phase two, and an exceedingly ambitious threshold of 80 per cent to move to stage three in this four-stage plan.
On current data it seems only the UK and Israel are near these targets. Morrison made clear there is a double test at each threshold – the national average must meet the target, as well as the individual jurisdiction making the move.
Anthony Albanese’s “whatever it takes” Labor
Morrison refused to speculate on the timetable for these achievements but said he had “hope” to make the initial transition by the end of the year.
That’s the goal. It will be put up in lights around Australia – 70 per cent with two jabs. Say it loud, say it clear. It is the goal the country needs to rally around as the nation’s vaccination target to be reached as soon as possible. That means before the close of 2021.
Morrison spoke last evening after a long meeting of national cabinet. What matters next are the reactions of the premiers. Are they on board? Is this a fair dinkum pathway? Or will the premiers continue to bet each way and, ­devoid of conviction, continue to do whatever they want.
The truth is there is a lot for the premiers in this pathway – the journey is immediately ambitious in the short term to reach 70 per cent vaccination, but phase two doesn’t put much limit on the discretion of the premiers. The big transition is going from stage two to stage three with its 80 per cent vaccination threshold.
The political reality is that the pathway will still be unfolding at the time of the next federal election. It will be either in phase two or phase three.
This pathway will demand a world-best effort from Australia. There will be no place for vaccination hesitancy. It will require the entire nation to be working together, state and federal, Coalition and Labor. With each phase, the ­restrictions are eased but it is only at stage three that vaccinated people are released from restrictions.
As each phase is progressed, the restrictions on overseas travel movement are also eased.
Given the feral mood of the ­nation, the pathway is sure to face intense criticism. This is where a genuine commitment from the premiers is vital. “Every single jab is important,” Morrison said. It is a major understatement. But the pathway offers a potential political escape for the Prime Minister from the world of pain he now endures.
What can go wrong for Morrison? The list is long. But the opportunity exists for a more cohesive national effort to reach these goals.
He made it clear that everything depends on the consensus around this decision sticking in the future. What are the prospects of this, after the appalling blame games of the past month?
NSW must have been a catalyst for this outcome. Facing a nine-week extended lockdown, NSW still cannot outrun the beast of Delta. The fear is manifest – that NSW Premier Gladys Berejiklian cannot contain the outbreak, with the prospect of growing public damage, polarised politics and an economy going backwards. Despite better numbers on Friday, the pressure remains immense on ­Berejiklian and chief health officer Kerry Chant as the two instruments they deploy – lockdowns and vaccination – struggle to do the job. Morrison has backed Berejiklian, saying the lockdown is the “only way through”, while boosting federal financial support to NSW to $750m a week.
The truth is Morrison’s standing is eroded every day the lockdown lasts, and that may be a long time. Rarely in history has a federal government pledged such open-ended financial support amid such rising hostility. The mood in NSW is a mixture of resignation, frustration and anger.
Yet the pincer-like trap is closing on Berejiklian and Morrison. If Covid cases keep rising, defying the contact tracers, at what point might NSW decide vaccination coverage is sufficient to permit an easing of restrictions?
The iron law governing the NSW lockdown is what Morrison calls the two-month delay in the vaccine rollout. It’s true, as Health Minister Greg Hunt says daily, the rollout gains momentum, with ­national numbers showing just under 40 per cent of eligible adults having their first jab, and 18 per cent having both jabs. But it is far from enough.
Labor leader Anthony Albanese will seek over the next month to destroy Morrison’s reputation and render him unelectable.
Berejiklian’s plea on vaccines reached a new intensity on Friday. “Our biggest weapon is vaccination,” she declared. With NSW having given 3.6 million jabs, that is a third of the way towards its target of 10 million. She renewed her plea for more vaccines, sure to be rejected by other premiers. But she has drawn the defining political nexus: more jabs mean more freedom.
This is the Berejiklian gospel. It is now reflecting in the national pathway. But the pressure on Morrison remains constant. Much of the public blames the federal government for the lockdown, attributing it to the slow vaccine rollout, a perception valid at the margins but still misleading. A high vaccination rate would not have stopped the NSW lockdown but it would have mitigated its severity.
The Delta variant has transformed the internal politics – Berejiklian, the “gold standard” from 2020, is tarnished because she failed to respond to Delta, while Victoria’s Dan Andrews, the failure from 2020, now struts the stage triumphant, presenting as the champion with his model of tough, hard lockdown.
Morrison and Josh Frydenberg have played their well-worn role. Hostage to lockdowns, they boosted their support yet again so NSW will receive more than $1bn a week in total from both governments. The PM and the Treasurer, having lifted support numbers to JobKeeper levels, have probably defeated the demand for JobKeeper’s return, a flawed demand since their new arrangements are faster and more flexible anyway.
Berejiklian’s rhetoric betrays her alarm at the prospect of a prolonged lockdown. “Things are likely to get worse before they get better,” she said after Thursday’s leap in cases. Yet the other premiers cling to their vaccines, fearing the spread of the NSW outbreak on their turf. The risk is where NSW goes, the nation might go. Berejiklian has become the target of patronising aggression from Andrews and West Australian Premier Mark McGowan, revealing their pent-up resentment of the status she once enjoyed.
With the federation fractured, Morrison, the premiers and national cabinet approached their moment of truth on Friday in deciding how Australia regathers and overcomes this crisis. Having taken these decisions in principle, they have an obligation to navigate through the federation strains, putting the national interest first.
Their decision relied upon Doherty Institute modelling on the vaccination thresholds deemed necessary to move Australia through four phases, including the transition beyond lockdowns. Morrison also factored economic assessments from Treasury into the mix, so it became a joint health-economic equation.
This pathway will make or break Morrison’s authority. While his political situation is still recoverable, much depends upon his ability to guide the national strategy. Morrison’s problem, of course, is that the premiers have the power and they control the politics.
For the premiers, the embrace of post-lockdown scenarios means surrendering the power and popularity they have enjoyed based upon the “I’ve kept you safe” mantra. Stepping back from their parochial fixations will be a big event. As for Morrison, he is plagued daily by his critical mistake in vaccine administration and rollout. Beyond that, however, Morrison has been trapped by constitutional and political realities – this is a public health emergency, and that means the premiers are in control.
The worst misreading of the crisis has come from the populist right lobby and its media backers who discount the Covid threat, demand that Morrison defy the premiers and, incredibly, even oppose the current NSW lockdowns. Reflecting upon the realities here, former prime minister John Howard told Inquirer: “The commonwealth cannot make public health orders for the states. The impression is that the premiers have taken up new powers. But that is not the case. The situation has always been that if something was required in public health, it had to be done by the states.
“On this issue the states have the constitutional power. This power has been there all the time. The point is it was dormant and just wasn’t needed to be exercised. Apart from information campaigns such as anti-smoking and for HIV-AIDS, this is the first ­nationwide public health issue in many decades, perhaps since the Spanish Flu.”
Morrison’s task now is to achieve co-ordination through national cabinet and prosecute the national pathway. Two lessons from NSW are now apparent: Delta is different and requires an immediate, short-term tough lockdown to contain any outbreak; and the damage done by prolonged lockdown is unsustainable and needed to be replaced by the nationwide pathway strategy.
Latest data shows that fewer than 80 per cent of people older than 80 have had one vaccine dose. So even at this stage, one fifth of the most vulnerable cohort has not scored a first jab. What is happening here? Looking at the 70-74 age group, 23 per cent have not got a first dose, and in the 65-69 age group this omission reaches 32 per cent.
When it comes to the metric of two jabs, 60 per cent of the over-70s aren’t there yet. Morrison and Berejiklian urge people to get AstraZeneca. Pfizer supplies, now a million a week, will ramp up more in September. The government’s concern at present is not with anti-vaxxer ideologues but with people merely biding their time, just being reluctant. The country cannot afford to indulge such delays any more than it can tolerate the reckless demonstrations seen in Sydney last weekend.
The police and the army are enforcing compliance. The public health emergency, jobs and livelihoods cannot be sacrificed to people who decline to accept their community obligation.
New vaccine-based political conflicts are sure to emerge. Morrison said this week he opposes compulsory vaccination (apart from aged-care workers) because “it’s the wrong decision for Australia”. He fears it would be counter-productive and warns that businesses must be careful that any mandating for employees is consistent with existing law. But the public interest from vaccination cannot be denied.
Morrison backed the principle that different restrictions will apply depending upon whether or not people are vaccinated. The unvaccinated pose “a danger to themselves and others”. Morrison doesn’t like the term “vaccine passports” but differentiation defined by vaccination is necessary and inevitable. The only issue is how far it goes.
Interviewed by 3AW’s Neil Mitchell, the PM said: “I know ­national cabinet has its critics. I mean, what’s the alternative? Premiers and chief ministers and the Prime Minister don’t meet? I tell you, it would be a failure if it didn’t meet.” What has national cabinet achieved? Morrison said: “We’ve saved 30,000 lives and got a million people back into work.” And now it has agreed a pathway.
The NSW situation has created a feral mood, rampant in the media and sections of the public. This won’t dissipate any time soon. More relevant, however, is that most people are following the health orders and doing the right thing. On Friday in NSW, there were 170 new Covid cases compared with the 239 peak on Thursday. There are 187 people in hospital, 58 in intensive case, 24 on ventilators, and 13 deaths so far in this outbreak. That’s grave but context is vital.
Australia has avoided anything like the death toll seen in other developed nations. Our performance remains among the world’s best. People who think Britain has done brilliantly need to assess the facts. Its death toll is more than 129,000 compared with Australia’s at a touch over 920.

Full text: Australia's path out of lockdowns will be decided by how many people are vaccinated but will also take into account the economic cost of restrictions that have already cost billions of dollars.
Political leaders will be warned of the economic cost of sustained lockdowns in a Treasury analysis to balance new advice to national cabinet on the target vaccination rate required to open up.
National cabinet will today also discuss whether snap lockdowns on low coronavirus numbers are the best way to handle Delta variant outbreaks, given their success in Victoria and South Australia.
New modelling from the Grattan Institute found Australia could ease restrictions and end lockdowns when 80 per cent of the entire population has been vaccinated - a target that could be reached by the end of the year if children under the age of 12 are included in the rollout.
Without vaccinating young children, the country could achieve the level of coverage that would minimise deaths and keep pressure off hospital systems even with more cases by March, the Grattan Institute's Race to 80 report shows.
The Doherty Institute will present separate modelling to national cabinet today.
Prime Minister Scott Morrison said Australians can expect a straight answer on which vaccine rates the country and each state and territory will need to reach before moving on to phase two of the four-stage transition to a COVID-normal society, but national cabinet won't have that answer immediately.
"[We] get one of the world's best scientific organisations, the Doherty Institute, to tell you what the rates, risks are against various vaccination levels for the general population," Mr Morrison told 3AW. "Then you get the best economic advice from your Treasury to work out what the cost of various restrictions are. And you come up with what the right vaccination rate is to enable that to happen."
Treasury Secretary Steven Kennedy will present the economic advice, while Doherty Institute professor Jodie McVernon will take leaders through the vaccination modelling.
The Treasury analysis models scenarios ranging from lighter restrictions to sweeping lockdowns to consider the risks to the economy and jobs. The results provide a counterbalance to the Doherty Institute's work because national cabinet could consider the economic consequences in setting a more ambitious vaccination target or supporting longer lockdowns.
To date, 14.2 per cent of the total population, or 3.7 million people, have been fully vaccinated and 31.7 per cent (8.1 million) have received a first dose.
National cabinet will also discuss the best way to approach snap lockdowns to deal with the Delta variant after the success of Victoria and South Australia in handling outbreaks.
"I think the lesson of these last six weeks or so is that under the Delta strain, going quickly and early is clearly the new mode of operation," Mr Morrison told the Nine Network.
"And we've seen Victoria and South Australia come out quickly. And that's great news in those states. But we have to press on in NSW; in Sydney we've got to make sure this lockdown is effective."
Health Minister Greg Hunt said the Doherty Institute's report will be made public when national cabinet has worked through it, but this masthead previously revealed it will recommend a higher vaccination rate for older Australians than for the younger cohort.
Stephen Duckett, who heads the Grattan Institute's health program, believes the Doherty Institute's modelling will have a similar conclusion to the Grattan report.
The institute's report said on top of 80 per cent vaccination coverage for the entire population, 95 per cent of vulnerable people including all those over 70 should be immunised. The Grattan report found a vaccination rate of 80 per cent would prevent the hospital system from becoming overwhelmed should the virus spread through the community, and result in fewer deaths.
It pointed to Singapore, which recently entered a partial lockdown as cases rose despite 73 per cent of the population having received at least one dose of a vaccine.
"If you [open up] at 80 per cent, it is still likely that the virus will circulate in the community," Dr Duckett said.
"It is this trade-off we're making ... we wanted to talk about it as able to happen soon, so that people were motivated to say, 'let's get it over and done with, let's get this vaccination stuff done'."
It was also possible for children under 12 to start getting vaccinated this year, Dr Duckett said.

Full text: Australia's path out of lockdowns will be based on vaccination rates but will also take into account the economic hit of restrictions that have already cost taxpayers and businesses billions of dollars.
At a meeting of national cabinet today, political leaders will be warned of the economic cost of sustained lockdowns in a Treasury analysis to balance new advice on the target vaccination rate required to open up.

The Doherty Institute will present separate modelling to today's national cabinet meeting.
State and federal leaders will also discuss the best way to approach snap lockdowns to deal with the Delta variant, after the success of Victoria and South Australia in controlling outbreaks.
Prime Minister Scott Morrison said yesterday: "I think the lesson of these last six weeks or so is that under the Delta strain, going quickly and early is clearly the new mode of operation."
Victorian authorities warned the public yesterday that the virus "is still with us," after the state reported seven new cases, including a Moonee Valley traffic controller whose infection was announced on Wednesday.
Another new case in Bass Coast Shire was announced last night and will be included in tomorrow's figures. That person was quarantining throughout their infectious period.
Officials said the traffic controller, who tested positive for COVID-19 as Victoria moved out of its fifth lockdown, was unvaccinated despite becoming eligible in February because he worked at a testing centre. The source of his infection is still unknown.
Victoria's acting Chief Health Officer, Ben Cowie, confirmed the controller worked on days when positive cases visited Moonee Valley testing centre, raising the likelihood he picked up the virus at work.
Yesterday's six other cases included four Bacchus Marsh Grammar students who tested positive on their thirteenth day of isolation.
To date, 14.2 per cent of Australia's total population, or 3.7 million people, have been fully vaccinated and 31.7 per cent (8.1 million) have received a first dose.

Scientists split over Sydney's lockdown

Full text: New modelling from multiple sources suggests Sydney's lockdown is still not tight enough to stop case numbers from growing.
As new locally acquired cases reached a record 177 in NSW yesterday, independent models from the University of Sydney, University of Western Australia and federal government show the city needs tighter restrictions to control its outbreak.
Other models are still optimistic, predicting the outbreak could be brought under control in one to three months. But one team is so concerned about Delta spread it is now modelling stage five restrictions, where "nobody goes outside the door".
The NSW government has been gradually tightening rules since the outbreak began last month, although it now plans to reopen the construction sector and allow year 12 students back to class.
NSW Premier Gladys Berejiklian has dismissed calls for a tougher, Victorian-style lockdown, similar to the one used by Melbourne at the height of its second wave.
Scientists often caution modelling should be taken with a substantial grain of salt, as a model is only as good as the data put in. But Sydney's outbreak continues to grow, despite it going into lockdown more than a month ago.
"It is clear the current restrictions are not yet at the level where the suppression will be ensured in a rapid time frame. If you want to suppress it in a month, you need to do more stringent measures, that is clear," said University of Sydney COVID-19 modeller Professor Mikhail Prokopenko.
A study to be released by his team today, not yet peer-reviewed, found marked improvements in social distancing since earlier this month has been slowing the growth of the outbreak. But the Delta strain's heightened infectiousness meant that was still not enough, he said.
At the University of Western Australia, Professor George Milne's model also shows cases continuing to grow under current restrictions. His team is so concerned about Delta it is modelling "stage five" restrictions, where "nobody goes outside the door". "People are saying the current lockdown measures in NSW will put a cap on cases. Our results do not suggest that," he said.
Delta is about 60 per cent more infectious than the Alpha variant of the virus, which in turn was perhaps 50 per cent more contagious than the version that emerged in Wuhan.
The federal government's modelling is done by scientists around the country. It uses a metric called transmission potential: the ability of the virus to spread. A number below 1 means cases will fall; above 1 indicates cases will rise. Were NSW facing the version of the virus that first left Wuhan, government modelling shows a transmission potential of 0.96, which would mean the epidemic would slowly shrink. With the Delta version, that rises to 1.75.
However, The Age understands much of this data was collected before NSW's restrictions were tightened. Scientists close to the project estimate the number is lower now, but still above 1, and point out it varies widely across Sydney.
Separate models by the Burnet Institute and University of Melbourne are more optimistic. They find stage three restrictions introduced in Sydney on July 9 would only stabilise case numbers, while the new stage four restrictions announced on Wednesday will drive them down quickly.
But the modellers find themselves unsure if Sydney really has implemented stage four restrictions. Their modelling is based on Victorian-style restrictions which, at stage four included a curfew, "ring of steel" separating Melbourne from regional Victoria and mandatory masks inside and outside.
The NSW government is not allowing people to enter or leave Greater Sydney but does not include a curfew. Masks are mandatory indoors, but only required outdoors if distancing can't be maintained.
"There are mixed signals coming from the NSW government. We were thinking this morning maybe they are in stage three. In terms of the adherence, how the lockdown is enforced," said Driss Ait Ouakrim, an epidemiologist and COVID-19 modeller at the University of Melbourne.

Vax thresholds set higher here than in US, UK

Full text: Australians face higher Covid-19 vaccination thresholds to reopen the nation than in Britain or the US because of much lower levels of community immunity from people who have already contracted and recovered from the virus.
Scott Morrison and state and territory leaders have agreed to take control of the final decision on the vaccination targets that will be used to ease Covid-19 restrictions on business and reopen the borders under the Prime Minister’s four-step plan.
“Only government leaders can balance all the needs and risks for both the economy and the health system,” Mr Morrison said.
The Doherty Institute will provide initial advice on scientific modelling for the setting of vaccine thresholds, a spectrum of risk assessments and the potential impact on state health systems.
The institute will also provide recommendations on tiered vaccine thresholds for cross-demographic groups.
Despite public calls from business leaders and some MPs for relatively low, simple vaccination thresholds to be set under the four-step plan endorsed by national cabinet last week, there will not be a single “magic bullet” number.
The government has sought a range of recommendations from the Doherty Institute that includes a “staircase” approach starting with small, staggered changes building up to the lifting of major restrictions.
The recommendations are also expected to involve thresholds in tiers, perhaps 50 per cent vaccination nationally to stop domestic border closures but 70per cent before the international border can be opened.
There will also be different thresholds applied to different demographic groups, with a higher threshold of national vaccination required for vulnerable and older groups than for younger people.
The calculations for Australia’s thresholds have to take into account the level of Covid-19 antibodies in the community as a result of people recovering from coronavirus infections as well as from vaccinations.
In the US and Britain, which have experienced a high level of Covid cases, with 29 million and 4.3 million people having recovered respectively, there are almost 10 per cent and 7 per cent of the population with antibodies who have not been vaccinated.
In Australia, with just under 30,000 recovered cases and a population of almost 26 million, like Japan, South Korea and New Zealand, the antibodies level from recovered cases is much less than 1 per cent.
Australia, New Zealand, South Korea and Japan are in the lowest five OECD nations for Covid-19 deaths and also in the lowest five OECD members for vaccination rates.
To offset the lower level of antibodies in the Australian community, the Doherty Institute is also calculating the lower risk of Covid-19 spreading in Australia because the virus is not endemic in the community.
Mr Morrison said on Friday the situation in Britain, Europe and the US was “very different” from Australia but he hoped to move into phase two of the four-step recovery by the end of the year.
The Doherty Institute risk assessment and recommendations on the level of national vaccination required to prevent a new surge of Covid-19 is expected to go to Mr Morrison by the end of July.
The recommendations of the Doherty Institute will be considered by federal and state treasuries and federal and state health departments, but the final decision will be made by government leaders. “We will be informed by the Doherty advice. We will be informed by the economic leaders and we will be informed by the health systems. But the leaders will make the final decision,” Mr Morrison said.

Full text: If any other state or territory was facing a COVID-19 outbreak of the kind NSW is confronting, they would already be in lockdown.
That the Berejiklian government is instead allowing businesses to stay open and people to leave their homes should give hope to lockdown-weary Victorians that there may be another way.
Other state premiers and chief health officers have adopted an "abundance of caution" as their North Star throughout this pandemic, but Deakin University epidemiologist Catherine Bennett said NSW was taking a "fundamentally different" approach.
"It doesn't mean that if it works in NSW it will work everywhere, but it certainly tells us it is possible," she told The Age.
In announcing Sydney's latest public health measures to contain an outbreak of the Delta variant of the coronavirus, which spread from an eastern suburbs shopping centre, Premier Gladys Berejiklian and her Health Minister Brad Hazzard warned the situation was serious and fast evolving.
Yet, in rejecting the template adopted by other mainland states - where a handful of COVID-19 cases are met with a fast, hard and preferably short lockdown - Berejiklian is sticking to the philosophy that, so far, has separated NSW from the rest.
"We have always said we won't burden our citizens unless we absolutely have to," she said. "We ask people to make individual decision on their own circumstances. We have put these rules in place, there will always be exceptions, there will always be certain situations which, perhaps, every single health order doesn't cover. We rely on people's common sense as much as what the health orders say."
Instead of issuing public health directives to keep people in their homes and businesses and classrooms shut, the NSW government is urging its citizens to wear masks and avoid travelling to and from suburbs where they know the virus is circulating.
It is an appeal to reason, rather than a resort to heavy regulation.
University of Melbourne epidemiologist Tony Blakely, whose modelling influenced the Victorian government's response to last year's second wave, welcomed the NSW message. "They are trying to gain compliance by a sense of volunteering," he said
However, Professor Blakely questioned some of the NSW settings, describing as "bonkers" the permission for people to still go to gyms.
He is circumspect about what the ultimate lesson from Sydney will be.
"At this point in time, I would say the chance of NSW controlling this is a bit less than 50/50," he said. "If they achieve that, that will be great, but that doesn't prove this is the best decision-making.
"There is a chance they will succeed. If they succeed, that doesn't mean they got it right, they might have just been lucky.
"You would need to have this experiment another 10 times to confidently conclude they got it right. That is the conundrum with COVID."
Professor Blakely said a defining quality of COVID-19, as observed by infectious diseases experts around the world, is its "stochastic nature". The randomness with which some cases become highly infectious and some cases not at all makes the outcome of any outbreak difficult to predict.
The public health dilemma faced by all governments is whether to lock down early or risk having to do so later, for longer and at a greater cost, when an outbreak has spread beyond control.
Wellington was yesterday placed under level two pandemic restrictions after it was discovered that a Sydney tourist infected with the Delta strain visited the New Zealand capital.
On the same day, the Victorian government announced a further easing of restrictions from the lockdown imposed a month ago.
Professor Bennett noted the contrast in tone adopted by the NSW and Victorian governments at the start of their respective outbreaks.
Where both governments stressed the seriousness of the situation and highly infectious nature of the COVID-19 variant they were dealing with, NSW has backed people to do the right thing instead of issuing broad, public health directives to ensure they do.
Professor Bennett said the NSW approach was less prone to "punitory creep", where public health rules become more draconian as an outbreak worsens.
"This is public health communication 101," she says.
"The community is your public health intervention. You need leadership but you need participation."
The Berejiklian government is taking a significant gamble. If Professor Blakely is right, its odds are no better than a coin toss.
The only certainty is that, if Sydney wins, Victoria and all other states stand to benefit.

The secret death toll figure that left minister 'stunned'

Full text: The NSW government feared as many 25,000 people could have died from COVID-19 in the state, with worst-case scenario figures revealing what could have unfolded without drastic action.
Releasing the NSW Health modelling for the first time, Health Minister Brad Hazzard confirmed he and senior ministers were told last year that 24,768 people could die from the virus in 12 months.
The dire warning, which was provided to Mr Hazzard and other senior ministers on March 25 last year, was based on modelling from the overseas experience in China, Italy and the United Kingdom.
Premier Gladys Berejiklian announced a NSW lockdown three days earlier on March 22 but she and senior ministers in her crisis cabinet were then briefed on the potential death toll.
The modelling was revealed as Australia grapples with the delayed rollout of the COVID vaccine, which the federal government has said would be pushed back beyond the initial October deadline.
Mr Hazzard said 12 months ago NSW was facing its "biggest peacetime disaster" when he was told of the risks facing the state if it did not take swift and decisive action to halt the spread of the virus.
"We were told we faced a massive tsunami of possible deaths and the force of the numbers we were presented with sent shivers down our spines," Mr Hazzard said.
"I was just stunned, it was horrible. We had no guidebook and we had an evolving crisis."
Mr Hazzard said the government was also briefed on "many thousands" being in NSW hospitals, putting the health system under the same pressure as experienced in many overseas countries.
"Based on what we were being told, we substantially made the right decisions to go into a lockdown because we had to stop the chains of transmission before they got away from us," Mr Hazzard said.
Health secretary Elizabeth Koff said while extensive modelling was being undertaken nationally by the Doherty Institute, NSW also felt it was critical to have its own "bespoke modelling".
Ms Koff said "modelling is modelling" and assumptions were made, but regardless the 25,000 figure was "very sobering" and made the case that transmission had to be stopped as quickly as possible.
"The modelling showed us what could happen if we didn't take on social distancing and the lockdown to give us time to allow the health system to prepare to surge," Ms Koff said.
She said during the lockdown, the number of intensive care beds across the state was increased from 500 to 2000, a huge number of ventilators were procured and personal protective equipment was sourced in preparation for the worst-case scenario.
There have been 56 COVID deaths in NSW since the start of the pandemic, and 5141 cases.
Community transmission is under control in NSW, with no new cases in the 24 hours to 8pm on Saturday. However, there were six new cases in hotel quarantine.
There were 410 COVID-19 vaccines administered by NSW Health in the reporting period, taking the total number of vaccines administered by the state government to 151,535.
Yesterday, just over a year since NSW ministers and bureaucrats received the modelling, federal Health Minister Greg Hunt said there was not a single case of community transmission in Australia.
24,768

Full text: Family and friends of Gold Coast Titans cheerleader Breeana Robinson burst into tears in the public gallery when Magistrate Catherine Pirie on Friday sent the case to the Supreme Court.
The decision was made on the eighth anniversary of Ms Robinson’s death.
Moorea, formerly known as Daniel Shearin, is accused of throwing Ms Robinson from the balcony of the H20 building in Southport on January 29, 2013, and damaging evidence by destroying a mobile phone.
At the conclusion of the nine-day committal hearing in the Southport Magistrates Court, defence barrister Angus Edwards, instructed by Hannay Lawyers, said: “My position is that this matter is unlikely to have reasonable prospects at trial but that is not the test at the committal hearing.
“My position is that the evidence fits no more than that description – weak, tenuous and vague – and limps over that very low bar (to be committed to trial).”
Outside court, Ms Robinson’s aunty made a tearful statement to reporters.
“It’s been a long time coming,” she said.
“Eight years to the day.
“There is still another big step to go.
“I was her aunty, I was her friend and I was her boss at work.
“She was so young, she had so much to live for and it’s just all been taken away.”
She also read a statement from Ms Robinson’s mum Elaine Robinson and brother Matthew Robinson.
“After eight long years Bree’s mum Elaine and Bree’s brother Matthew would like to thank the police task force for all their work to get us to this outcome today,” she said.
“They especially want to thank family and friends for their overwhelming and unwavering support.
“Our grief and love for Bree bonds us forever.”
Ms Robinson’s cousin Edyn Mackney said her cousin was a “star”.
“When you think dance, pink flowers and everything girly you think of her,” she said.
“She was sweet and never had a bad word to say about anyone.”
Moorea’s lawyer Chris Hannay, of Hannay Lawyers, said it could take two years before the matter got to trial.
During the committal hearing, the court was told:
* Police initially ruled Ms Robinson’s death a suicide.
* A full investigation did not begin until the coroner looked at the file and ordered a full police investigation in 2017.
* A number of neighbours were not interviewed by police until five years later.
* A police officer who had an “odd and concerning” conversation with Moorea the night of Ms Robinson’s death made no notes of the conversation until 2018. The officer spent five hours that night guarding the crime scene at the pair’s apartment.
* Witness told different stories about how Mr Robinson landed – some say she was perpendicular, with her feet pointing to the building and her head towards the street, and others say she was parallel with the building.
* The key biomechanical expert for police found she was thrown from the building. But he had based his modelling on the evidence provided, which pointed to her landing parallel to the building.
* No modelling was done for what would happen if Ms Robinson had landed perpendicular to the building.
* Police prosecutor Gavin Reece told the court that without the modelling done on Ms Robinson landing perpendicular to the building he was still of the view there was “sufficient evidence” to put Moorea on trial.
* Ms Robinson had a strained relationship with her mother after a fight about whether she would go on a cruise with Moorea.
* Ms Robinson told her cousin she had been arguing with Moorea in the weeks leading up to her death.
The committal hearing was also told about how many neighbours heard arguing the night of Ms Robinson’s death. They said it was followed by a woman screaming “no” and a loud thud.
Ms Robinson’s aunt Janine Mackney did not miss a single day of the committal hearing, attending each day holding a single pink rose in honour of the 21-year-old niece’s favourite colour.
“Eight years later, as I keep saying, it’s just not good enough, our legal system is a joke,” she told reporters on the second day of the committal hearing.
“Five years later and they are only getting witness statements. You know, you have to do better, you’ve got to do better.”
During the hearing, Ms Mackney also released an emotional video showing how close the courthouse is to the H2O building where Ms Robinson died.
DAY EIGHT: COUSIN SAYS BREEANA TOLD HER ABOUT ARGUMENT
BREEANA Robinson told her cousin that she had been arguing with her boyfriend Jayden Moorea in the lead up to her death, a court has been told.
Moorea, previously known as Daniel Shearin, is accused of throwing Ms Robinson from his 11th-floor balcony in the H2O building in Southport on January 29, 2013.
Moorea is facing a committal hearing in the Southport Magistrates Court for one count each of murder and damaging evidence.
Bianca Robinson said she drove Breeana home from cheerleading training because Moorea had refused.
The Gold Coast Titans cheerleader was unable to drive as she was legally blind.
“On the way home Breeana and I had been chatting and she said over recent weeks they had been arguing as he was not used to having someone around and someone who relied on her that much,” Bianca said.
She told the court Moorea would drop her off to training but told her to get someone else to drive her home.
“Driving her home was an inconvenience so she was told to ask me,” she said.
Bianca, also a Titans cheerleader, said the night Breeana died she drove her home.
She said the pair chatted about a number of things including being estranged from family members.
The court was told Breeana and her mother Elaine Robinson had a strained relationship in the months leading up to her death.
Bianca told the court she had offered to let Breeana move in with her in October 2012 after her mother issued the ultimatum.
“My aunt Elaine just wanted Breeana to come home but to do so she couldn’t be with Dan,” she said.
Bianca told the court it was her understanding that Bianca and her mother had stopped talking.
Breeana moved in with Moorea in December 2012.
The hearing is expected to conclude on Friday.
Earlier in court, Ms Robinson’s mother said her daughter was unrecognisable in the months leading up to her death.
Elaine Robinson also spoke about how her daughter had been bullied throughout high school and primary school.
She gave evidence on Thursday morning with a screen obscuring Moorea from her view.
Elaine Robinson told the court she and Breeana Robinson had an argument in September or October 2012 which led to a strained relationship.
She said the argument had been because Breeana Robinson wanted to go on a cruise with Moorea.
Her mother had said she could not go.
Defence barrister Angus Edwards, instructed by Hannay Lawyers, asked Ms Robinson: “Her behaviour was not consistent with your daughter you knew and understood?”
Elaine Robinson replied: “Yep.”
The cheerleader moved out of her mother’s home not long after the argument to go live with her cousin.
Elaine Robinson said she never gave Breeana Robinson an ultimatum between herself and Moorea.
NED-2822-GCB-APP
She spoke about how she had only seen her daughter one or two times in the months before her death.
She described a time when she saw Breeana Robinson at work.
“When I saw her at work I told her I loved her and she told me that she loved me,” she said.
“When I left her I got a text from Dan saying don’t contact them.”
Elaine Robinson agreed her relationship with her daughter had been strained in the months leading up to her death.
She told the court that as a child Breeana Robinson had been bullied at school including being cut out of photos when graduating primary school.
Elaine Robinson said she agreed that Breeana Robinson was naive, did not have a lot of life experience and was sheltered for her age.
POLICE OFFICER SAYS MOOREA TOLD HIM HE SAW BREEANA ‘LEAPING OUT OF WINDOW’
A CRUISE ship crooner told police he saw his Gold Coast Titans cheerleader girlfriend “leaping out of the window” the night she fell to her death from a high rise balcony.
Jayden Moorea, previously known as Daniel Shearin, is accused of throwing Breeana Robinson from his 11th floor balcony in the H2O building in Southport on January 29, 2013.
Moorea is facing a committal hearing in the Southport Magistrates Court for one count each of murder and damaging evidence.
Gold Coast police Senior Constable Clifford Coetzee told the eighth day of the committal hearing he made notes that night as he spoke to Moorea.
Defence barrister Angus Edwards, instructed by Hannay Lawyers, said part of the reason Sen Const Coetzee had been called as a witness was to help decipher the handwriting in his notebook.
Sen Const Coetzee said the notes showed that Moorea had told him that he was in the master bedroom while Ms Robinson was in the spare.
FULL DIGITAL ACCESS: JUST $5 A MONTH FOR THE FIRST THREE MONTHS
“He said something like five seconds later he came out of main bedroom and saw her leaping out of the window,” he said.
Sen Const Coetzee said without the notes he would have difficulty recalling the conversation.
Last week Gold Coast police Senior Constable George Liasides told the committal hearing he had not taken notes during an “odd and concerning” conversation he had with Moorea the night of Ms Robinson’s death.
He did not record the conversation anywhere until five years after her death.
DAY SEVEN: CHEERLEADER’S TEAMMATES DESCRIBE DAYS BEFORE BALCONY DEATH
FORMER Gold Coast Titans cheerleaders have told a court about conversations with their teammate in the weeks leading up to her falling from an 11th floor balcony.
Breeana Robinson died after falling from a balcony at the H2O Building in Southport on January 29, 2013.
Her boyfriend Jayden Moorea, formerly known as Daniel Shearin, is accused of throwing her from the balcony.
Moorea is facing a committal hearing in the Southport Magistrates Court for murder and damaging evidence.
On the seventh day of the hearing on Wednesday more of Ms Robinson’s teammates gave evidence.
“We had lots of deep and meaningfuls about future and career,” former cheerleader Lauren Boyd told the court.
Ms Boyd said she did not talk to Ms Robinson about her relationship or family.
“Topics were career and sport so like dancing and what she wanted to do, yeah,” she said.
“Nothing personal about families or relationships, no not about that.”
She said they never spent time together outside of training and game days.
“She was very bubbly, always friends and always smiling,” she said.
“She wasn’t very loud and outgoing but she was always friendly when approached.”
Cheerleader Hayley Moulds said she thought Ms Robinson was becoming withdrawn.
“I remember her and Bianca having a quiet moment or talk the night of training before the incident,” she said.
“ … she was withdrawn, was withdrawing to someone she was close to.”
Another former cheerleader Stephanie Power said Ms Robinson was a “work friend”.
She told the court she declined the one time Ms Robinson had invited her to spend time together outside of the Titans.
Numerous cheerleaders have told the court they never spent any time with Ms Robinson outside of training or game day.
They also said they did not attend her 21st birthday party.
Earlier in the committal hearing the court was told that the night Ms Robinson died neighbours had heard arguing and a woman scream “no” before hearing a thud.
Some witnesses said her body landed parallel to the building while others said she landed perpendicular to the building.
DAY 6 – OUT OF SORTS’: TEAMMATE’S REGRET OVER COAST CHEERLEADER DEATH
A GOLD Coast Titans cheerleader said she wished she had asked teammate Breeana Robinson what was wrong during a training session hours before she died.
Ms Robinson died when she fell from a Southport high-rise balcony on January 29, 2013. Her boyfriend, ex-cruise ship crooner Jayden Moorea — formerly known as Dan Shearin — is facing a committal hearing in the Southport Magistrates Court for murder and damaging evidence.
It is alleged he threw her from the 11th-floor balcony of his apartment.
On the sixth day of the hearing on Monday, Ms Robinson’s former teammates gave evidence about what she was like at a training session the night she died.
Teammate Abi Lannoy said Ms Robinson seemed a “bit out of sorts”.
“When I turned around and saw her she seemed a little different, but we had a very hard warm up,” she said in a statement.
Ms Lannoy told the court she remembered thinking as she drove home that she wished she asked Ms Robinson what was wrong.
She said it also may have been because they were in the midst of a particularly hard training session.
Eight other cheerleaders gave evidence on Monday morning.
They all described Ms Robinson as quiet and said they did not socialise with her outside of cheerleader training, game days and events.
The women told the court they had not been invited to Ms Robinson’s 21st birthday party nor did they know of any one on the team who went.
“We trained together twice a week,” cheerleader Ashleigh Andrews said.
“She wasn’t really close friends with anyone in the group but she was in my dance group.”
Another cheerleader, Megan Grant, described Ms Robinson as “outspoken but not loud”.
“She was very sure of herself.”
The cheerleaders’ evidence came after an explosive first week of the committal hearing.
On Friday it was revealed a biomechanical expert had only been given one possible way Ms Robinson had landed after the fall – parallel to the building.
The positioning of her body had been controversial with some saying she landed parallel to the building and others saying she was perpendicular to the building.
Dr Zachariah Couper completed his report saying it was likely she was thrown from the building using the evidence he had – that she landed parallel to the building.
He told the court on Friday it was likely that if she landed perpendicular to the building she stepped back and fell, but he would need to do more modelling.
Magistrate Catherine Pirie gave the legal teams the weekend to determine if they needed Dr Couper to do a further report.
Police prosecutor Gavin Reece told the court on Monday that he had determined a further report from Dr Couper was not necessary.
During the first week of the committal hearing witnesses also told the court they heard arguing and a woman yelling “no” before a thud.
The hearing was adjourned until Wednesday.
DAY FIVE: DOUBT CAST OVER EXPERT REPORT
DOUBT has been cast over the expert report of a key witness in the committal hearing of a former cruise ship crooner accused of throwing his Gold Coast Titans cheerleader girlfriend from a high rise balcony.
Jayden Moorea, previously known as Dan Shearin, walked into the Southport Magistrates Court on Friday flanked by solicitor Chris Hannay and barrister Angus Edwards.
It is alleged Moorea threw Breeana Robinson from his balcony in the H20 building in Southport on January 29, 2013.
Biomechanical engineer Dr Zachariah Couper told the court he based his report on evidence he had been given.
That included that Breeana Robinson landed on a glass awning parallel to the H2O building.
During the committal hearing Dr Couper said he had not been made aware that security guard Gordon Cassidy had said he moved Ms Robinson about 90 degrees to give her medical treatment.
Dr Couper was also not aware that other witnesses had reported seeing her initially lying perpendicular to the building.
He was asked whether the change in body position would mean it was likely Ms Robinson had been thrown from the balcony.
“It would make it more likely that there was a step back and a fall,” he said.
Dr Couper stressed that he would need to do more modelling of the changed body position before he could give a definitive answer.
Magistrate Catherine Pirie said it made sense for Dr Couper to be allowed more time to do more complete modelling.
“The court has heard other evidence and the witness has said he will need to go back and reconsider the modelling and wants to give some thought to the report or what opinion he might have with other information,” she said.
“I am just wondering about whether there needs to be an adjournment for further modelling having regard to further evidence.”
Police prosecutor Gavin Reece and Moorea’s defence team will take the weekend to determine if Dr Couper should be given more time to do modelling of all the evidence.
Ms Robinson’s aunt Janine Mackney declined to comment as she was too upset.
They will make a determination when the hearing continues on Monday.
POLICE OFFICER TELLS COURT MOOREA SPOKE OF FIGHT WITH GIRLFRIEND
A former cruise ship crooner told a police officer he had a fight with his Gold Coast Titans cheerleader girlfriend the night she fell from a high-rise balcony, a court was told.
But the officer, who said he had a “concerning and odd” conversation with Jayden Moorea, did not make any notes or recordings until five years later.
Moorea, previously known as Daniel Shearin, is accused of throwing Breeana Robinson from his 11th floor balcony in the H20 building in Southport on January 29, 2013.
Moorea is facing a committal hearing in the Southport Magistrates Court for one count each of murder and damaging evidence.
Gold Coast police officer Senior Constable George Liasides told the court he had a number of conversations with Moorea the night Ms Robinson died.
“The conversation with him stating they had a fight happened within the unit,” he said.
Sen Const Liasides said he did not ask Moorea if he meant a verbal or physical fight.
The court was told Sen Const Liasides gave a statement in 2015 but did not mention the conversation until 2018.
The statement in 2018 included details of conversations between Sen Liasides and Moorea, the court was told.
FULL DIGITAL ACCESS: JUST $5 A MONTH FOR THE FIRST THREE MONTHS
Sen Const Liasides said he did not record the conversation or make notes following the conversation.
“My greatest regret in my career is not having a digital recording,” he said.
“Things that were said and stuck with me.”
Sen Const Liasides said he did not make any notes of the conversation until he made the statement in April 2018 – about five years later.
He denied he was “reconstructing” a conversation but did not have any explanation as to why he did not make any notes.
DAY FOUR: COURT HEARS DETAILS OF BREEANA’S INJURIES
A GOLD Coast Titans cheerleader most likely landed on her back with her head turned to the right after falling from a high-rise building, an expert has told a court.
Jayden Moorea, previously known as Daniel Shearin, is accused of throwing Breeana Robinson from his 11th floor balcony in the H2O building in Southport on January 29, 2013.
Moorea is facing a committal hearing in the Southport Magistrates Court for one count each of murder and damaging evidence.

On the fourth day of the committal hearing Dr Dianne Little, who performed the autopsy, said a majority of the injuries she found on Ms Robinson were likely to be related to the fall.
She some there were some rib fractures which were likely to be related to CPR.
Dr Little also told the court the injuries Ms Robinson received meant it was likely Ms Robinson landed perpendicular to the building.
The court was told Ms Robinson had “tram track” like injuries on her right arm and left calf.
Barrister Angus Edwards, instructed by Hannay Lawyers, asked her if the most likely way Ms Robinson landed to get those injuries would be perpendicular to the building.
Dr Little agreed due to the way some metal strips were positions on the glass.
The court was told Ms Robinson also had significant cuts and bruising on the right side of her face and head.
Mr Edwards asked if it was likely Ms Robinson landed on her back with her head turned to the right.
“That would explain those injuries,” Dr Little replied.
Ms Robinson also had a mark on her throat as well, the court was told.
Dr Little said it was likely that injury was caused when paramedics were trying to resuscitate her.
She said there were no injuries consistent with Ms Robinson being choked.
The doctor who examined Moorea on the night Ms Robinson fell to her death said she only found one injury on his body.
Dr Christine Mirakian said she saw a small cut on Moorea’s right middle finger near the knuckle.
She described it as a 1cm by 0.5cm area of redness with a small cut on the top which was already starting the scab.
“It (the scab) wasn’t something that had occurred within likely just a couple of hours,” she said.
Dr Mirakian said she saw Moorea about 2.30am the morning after Ms Robinson died and it was “likely” the cut had occurred at least 24 hours before she saw Moorea.
She said it was also likely it may have been from psoriasis.
Police scenes of crime officer Senior Sergeant Leon Wort said that four prints were found on the balcony railing in Moorea and Ms Robinson’s apartment.
Two belonged to Moorea and one belonged to Ms Robinson and the fourth has not been identified, the court was told.
Mr Edwards questioned Sen Sgt Wort about the other markings found on the railing which could not be identified.
“Is it the case you are unable to say whether someone climbed over that railing,” Mr Edwards asked.
“That’s correct,” Sen Sgt Wort replied.
Mr Edwards then asked: “They may have, they may not have.”
Sen Sgt Wort replied: “That’s right.”
Forensic specialist Cassie Thompson told the court she examined the clothes Ms Robinson was wearing – a top, a pair of shorts and underwear.
She told the court there were numerous small “severances” in the back of all the clothes.
She said she also found glass in the top and shorts.
Fingerprint expert Sergeant Alicia Finigan said the unidentifiable mark was a hand print but it was unclear who it was from.
“It’s an impression of a hand but here is not enough detail in order to make any other impression,” she said
Sgt Finigan said the print from Ms Robinson was from her palm with it turned at an angle on the top of the railing.
The hearing will continue on Friday with five witnesses, including a biomechanical expert.
HARROWING DETAIL ADDING TO GRIEF OF FAMILY
THE aunt of a Gold Coast Titans cheerleader who fell to her death has revealed her pain at attending court each day.
Breeana Robinson died after falling from the H2O building in Southport on January 29, 2013.
Her former boyfriend, cruise ship crooner Jayden Moorea, previously known as Daniel Shearin, is facing a committal hearing the Southport Magistrates Court for one count each of murder and damaging evidence.
It is alleged he threw her from the balcony.
Janine Mackney, aunt of Breeana Robinson, talks about returning to Gold Coast's Southport courthouse in the committal hearing of alleged killer Jayden Moorea.
Ms Robinson’s aunt posted to Facebook a short clip of why attending court each day is so hard.
In the clip she stands in a car park across the road from the court, films the court building before turning the camera to show the H2O building nearby.
“Let me share with your all one of the hard things about being here,” she says in a teary voice.
“That’s the building where she died. It’s very hard to be in this area.”
Ms Mackney has been attending court each day of the committal hearing carrying a pink rose.
Pink was Ms Robinson’s favourite colours.
She has been supported by her daughters.
FOUR YEARS TO GET A STATEMENT
POLICE took almost four years to get a statement from one of the paramedics who helped treat Breeana Robinson the night she fell to her death from a high-rise, a court has been told.
Jayden Moorea, previously known as Daniel Shearin, is accused of throwing the Gold Coast Titans cheerleader from his 11th-floor balcony in the H20 building in Southport on January 29, 2013.
Moorea is facing a committal hearing in the Southport Magistrates Court for one count each of murder and damaging evidence.
Paramedic Andrew Busby told the court on day three of the hearing that he provided his statement in July 2017.
Mr Busby said when he arrived at the scene other paramedics were already trying to save Ms Robinson.
“When we approached her body she was laying on her back,” he said.
“She was quite precariously close to the edge so we had to move her back so we could treat her.”
FULL DIGITAL ACCESS: JUST $5 A MONTH FOR THE FIRST THREE MONTHS
Mr Busby said the could not recall any further details about how she was lying.
Throughout the first two days of the committal hearing a number of witnesses have told the court their first statement to police was not until 2017 or 2018.
The positioning of her body has also been controversial with some saying she was perpendicular to the building and others saying she was parallel to the building. Others had no clear recollection.
Paramedic Dean Gamblin told the court they moved Ms Robinson further away form the edge of the glass when they arrived.
He said she was lying in a position parallel to the building.
“I believe that she was in the very similar position so we haven’t changed the angle as such,” she said.
Mr Gamblin said he could not comment is she had been moved before paramedics arrived.
He told the court as paramedics worked on her a firefighter came to assist but the glass began to move.
Mr Gamblin said he could not remember if Ms Robinson had any marks on her face or throat.
“It was dark and the lighting was quite poor,” he said.
H20 resident Ashlee Horvath told the court she was lying on her couch looking out of the balcony when she heard a scream.
“I heard a scream and saw a woman’s body go past,” she said.
Ms Horvath said she saw Ms Robinson’s feet go past, followed by her head.
She told the court the body was not quite straight up and down.
“It was a split second thing,” she said.
“I looked up and went ‘oh my gosh is that what I thought I saw’.
“I heard the loud bang and saw she landed on the glass petition under my balcony.”
Moorea’s former boss Jacqueline Lowein told the court Moorea sounded “scattered and disjointed” when he left a number of voicemail messages for her the night Ms Robinson died.
“He was saying something like ‘oh my God, Jac, Bree’s jumped and thrown herself off the balcony’,” she said.
Ms Lowein said she was working as a travel manager at Travel by Wyndham at the time.
She said she exchanged voicemails with Moorea that night but they never actually managed to speak.
“He was just very scattered, as you would be,” she said.
Defence barrister Angus Edwards, instructed by Hannay Lawyers, asked what Ms Lowein meant when she said in her statement that Moorea did not sound very genuine.
“It just sounded odd … I just remember thinking it was odd,” she said.
Ms Lowein said she thought Moorea sounded upset and at times could hear him crying.
Moorea also told her he was not going to come into work.
The committal hearing will continue on Thursday when forensic experts are expected to take the stand.

AUNT SLAMS LEGAL SYSTEM
THE aunt of a Gold Coast Titans cheerleader who fell to her death from an 11th floor balcony has slammed the legal system for taking so long to hear the case.
Breeana Robinson died after falling from the H20 building in Southport on January 29, 2013.
Her boyfriend cruise ship crooner Jayden Moorea, previously known as Daniel Shearin, is facing a committal hearing the Southport Magistrates Court for one count each of murder and damaging evidence.
It is alleged he threw her from the balcony.
In the first two days of the committal hearing the court has heard from a number of witnesses who did not give their first police statement until 2018 – more than five years after Ms Robinson’s death.
Ms Robinson’s aunt Janine Mackney spoke outside court on Tuesday saying she was upset by the delay.
“Eight years later as I keep saying, It’s just not good enough, our legal system is a joke,” she said.
Janine Mackney, aunt of former Gold Coast Titans cheerleader Breeana Robinson, who fell to her death in 2013.
“Five years later and they are only getting witness statements. You know, you have to do better, you’ve got to do better.”
Ms Mackney became emotional when asked what kept her coming to court each day.
“I made a promise. She was my niece,” she said.
“Someone has to be here for her. I think it’s good that, you know, Dan’s expecting that. I’m never going to give up.”
Mr Robinson said she was reassured by multiple witnesses saying they heard the same thing – about 15 minutes of arguing before a scream.
The hearing continues.
EARLIER
A NEIGHBOUR heard loud voices before a thump the night a Gold Coast Titans cheerleader fell to death from a high-rise balcony, a court was told.
Jayden Moorea, previously known as Daniel Shearin, is accused of throwing Breeana Robinson from his 11th-floor balcony in the H20 building in Southport on January 29, 2013.
Moorea is facing a committal hearing in the Southport Magistrates Court for one count each of murder and damaging evidence.
On the second day of the hearing on Tuesday neighbour Rebecca Adams, who lived on the 18th floor, said she heard loud noises while in her bedroom.
“I thought they were coming from the street,” she said.
“I can’t say how far away the voices were but they were loud enough for me to appreciate from my bedroom.”
Dr Adams said she then heard a thump but she could not say if the loud voices continued up until the thump.
She said she was not sure if they continued after the thump as there was a lot of other noise of people in the building talking.
“I recall the body lying parallel to the building and the head was on the left and legs on the right and I remember that specifically … I could see blood coming out of the head,” she said.
Dr Adams first made a statement to police in June 2018 – more than five years after Mr Robinson’s death.
A neighbour who lived on the same floor as Jayden Moorea and Breeana Robinson described how she heard a man and woman loudly arguing before Ms Robinson fell to her death.
Julie Carroll said: “I heard an argument for at least 15 minutes … I could hear the man’s loud yelling and the woman was crying.”
Ms Carroll said the arguing stopped and she later heard a scream.
She could not recall how long it was between the arguing stopping and the scream.
Defence barrister Angus Edwards, instructed by Hannay Lawyers, showed Ms Carroll Facebook conversations she had the night Ms Robinson died.
In the messages Ms Carroll said she did not hear screaming.
“I meant I didn’t hear screams after it had happened,” she said.
“If I knew someone who fell from a balcony I would be screaming.”
Allan Walker, who lived on the seventh floor, said he was out on the balcony and heard a “swishing noise” before someone said ‘Oh, no’.”
Mr Walker said he then saw Ms Robinson fall past him.
“She was parallel (to the building) as she went past,” he said.
Mr Walker said when he saw her body on the glass awning her head was closer to the street and her feet were pointing to the building.
He said she appeared to be wearing a black bra and underwear and had landed on her back with her right hand twisted under her and her legs apart.
H20 resident Emily Turner, who lived on the eighth floor, said she heard arguing before a period of silence and then she heard a thump.
“(The silence was) no more than a minute,” she said.
Ms Turner said it was possible she had fallen back to sleep during the period of silence between the arguing and the thump.
She told the court when she looked out over the balcony she saw Ms Robinson’s body perpendicular to the building.
Moorea’s next door neighbour Lisa Dunscombe was in the lift with the Moorea as they went to got see Ms Robinson immediately after she had fallen.
She told the court he seemed upset.
Ms Dunscombe said she left her apartment after hearing the thump and seeing Bree on the awning.
She said she saw Moorea coming out with his phone in one hand and doing up his pants.
Ms Dunscombe told the court she and her partner got into the lift with Moorea to go down to see what happened. Moorea told the pair it was his girlfriend he caused the thud.
“He said something about his ‘beautiful Bree’ and his exact words I can’t remember and him saying ‘he could have done more’,” she said.
Ms Dunscombe said she did not remember hearing any arguing or screaming the night Ms Robinson fell.
“I know there was no screaming and there was no noise and there was no previous arguing,” she said.
Ms Dunscombe told the court when she saw Bree’s body from under the awning she was on her back, her arms out at about a 45 degree angle and parallel to the building.
She said she had a conversation that night with Moorea after he came down from the balcony.
Ms Dunscombe told the court that Moorea said to her: “I could have helped her and I could have saved her.
“I could have loved her more.”

TRIPLE 0 CALLS
TWO Triple 0 calls Jayden Moorea made the night his former Gold Coast Titans cheerleader girlfriend fell from a Southport tower has been played to court.
Moorea, formerly Dan Shearin, is facing a committal hearing the in the Southport Magistrates Court on charges of murder and damaging evidence.
It is alleged Moorea threw Breeana Robinson from his balcony in the H20 building in Southport on January 29, 2013.
During the first day of proceedings, the court was played a recording of a Triple 0 call Moorea made the night Ms Robinson died.
“We are down in the foyer, she has landed on the glass,” Moorea said in the recording.
He was asked if she was breathing.
“No, I don’t know, we can’t get up to her,” he said.
Moorea is also heard asking for a ladder.
Former H20 security guard Gordon Cassidy told the court he heard the fall and saw Ms Robinson on the glass.
He said he, another man and Moorea all got up to the awning where Ms Robinson was lying.
Mr Cassidy said she was breathing and he moved her so she was no longer on the broken glass so he could perform first aid.
The downstairs neighbour of Moorea and Ms Robinson said she heard the pair fighting before the cheerleader fell from the balcony.
Mieke Pearce said she does not remember how long it was between the arguing stopping and hearing Ms Robinson scream.
“I just feel like it all happened very quickly. From the memory I have now it all happened one after the other,” she said.
Ms Pearce told the court she heard a woman scream and “yell out no”.
The court was told Ms Pearce had moved into the unit five days earlier and had heard the pair argue two or three times.
Ms Pearce’s partner Ben Pearce told the court he remembered there being a distinct period of time between hearing the arguing and the scream.
He said could not remember the time period but agreed it could be up to 30 minutes between the arguing and scream.
FULL DIGITAL ACCESS: JUST $5 A MONTH FOR THE FIRST THREE MONTHS
Defence barrister Angus Edwards, instructed by Hannay Lawyers, asked a number of witnesses about the position Ms Robinson was in when they saw her after the fall and before someone was able to get onto the awning to help her.
Three witness have said she was perpendicular to the building.
H20 resident Edward Wu, who lived on the ninth floor, said he remembers seeing Ms Robinson lying parallel to the building.
“All I can say is she was facing down … I don’t know whether her feet were closer to the edge of the building,” he said.
A second Triple 0 call made by Moorea has been played to the court where he told operators his girlfriend had climbed over the balcony.
“I went into the bedroom and she just ran onto the balcony and she has gone over the balcony,” he is heard saying on the call.
Moorea made the call prior to going downstairs and prior to the Triple 0 call played to the Southport Magistrates Court earlier on Monday.
His voice sounds high and he spoke in rushed tones.
The Triple 0 operator had to ask him a number of times to repeat information which could not be understood.
Next-door neighbour Alfred Schmetzer told the court he ran out into the hall after he heard a thud.
He said he saw Moorea coming out of this apartment on the phone and using one hand to put on pants.
Mr Schmetzer said his recollection as that Moorea was “focused and calm”.
A H20 resident told the court she heard Mr Robinson scream “no, no” as she feel from her balcony.
Georgina Hadid told the Southport Magistrates Court she also saw Ms Robinson falling past her fourth level balcony for a “split second”.
“She was flat on her back facing towards the sky,” she said.
Ms Hadid first gave a statement to police in November 2018 – five and a half years after Ms Robinson’s death.
She said she later saw Moorea out on the balcony while a security guard and her husband Badawi Hadid tried to help Ms Robinson.
“At one stage I did see him on the awning and he never touched her and never helped her,” she said.
“What I recall is him saying ‘Bree, I’m here for your Bree’ … no emotion, no nothing.”
Ms Hadid said she saw this from her fourth floor balcony.
MOOREA FLANKED BY LAWYERS AS HE ARRIVES AT COURT
A CRUISE ship crooner accused of murdering his Gold Coast Titans cheerleader ex-girlfriend has arrived at court for a committal hearing flanked by his lawyers.
Jayden Moorea, previously known as Dan Shearin, walked into the Southport Magistrates Court on Monday accompanied by solicitor Chris Hannay and barrister Angus Edwards.
It is alleged Moorea threw Breeana Robinson from his balcony in the H20 building in Southport on January 29, 2013.
Moorea was not charged until January 2019.
The group was stopped at the courthouse doors by security asking if they had been in Brisbane in the past 21 days.
Security provided the group with masks and asked them to wear them in the premises.
More than 70 witnesses are expected to give evidence in the committal hearing over the next two weeks.
Witnesses called will include experts, cheerleaders and police officers.
The hearing will determine if there is enough evidence for Moorea to stand trial.
Ms Robinson’s aunt Janine Mackney and another friend of Ms Robinson are in the courtroom waiting for proceedings to start, both holding a pink rose.
Moorea, who was released on bail not long after he was charged, has a clothing line – C.R. U. I. S. E – Can’t Rest Until I Sail Everywhere.
The apparel is sold on Moorea’s website – jdmoorea.com – where he describes himself as an “author, photographer and performance coach”.
In a court hearing in November 2019 a portion of the triple-0 call was read aloud.
“I need an ambulance, please, my girlfriend has just climbed over the balcony … I went into the bedroom and saw her climb over the balcony … she had threatened to do this before,” Moorea is alleged to have said on the call.
NED-2822-GCB-APP
The committal hearing is expected to focus on what happened in the lead-up to Ms Robinson’s death and what happened in Moorea’s apartment before her fall.
Evidence from biomechanical experts is expected to shed further light on what happened that night.

Full text: Ms Robinson died when she fell from a Southport high-rise balcony on January 29, 2013. Her boyfriend, ex-cruise ship crooner Jayden Moorea — formerly known as Dan Shearin — is facing a committal hearing in the Southport Magistrates Court for murder and damaging evidence.
It is alleged he threw her from the 11th-floor balcony of his apartment.
On the sixth day of the hearing on Monday, Ms Robinson’s former teammates gave evidence about what she was like at a training session the night she died.
Teammate Abi Lannoy said Ms Robinson seemed a “bit out of sorts”.
“When I turned around and saw her she seemed a little different, but we had a very hard warm up,” she said in a statement.
Ms Lannoy told the court she remembered thinking as she drove home that she wished she asked Ms Robinson what was wrong.
She said it also may have been because they were in the midst of a particularly hard training session.
Eight other cheerleaders gave evidence on Monday morning.
They all described Ms Robinson as quiet and said they did not socialise with her outside of cheerleader training, game days and events.
The women told the court they had not been invited to Ms Robinson’s 21st birthday party nor did they know of any one on the team who went.
“We trained together twice a week,” cheerleader Ashleigh Andrews said.
“She wasn’t really close friends with anyone in the group but she was in my dance group.”
Another cheerleader, Megan Grant, described Ms Robinson as “outspoken but not loud”.
“She was very sure of herself.”
The cheerleaders’ evidence came after an explosive first week of the committal hearing.
On Friday it was revealed a biomechanical expert had only been given one possible way Ms Robinson had landed after the fall – parallel to the building.
The positioning of her body had been controversial with some saying she landed parallel to the building and others saying she was perpendicular to the building.
Dr Zachariah Couper completed his report saying it was likely she was thrown from the building using the evidence he had – that she landed parallel to the building.
He told the court on Friday it was likely that if she landed perpendicular to the building she stepped back and fell, but he would need to do more modelling.
Magistrate Catherine Pirie gave the legal teams the weekend to determine if they needed Dr Couper to do a further report.
Police prosecutor Gavin Reece told the court on Monday that he had determined a further report from Dr Couper was not necessary.
During the first week of the committal hearing witnesses also told the court they heard arguing and a woman yelling “no” before a thud.
The hearing was adjourned until Wednesday.
FRIDAY: Day five in committal hearing
DOUBT has been cast over the expert report of a key witness in the committal hearing of a former cruise ship crooner accused of throwing his Gold Coast Titans cheerleader girlfriend from a high rise balcony.
Jayden Moorea, previously known as Dan Shearin, walked into the Southport Magistrates Court on Friday flanked by solicitor Chris Hannay and barrister Angus Edwards.
It is alleged Moorea threw Breeana Robinson from his balcony in the H20 building in Southport on January 29, 2013.
Biomechanical engineer Dr Zachariah Couper told the court he based his report on evidence he had been given.
That included that Breeana Robinson landed on a glass awning parallel to the H2O building.
During the committal hearing Dr Couper said he had not been made aware that security guard Gordon Cassidy had said he moved Ms Robinson about 90 degrees to give her medical treatment.
Dr Couper was also not aware that other witnesses had reported seeing her initially lying perpendicular to the building.
He was asked whether the change in body position would mean it was likely Ms Robinson had been thrown from the balcony.
“It would make it more likely that there was a step back and a fall,” he said.
Dr Couper stressed that he would need to do more modelling of the changed body position before he could give a definitive answer.
Magistrate Catherine Pirie said it made sense for Dr Couper to be allowed more time to do more complete modelling.
“The court has heard other evidence and the witness has said he will need to go back and reconsider the modelling and wants to give some thought to the report or what opinion he might have with other information,” she said.
“I am just wondering about whether there needs to be an adjournment for further modelling having regard to further evidence.”
Police prosecutor Gavin Reece and Moorea’s defence team will take the weekend to determine if Dr Couper should be given more time to do modelling of all the evidence.
Ms Robinson’s aunt Janine Mackney declined to comment as she was too upset.
They will make a determination when the hearing continues on Monday.
POLICE OFFICER TELLS COURT MOOREA SPOKE OF FIGHT WITH GIRLFRIEND
A former cruise ship crooner told a police officer he had a fight with his Gold Coast Titans cheerleader girlfriend the night she fell from a high-rise balcony, a court was told.
But the officer, who said he had a “concerning and odd” conversation with Jayden Moorea, did not make any notes or recordings until five years later.
Moorea, previously known as Daniel Shearin, is accused of throwing Breeana Robinson from his 11th floor balcony in the H20 building in Southport on January 29, 2013.
Moorea is facing a committal hearing in the Southport Magistrates Court for one count each of murder and damaging evidence.
Gold Coast police officer Senior Constable George Liasides told the court he had a number of conversations with Moorea the night Ms Robinson died.
“The conversation with him stating they had a fight happened within the unit,” he said.
Sen Const Liasides said he did not ask Moorea if he meant a verbal or physical fight.
The court was told Sen Const Liasides gave a statement in 2015 but did not mention the conversation until 2018.
The statement in 2018 included details of conversations between Sen Liasides and Moorea, the court was told.

Sen Const Liasides said he did not record the conversation or make notes following the conversation.
“My greatest regret in my career is not having a digital recording,” he said.
“Things that were said and stuck with me.”
Sen Const Liasides said he did not make any notes of the conversation until he made the statement in April 2018 – about five years later.
He denied he was “reconstructing” a conversation but did not have any explanation as to why he did not make any notes.
DAY FOUR: COURT HEARS DETAILS OF BREEANA’S INJURIES
A GOLD Coast Titans cheerleader most likely landed on her back with her head turned to the right after falling from a high-rise building, an expert has told a court.
Jayden Moorea, previously known as Daniel Shearin, is accused of throwing Breeana Robinson from his 11th floor balcony in the H2O building in Southport on January 29, 2013.
Moorea is facing a committal hearing in the Southport Magistrates Court for one count each of murder and damaging evidence.

On the fourth day of the committal hearing Dr Dianne Little, who performed the autopsy, said a majority of the injuries she found on Ms Robinson were likely to be related to the fall.
She some there were some rib fractures which were likely to be related to CPR.
Dr Little also told the court the injuries Ms Robinson received meant it was likely Ms Robinson landed perpendicular to the building.
The court was told Ms Robinson had “tram track” like injuries on her right arm and left calf.
Barrister Angus Edwards, instructed by Hannay Lawyers, asked her if the most likely way Ms Robinson landed to get those injuries would be perpendicular to the building.
Dr Little agreed due to the way some metal strips were positions on the glass.
The court was told Ms Robinson also had significant cuts and bruising on the right side of her face and head.
Mr Edwards asked if it was likely Ms Robinson landed on her back with her head turned to the right.
“That would explain those injuries,” Dr Little replied.
Ms Robinson also had a mark on her throat as well, the court was told.
Dr Little said it was likely that injury was caused when paramedics were trying to resuscitate her.
She said there were no injuries consistent with Ms Robinson being choked.
The doctor who examined Moorea on the night Ms Robinson fell to her death said she only found one injury on his body.
Dr Christine Mirakian said she saw a small cut on Moorea’s right middle finger near the knuckle.
She described it as a 1cm by 0.5cm area of redness with a small cut on the top which was already starting the scab.
“It (the scab) wasn’t something that had occurred within likely just a couple of hours,” she said.
Dr Mirakian said she saw Moorea about 2.30am the morning after Ms Robinson died and it was “likely” the cut had occurred at least 24 hours before she saw Moorea.
She said it was also likely it may have been from psoriasis.
Police scenes of crime officer Senior Sergeant Leon Wort said that four prints were found on the balcony railing in Moorea and Ms Robinson’s apartment.
Two belonged to Moorea and one belonged to Ms Robinson and the fourth has not been identified, the court was told.
Mr Edwards questioned Sen Sgt Wort about the other markings found on the railing which could not be identified.
“Is it the case you are unable to say whether someone climbed over that railing,” Mr Edwards asked.
“That’s correct,” Sen Sgt Wort replied.
Mr Edwards then asked: “They may have, they may not have.”
Sen Sgt Wort replied: “That’s right.”
Forensic specialist Cassie Thompson told the court she examined the clothes Ms Robinson was wearing - a top, a pair of shorts and underwear.
She told the court there were numerous small “severances” in the back of all the clothes.
She said she also found glass in the top and shorts.
Fingerprint expert Sergeant Alicia Finigan said the unidentifiable mark was a hand print but it was unclear who it was from.
“It’s an impression of a hand but here is not enough detail in order to make any other impression,” she said
Sgt Finigan said the print from Ms Robinson was from her palm with it turned at an angle on the top of the railing.
The hearing will continue on Friday with five witnesses, including a biomechanical expert.
HARROWING DETAIL ADDING TO GRIEF OF FAMILY
THE aunt of a Gold Coast Titans cheerleader who fell to her death has revealed her pain at attending court each day.
Breeana Robinson died after falling from the H2O building in Southport on January 29, 2013.
Her former boyfriend, cruise ship crooner Jayden Moorea, previously known as Daniel Shearin, is facing a committal hearing the Southport Magistrates Court for one count each of murder and damaging evidence.
It is alleged he threw her from the balcony.
Janine Mackney, aunt of Breeana Robinson, talks about returning to Gold Coast's Southport courthouse in the committal hearing of alleged killer Jayden Moorea.
Ms Robinson’s aunt posted to Facebook a short clip of why attending court each day is so hard.
In the clip she stands in a car park across the road from the court, films the court building before turning the camera to show the H2O building nearby.
“Let me share with your all one of the hard things about being here,” she says in a teary voice.
“That’s the building where she died. It’s very hard to be in this area.”
Ms Mackney has been attending court each day of the committal hearing carrying a pink rose.
Pink was Ms Robinson’s favourite colours.
She has been supported by her daughters.
FOUR YEARS TO GET A STATEMENT
POLICE took almost four years to get a statement from one of the paramedics who helped treat Breeana Robinson the night she fell to her death from a high-rise, a court has been told.
Jayden Moorea, previously known as Daniel Shearin, is accused of throwing the Gold Coast Titans cheerleader from his 11th-floor balcony in the H20 building in Southport on January 29, 2013.
Moorea is facing a committal hearing in the Southport Magistrates Court for one count each of murder and damaging evidence.
Paramedic Andrew Busby told the court on day three of the hearing that he provided his statement in July 2017.
Mr Busby said when he arrived at the scene other paramedics were already trying to save Ms Robinson.
“When we approached her body she was laying on her back,” he said.
“She was quite precariously close to the edge so we had to move her back so we could treat her.”

Mr Busby said the could not recall any further details about how she was lying.
Throughout the first two days of the committal hearing a number of witnesses have told the court their first statement to police was not until 2017 or 2018.
The positioning of her body has also been controversial with some saying she was perpendicular to the building and others saying she was parallel to the building. Others had no clear recollection.
Paramedic Dean Gamblin told the court they moved Ms Robinson further away form the edge of the glass when they arrived.
He said she was lying in a position parallel to the building.
“I believe that she was in the very similar position so we haven’t changed the angle as such,” she said.
Mr Gamblin said he could not comment is she had been moved before paramedics arrived.
He told the court as paramedics worked on her a firefighter came to assist but the glass began to move.
Mr Gamblin said he could not remember if Ms Robinson had any marks on her face or throat.
“It was dark and the lighting was quite poor,” he said.
H20 resident Ashlee Horvath told the court she was lying on her couch looking out of the balcony when she heard a scream.
“I heard a scream and saw a woman’s body go past,” she said.
Ms Horvath said she saw Ms Robinson’s feet go past, followed by her head.
She told the court the body was not quite straight up and down.
“It was a split second thing,” she said.
“I looked up and went ‘oh my gosh is that what I thought I saw’.
“I heard the loud bang and saw she landed on the glass petition under my balcony.”
Moorea’s former boss Jacqueline Lowein told the court Moorea sounded “scattered and disjointed” when he left a number of voicemail messages for her the night Ms Robinson died.
“He was saying something like ‘oh my God, Jac, Bree’s jumped and thrown herself off the balcony’,” she said.
Ms Lowein said she was working as a travel manager at Travel by Wyndham at the time.
She said she exchanged voicemails with Moorea that night but they never actually managed to speak.
“He was just very scattered, as you would be,” she said.
Defence barrister Angus Edwards, instructed by Hannay Lawyers, asked what Ms Lowein meant when she said in her statement that Moorea did not sound very genuine.
“It just sounded odd … I just remember thinking it was odd,” she said.
Ms Lowein said she thought Moorea sounded upset and at times could hear him crying.
Moorea also told her he was not going to come into work.
The committal hearing will continue on Thursday when forensic experts are expected to take the stand.

AUNT SLAMS LEGAL SYSTEM
THE aunt of a Gold Coast Titans cheerleader who fell to her death from an 11th floor balcony has slammed the legal system for taking so long to hear the case.
Breeana Robinson died after falling from the H20 building in Southport on January 29, 2013.
Her boyfriend cruise ship crooner Jayden Moorea, previously known as Daniel Shearin, is facing a committal hearing the Southport Magistrates Court for one count each of murder and damaging evidence.
It is alleged he threw her from the balcony.
In the first two days of the committal hearing the court has heard from a number of witnesses who did not give their first police statement until 2018 – more than five years after Ms Robinson’s death.
Ms Robinson’s aunt Janine Mackney spoke outside court on Tuesday saying she was upset by the delay.
“Eight years later as I keep saying, It’s just not good enough, our legal system is a joke,” she said.
Janine Mackney, aunt of former Gold Coast Titans cheerleader Breeana Robinson, who fell to her death in 2013.
“Five years later and they are only getting witness statements. You know, you have to do better, you’ve got to do better.”
Ms Mackney became emotional when asked what kept her coming to court each day.
“I made a promise. She was my niece,” she said.
“Someone has to be here for her. I think it’s good that, you know, Dan’s expecting that. I’m never going to give up.”
Mr Robinson said she was reassured by multiple witnesses saying they heard the same thing – about 15 minutes of arguing before a scream.
The hearing continues.
EARLIER
A NEIGHBOUR heard loud voices before a thump the night a Gold Coast Titans cheerleader fell to death from a high-rise balcony, a court was told.
Jayden Moorea, previously known as Daniel Shearin, is accused of throwing Breeana Robinson from his 11th-floor balcony in the H20 building in Southport on January 29, 2013.
Moorea is facing a committal hearing in the Southport Magistrates Court for one count each of murder and damaging evidence.
On the second day of the hearing on Tuesday neighbour Rebecca Adams, who lived on the 18th floor, said she heard loud noises while in her bedroom.
“I thought they were coming from the street,” she said.
“I can’t say how far away the voices were but they were loud enough for me to appreciate from my bedroom.”
Dr Adams said she then heard a thump but she could not say if the loud voices continued up until the thump.
She said she was not sure if they continued after the thump as there was a lot of other noise of people in the building talking.
“I recall the body lying parallel to the building and the head was on the left and legs on the right and I remember that specifically … I could see blood coming out of the head,” she said.
Dr Adams first made a statement to police in June 2018 – more than five years after Mr Robinson’s death.
A neighbour who lived on the same floor as Jayden Moorea and Breeana Robinson described how she heard a man and woman loudly arguing before Ms Robinson fell to her death.
Julie Carroll said: “I heard an argument for at least 15 minutes … I could hear the man’s loud yelling and the woman was crying.”
Ms Carroll said the arguing stopped and she later heard a scream.
She could not recall how long it was between the arguing stopping and the scream.
Defence barrister Angus Edwards, instructed by Hannay Lawyers, showed Ms Carroll Facebook conversations she had the night Ms Robinson died.
In the messages Ms Carroll said she did not hear screaming.
“I meant I didn’t hear screams after it had happened,” she said.
“If I knew someone who fell from a balcony I would be screaming.”
Allan Walker, who lived on the seventh floor, said he was out on the balcony and heard a “swishing noise” before someone said ‘Oh, no’.”
Mr Walker said he then saw Ms Robinson fall past him.
“She was parallel (to the building) as she went past,” he said.
Mr Walker said when he saw her body on the glass awning her head was closer to the street and her feet were pointing to the building.
He said she appeared to be wearing a black bra and underwear and had landed on her back with her right hand twisted under her and her legs apart.
H20 resident Emily Turner, who lived on the eighth floor, said she heard arguing before a period of silence and then she heard a thump.
“(The silence was) no more than a minute,” she said.
Ms Turner said it was possible she had fallen back to sleep during the period of silence between the arguing and the thump.
She told the court when she looked out over the balcony she saw Ms Robinson’s body perpendicular to the building.
Moorea’s next door neighbour Lisa Dunscombe was in the lift with the Moorea as they went to got see Ms Robinson immediately after she had fallen.
She told the court he seemed upset.
Ms Dunscombe said she left her apartment after hearing the thump and seeing Bree on the awning.
She said she saw Moorea coming out with his phone in one hand and doing up his pants.
Ms Dunscombe told the court she and her partner got into the lift with Moorea to go down to see what happened. Moorea told the pair it was his girlfriend he caused the thud.
“He said something about his ‘beautiful Bree’ and his exact words I can’t remember and him saying ‘he could have done more’,” she said.
Ms Dunscombe said she did not remember hearing any arguing or screaming the night Ms Robinson fell.
“I know there was no screaming and there was no noise and there was no previous arguing,” she said.
Ms Dunscombe told the court when she saw Bree’s body from under the awning she was on her back, her arms out at about a 45 degree angle and parallel to the building.
She said she had a conversation that night with Moorea after he came down from the balcony.
Ms Dunscombe told the court that Moorea said to her: “I could have helped her and I could have saved her.
“I could have loved her more.”

TRIPLE 0 CALLS
TWO Triple 0 calls Jayden Moorea made the night his former Gold Coast Titans cheerleader girlfriend fell from a Southport tower has been played to court.
Moorea, formerly Dan Shearin, is facing a committal hearing the in the Southport Magistrates Court on charges of murder and damaging evidence.
It is alleged Moorea threw Breeana Robinson from his balcony in the H20 building in Southport on January 29, 2013.
During the first day of proceedings, the court was played a recording of a Triple 0 call Moorea made the night Ms Robinson died.
“We are down in the foyer, she has landed on the glass,” Moorea said in the recording.
He was asked if she was breathing.
“No, I don’t know, we can’t get up to her,” he said.
Moorea is also heard asking for a ladder.
Former H20 security guard Gordon Cassidy told the court he heard the fall and saw Ms Robinson on the glass.
He said he, another man and Moorea all got up to the awning where Ms Robinson was lying.
Mr Cassidy said she was breathing and he moved her so she was no longer on the broken glass so he could perform first aid.
The downstairs neighbour of Moorea and Ms Robinson said she heard the pair fighting before the cheerleader fell from the balcony.
Mieke Pearce said she does not remember how long it was between the arguing stopping and hearing Ms Robinson scream.
“I just feel like it all happened very quickly. From the memory I have now it all happened one after the other,” she said.
Ms Pearce told the court she heard a woman scream and “yell out no”.
The court was told Ms Pearce had moved into the unit five days earlier and had heard the pair argue two or three times.
Ms Pearce’s partner Ben Pearce told the court he remembered there being a distinct period of time between hearing the arguing and the scream.
He said could not remember the time period but agreed it could be up to 30 minutes between the arguing and scream.
FULL DIGITAL ACCESS: JUST $5 A MONTH FOR THE FIRST THREE MONTHS
Defence barrister Angus Edwards, instructed by Hannay Lawyers, asked a number of witnesses about the position Ms Robinson was in when they saw her after the fall and before someone was able to get onto the awning to help her.
Three witness have said she was perpendicular to the building.
H20 resident Edward Wu, who lived on the ninth floor, said he remembers seeing Ms Robinson lying parallel to the building.
“All I can say is she was facing down … I don’t know whether her feet were closer to the edge of the building,” he said.
A second Triple 0 call made by Moorea has been played to the court where he told operators his girlfriend had climbed over the balcony.
“I went into the bedroom and she just ran onto the balcony and she has gone over the balcony,” he is heard saying on the call.
Moorea made the call prior to going downstairs and prior to the Triple 0 call played to the Southport Magistrates Court earlier on Monday.
His voice sounds high and he spoke in rushed tones.
The Triple 0 operator had to ask him a number of times to repeat information which could not be understood.
Next-door neighbour Alfred Schmetzer told the court he ran out into the hall after he heard a thud.
He said he saw Moorea coming out of this apartment on the phone and using one hand to put on pants.
Mr Schmetzer said his recollection as that Moorea was “focused and calm”.
A H20 resident told the court she heard Mr Robinson scream “no, no” as she feel from her balcony.
Georgina Hadid told the Southport Magistrates Court she also saw Ms Robinson falling past her fourth level balcony for a “split second”.
“She was flat on her back facing towards the sky,” she said.
Ms Hadid first gave a statement to police in November 2018 – five and a half years after Ms Robinson’s death.
She said she later saw Moorea out on the balcony while a security guard and her husband Badawi Hadid tried to help Ms Robinson.
“At one stage I did see him on the awning and he never touched her and never helped her,” she said.
“What I recall is him saying ‘Bree, I’m here for your Bree’ … no emotion, no nothing.”
Ms Hadid said she saw this from her fourth floor balcony.
MOOREA FLANKED BY LAWYERS AS HE ARRIVES AT COURT
A CRUISE ship crooner accused of murdering his Gold Coast Titans cheerleader ex-girlfriend has arrived at court for a committal hearing flanked by his lawyers.
Jayden Moorea, previously known as Dan Shearin, walked into the Southport Magistrates Court on Monday accompanied by solicitor Chris Hannay and barrister Angus Edwards.
It is alleged Moorea threw Breeana Robinson from his balcony in the H20 building in Southport on January 29, 2013.
Moorea was not charged until January 2019.
The group was stopped at the courthouse doors by security asking if they had been in Brisbane in the past 21 days.
Security provided the group with masks and asked them to wear them in the premises.
More than 70 witnesses are expected to give evidence in the committal hearing over the next two weeks.
Witnesses called will include experts, cheerleaders and police officers.
The hearing will determine if there is enough evidence for Moorea to stand trial.
Ms Robinson’s aunt Janine Mackney and another friend of Ms Robinson are in the courtroom waiting for proceedings to start, both holding a pink rose.
Moorea, who was released on bail not long after he was charged, has a clothing line – C.R. U. I. S. E – Can’t Rest Until I Sail Everywhere.
The apparel is sold on Moorea’s website – jdmoorea.com – where he describes himself as an “author, photographer and performance coach”.
In a court hearing in November 2019 a portion of the triple-0 call was read aloud.
“I need an ambulance, please, my girlfriend has just climbed over the balcony … I went into the bedroom and saw her climb over the balcony … she had threatened to do this before,” Moorea is alleged to have said on the call.

The committal hearing is expected to focus on what happened in the lead-up to Ms Robinson’s death and what happened in Moorea’s apartment before her fall.
Evidence from biomechanical experts is expected to shed further light on what happened that night.

Full text: Victoria's first mystery coronavirus case in more than two months will intensify pressure on the state's testing and contact tracing system after thousands of Boxing Day shoppers at Chadstone shopping centre and cricket spectators at the MCG were potentially exposed to the virus.
Authorities are on high alert after a man in his 30s who attended sales at Chadstone on December 26 and the second day of the Boxing Day Test match on December 27 later tested positive to COVID-19.
"I think it's most likely we have another cluster going on," Victoria's Deputy Chief Health Officer, Professor Allen Cheng, said yesterday.
The discovery that thousands of people could have been exposed to the virus at the venues came as Canberra put GPs at the forefront of an earlier-than-expected vaccine rollout to begin in early March.
The mystery-case revelation prompted the state government to delay plans to bring more Victorians back to work in Melbourne's CBD from next week and led authorities to review safety protocols at upcoming major events including the Australian Open, as Tennis Australia conceded that a spectator-free tournament, due to start on February 8, remains a possibility.
NSW also tightened restrictions on the eve of the Sydney Test, making mask-wearing mandatory for spectators at the Sydney Cricket Ground.
The man's illness cannot yet be linked to any other cluster, and a leading epidemiologist said the thousands of potential contacts would challenge the state's contact tracing and testing system.
The case comes as lengthy queues outside testing clinics have only recently subsided following the fresh Victorian outbreak and the state government's decision to close the NSW border, prompting tens of thousands of Victorian holidaymakers to return home.
"It is a test," La Trobe University epidemiologist Associate Professor Hassan Vally said. "We are talking about Chadstone and the MCG. That's a lot of people to be contacted and followed up. We predicted Boxing Day shopping would be a risk and going to the cricket would be a risk."
Myer closed its Chadstone store early to enable staff to get tested yesterday. The store will reopen today using staff from unaffected stores, while Chadstone staff will remain in isolation until they receive their test results. Staff at other affected shops at Chadstone were also being tested while their workplaces were closed for deep cleaning.
While officials do not believe the man was contagious when he visited Chadstone or the MCG, they fear he may have been infected at one of the two locations. They said anyone who shopped at Chadstone shops Culture Kings, Huffer, JD Sports, Jay Jays, H&M, Uniqlo, Myer, Superdry, Footlocker or Dumplings Plus on December 26 between 6am and 2pm, or sat in zone five at the MCG between 12.30pm and 3.30pm on December 27, should get tested.
A new testing site was opened yesterday near gate one at the MCG but authorities urged people who needed to be swabbed to go to their nearest testing venue and isolate until they received a negative result.
COVID-19 response commander Jeroen Weimar said about 8000 people were sitting in zone five of the MCG's Great Southern Stand on December 27.
Tens of thousands of shoppers descended on Chadstone on Boxing Day, but it is not known exactly how many visited between the hours of 6am and 2pm, when the mystery case potentially acquired the virus.
Victoria last recorded a mystery coronavirus case on October 29 and genomic testing is under way to determine whether the new case is linked to the recent Black Rock cluster or the recent NSW outbreak.
Deakin University epidemiology chair Catherine Bennett said the mystery case was concerning because it meant an infected person had not been picked up by testing and there might be low-level virus transmission within the community.
"If this person hasn't travelled from NSW or been released from hotel quarantine and they have no ties to the Black Rock cluster, it means there is at least one missing case out there," she said. "And as soon as you have one missing chain of transmission, it begs the question of what else don't you know."
University of Melbourne senior research fellow Jason Thompson, who was a member of the research team that provided scientific modelling to help inform the state government's road map out of lockdown, said any situation in a crowded setting, particularly indoors, raised the exposure risk.
"The lowest-risk thing people can do is either plan to avoid those situations altogether, or if they can't, wear a well-fitted mask and minimise the time you spend there."
Contact tracers believe they have a strong understanding of everyone the mystery case came into contact with after he developed symptoms on December 30. He has been self-isolating since December 31, was tested on January 3 and received his result on January 5.
Professor Cheng said the decision to list Chadstone and the MCG as possible acquisition sites for the mystery case was precautionary and there were other locations where the man was more likely to have caught the virus.
The man also had contact with someone from NSW on Christmas Eve, and authorities are awaiting the contact's test results. But Professor Cheng said it was unlikely the NSW contact passed on the virus, as he did not report feeling unwell.
There are now 41 active cases in Victoria, including 28 locally acquired cases.

Mutant virus threat

Publication info: Herald Sun ; Melbourne, Vic. [Melbourne, Vic]. 05 Jan 2021: 8.

https://login.ezproxy.lib.rmit.edu.au/login?url=https://www.proquest.com/newspapers/mutant-virus-threat/docview/2474956757/se-2?accountid=13552

Full text: EXCLUSIVE VICTORIA is calling for an urgent meeting of National Cabinet over the threat of Britain’s super COVID-19 strain, amid fears the mutant bug could devastate Australia.
The variant of the coronavirus, described by a senior state government source as “radioactive, toxic material, wildly infectious” is up to 50 per cent more infectious than the strain that caused Victoria’s second wave.
The state government wants the national meeting to again push for pre-flight testing of all travellers from Britain. It is believed there are also concerns other states’ hotel quarantine testing regimens are not as rigorous as in Victoria, which screens every employee daily and their families weekly.
Leading epidemiologist Tony Blakely says Australia should consider halting international flights until all frontline hotel quarantine workers can be vaccinated to prevent an outbreak of the more dangerous coronavirus now sweeping Britain.
Four travellers arriving in Melbourne have been identified with the new strain, since the first on December 11, and genomic sequencing is under way to confirm a suspected fifth case.
The new variant is being blamed for the explosion in cases across Britain, where despite most of the country being in lockdown the number of coronavirus cases is still rising by more than 50,000 a day and London’s hospital system faces the prospect of a meltdown similar to the disaster that hit northern Italy last year.
“Obviously we’re watching very closely, with significant concern, the UK variant and others,” COVID-19 Response Commander Jeroen Weimar told the Herald Sun.
“We know the two biggest risks are returning international passengers and international aircrews. That’s why we test every single staff member working in hotel quarantine every single shift and all aircrew are in a holding hotel, every one of them tested.” The strain is believed to be the reason the state government put hotel quarantine program workers at the top of its list to receive vaccinations when they are available, alongside front line health workers.
Dr Blakely, of the University of Melbourne, said quarantine workers should be at the front of the queue along with airline staff.
He said the new strain meant it was increasingly likely Australia would see outbreaks from quarantine hotels, and the situation was so serious there was a case for closing borders until all staff in contact with returned travellers could be immunised.
He said an outbreak of the new strain would be much harder to control and render redundant all previous modelling on how the virus spreads.
“The way that we’ve managed hotel quarantine here, we’ve actually got to be pretty good but we’re hitting the ceiling as to how good we can get,” he said.
“No matter how good your processes are, occasionally it’s going to get out.” He said the existence of the new variant “will make the risk of leakage greater again … and once it gets out it can explode much quicker”.
“Is there are case? Yes, there is a case. Should it be done? That’s above my pay grade and also requires considering politics and the issue of Australian citizens coming home and the compassionate grounds and other things. But is there a case? Yes there is.” Professor Adrian Esterman of the University of South Australia said the new strain was “much more difficult to control because it spreads much quicker”. He said he had been calling for the whole hotel quarantine program to be revisited because it made little sense to run hotel quarantine in the middle of a city.
“If this is as infectious as we think it is, it only takes one person to bring it and for it to escape and that’s it — it will take off like wildfire,” he said.

UK’S MUTANT COVID STRAIN Mid-September: New variant VUI – 202012/01 first identified November: A quarter of cases in London were the new variant December: Two- thirds of cases in London were the new variant Prime Minister Boris Johnson has said it “may be up to 70% more transmissible" Cases have been seen in every part of the UK and also in Ireland The mutant virus has quickly spread, with cases found in Europe and as far afield as Australia What has changed?
17 important alterations on the virus have been identified Mutation N501Y Alters part of the virus spike protein and may make it easier to get into our cells Spike deletion 69-V70del Causes the loss of two amino acids in the spike protein and may help it evade our immune response Is it more dangerous?
No evidence so far of increased mortality or disease severity Will the current vaccines still work?
• The vaccine response is believed to be adequate for now • Further changes could build the virus’s resistance • This means constantly adapting the vaccine as we do for the flu

Full text: An architect of Australia’s COVID-19 response has rejected calls for the vaccine rollout to be accelerated, despite the emergence of more contagious mutant virus strains in Britain and South Africa and the spread interstate of the outbreak centred on Sydney’s northern beaches.
Jodie McVernon — director of epidemiology at Melbourne’s Peter Doherty Institute for Infection and Immunity and an expert member of the council of chief health officers that delivers high-level scientific advice to Scott Morrison and the premiers — said there was no need “to press the red emergency button” and bring forward distribution of the jab from March.
Her position is at odds with Anthony Albanese who on Wednesday urged the Prime Minister to make the vaccine available as soon as January, when some or all of the three overseas formulations ordered by the government are expected to be approved.
“No, I don’t think we need to press the red emergency button right now,” Professor McVernon said. “We are not in the same universe as the countries that have done that. There would have to be a significant tipping point for the commonwealth and the regulator to decide we were at an emergency usage stage. I … am very heartened by the faith the NSW government has in its system and its measured and proportional response to what has happened on the northern beaches.” Seven new COVID-19 cases in Sydney were revealed on Friday, with a further case in quarantine in Queensland linked to a superyacht that arrived in Cairns after a six-week trip from the Maldives.
Updated state-by-state modelling on the transmission potential of the virus by University of Melbourne professor in mathematical biology James McCaw, who sits alongside Professor McVernon on the Australian Health Protection Principal Committee, shows that the risk of COVID-19 spreading in NSW is nearly a third higher than in Victoria.
Perversely, the success of Western Australia and Queensland in containing the virus jars with their outbreak risk being rated as the highest of the mainland states — calculated at 1.55 and 1.33 respectively. As the index measures “current settings and behaviours”, it could reflect a ­degree of public complacency in those jurisdictions.
Professor McVernon said Australians should not be “judged harshly” on the numbers.
“If the virus is imported into a given state or territory, the reproductive potential shows what is the likelihood it will spread … effectively it’s an indication of how free the populations are,” she said.
“And look, that was the point of getting to zero community transmission — letting people get out, socialise and have a healthy economy. So we shouldn’t berate the population for that.” The modelling on the federal Health Department’s common operating picture database cut out at December 8, before the northern beaches outbreak took hold in Sydney. A southeast Queensland man who visited the area on ­December 12, prior to the lockdown, has now tested positive to COVID. Viral traces had also been detected in sewage in Wynnum on Brisbane’s bayside, Bundaberg and nearby Bargara Beach, Queensland chief health officer Jeannette Young said. South Australia also recorded a case linked to the northern beaches cluster, after a resident aged in his 20s returned a positive test.
Alarm about the mutations reported in Britain and South Africa intensified this week after federal chief medical officer Paul Kelly revealed four cases of the British strain had been detected among returned travellers in hotel quarantine. Two were in Sydney, two in Melbourne.
British authorities say the variant spreading in London, southeast England and Wales could be up to 70 per cent more infectious than the coronavirus that causes COVID-19, though there was no proof it made the disease deadlier.
British Health Secretary Matt Hancock warned that the mutated South African strain, now identified in two cases in Britain involving people thought to be contacts of those who had recently travelled between the two countries, could be even more contagious. Announcing further lockdown measures to come into effect next week, Mr Hancock said: “This new (South African) variant is highly concerning because it is yet more transmissible and it appears to have mutated further than the new variant discovered in the UK.” Health Minister Greg Hunt, who accused Mr Albanese of undermining confidence in a vaccine by pushing for an accelerated rollout, said on Christmas Eve that the vaccine introduction would not be fast-tracked from March, with the government sticking with its approach to “underpromise and overdeliver”.
After the failure of the University of Queensland vaccine, which was to deliver 50m doses, additional supply was ordered of the Oxford-AstraZeneca and Novavax vaccines, in addition to 10m doses contracted from Pfizer of the German BioNTech vaccine.
Professor McVernon said public confidence in the immunisers was as important as their effectiveness, and would be underpinned by the experience in the UK and US after those hard-hit countries approved the Pfizer jab under emergency-use provisions. Another vaccine produced by American biotech company Moderna Therapeutics has been provisionally authorised by the US regulator, the Food and Drug Administration, paving the way for nearly 1 million people to be treated to date under President Donald Trump’s “Operation Warp Speed” initiative. “Obviously for any vaccine development program to work we need to be confident of its safety and its effectiveness, and the fact that we have not had to use the vaccines with the urgency of other countries does mean we benefit from the additional time,” Professor McVernon said.
Pfizer in Australia would not be drawn on when the vaccine would be available here. “We have confidence in our ability to quickly scale and manufacture large quantities of a high-quality COVID-19 vaccine, leveraging multiple sites in the US and Europe,” a spokeswoman said.
“Pfizer and BioNTech are committed to delivering on their agreement with the Australian government to supply 10m doses … over the course of 2021 subject to regulatory approval.” Asked if fast-tracking the ­process was an option if the containment situation deteriorated, Professor McVernon pointed to October’s decision by the Therapeutic Goods Administration to issue a “provisional determination” in favour of Pfizer and the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccines before the latter was delayed by a dosing glitch in final-phase human trials. The problem, reportedly, has been resolved and British regulators are expected to green light the rollout within days.
A provisional determination by the TGA means the drug developer can apply for provisional registration in Australia and Professor McVernon said this implied an accelerated pathway was possible.

How medical science staved off calamity

Full text: A 12.39am email at the beginning of February put in motion Australia's response to the coronavirus, write Deborah Snow and Kate Aubusson.
Epidemiologist Professor Jodie McVernon was in the Qantas lounge at Canberra airport on the evening of Monday, February 3, when she took an urgent call from Brendan Murphy, then the Commonwealth's chief medical officer.
McVernon had for days been "obsessively" tracking information on a mysterious new virus seeping out of Wuhan, China, and was preparing to fly home to Melbourne after lengthy meetings in the nation's capital. But Murphy had a fresh task for her.
"Your prime minister needs a projection, a future scenario, in 48 hours," he told her.
McVernon's long-time colleague, mathematical biologist Professor James McCaw, was also on the road when he received the same news. The two had two days to get a brief to the federal government's National Security Committee.
It was a curtain-raiser to what would be the most destructive pandemic to sweep the world since the 1918-20 Spanish flu.
McVernon, 50, and McCaw, 43, were as well-briefed as anyone in the country on the rapidly emerging but as-yet-unnamed novel coronavirus. Both were members of an international network of modellers convened by the WHO and had been dialling into the network's meetings (usually held late at night, Australian time) since January 17.
Says McVernon, director of epidemiology at Melbourne's Doherty Institute: "The modelling community had clocked very quickly that this was going to be bad and it was going to be long. It was clear we had to adopt a high transmissibility scenario, higher than most of our flu scenarios. The key unknown was whether it could be transmitted before the onset of symptoms. If that was the case, it was going to be a lot harder to control."
On January 21, Murphy invoked the Biosecurity Act in preparation for possible border restrictions.
At 12.39am on February 1, McVernon emailed Murphy, relaying the latest consensus from the modellers' network that the new coronavirus had seeded throughout China from Wuhan. And it was not just jumping from infected animal to human, transmitting between people.
Murphy was getting similar intelligence from the federal health department's crisis centre, the National Incident Room. He fed that to federal Health Minister Greg Hunt, who immediately briefed Prime Minister Scott Morrison. Canberra slammed on the brakes. By that afternoon, Australia's borders to China had been closed.
But the virus had already slipped into the country, hitchhiking in the body of a passenger from Wuhan who had flown to Melbourne on January 19. Australia had its patient zero.
On February 11, the WHO christened the baffling new affliction "COVID-19", a name that would dominate humanity's waking hours and darken its collective dreams for the rest of 2020. The virus that caused it was labelled SARS-CoV 2. The silent invader would breach the defences of every country. Some - too tardy, in denial, under-resourced or poorly prepared - would fare worse than others.
McVernon and McCaw had been invited on to the Australian Health Protection Principal Committee, the body which brings together federal, state and territory chief health and medical officers. It would meet daily for more than four months, the pressure cooker atmosphere akin to a war cabinet. "Every day there was something new, the situation was changing so quickly," says McCaw.
By the end of March, Australia notched up 4500 cases - most introduced from overseas. Italy and Spain were becoming horrifying demonstrations of what could happen when rampant infection took hold. Exhausted physicians in those countries were running out of ventilators and intensive care beds, having to play God, and decide which patients lived or died.
As Australia's case numbers doubled every three to five days in mid-March, some feared similar scenarios could unfold here. Federal deputy chief medical officer Professor Paul Kelly appeared to endorse speculation that between 20 per cent and 60 per cent of the population might end up contracting the virus should it run wild. That generated headlines that fatalities could run as high 150,000 people.
ABC coronavirus guru Dr Norman Swan warned NSW could be out of ICU beds within weeks if the sharp rise in cases continued. The federal Department of Home Affairs, which had the lead in managing emergency logistics, began searching for cold storage facilities where bodies could be stored if mortuaries were over-run.
McCaw now says those scenarios were never going to play out here. "Those figures showed what could happen if it was allowed to spread unchecked [but] there was no way we were going to let it happen".
NSW Chief Medical Officer Kerry Chant agrees: "It was never going to be acceptable to allow that spread, because that modelling was based on an unmitigated pandemic." Instead, Australia's political leaders bowed to the medical advice.
The nation sealed off its external borders to all countries on March 20. Hotel quarantine was introduced. Social distancing and strictures on movement and economic activity were applied and then gradually eased as they started to "flatten the curve" of infection.
Then came Victoria's outbreak, suppressed with one of the world's harshest lockdowns. By November's end, that state had managed the miracle of effective elimination of the virus from a community which, in August, had had a peak of 725 new infections in a single day.
For McVernon, dealing daily with colleagues overseas where the virus is running rampant once again through the northern winter, it's like inhabiting two separate universes.
"The idea we would get to a [near] elimination state here didn't seem plausible at the beginning," she says. "It was very hard explaining to international colleagues just a month or so ago that we were in lockdown [in Melbourne] with five cases a day. What we take for granted now as our expected normal is so far apart from theirs."
'Long COVID' effect
Dr Sarah Coombes is a Sydney-based emergency services physician. Previously in robust health, the 54-year-old contracted COVID-19 in Europe in March and tested positive to the virus soon after arriving home.
She still suffers from COVID-related joint pain, managed with anti-inflammatories and Panadol, and an increased heart rate and chest pain if fatigued. For six months, she was at 75 per cent of her previous energy levels. Now it's 90 per cent.
Coombes is a victim of long COVID, a syndrome where patients remain afflicted with lingering effects long after they've ceased being infectious.
For some, it's not just the physical toll, but the stigma as well. At St Vincent's hospital in Sydney, where professors Gail Matthews and Greg Dore are running a study of some 140 long COVID sufferers, some stories are heartbreaking: patients who've spent weeks isolated from family, friends and colleagues, longing for human touch from someone other than a figure clad head to toe in personal protective equipment.
There is the 60-year-old whose gardening business is floundering, because no one will hire him, having heard he'd had the disease. One couple's children were made to sit metres from classmates after their parents were diagnosed. Yet these people are among the safest company if they have developed antibodies, says Dr Kari Lancaster, a UNSW social scientist who is attached to the St Vincent's study.
Why an unlucky group suffers in this way (up to one in 20 will have symptoms after eight weeks, according to one British study) is among the many mysteries still to be unlocked about the virus, even after a torrent of clinical trials, studies and autopsy examinations.
As well as being wildly infectious, the virus is fickle. It strikes a minority (mostly in older age groups) with lethal effect, while about 80 per cent will have mild symptoms or none at all.
That's an "incredibly disruptive" combination of characteristics, says McCaw: "There are enough cases of low-level symptom or asymptomatic transmission that it spreads easily, yet is very, very severe for the vulnerable".
The virus was thought at first to spread mainly by way of surface and physical contact but evidence has become overwhelming that it is remarkably efficient at transmitting through aerosols - the tiny droplets we exhale, particularly when exercising, singing, and talking loudly. (WHO recommended mask-wearing in public in early June.)
The disease at first seemed to affect just the lungs. "But we quickly learned it affects every single organ system" says Dr Neha Dangayach, co-director of neurosurgical intensive care at Mount Sinai New York. There were gastro and cardiac and neurological presentations. Doctors across the globe were reporting the same myriad complaints.
WHO's list of COVID symptoms grew from a handful of respiratory complaints to include headache, muscle and joint pains, nausea, diarrhoea, vomiting, loss of sense of smell and/or taste, loss of appetite, fatigue, conjunctivitis, discolouration of fingers and toes, chest pain or pressure and loss of speech or movement.
Australian neuroscientist Thomas Oxley, in the neurosurgery department also at Mount Sinai, documented a spike in strokes among younger COVID-19 patients who had been asymptomatic or had presented with mildest of symptoms.
Chant says: "I don't think there's ever been an experience where it has been such a prolonged period of continual learning."
While many treatments have been tried, no cure has emerged. A handful of therapeutic approaches appear to help stave off severe disease, if administered early.
But outgoing US president Donald Trump's favourite, hydroxychloroquine, is a dud. Today, almost all trials of hydroxychloroquine have been halted, amid a volley of accusations between scientists of vested interests and poorly designed trials.
As professor of surgery at the University of Sydney, Henry Woo told The Age in April: "There are a lot of things that can destroy the virus in a Petri dish - like kerosene." Trump's doctors seem to have had more success with a monoclonal (lab-engineered) antibody called REGN-COV-2, though it's still experimental.
Professor Steven Tong, who is leading a clinical trial dubbed ASCOT at the Doherty Institute, says two drugs have emerged as solid treatment options: dexamethasone - developed to treat ebola - and the antiviral Remdesivir. Both are routinely given to hospitalised COVID patients in Australia and internationally.
Remdesivir appears to shorten the duration of COVID-19, according to investigators of the RECOVERY trial, a cornerstone of COVID-19 treatment research, which has recruited more than 14,000 patients from Britain's National Health Service. But the WHO's SOLIDARITY trial found it did not reduce mortality.
Tong says: "It doesn't stop people from dying, but for hospitalised patients needing oxygen therapy, but not sick enough to need ventilation, it appears to speed up their time to discharge compared to patients given placebo."
Dexamethasone does appear to save lives, reducing deaths by one-third among ventilated patients and one-fifth in patients receiving oxygen therapy. The Australian ASCOT trial is testing convalescent plasma - blood plasma rich in antibodies from donors who have recovered from COVID-19.
All eyes are now on vaccines, three of which have delivered huge promise in recent weeks.
Two of these - one produced by Moderna, and the other by Pfizer, both based in the US - represent a breakthrough in modern vaccine technology, using messenger RNA (mRNA) to instruct human cells to manufacture parts of the virus in order to rouse the body's own immune response.
Both look to have a 94 per cent to 95 per cent effectiveness rate. The third, made by AstraZeneca in conjunction with Oxford University, reported about 70 per cent effectiveness (it is subject to further testing), and would be cheaper and easier to distribute.
But the question is whether these or other vaccines still in the pipeline can prevent infection, as well as the disease caused by the virus.
Canberra is hedging its bets and has invested more than $3.2 billion on four vaccine candidates thus far, including the Pfizer and AstraZeneca products. However, as US infectious diseases authority Dr Anthony Fauci says "the cavalry is coming, but don't put your weapons down".
While they may protect against the disease caused by the virus, it's not clear for how long. Nor is it clear whether they can stop transmission - the only thing that can bring the virus to a halt.
Even after safety trials, the risk of rare side effects may not be known some time. Then there's vaccine hesitancy, which seems to be growing in some sections of the population.
Professors Matthew Gray and Nick Biddle, social researchers at the Australian National University, found in their surveys that between 12 and 13 per cent of adult Australians would definitely or probably not get vaccinated against COVID-19.
Our Achilles heel
Quarantine hotels will remain our Achilles heel for as long as the virus runs rampant beyond our shores. Victoria graphically illustrated this, as did South Australia's recent outbreak. Chant worries about maintaining vigilance. "One of the things that we have been grappling with over recent weeks is how to keep [emphasising] the message that even one case matters," she says.
Hunt wants to see Australia "at a place where we are as fully vaccinated as people choose ... by the end of 2021", starting as early as March. The Therapeutic Goods Administration has granted AstraZeneca and Pfizer "provisional predetermination", which could expedite approval.
But McVernon sounds a note of caution. "Realistically, I think [the vaccines] will be one of a suite of ongoing risk reduction measures until we learn more about how effective they are.
"It's likely that we will still need some degree of social constraint, and all those other COVID- safe practices ... until we understand their impact on transmission. That will be the evolving story."

Full text: An email at 12.39am on Monday, February 3, put in motion Australia's COVID-19 response, write Deborah Snow and Kate Aubusson.
Epidemiologist Professor Jodie McVernon was in the Qantas lounge at Canberra airport on the evening of Monday, February 3, when she took an urgent call from Brendan Murphy, then the Commonwealth's chief medical officer.
McVernon had for days been "obsessively" tracking information on a mysterious new virus seeping out of Wuhan, China, and was preparing to fly home to Melbourne after lengthy meetings in the nation's capital. But Murphy had a fresh task for her.
"Your prime minister needs a projection, a future scenario, in 48 hours," he told her.
McVernon's long-time colleague, mathematical biologist Professor James McCaw, was also on the road when he received the same news. The two had two days to get a brief to the federal government's National Security Committee.
It was a curtain-raiser to what would be the most destructive pandemic to sweep the world since the 1918-20 Spanish flu.
McVernon, 50, and McCaw, 43, were as well briefed as anyone in the country on the rapidly emerging but as-yet-unnamed novel coronavirus. Both were members of an international network of modellers convened by the WHO and had been dialling into the network's meetings (usually held late at night, Australian time) since January 17.
McVernon, director of epidemiology at Melbourne's Doherty Institute, says: "The modelling community had clocked very quickly that this was going to be bad and it was going to be long. It was clear we had to adopt a high transmissibility scenario, higher than most of our flu scenarios. The key unknown was whether it could be transmitted before the onset of symptoms. If that was the case, it was going to be a lot harder to control."
On January 21, Murphy invoked the Biosecurity Act in preparation for possible border restrictions.
At 12.39am on February 1, McVernon emailed Murphy, relaying the latest consensus from the modellers' network that the new coronavirus had seeded throughout China from Wuhan. And it was not just jumping from infected animal to human, transmitting between people.
Murphy was getting similar intelligence from the federal health department's crisis centre, the National Incident Room. He fed that to federal Health Minister Greg Hunt, who immediately briefed Prime Minister Scott Morrison. Canberra slammed on the brakes. By that afternoon, Australia's borders to China had been closed.
But the virus had already slipped into the country, hitchhiking in the body of a passenger from Wuhan to Melbourne on January 19. Australia had its patient zero.
On February 11, the WHO christened the baffling new affliction "COVID-19", a name that would dominate humanity's waking hours and darken its collective dreams for the rest of 2020. The virus that caused it was labelled SARS-CoV 2. The silent invader would breach the defences of every country. Some - too tardy, in denial, under-resourced or poorly prepared - would fare worse than others.
McVernon and McCaw had been invited on to the Australian Health Protection Principal Committee, the body which brings together federal, state and territory chief health and medical officers. It would meet daily for more than four months, the pressure cooker atmosphere akin to a war cabinet. "Every day there was something new, the situation was changing so quickly," says McCaw.
By the end of March, Australia notched up 4500 cases - most introduced from overseas. Italy and Spain were becoming horrifying demonstrations of what could happen when rampant infection took hold. Exhausted physicians in those countries were running out of ventilators and intensive care beds, having to play God, and decide which patients lived or died.
As Australia's case numbers doubled every three to five days in mid-March, some feared similar scenarios could unfold here. Federal deputy chief medical officer Professor Paul Kelly appeared to endorse speculation that between 20 per cent and 60 per cent of the population might end up contracting the virus should it run wild. That generated headlines that fatalities could run as high 150,000 people.
ABC coronavirus guru Dr Norman Swan warned NSW could be out of ICU beds within weeks if the sharp rise in cases continued. The federal Department of Home Affairs, which had the lead in managing emergency logistics, began searching for cold storage facilities where bodies could be stored if mortuaries were over-run.
McCaw now says those scenarios were never going to play out here. "Those figures showed what could happen if it was allowed to spread unchecked [but] there was no way we were going to let it happen".
NSW Chief Medical Officer Kerry Chant agrees: "It was never going to be acceptable to allow that spread, because that modelling was based on an unmitigated pandemic." Instead, Australia's political leaders bowed to the medical advice.
The nation sealed off its external borders to all countries on March 20. Hotel quarantine was introduced. Social distancing and strictures on movement and economic activity were applied and then gradually eased as they started to "flatten the curve" of infection.
Then came Victoria's outbreak, suppressed with one of the world's harshest lockdowns. By November's end, that state had managed the miracle of effective elimination of the virus from a community which, in August, had had a peak of 725 new infections in a single day.
For McVernon, dealing daily with colleagues overseas where the virus is running rampant once again through the northern winter, it's like inhabiting two separate universes.
"The idea we would get to a [near] elimination state here didn't seem plausible at the beginning," she says. "It was very hard explaining to international colleagues just a month or so ago that we were in lockdown [in Melbourne] with five cases a day. What we take for granted now as our expected normal is so far apart from theirs."
'Long COVID' effect
Dr Sarah Coombes is a Sydney-based emergency services physician. Previously in robust health, the 54-year-old contracted COVID-19 in Europe in March and tested positive to the virus soon after arriving home.
She still suffers from COVID-related joint pain, managed with anti-inflammatories and Panadol, and an increased heart rate and chest pain if fatigued. For six months, she was at 75 per cent of her previous energy levels. Now it's 90 per cent.
Coombes is a victim of long COVID, a syndrome where patients remain afflicted with lingering effects long after they've ceased being infectious.
For some, it's not just the physical toll, but the stigma as well. At St Vincent's hospital in Sydney, where professors Gail Matthews and Greg Dore are running a study of some 140 long COVID sufferers, some stories are heartbreaking: patients who've spent weeks isolated from family, friends and colleagues, longing for human touch from someone other than a figure clad head to toe in personal protective equipment.
There is the 60-year-old whose gardening business is floundering, because no one will hire him, having heard he'd had the disease. One couple's children were made to sit metres from classmates after their parents were diagnosed. Yet these people are probably among the safest company if they have developed antibodies, says Dr Kari Lancaster, a UNSW social scientist attached to the St Vincent's study.
Why an unlucky group suffers in this way (up to one in 20 will have symptoms after eight weeks, according to one British study) is among the many mysteries still to be unlocked about the virus, even after a torrent of clinical trials, studies and autopsy examinations.
As well as being wildly infectious, the virus is fickle. It strikes a minority (mostly in older age groups) with lethal effect, while about 80 per cent will have mild symptoms or none at all.
That's an "incredibly disruptive" combination of characteristics, says McCaw: "There are enough cases of low-level symptom or asymptomatic transmission that it spreads easily, yet is very, very severe for the vulnerable".
The virus was thought at first to spread mainly by way of surface and physical contact but evidence has become overwhelming that it is remarkably efficient at transmitting through aerosols - the tiny droplets we exhale, particularly when exercising, singing, and talking loudly. (WHO recommended mask-wearing in public in early June.)
The disease at first seemed to affect just the lungs. "But we quickly learned it affects every single organ system" says Dr Neha Dangayach, co-director of neurosurgical intensive care at Mount Sinai New York. There were gastro and cardiac and neurological presentations. Doctors across the globe were reporting the same myriad complaints.
WHO's list of COVID symptoms grew from a handful of respiratory complaints to include headache, muscle and joint pains, nausea, diarrhoea, vomiting, loss of sense of smell and/or taste, loss of appetite, fatigue, conjunctivitis, discolouration of fingers and toes, chest pain or pressure and loss of speech or movement.
Australian neuroscientist Thomas Oxley, also at Mount Sinai, documented a spike in strokes among younger COVID-19 patients who had been asymptomatic or had presented with the mildest of symptoms.
Chant says: "I don't think there's ever been an experience where it has been such a prolonged period of continual learning."
While many treatments have been tried, no cure has emerged. A handful of therapeutic approaches appear to help stave off severe disease, if administered early.
But outgoing US president Donald Trump's favourite, hydroxychloroquine, is a dud. Almost all trials of hydroxychloroquine have been halted, amid a volley of accusations between scientists of vested interests and poorly designed trials.
As professor of surgery at the University of Sydney, Henry Woo told the Herald in April: "There are a lot of things that can destroy the virus in a Petri dish - like kerosene." Trump's doctors seem to have had more success with a monoclonal (lab-engineered) antibody called REGN-COV-2, though it's still experimental.
Professor Steven Tong, who is leading a clinical trial dubbed ASCOT at the Doherty Institute, says two drugs have emerged as solid treatment options: dexamethasone - developed to treat ebola - and the antiviral Remdesivir. Both are routinely given to hospitalised COVID patients in Australia and internationally.
Remdesivir appears to shorten the duration of COVID-19, according to investigators of the RECOVERY trial, a cornerstone of COVID-19 treatment research, which has recruited more than 14,000 patients from Britain's National Health Service. But the WHO's SOLIDARITY trial found it did not reduce mortality.
Tong says: "It doesn't stop people from dying, but for hospitalised patients needing oxygen therapy, but not sick enough to need ventilation, it appears to speed up their time to discharge compared to patients given placebo."
Dexamethasone does appear to save lives, reducing deaths by one-third among ventilated patients and one-fifth in patients receiving oxygen therapy. The Australian ASCOT trial is testing convalescent plasma - blood plasma rich in antibodies from donors who have recovered from COVID-19.
All eyes are now on vaccines, three of which have delivered huge promise in recent weeks.
Two of these - one produced by Moderna, and the other by Pfizer, both based in the US - represent a breakthrough in modern vaccine technology, using messenger RNA (mRNA) to instruct human cells to manufacture parts of the virus in order to rouse the body's own immune response.
Both look to have a 94 per cent to 95 per cent effectiveness rate. The third, made by AstraZeneca in conjunction with Oxford University, reported about 70 per cent effectiveness (it is subject to further testing), and would be cheaper and easier to distribute.
But the question is whether these or other vaccines still in the pipeline can prevent infection, as well as the disease caused by the virus.
Canberra is hedging its bets and has invested more than $3.2 billion on four vaccine candidates thus far, including the Pfizer and AstraZeneca products. However, as US infectious diseases authority Dr Anthony Fauci says "the cavalry is coming, but don't put your weapons down".
While they may protect against the disease caused by the virus, it's not clear for how long. Nor is it clear whether they can stop transmission - the only thing that can bring the virus to a halt.
Even after safety trials, the risk of rare side effects may not be known some time. Then there's vaccine hesitancy, which seems to be growing in some sections of the population.
Professors Matthew Gray and Nick Biddle, social researchers at the Australian National University, found in their surveys that between 12 and 13 per cent of adult Australians would definitely or probably not get vaccinated against COVID-19.
Our Achilles heel
Quarantine hotels will remain our Achilles heel for as long as the virus runs rampant beyond our shores. Victoria graphically illustrated this, as did South Australia's recent outbreak.
Chant worries about maintaining vigilance. "One of the things that we have been grappling with over recent weeks is how to keep [emphasising] the message that even one case matters," she says.
Hunt wants to see Australia "at a place where we are as fully vaccinated as people choose ... by the end of 2021", starting as early as March. To this end, the safety watchdog, the Therapeutic Goods Administration, has granted AstraZeneca and Pfizer "provisional predetermination", which could expedite approval.
But McVernon sounds a note of caution. "Realistically, I think [the vaccines] will be one of a suite of ongoing risk reduction measures until we learn more about how effective they are.
"It's likely that we will still need some degree of social constraint, and all those other COVID- safe practices ... until we understand their impact on transmission. That will be the evolving story."

Full text: Epidemiologists have had a mixed reaction to the state government's road map out of the current strict COVID-19 lockdown that has driven down cases but kept Victorians inside their homes.
Jodie McVernon, director of epidemiology at Melbourne's Doherty Institute:
"If they were [a hard target], I would be very concerned that we might never reach them.
"I think getting down to an average of five cases over 14 days, I think that is a very stringent target.
"I would really be expecting that we will have a much more nuanced discussion about it and those numbers are a goal."
Mary-Louise McLaws, UNSW epidemiologist and World Health Organisation COVID-19 adviser (speaking to SBS):
"I think that's too stringent. I think Victoria will be in a safe place with fewer than five cases per day - they'll be able to squash clusters every day."
"Victorians have been living with such high numbers that they're forgetting that 1200 cases over the last 14 days is still volcanically high.
"They're doing brilliantly. But if the restrictions are lifted when they're in that amber phase, it's too soon.
"The amber phase is where you should be putting in preemptive restrictions to stop you from getting into the red."
Stephen Duckett, director of the health program at the Grattan Institute:
"Today the number of cases was in that 30-50 range, so if the same thing happens over the next fortnight then we are certainly on track to move to the second step.
"By and large the modelling shows the decline is going really well.
"Getting to five is going to be a tough call."
Catherine Bennett, chair in epidemiology at Deakin University (speaking on 3AW):
"Stage three plus masks worked as well as what we're doing now, from what we can see from the outside.
"You don't need to keep us in stage four, you just need to have a really smart path that keeps elimination suppressed but starts to open up, and then you get the best of both worlds: you've got people on board, you've got good compliance and that's how we wrap up the end of this tail.
"We certainly know in the tail that we've got particular areas that should be priority areas. That's what you focus on."
Mike Toole, epidemiologist from the Burnet Institute:
"They're being ultra cautious ... but I think we do have a chance here in Victoria to get down to a level that could be sustained for quite a long time, until we get a vaccine.
"A third wave is just going to be a total disaster for everything - for health and for our business - so I think it's worth having these restrictions for a little bit longer."
Tony Blakely, University of Melbourne professor of epidemiology:
"If we do our contact tracing better than we did three months ago, the contact tracers may be able to hold the case count without it going up again as badly as our model suggests.
"I'm sick of lockdown, I want to get out of it too, but unfortunately if you come out of lockdown too early, too fast, the chance of the third wave by Christmas is pretty high - about 60 per cent."

Full text: ANNALIESE Van Diemen’s tweet exposes the coronavirus gang. What kind of extremists have turned Victoria almost into a police state?
Her tweet abusing Captain James Cook helps to explain why Victoria has Australia’s toughest coronavirus laws, and why we’ll all pay as its Labor government destroys its economy and looks to China for rescue.
Van Diemen is Victoria’s deputy chief health officer, helping to fight the coronavirus. Yet at 10.16am last Wednesday, she took time out to attack the 250th anniversary of Cook’s landing at Botany Bay.
She tweeted: “Sudden arrival of an invader from another land, decimating populations, creating terror. Forces the population to make enormous sacrifices & completely change how they live in order to survive.
“Covid-19 or Cook 1770?” Most critics attacked just one half of Van Diemen’s astonishing analogy — the one showing that this graduate of James Cook University is amazingly ignorant of Cook himself.
Cook spent just one week at Botany Bay and killed nobody. Instead, he describes in his journal repeatedly trying to befriend Aborigines: “We left several articles such as Cloth, Looking glasses, Combs, Beeds (sic) Nails &c.” This alone suggests Van Diemen may form her opinions by consulting not the facts but political fashions, as when she berates Australia as a “racist nation”.
But look at the other side of Van Diemen’s crazy analogy — that this virus is “decimating” our population.
Again, she is catastrophising. This virus has so far killed just 94 Australians, half aged 80 or older and many already sick. In comparison, 1255 Australians died of the flu in 2017.
This is where we should start feeling scared of the kind of people who’ve imposed Australia’s harshest coronavirus bans, stopping Victorians even from playing golf, visiting their children or going to school.
None of those bans are likely to make any real difference to the transmission of a virus that is very rarely spread outdoors, rarely infects children and has just 50 or so Victorians ill right now — all either safely in hospital or in quarantine.
But it turns out Van Diemen is far from alone in wildly exaggerating dangers we face.
Take her boss. chief health officer Brett Sutton has huge powers under Victoria’s state of emergency to impose coronavirus bans, yet still found time in March to publish a paper warning that global warming, too, was an “existential threat”.
He recommended tough “whole-of-government” crackdowns to save us from alleged disasters such as “flooding, coastal inundation, bushfire, extreme wind, soil movement and extreme heat”.
Hmm. Sutton, like Van Diemen, seems prone to catastrophising. Indeed, just two weeks ago he was still claiming his coronavirus bans had saved 36,000 lives, when the NSW government was modestly claiming to have saved just 700.
Sutton was clearly still relying on discredited modelling by the Peter Doherty Institute, which used dodgy Chinese data to warn the virus would kill between 50,000 and 150,000 Australians. That modelling so panicked the Victorian government that it spent $1.3 billion to create 4500 intensive care beds. Just seven beds are being used.
Victoria overreacted because Sutton and Van Diemen report to a Premier, Daniel Andrews, who shares not just their politics but their alarmism, and has a disturbing streak of authoritarianism.
Andrews, of Labor’s Socialist Left faction, already had Australia’s most absurdly tough global warming policies, and now has the most absurd coronavirus laws as well.
He even defended his golf ban as a matter of life or death: “ I don’t need to play golf, and me playing golf is not worth someone’s life.” What a mad rationalisation. Golf with social distancing would kill nobody. Nor do we “need” to do anything that makes life worth living, including visiting family and friends, or just sitting at the beach to watch the sun go down.
Andrews’ response shows little respect for freedom. Nor does his solution to the economic devastation he is causing.
Alone among Australia’s leaders, he signed on to the “belt and road initiative” of China’s dictatorship, which aims to increase China’s reach and power through trade, investments and access to ports.- Andrew Bolt

Full text: We should just stick to the historical facts ANNALIESE Van Diemen’s tweet exposes the coronavirus gang.

Through a spokesman, Andrews last week said we now needed this deal with the dictatorship even more: “(These) opportunities will be more important than ever as we rebuild from this crisis.” So what Andrews destroyed with his bans, China will be invited to help rebuild. Does this not worry you, too?
COOKING THE BOOKS TO MARK James Cook landing at Botany Bay 250 years ago, the ABC somehow found activist Teresa Ardler.
Ardler said stories that Cook fired into the air to stop Aborigines throwing spears were “not the true history, because my grandfather was shot”.
Wow. Her grandfather must have lived to 200.
Amazingly, SBS, also taxpayer-funded, interviewed Rodney Kelly, also claiming descent from the man Cook stung with small shot.
Kelly claimed his ancestors said “Cook left casks of dynamite on the shore, rigged to blow up”. But dynamite wasn’t invented until 1867.Why did the ABC and SBS retail such nonsense?

Full text: THERE hasn’t been a lot of good news so far this year. But Prime Minister Scott Morrison had some to report this week.
The growth rate of new coronavirus cases in Australia had fallen rapidly, he said, and it had slowed “well beyond our expectations” so that tens of thousands of people had managed to avoid the deadly disease.
And yet, just when things seemed to be looking up, there was an unspoken asterisk on Morrison’s positive remarks. The perverse truth of this pandemic is that it is possible for Australia to be too successful in our response.
We are obviously lucky not to be in the position of places such as Italy, where doctors have to consider rationing ventilators for people below a certain age, or New York, where makeshift morgues are overflowing.
Modelling from Melbourne’s Doherty Institute this week showed the bullet we have so far dodged — 23 million Australians infected by an uncontrolled outbreak, 35,000 needing intensive care at the peak, and hospitals only having room for 15 per cent of those patients.
It predicted quarantine, isolation and social distancing measures could reduce community transmission by a third, meaning everyone who needed an intensive care bed would get one, Those unprecedented rules mean we have so far managed to “flatten the curve” and slow the spread of the virus, but how we defeat it rests on what University of Melbourne epidemiologist Tony Blakely calls a “wicked choice”.
If we keep slowing the virus, we become more vulnerable when lockdowns are lifted. But if we allow it to spread more quickly, it can get out of control and more people will die.
This dilemma is best explained by considering the normal flu season. When winter rolls around, we don’t shut pubs, close classrooms or stop playing football. Instead, we protect those in aged care, we get vaccinated and we let the virus run its course.
A lot of people do get sick — there were 65,000 confirmed cases here in 2019 — and the flu does claim lives, with 150 Victorians dying last year.
The truth is this is the price we have been willing to pay to achieve herd immunity, where enough people become resistant a virus cannot keep spreading.
But coronavirus is about twice as contagious as the flu, meaning it spreads faster and puts far greater pressure on the hospital system.
On the evidence so far, it is more deadly. And it does not have a vaccination, and likely won’t for a year or more, which means creating that artificial level of herd immunity is impossible.
A critical question now facing Morrison and the National Cabinet is whether they are willing to let the virus spread enough that some immunity is developed.
Chief Medical Officer Brendan Murphy hinted at this quandary this week, when he described Australia’s strategy “to identify, completely control and isolate every case”.
“That may be the long-term strategy. But we have to look at all of those potential options. There is no clear path,” he said.
Continuing to copy Wuhan — the epicentre of the virus — by trying to eradicate the virus would leave Australia without “any immunity in the population”, Murphy said, and mean keeping borders closed for a long time.
The alternative is to start relaxing some of the restrictions on lives to see how the virus reacts.
New South Wales is already talking about cafes and restaurants letting diners back in next month. But it’s easier said than done.
Even if the number of new cases dries up first, it would only take one infected person wandering back into their reopened local pub to spark another outbreak.
Morrison said this week some states could trial tapering off restrictions, but that likely would cost people their lives.
Our current contain-and-control strategy leaves little room for risk. Will Australians be willing to start gambling with the health of their loved ones? And if we place that bet and lose, will we cop giving up our freedoms all over again?
Perfect is the enemy of good. But if we avoid complacency, and we keep social distancing and staying home, then our response might be perfect. And that won’t be as good as we would like to think.

Full text: The coronavirus pandemic has arrived fast in slow motion. We watched as Wuhan was engulfed in a horror we could feel but which Australians without a connection to China could comfortably regard as foreign.
When Australian children started school at the beginning of February, cases stood at 12. By March 1, just 27 people had been confirmed with the virus. Italy was touching 1700.
That was barely a month ago. Now, Australia has 5800 cases and Italy 132,500. The pandemic has overwhelmed hospitals and frightened medical workers in New York. In Britain, Boris Johnson is in intensive care. Australians without a Chinese connection, will have one in Italy, in the United States or in Britain. The horror has become real for many, and now we finally have the modelling that shows what the virus might have been capable of here.
It has not, frankly, been presented in the most straightforward way, and it does not, oddly, mention the word death, other than to say how many have died to date. That is clearly a level of detail with which the authorities are not yet ready to trust us.
The Prime Minister and chief medical officer were also at pains on Tuesday to point out that the worst-case scenario was firmly in the zone of theory and, they said, completely unrealistic.
It does, however, explain why the pub is closed and you're sitting at a cobbled-together desk being over-sold as a home office with the kids at your feet and grandma in isolation.
As Doherty Professor of Mathematical Biology James McCaw said on Tuesday, his team had "put some scary numbers to the government early on", and, happily, "that wasn't dismissed". Instead, the government listened, which has "served us and our community well".
However, "what is absolutely clear is if we relaxed all of the current measures that would turn into an explosive outbreak and we would be in a very poor situation very quickly," he said.
Those scary numbers include the fact that 65 per cent of over 80 year olds are expected to end up in hospital if they catch the virus, along with 36 per cent of people in their 70s.
Ten per cent of people in their 50s are expected to need hospital care and it gets better down from there. Five per cent of people in their 40s, 3 per cent of people in their 30s, and fewer than 1 per cent of people in their 20s or younger are expected to end up in hospital.
The scary numbers also suggested a pandemic left to run its course would see 35,000 people needing intensive care treatment on the worst day. Australia has 2200 intensive care beds and is ramping that up to 5000 using ventilators from other parts of hospitals. The government has also ordered another 1000 and is working up to about 7500, including non-invasive ventilators that help people breathe rather than breathe for them. None of that goes near 35,000.
The Doherty Institute modelling is aimed at finding a scenario that we can all live with, literally. Kind of.
The modellers looked at what happens to the numbers if you isolate infected people and quarantine contacts. Not enough. You still end up with fewer than one-third of the people who need intensive care beds being able to access them.
So they went further, adding in social distancing. Only then did they get close.
All of this assumes intensive care capacity can be tripled, making five times as many beds available for coronavirus patients (assuming there are 1100 intensive care beds available for coronavirus patients at the moment, 22 of them in Canberra).
The base case assumes an infection rate of 2.53 if the spread is unmitigated (with each infected person infecting 2.53 others).
When social distancing cuts the infection rate (the R0) to 1.9, there's still a shortage of intensive care beds, with 80 per cent of people needing them able to access them. It is only finally at the infection rate of 1.69 that intensive care copes with the numbers.
So there it is finally, the number that is keeping the national pandemic team and our political leaders up at night and driving what you see around you.

Full text: THE number of coronavirus cases tied to the Gympie region has remained unchanged for the fourth day in a row, as case numbers continue to slow across Queensland.
A small jump of 13 took the total state cases to 934 yesterday, with those in the Sunshine Coast Health and Hospital Services staying at 84. The new cases brought Australia’s total to 5894 as of yesterday.
The death toll from the disease has continued to rise, with 46 people now having died after contracting the virus – five of those in Queensland.
More than 170 of Queensland residents to contract the disease have recovered, and the state has tested more than 58,000 residents.
Prime Minister Scott Morrison yesterday warned residents to stay home over the Easter break or risk coronavirus “horror scenarios”.
“This Easter weekend will be incredibly important. Stay at home,” Mr Morrison said.
“Failure to do so this weekend would completely undo everything we have achieved so far together, and potentially worse.” The long-called for modelling the Federal Government was relying on to control the pandemic was also released yesterday.
The models, created by the Doherty Institute, showed an unmitigated worst case scenario in which 90 per cent of Australians were infected.
If that happened, no more than 15 per cent of people in need of intensive care would have been admitted.
Chief medical officer Brendan Murphy called it an “horrendous scenario”. “A daily demand for new intensive care beds of 35,000-plus.”These forecasts were cut by the decision to close the borders and install self-isolation and quarantine measures.

Full text: Australians are at risk from an "explosive resurgence" of COVID-19 if social controls imposed to fight the pandemic are relaxed, top scientific advisers have warned in a new alert on long-term economic shutdowns.
The federal government's expert advisers predicted a surge in hospital admissions in the next fortnight from the spread of the coronavirus but forecast an easing in the pressure over time as the social curbs took effect.
The advice is founded on two scientific papers published yesterday after Prime Minister Scott Morrison released official modelling showing hospitals will have enough intensive care beds if the pandemic is contained to its current growth rate.
"What is absolutely clear is that if we relaxed any of the current measures, that would turn into an explosive outbreak driven by community transmission and we would be in a very poor situation very quickly," said University of Melbourne professor James McCaw.
The remarks confirm the long timeframe for business closures and curbs on social activity amid fears of a mounting economic cost, as Mr Morrison urged Australians to keep to the strict controls this Easter weekend.
While the modellers chose not to estimate the deaths that might have occurred without intervention such as travel bans and business closures, they found only 30 per cent of patients would have gained a hospital bed in an uncontrolled pandemic. The government said its approach lifted the ratio to 100 per cent.
Doherty Institute epidemiologist and University of Melbourne professor Jodie McVernon, one of the government's top expert advisers, cautioned against claims any single measure - such as school closures - could slow the spread of infection.
"We need to keep watching, we need to keep looking, we need to keep learning," she said.
Mr Morrison outlined the long-awaited modelling with an emphasis on the need for a six-month timeframe for the health and economic measures, compared to the three-month plans in other countries.
"We have bought valuable time but we cannot be complacent," he said. "We must keep the tension in the cord."
Chief Medical Officer Brendan Murphy said the country would have faced a "horrendous scenario" without the travel bans and other measures because the pandemic would have required daily demand from more than 35,000 patients for new intensive care beds.
In a teleconference to outline their findings, Professor McVernon and Professor McCaw said more work would be done over the next two weeks to calculate the impact of measures taken so far to keep infections down.
"We agree that given the control measures we have in place at the moment, we can see in the data that it looks like the curve is flattening and flattening strongly," said Professor McCaw, a professor of mathematical biology.
"There's fewer importations from returning travellers or returning Australians and it looks like community transmission is continuing to be well-suppressed.
"So in that sense you would say that it looks from a case infection point of view that a peak might have almost passed, or is passing, and then we will see a surge in hospitalisations in the coming week and then that would die away.
"But then of course we know that our population is still largely susceptible, so if we relaxed and went back to normal we would see a rapid, explosive resurgence in epidemic activity."
The warning highlights the tension both within and between governments over the timetable to ease the restrictions on economic activity, as Parliament meets today to vote on the $130 billion JobKeeper package to support 6 million jobs for six months. The new scientific papers were published by the Peter Doherty Institute for Infection and Immunity on Tuesday and supported the government modelling, but the document released by the government did not contain forecasts based on Australian data.
The government acknowledged more work would be done in the next two weeks on Australian figures to decide if further restrictions would be required or whether existing measures were adequate.
Professor McCaw said that Australia had reached a "critically important state" but could not maintain its strict controls forever.
That meant that the risk would remain because the epidemic would continue to spread around the world even if Australia brought it under control.

Terrible choice looms even if curve flattens

Full text: Australia's leaders must make a difficult choice in the next two weeks concerning the social distancing measures this nation is willing to live under long term and the death toll it is willing to bear.
The success of harsh social distancing rules means Australia appears close to passing the first peak of the coronavirus pandemic, as shown by one mathematical model, but leading epidemiologists say the moment Australia loosens those rules, infection rates will rise.
The pandemic will end only when enough people have been infected to achieve herd immunity or scientists develop a vaccine, at least 12 months away, experts say.
Epidemiologists have laid out two roads for the nation: Australia can live in total lockdown until a vaccine is developed. Or it can loosen restrictions and experience a higher death toll.
One option being canvassed in Britain is a cycle of loosening restrictions, then reintroducing them when infection rates rise. This could mean six months of openness and 12 months of lockdowns.
Professor Tony Blakely, one of Australia's leading epidemiologists, said: "Some of us are now wondering whether the social cure is worse than the disease."
Modelling by Professor Mikhail Prokopenko's University of Sydney team suggests if Australia maintains its social distancing rules, new infections could fall to almost zero by July. "It is quite likely the incidence peak is very close," he said. "We may have even passed it."
The federal government has promised to make its top-level modelling public on Tuesday, which will further inform the choices.
But epidemiologists say Australia is unlikely to eliminate the virus through social distancing.
"I think the consensus is, with the number of cases we have, it would be very difficult to drive the virus out altogether," University of Melbourne epidemiologist Professor John Mathews said.
Australia can remain in lockdown until a vaccine is developed or herd immunity reached, or loosen restrictions without overwhelming the health system. Herd immunity requires about 60 per cent of Australians to be infected so the virus stops circulating.
Scientists say a vaccine is 12 to 18 months away. But one may never be developed. "That's a scary possibility," said Professor Blakely, head of population interventions at the University of Melbourne's centre for epidemiology. That could mean a society trapped inside indefinitely. "Unemployment kills. Housing insecurity kills. Social isolation kills," he said.
The second option is a gradual loosening of social restrictions once new infections fall close to zero. People at lower risk could come out of their homes and return to work. Some pubs and cafes could reopen.
The lockdown would never end for high-risk groups. They would need to remain cloistered in their homes until a vaccine was developed or herd immunity established.

Money buys hope, but not trust

Full text: Historic spending to get us through the virus has bolstered confidence but voters deserve to know the health objective.
The verdict from one of Canberra's medical experts was direct this week when police in Sydney and Melbourne started warning Australians to leave their local parks and stay indoors.
Peter Collignon, an infectious diseases physician and a professor at the Australian National University, said the state decisions on hard lockdowns looked like "panic by politicians" rather than science.
His advice? Collignon said there was no good reason, other than official quarantine, to prevent someone going outside for fresh air, including exercise, provided they were not in groups and kept two metres away from each other.
It seemed like another small argument over the scale of the social-distancing rules, much like the hamfisted way the Victorian government told single people they could not visit their partners and then reversed the directive hours later. But there is a broader issue at stake in these disputes because the science suggests the shutdowns will last longer than expected. Much longer.
On some projections, the cycle of closing and reopening services will last until next year. Tony Blakely, an epidemiologist and a professor at the University of Melbourne, says the current approach could continue into 2021 in the hope a vaccine arrives.
This does not mean the shutdowns are failing. In fact, the consensus from the experts is that the first ones have worked well and the later ones will have an impact on case numbers over the next 10 days or so. It means confidence in the combined government response to the pandemic has never been more important. What is the endgame?
Is it herd immunity, eradication or a long hibernation until the vaccine comes? What is the strategy to get there?
Confidence is easy to claim but hard to achieve when only 30 per cent of the community trusts the federal government "to do the right thing for the Australian people" - a finding in the annual Scanlon Foundation social cohesion report last November. So our political leaders will have to change the way they are managing this crisis. We will need more transparency and better governance to get through the long months ahead.
The great boost to confidence this week was the $130 billion wage subsidy from Scott Morrison and Josh Frydenberg. The assistance is broad and the design is simple. No scheme will be perfect in an emergency but employers and unions are backing this one.
As someone on the Labor side of politics put it: "It's a gutsy call." This was said with admiration and an f-bomb. The package shows the Prime Minister and Treasurer are going as far as possible to save jobs.
Morrison's message about the "hibernation" of business is a reassuring concept (more than a fixed economic theory) that tells Australians there will be a thaw that allows them to restart. Many Australians will need that promise of spring to get them through anxious times filled with worry about their health, their jobs and their families.
Another boost to confidence came yesterday when Morrison promised free childcare for workers who can stay in their jobs through the slump. More help is due today for renters and landlords.
But what of confidence in the strategy to end the pandemic that has caused this economic havoc? The fundamental dynamic, as Morrison says, is that the health and economic objectives work against each other. The tougher the action to protect health, the greater the damage to the economy.
But there is another truth. Any action to protect the economy means nothing if governments fail on health. The astonishing blunder with the Ruby Princess - its passengers disembarked in Sydney only two weeks ago - is a reminder that everything depends on the decisions on health. Would the shutdowns be different if we did not have 400 coronavirus cases from that ship?
Ministers, officials and the cruise company executives have to be held accountable for that failure, but that cannot happen if parliaments are suspended for months.
Blakely thinks the current health measures are doing more than flattening the curve to slow the spread of the virus. He says they are "squashing the curve". But he cannot be sure of the final objective. While he believes it is too late for Australia to eradicate the virus, he says "herd immunity" remains a possible outcome - that is, the infection reaches 60 per cent of the population and the country becomes resistant to its spread.
The alternative? "Australia could continue squashing the curve for months and months till sometime in 2021, with a muted epidemic or two along the way, until a vaccine is available," he says.
The calculation is brutal. The approach means a lower mortality rate but much greater social and economic costs.
The number of beds in the intensive care units becomes the crucial benchmark on which to adjust everything else. Greater capacity not only brings better healthcare but also greater flexibility on shutdowns and
the economy.
Senior figures in the Morrison government regard herd immunity as "unconscionable" if it means letting the infection rip. Their approach appears to be to suppress the infection for as long as possible in the hope of a vaccine. Can Australians trust this strategy? This question is totally different to one about confidence in the $130 billion wage subsidy, which is easier to measure.
Australians deserve to have the health objective articulated and subject to real scrutiny, with at least two changes. First, Federal Parliament - after it resumes on Wednesday to vote on the economic plan - should have a continuing role in testing the health strategy. The British Parliament has a committee that has heard testimony from health officials during the crisis. Australia can surely do the same.
Second, state and federal governments need to release their modelling on the pandemic. The commonwealth's deputy chief medical officer, Paul Kelly, suggested on Tuesday he would do so this week. On Wednesday he backtracked. Voters should be able to see the information.
Morrison and his government have done much this week to shore up confidence. But why stop there?

Tougher measures ‘a matter of life or death’

Health experts say the government will have to further tighten social distancing measures that have shut down pubs, clubs and gyms if Australia is to slow the rate of COVID-19 infections to a level at which hospitals can cope.
Infectious disease modellers say the current round of restrictions would quarter the number of likely infections at the peak of the epidemic, but even with those social distancing measures in place, unless further measures were taken, Australia could still hit a peak of 125,000 infections a day — a level that would overwhelm the nation’s intensive care units.
In the past five days, Australia’s epidemic curve has tracked steeply upwards in what University of Sydney associate professor Tim Newsome described as an alarming manner. “I think what we’re seeing is very concerning,” he said.
“We’re looking very exponential at the moment. We are tracking in a way which could potent­ially overwhelm our health systems unless we start seeing effects from social distancing and more stringent measures.” Whether the moves to shut down public gathering spaces has been successful in flattening Australia’s curve of infections will not be known for another 10 days, but Professor Newsome said he believed governments in Australia would soon need to confine people to their homes, letting them go out only to buy food or medicine.
“My suspicion is we’re going to have to adopt stricter measures to really contain the spread,” he said.
Cases of COVID-19 are currently doubling every four days in Australia and heading towards a trajectory of a three-day doubling. If the epidemic were allowed to continue in this manner, University of Melbourne epidemiologist Tony Blakely said, infections could climb to as many as 500,000 a day within weeks.
Under that scenario, the reproductive number of the virus is 2.5 — meaning every person infected with the virus would pass it to 2½ others. Social distancing measures are likely to reduce the reproductive number, known as R0.
Professor Blakely has modelled the impact of social distancing measures and predicts the moves to close pubs, clubs, restaurants and sporting facilities could reduce the R0 to 1.2 by the end of May. That would see the epidemic peak at about 125,000 infections a day in late May, with 60 per cent of the population infected.
Based on modelling completed by epidemiologists from Imperial College London, and adapting their model to Australia, Professor Blakely predicts that by the epidemic’s end, 165,000 ­people, or 0.84 per cent of cases, would require intensive care, ­assuming 60 per cent of people of all ages were infected.
At the peak of the epidemic, almost 1400 people a day would require intensive care. The nation has a little over 2200 intensive care beds, and hospitals are ramping up their capacity to double that.
Based on a scenario of every ­patient warranting intensive care admission needing to stay there for at least four days, at the epidemic’s peak there could be as many as 5600 people a day requiring intensive care, not including those for other reasons.
The key to hospitals being able to cope with the surge in cases will be reducing the spread of the disease among the elderly, Professor Blakely said. “If we allow an epidemic to pass through and infect everybody at the same rate, 90 per cent of all deaths will be amongst 60-plus-year-olds.”Analysis of coronavirus infections data recorded by the federal Health Department reveals that those aged under 49 make up almost half of diagnosed cases.

Health experts say the government will have to further tighten social distancing measures that have shut down pubs, clubs and gyms if Australia is to slow the rate of COVID-19 infections to a level at which hospitals can cope.
Infectious disease modellers say the current round of restrictions would quarter the number of likely infections at the peak of the epidemic, but even with those social distancing measures in place, unless further measures were taken, Australia could still hit a peak of 125,000 infections a day — a level that would overwhelm the nation’s intensive care units.
In the past five days, Australia’s epidemic curve has tracked steeply upwards in what University of Sydney associate professor Tim Newsome described as an alarming manner. “I think what we’re seeing is very concerning,” he said.
“We’re looking very exponential at the moment. We are tracking in a way which could potent­ially overwhelm our health systems unless we start seeing effects from social distancing and more stringent measures.” Whether the moves to shut down public gathering spaces has been successful in flattening Australia’s curve of infections will not be known for another 10 days, but Professor Newsome said he believed governments in Australia would soon need to confine people to their homes, letting them go out only to buy food or medicine.
“My suspicion is we’re going to have to adopt stricter measures to really contain the spread,” he said.
Cases of COVID-19 are currently doubling every four days in Australia and heading towards a trajectory of a three-day doubling. If the epidemic were allowed to continue in this manner, University of Melbourne epidemiologist Tony Blakely said, infections could climb to as many as 500,000 a day within weeks.
Under that scenario, the reproductive number of the virus is 2.5 — meaning every person infected with the virus would pass it to 2½ others. Social distancing measures are likely to reduce the reproductive number, known as R0.
Professor Blakely has modelled the impact of social distancing measures and predicts the moves to close pubs, clubs, restaurants and sporting facilities could reduce the R0 to 1.2 by the end of May. That would see the epidemic peak at about 125,000 infections a day in late May, with 60 per cent of the population infected.
Based on modelling completed by epidemiologists from Imperial College London, and adapting their model to Australia, Professor Blakely predicts that by the epidemic’s end, 165,000 ­people, or 0.84 per cent of cases, would require intensive care, ­assuming 60 per cent of people of all ages were infected.

Full text: The GFC was a financial problem that could be addressed by financial measures and without the fear of making mistakes that could lead to the deaths of many people.
To address the coronavirus crisis, one has to weigh up how to save people without destroying the economy.
Then there is the added dimension of all the health initiatives which are being formulated on the run. The dramatic economic impacts of these public health initiatives are considered a reasonable price to pay to save lives.
The economic impacts also risk destroying the livelihoods of many individuals and families. They may well lead to the demise of some businesses and individuals.
Every course of possible action has its own unseen dangers. The government will be criticised regardless of what it does.
Commonsense is usually to be found somewhere in the middle between two extremes. It seems to me this government is steering that course.
That said, taking the middle ground will still attract just as much criticism, if not more. This is because many people are either all one way or the other. They see any compromise as a "half-measure".
For the first time, I am beginning to feel sorry for ScoMo. He has been presented with a no-win situation.
Philip White, Crace It's a worry The ABC and the National Press Club provided a great forum on Wednesday for acknowledged experts to advise the media and citizens on their fields of expertise in addressing questions on the coronavirus.
Professor Jodie McVernon, Director of Epidemiology at the Doherty Institute, went into great detail when explaining how widespread modelling by many agencies throughout Australia and overseas is ensuring government is receiving the best advice available on protecting us from this pandemic.
When questioned by a reporter on what the modelling was showing for the future of the pandemic in Australia, she stonewalled. It seemed she was not about to tell Australians how bad this was pandemic could become.
Pressed harder by the reporter, she stated categorically she would not disclose what the modelling indicated.
By not being forthright Professor McVernon has left viewers with the impression the future is really scary; perhaps as bad as that already experienced in other countries or worse.
If that is the case we need to know. Australians will take the COVID-19 pandemic much more seriously if they are told the truth.
Allan Gadsby, Kaleen Bring back the cars Just before the virus-inspired ban on large gatherings came into force, Canberra had a very successful week-long Night Noodle Market, Enlighten and hot air balloon festival on the lawns near Old Parliament House.
With NCA approval, this involved scores of two tonne vehicles delivering the balloons at dawn followed by over 300,000 people attending the night time activities.
When the current crowd restrictions are over, would it be too much to ask for the NCA to reconsider their ban on the holding of the occasional classic car display at the same venue?
Geoff Nickols, Griffith Testing dilemma Front line medical staff are in a difficult position because of the shortage of test kits.
There are strict rules about who can be tested. If you visit a clinic with your symptoms, but do not meet the criteria, don't panic. Stop and have a think.
There is no treatment. If you were tested and found positive you would simply be sent to home isolation.
If you are confident you have contracted the virus don't waste time abusing the poor worker. Go away and put yourself into home isolation. Problem solved.
If you feel better in a few days you can self-release without all the bureaucracy. If it turns out you had correctly diagnosed yourself, you will have the satisfaction of ringing the authorities and telling them you were right.
In the meantime you have been a good citizen and not infected others. Good on you.
G. Williams, Gowrie Keep the fights fair Re: "But it's discrimination ..." (Letters, March 20). A disabled person (one armed, blind, wheelchair bound etc.) may require the community shopping hour as, because they are physically less capable, they might not fare as well in a knife-fight in a supermarket aisle.
J M Merryt, Kaleen Think of others Look, I'm loath to sound trite here, but it's in straitened times that we need to be even more selfless. So, let's try our best to ensure our pantries are less full, our wallets less fat, and our toilet rolls ... well, you know. This is called social "vaccination".
Fr Peter Day, Queanbeyan, NSW A simple explanation (Dr) A. Thomson (Letters, March 20) asks: "Why haven't passenger planes, trains and buses been stopped from entering and leaving Canberra?".
Perhaps it's because most interstate visitors arrive by car.
Leon Arundell, Downer A historic day for AFL For the first time ever no one in the AFL crowd will doubt an umpire's eyesight or call them a white maggot.
It only took a worldwide crisis to achieve this.
Dennis Fitzgerald, Box Hill, Vic Get on with it The RAAF owns eight C-17 Globemaster transports.
That is enough heavy lift capacity to bring home a regiment of stranded Australians from any place on earth. Chile, for example.
P A Marshall, Braidwood, NSW Close the schools While I can understand all the motivations for avoiding school closures, I remain unconvinced by the rationale, unless we are sure that children are not silent transmitters of the coronavirus.
We seem to know that they suffer less if they contract it than older people do, and it is claimed they are less likely to get it, and that perhaps they don't transmit it as easily as older people.
But without widespread testing it not clear to me that we know how many people actually have this virus, or who is capable of spreading it.
A main issue with this particular virus appears to be that it can be caught from people who never develop signs of illness. This is why early, aggressive intervention is critical.
As a general rule, schools and child care centres are notorious spreaders of disease. Even if school children do not get sick themselves, they are sure-fire sources of contagion in the broader community.
Do we know that COVID-19 is the exception?
Jean Gifford, O'Connor Just do the job Thomas Natera (Letters, March 18) doesn't think anyone would not be praising the government's handling of the COVID-19 virus and the economy.
I am not praising Morrison and his government.
Their response to both, as with the bushfires, has been too little too late. I believe Morrison has selfishly used this disaster to try to regain some political credibility.
I am sick of seeing him, and other politicians, in front of flags pretending they have the situation in hand.
They don't.
I just want to hear expert advice and truth about the situation and how we can best deal with it.
David Groube, Guerilla Bay, NSW Racial and ageist divides COVID-19 has revealed some worrying biases. Initially it was a blaming racism towards people of Asian, especially Chinese, origin.
Now it seems that a patronising ageism is emerging.
For example, the oldies shopping debacle. Perhaps well-meaning people (but not Baby Boomers) decided the over 70s could have a special "oldies only" early shopping time.
It doesn't matter if the older shoppers wanted this or not, or if some other generations needed to shop at that time too.
More serious, and so upsetting I almost forgot to use my hand sanitiser, was a call for euthanasia of old people with dementia who clog up nursing homes (J Sweeney, Letters, March 18).
No person should ever have the right to decide whether another person lives or dies. The expectation of a peaceful and cared-for period at the end of life is normal, humane, and befitting of an intelligent and sophisticated society.
It would be bad if doctors and other health care professionals were expected to end life.
I'm optimistic that our educated, tough, resilient population can stay united and not fall into a blame and knee jerk reactivity.

Perhaps it's because most interstate visitors arrive by car.
Leon Arundell, Downer A historic day for AFL For the first time ever no one in the AFL crowd will doubt an umpire's eyesight or call them a white maggot.
It only took a worldwide crisis to achieve this.
Dennis Fitzgerald, Box Hill, Vic Get on with it The RAAF owns eight C-17 Globemaster transports.
That is enough heavy lift capacity to bring home a regiment of stranded Australians from any place on earth. Chile, for example.
P A Marshall, Braidwood, NSW Close the schools While I can understand all the motivations for avoiding school closures, I remain unconvinced by the rationale, unless we are sure that children are not silent transmitters of the coronavirus.
We seem to know that they suffer less if they contract it than older people do, and it is claimed they are less likely to get it, and that perhaps they don't transmit it as easily as older people.
But without widespread testing it not clear to me that we know how many people actually have this virus, or who is capable of spreading it.
A main issue with this particular virus appears to be that it can be caught from people who never develop signs of illness. This is why early, aggressive intervention is critical.
As a general rule, schools and child care centres are notorious spreaders of disease. Even if school children do not get sick themselves, they are sure-fire sources of contagion in the broader community.
Do we know that COVID-19 is the exception?
Jean Gifford, O'Connor Just do the job Thomas Natera (Letters, March 18) doesn't think anyone would not be praising the government's handling of the COVID-19 virus and the economy.
I am not praising Morrison and his government.
Their response to both, as with the bushfires, has been too little too late. I believe Morrison has selfishly used this disaster to try to regain some political credibility.
I am sick of seeing him, and other politicians, in front of flags pretending they have the situation in hand.
They don't.
I just want to hear expert advice and truth about the situation and how we can best deal with it.
David Groube, Guerilla Bay, NSW Racial and ageist divides COVID-19 has revealed some worrying biases. Initially it was a blaming racism towards people of Asian, especially Chinese, origin.
Now it seems that a patronising ageism is emerging.
For example, the oldies shopping debacle. Perhaps well-meaning people (but not Baby Boomers) decided the over 70s could have a special "oldies only" early shopping time.
It doesn't matter if the older shoppers wanted this or not, or if some other generations needed to shop at that time too.
More serious, and so upsetting I almost forgot to use my hand sanitiser, was a call for euthanasia of old people with dementia who clog up nursing homes (J Sweeney, Letters, March 18).
No person should ever have the right to decide whether another person lives or dies. The expectation of a peaceful and cared-for period at the end of life is normal, humane, and befitting of an intelligent and sophisticated society.
It would be bad if doctors and other health care professionals were expected to end life.
I'm optimistic that our educated, tough, resilient population can stay united and not fall into a blame and knee jerk reactivity.
Susan Archer, Yarralumla
