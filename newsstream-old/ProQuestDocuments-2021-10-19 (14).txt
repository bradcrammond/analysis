Full text: More COVID-19 restrictions in the ACT could be eased after the territory passed the milestone vaccination threshold of 80 per cent.
Chief Minister Andrew Barr said the vaccination rate - which means 80 per cent of people in the ACT aged 12 and over have had two doses of a COVID vaccine - triggered a further step in easing restrictions.
More detail would be provided on Tuesday, Mr Barr said in a post on Twitter.
Mr Barr has emphasised that it takes two weeks after the second dose of the vaccine is administered for it to give full protection.
Under the ACT's pathway forward roadmap for easing restrictions, the next changes are scheduled for October 29.
The ACT, which is on track to be one of the world's most vaccinated areas, has stopped reporting first-dose vaccinations above 99 per cent of the eligible population.
Professor Peter Collingon, an infectious diseases expert at the Australian National University, last week said a double-dose vaccination rate of 95 per cent was usually "as good as you could ever expect".
A national plan, agreed to by national cabinet, had set 80 per cent vaccination thresholds as a key milestone to ease restrictions, based on advice and modelling from the Doherty Institute.
The ACT's strict lockdown ended on Friday, but tough rules remain in place that severely limit businesses ability to trade.
Non-essential retail can operate click-and-collect services and have two people in the store at a time by booked appointment.

The ACT recorded 17 new cases of COVID-19 on Monday, while 17 people remain in hospital. There are nine people in intensive care with the virus in Canberra.
Chief health officer Dr Kerryn Coleman said it was important residents continued to get tested as soon as they felt even the mildest of symptoms.
"Testing remains a vital step in the way we manage COVID-19, especially now that we have eased restrictions," Dr Coleman said.

Full text: Congratulations, Canberra, for collectively rolling up your sleeve to get the COVID-19 vaccine.
In reaching a fully vaccinated rate of 70 per cent for people aged 16 and over, you have helped to get us well on the way to being able to safely reopen our country.
Thank you to all of the ACT healthcare workers for everything you have done.
You have been on the ground from the start, responding to the beginning of this pandemic last year, and now with the vaccine protecting us.
All states and territories are playing a vital role and fast closing in on this important milestone.
The day when we will achieve a fully vaccinated rate of 70 per cent in every state and territory is not far off - and it will be a testament to the resolve, resilience and fortitude of our nation.
Everyone from Townsville in North Queensland to Burnie in Tasmania who has made the decision to get vaccinated is protecting themselves and their community, and helping us get back to the things we all love to do.
With our nationwide double-dose rate now sitting at approximately 61 per cent and rising fast, Australians have again demonstrated we understand the benefits of vaccination and how it can save lives and avoid serious illness.
We have seen this through our world-leading child immunisation rates in general as well as the rate at which Australians are now getting vaccinated against COVID-19, exceeding rates of vaccination of many countries across the globe.

Every day we are getting closer. Every day we see records being met and exceeded. Every day we see more people across Australia roll up their sleeves.

School’s back for summer

Full text: Vaccination rates for children in NSW and Victoria have surged ahead of an easing of pandemic ­restrictions and an early return to school in the country’s largest state.
Dominic Perrottet, in one of his first major acts as NSW Premier, on Thursday unveiled an accelerated easing of restrictions that will have students back in schools by October 25, and double the number of visitors allowed in a home from Monday.
Fully vaccinated NSW residents will be able to welcome 10 visitors to their home, up from a limit of five, and socialise in groups of 30 outdoors, up from a cap of 20, from Monday, under a revised road map that Mr Perrottet ­labelled “measured and sensible”.
Mask requirements in offices will be scrapped at 80 per cent vaccination, slated for October 18, rather than 90 per cent.
The moves come as new commonwealth data obtained by The Australian shows 63 per cent of children between 12 and 15 years old in NSW have already received one dose of Covid-19 vaccine, less than a month after that age group became eligible.
In Victoria, that figure is 59 per cent, while more than 80 per cent of children in the ACT have also had their first vaccination.
Those rates are considerably higher than the national average – 49 per cent – and more than ­double those of other major states, including Queensland and Western Australia.
As NSW reached its 70 per cent double-dose target, Scott Morrison on Thursday said the rising vaccination rates demonstrated supply challenges had been ­addressed and the country was “on the home stretch”.
“I believe Australia can achieve much higher vaccination rates than the 70 and 80 per cent that we’ve set out in the national plan and that will only give us greater confidence and enable us to move even more quickly as we open the country up,” the Prime Minister said.
The Australian Technical Advisory Group on Immunisation is on Friday expected to announce that the immuno-compromised should be given a third dose of the Covid-19 vaccine, following moves in the EU that approved an extra dose 28 days after the second.
A recommendation by ATAGI on third jabs for the wider population is unlikely until next year, as health authorities monitor overseas programs, with the US, ­Britain, Israel and France among those countries already offering boosters.
ANU infectious diseases physician Peter Collignon said the “brilliant” uptake of the Covid-19 vaccine in 12-15 year olds could lead to restrictions being eased earlier than anticipated.
“The more people we vaccinate from any age group the better, because it means we will see a much lower risk of people getting the virus and passing the virus on to others,” he said.
“Basically, if people are vaccinated, it’s safer for them, safer for everyone else and means we can open up sooner.” Professor Collignon pointed to the fact that 12-15 year olds were not initially counted in the Doherty Institute modelling that would see Australia open up when 70 per cent of the population was vaccinated, with more freedoms being offered at 80 per cent. “Now that under-16s are getting vaccinated, it’s very possible we could see that road map moved forward because it means we may be able to relax things earlier.” Mr Morrison said the new road map for NSW was beginning the process of opening safely and staying safely open, calling it “the light at the end of the tunnel”.
“That’s what the national plan is about. When you hit those vaccination rates, you can open with certainty again and you can open safely with certainty again and you can stay open,” he said.
“We have passed the first major milestone for Australians getting their lives back.” Mr Morrison said residents now had the certainty to make plans and bookings for the months ahead.
“I want this to be a sign of hope to the rest of the country, partic­ularly those in Victoria, who I’m mindful of today, and here in the ACT, where the lockdowns continue.” However, the NSW moves were criticised on Thursday by the Australian Medical Association for “the potential sidelining of public health advice” after the state’s chief health officer, Kerry Chant, was notably absent from the press conference announcing the changes to the road map.
“The AMA is very concerned at the apparent shift in approach to the management of Covid-19 in NSW announced today”, AMA president Omar Khorshid said, warning the move could lead to “avoidable deaths”.
“The changes to the road map have occurred at the 11th hour without the presence of the chief health officer Dr Kerry Chant at the announcement,” he said.
The AMA supported the gradual opening up of the economy, but it was critical to observe the impact of each step on transmission and case numbers, otherwise NSW would still see hospitals become “completely overwhelmed” despite high vaccination rates, he said. “NSW must not be reckless at this critical time. That would cost more lives, cause more suffering, and put the economies of NSW and the nation at risk.” The move to bring forward face-to-face lessons for all students in NSW by October 25 comes despite estimates only 85 per cent of teachers are vaccinated, with November 8 set as the deadline.
NSW Teachers Federation president Angelo Gavrielatos said the low vaccination rate was because teachers had never been prioritised during the vaccine rollout.
“How do you intend to staff a school with all students present from October 25 when only 85 per cent of your workforce has been double-vaccinated?” he said. However, Mr Perrottet was unapologetic: “It’s a major relief for parents and their sanity, and … I want to thank all the teachers who are there getting vaccinated to ensure we can open our schools as safely as possible.”

'Deserve to know': Questions over secret hospital capacity report

Full text: Questions surround a secret report on how hospitals would manage under the strain of higher COVID-19 cases, as the stoush between the Morrison government and the states and territories over health funding intensifies.
The national cabinet has been handed a report which models demand on state and territory hospitals as the country reopens and case numbers rise.
Health Department boss Brendan Murphy said the study showed hospitals would be able to cope with the case numbers predicted in the Doherty Institute modelling.
Professor Murphy indicated he would support the release of the report, but noted that was a decision for the national cabinet.
ACT Health Minister Rachel Stephen-Smith said the territory had contributed to the report with the expectation that it would be made public.
Ms Stephen-Smith said there were concerns with how the document "framed" the capacity of the hospital system to cope with an increase in cases.
She suggested the report might have undersold the implications of a surge in case numbers for other aspects of the health system, including elective surgeries.
"Of course our hospital system will cope and manage surges of COVID-19," Ms Stephen-Smith said on Tuesday.
"What I think there is some concern about is the underestimation of the impact across our hospitals and health systems of having to do that ... [and] what that could potentially mean, if we see a big surge in [COVID-19] cases, for things like elective surgery."

Full text: Questions surround a secret report on how hospitals would manage under the strain of higher COVID-19 cases, as the stoush between the Morrison government and the states and territories over health funding intensifies.
The national cabinet has been handed a report which models demand on state and territory hospitals as the country reopens and case numbers rise.
Health Department boss Brendan Murphy said the study showed hospitals would be able to cope with the case numbers predicted in the Doherty Institute modelling.
Professor Murphy indicated he would support the release of the report, but noted that was a decision for the national cabinet.
ACT Health Minister Rachel Stephen-Smith said the territory had contributed to the report with the expectation that it would be made public.
Ms Stephen-Smith said there were concerns with how the document "framed" the capacity of the hospital system to cope with an increase in cases.
She suggested the report might have undersold the implications of a surge in case numbers for other aspects of the health system, including elective surgeries.
"Of course our hospital system will cope and manage surges of COVID-19," Ms Stephen-Smith said on Tuesday.
"What I think there is some concern about is the underestimation of the impact across our hospitals and health systems of having to do that ... [and] what that could potentially mean, if we see a big surge in [COVID-19] cases, for things like elective surgery."

Full text: EXCLUSIVE VICTORIANS caught at coronavirus exposure sites could avoid staying home for two weeks, with isolation rules to be overhauled as vaccination targets are reached and the state reopens.
The Herald Sun can reveal state and federal authorities are considering relaxing isolation requirements for those who are fully vaccinated, while aiming contact tracing resources at controlling outbreaks in high-risk areas.
The Doherty Institute, which is modelling the effect of new containment models, has backed the shift and told national cabinet to move away from the existing “zero tolerance” tracing approach.
Experts say this is crucial to avoid the chaos seen in Britain, where an estimated 1.7 million people – in a country of 67 million – were forced to isolate after they were caught at exposure sites when restrictions were eased.
Britain’s so-called “pingdemic”, fuelled by its Bluetooth tracing app, caused widespread workforce shortages before the government scrapped the isolation rule for those who were fully vaccinated and instead encouraged them to be tested.
Victorian authorities are already allowing fully vaccinated healthcare workers who are exposed to Covid-19 to return to work if they return a negative test after five days, with daily saliva tests and two more PCR tests also required.
Under existing rules, Victorians who visit tier 1 exposure sites must isolate for 14 days, and are only released after two negative test results.
In its latest report to the national cabinet, the Doherty Institute said tracing and isolation measures would shift to target “transmission reduction, allowing a lesser focus on casual and place-based contact tracing outside high-risk settings”.
Institute epidemiology director Professor Jodie McVernon said once vaccination thresholds were met, it was time to scale back “low yield” tracing measures designed to find every last case, and instead implement “more efficient and sustainable processes”.
Deakin University epidemiology chair Professor Catherine Bennett said authorities “don’t have to find every case in the future” and should make tracing in high-risk settings the priority.
She said secondary contacts at exposure sites could be asked to have a test instead of isolating for 14 days.
A spokeswoman for federal Health Minister Greg Hunt said the national medical expert panel was examining revised leave requirements for health workers, while a state government spokesman said they would have “more to say soon” about revised rules. ANDREW BOLT, PAGE 19

Premier draws a line on borders

Publication info: The Australian ; Canberra, A.C.T. [Canberra, A.C.T]. 24 Sep 2021: 1.

Full text: Queensland Premier Annastacia Palaszczuk has thrown holiday travel plans into doubt, saying lifting border restrictions even after vaccine coverage reaches 80 per cent would be a “backward” step.
Ms Palaszczuk did not say what level of Covid-19 vaccination would be needed to safely reopen to NSW and Victoria, adding a national reopening plan had “not been finalised”.
“If you look at the national plan, the 80 per cent actually takes you backwards and I do not want that for Queensland, so we’re probably going to see a difference for Western Australia and Queensland because at the moment we have freedoms,” she said on Thursday.
Her comments came as NSW recorded 1063 new infections – and six deaths – while Victoria had 766 cases. There are fears that the virus could spread more widely in Melbourne after a man who attended a protest at the Shrine of Remembrance on Wednesday tested positive and was taken to hospital.
The Victorian government began easing restrictions on vaccinated residents stuck in Canberra and NSW, and will allow them to return home provided they have tested negative.
Queensland industry groups and tourism operators reliant on interstate travel criticised Ms Palaszczuk’s comments, and said they needed clarity to prepare for the coming summer holiday season. Ms Palaszczuk, asked about lifting health restrictions, said she would need to see additional health modelling.
“At the moment, Queenslanders have more freedoms now than Victorians will when they reach 80 per cent vaccinated,” she said. “In NSW, you have a massive Delta outbreak, so you have to go and ask the NSW government what is their plan for Christmas?” State and territory leaders in July agreed to a pathway to freedom based on vaccination rate thresholds recommended by the Doherty Institute. Under the plan, fully vaccinated Australians would be exempt from “all domestic restrictions” once 80 per cent of the population older than 16 was vaccinated.
But on Thursday, Ms Palaszczuk said Queenslanders would enjoy more freedoms at home than “if they hopped on a plane and went to Tokyo”.
“Where are you going to go? Are you going to go to India? In Tokyo, you have to sit in perspex screens with masks on and if you remove your mask you can’t talk while you’re eating,” she said.
Queensland Tourism Industry Council chief executive Daniel Gschwind said the state needed “a path to re-engage with the rest of Australia and the rest of the world”. “We know Queenslanders are very protective of the excellent health situation here and nobody wants to put that at risk,” he said.
“But at some point we have to make a leap of faith and trust in the vaccine protecting us alongside other health measures – tracing, testing social distancing.” Cairns Adventure Group owner Roderic Rees said 90 per cent of his customers were locked out of the state. “We had 75 on the payroll in June and last week we paid 23 people,” he said.
Mr Rees supported limiting freedoms for unvaccinated people if it meant borders could reopen to those who had been fully vaccinated against Covid-19.
“National cabinet has set that 80 per cent vaccination target and Queensland should stick to their guns on that and let people know what is going to change when we get there,” he said.
“We need to have the borders open and people travelling before Christmas – that needs to happen.” The latest vaccination figures show 74.1 per cent of adults have had at least one dose, while 49.3 per cent are fully vaccinated.
NSW will reach 80 per cent coverage for adults in mid-October, with Victoria following in November. Queensland is expected to reach that vaccine coverage level in December.
When asked whether she could give regional businesses more clarity after national cabinet meets next week, Ms Palaszczuk said: “If we get a Delta outbreak here, we’ll be in lockdown and all businesses will be closed. Do you want that?
“I don’t understand this constant criticism of Queensland doing well.” LNP MP Amanda Camm, whose northern Queensland electorate covers the Whitsunday Islands popular with tourists, said operators feared the state would remain closed while international travel restarted for other states.
“The goalposts keep moving,” she said. “People want to see their family on the other side of the country at Christmas. We need a clear plan with clear targets so people are incentivised to go out and get vaccinated.” In a push to increase the state’s lagging vaccination rollout, the state government teamed up with the NRL to offer free tickets to people receiving vaccinations.
It was scrapped hours after its launch when the Therapeutic Goods Administration deemed it non-compliant with its rules.
Health Minister Yvette D’Ath said the decision was “bureaucracy gone mad”, although she admitted to not having read the rules on offering incentives.
“Are we supposed to be vaccinating people against Covid in this country or not,” she said.
PALASZCZUK ON ...
THE NATIONAL CABINET ROADMAP If you look at the national plan, the 80 per cent actually takes us backwards. So I don’t want that for Queensland FREEDOMS At the moment, Queenslanders have more freedoms now than Victorians will when they reach 80 per cent vaccinated REOPENING FOR CHRISTMAS In NSW, you have a massive Delta outbreak, so you have to go and ask the NSW government what is their plan for Christmas?
OVERSEAS TRAVEL Where are you going to go? Are you going to go to India? In Tokyo, you have to sit in perspex screens with masks on and if you remove your mask you can’t talk while you’re eating DOMESTIC TRAVEL Queenslanders would probably enjoy greater freedoms travelling around Queensland than if they hopped on a plane and went to Tokyo

Full text: Domestic rapid antigen and at-home testing manufacturers have not been engaged with by the federal government, despite numerous calls for the kits to be offered once lockdowns end.
The Canberra Times understands no engagement or correspondence has occurred between either the Department of Health, or the Health Ministers office and local tech companies already selling testing kits in the US, UK and the European Union.
Queensland-based AnteoTech which makes rapid antigen and screening tests for the European market, confirmed the Commonwealth and most state and territory governments have not contacted the company in relation to its EuGeni testing technology, which is currently subject to a fast-tracked approval process from the Therapeutics Goods Administration.
AnteoTech chairman Jack Hamilton said all levels of government need to begin implementing plans on rapid-antigen testing to ensure workplaces and communities will be equipped to conduct tests when living with the virus begins.
"I suspect at the moment is still formative, it's ... the position that government has really only changed through the Sydney outbreak," he said.
"I think the government will need to keep working up ... what is [the] role for rapid testing."
It is also understood at-home testing kit company Ellume, which is also based in Brisbane and already selling in the US market, has also not been engaged by any Australian level of government.
Ellume's home testing kits are currently banned for use in Australia under TGA laws prohibiting at-home testing for contagious diseases, however the regulator does have the power to allow the use of the products at its discretion.
The TGA has done this in the past for at-home HIV and influenza testing kits.
Health Minister Greg Hunt said the federal government supports the implementation of rapid antigen and at-home testing, but will require the support of the states and territories.

"We strongly support the use of rapid antigen testing in alternate settings including at the home."
It is unclear whether Australia will face supply constraints when ordering rapid tests in the global market, similar to what has occurred with the procurement of vaccines this year.
Conversations about Australia adopting rapid testing and whether it should be subsidised comes as NSW recorded 935 new locally acquired COVID-19 cases and four deaths, while Victoria posted 567 new cases and one fatality.
The UK government subsidised rapid antigen testing to assist in lowering virus numbers in workplaces, schools and events, a move which Mr Hamilton says the Commonwealth need to consider.
Ernst and Young is anticipated to release modelling to look at the ongoing structural impacts virus disruptions will have on the economy once vaccination targets are reached and lockdowns end.
The Doherty Institute on Monday flagged rapid antigen testing is not as accurate as a traditional PCR test, but flagged it could be used once the country moves to a "risk reduction" model rather than an elimination strategy.
"Clearly these things need to be done within their license indications, they need to be done safely and proportionately and usefully, and there needs to be a clear framework about how it can be done," epidemiologist Jodie McVernon said.

Full text: EDITORIAL THERE is no denying that Premier Annastacia Palaszczuk has been very successful so far in “keeping Queenslanders safe” through the global Covid-19 pandemic. There is also no denying this success has translated into political popularity.
If a state election were held today, there is little doubt Ms Palaszczuk and her Labor Party would be returned with an even greater majority than they were 11 months ago (with a comfortable five-seat majority on the back of a 53-47 two-party-preferred vote). With the two big southern states locked down now for months while we in Queensland enjoy almost-normal freedoms, you could comfortably assume the incumbent government would be even further ahead now.
Obviously, that is moot because our fixed-terms model means the next election is set for October 26, 2024. But politicians always keep one eye on the opinion polls, no matter what they might publicly say.
That being the case, when viewed solely through a political lens, there is zero political reason the Premier would take any chances when it comes to Covid-19. The longer Queensland can remain free of the virus that has ravaged the rest of the world, the better things will be politically for the politician that Ms Palaszczuk is.
Little wonder, then, that Labor insiders are now actively briefing out the idea of shifting to 90 per cent the current 80 per cent (of the eligible population fully vaccinated) trigger for our state border to be reopened, and for region-wide lockdowns being taken off the table.
Such a move would – politically – make sense. Internal Labor polling is understood to be – unsurprisingly – showing a massive spike in how much Queenslanders now value their freedoms as the situation in NSW and Victoria reach the point of no-return.
Keeping the border closed to those virus-ridden southerners has therefore quickly become just about the biggest no-brainer that history has ever gifted to a populist Queensland premier.
As we report today, Queensland could hit 80 per cent of our over-16 population double-jabbed as soon as November 12 – coincidentally the same day the nation is due to reach that milestone. Under the national cabinet agreement struck prior to the NSW and Victoria outbreaks, that would trigger all border restrictions to be dropped – and lockdowns deemed to be a measure of last resort, and then only imposed at a localised level.
But – and this is the point the Premier has been, perhaps a little clumsily, making – that agreement was struck when there were no Covid cases in Australia. Opening up the nation now would be a totally different ballgame, as it would all but ensure outbreaks within days right across Queensland.
In that context, you can understand why those political operatives working for a naturally risk-averse Premier whose entire focus is on Covid are flying a kite around the lifting of the 80 per cent threshold for our state to reunify with the rest of Australia.
The Premier is still publicly saying it is still too early to speculate on what might happen at 80 per cent. After all, that milestone remains at least seven or eight weeks away. In the meantime, she repeats whenever asked: “We are waiting on updated Doherty Institute modelling before we can make those decisions.” We understand that living a life free from Covid is a glorious thing. Being able to turn up to a full Suncorp Stadium is wonderful. As is having a dinner out with friends or family, or just the simple pleasure of a pint at the pub with your mates.
But we can’t shut ourselves off from the world indefinitely. And yet there are two statistics that worryingly indicate this could be the reality if the government does decide to shift to 90 per cent.
The first is that 90 per cent of people aged over 16 in Australia (the standard benchmark for Covid jab rates) equates to 72 per cent of the entire population. Just 13 nations have so far managed Covid jab rates that high. The UK is stuck at 66 per cent, Canada 70 per cent, and the US 54 per cent.
Even more worrying is that the threshold would have to be hit both in Queensland and nationally – and 13.4 per cent of Queensland adults are still saying they are unwilling to be vaccinated against Covid. Across Australia, that rate is at 9.4 per cent. There is a real chance our Covid jab rates will never top 90 per cent. All that being the case, it looks – sadly – prudent for Queenslanders to delay making any plans for an interstate Christmas holiday.

Full text: VAX-A-NATION OVID-19 VACCINATION GUIDE The sooner we’re jabbed, the sooner we can all be free again, writes Lieutenant General John Frewen AS co-ordinator-general of Operation Covid Shield, I am constantly talking to people from around the country and from all walks of life to ensure our vaccine rollout program is as effective as possible.
It’s always interesting to hear what motivated a particular person to get vaccinated, or if they haven’t yet had the jab, what would encourage them to do so.
There is a very clear theme to people’s motivation. For people in lockdowns (or who have had to live through them), it’s about getting our freedoms back so we can return to the way of life we enjoyed before the pandemic.
It’s simple things like being able to go out for dinner, instead of getting takeaway. Or going to the hairdresser. Or a mate’s place for a barbecue. Or the footy.
Or swinging a golf club. Or seeing a family member we haven’t been able to see for months. Or getting kids back to school – in part, so they can see their friends again.
Of course, it’s also bigger things such as having the certainty to plan a wedding without fearing it may have to be postponed – yet again!
For others, who are older or who have medical conditions, the motivation might be self-protection – preventing severe Covid-19, which can be a devastating and fatal illness.
I understand all of these motivating factors and it just underscores why it is so important for everyone who is eligible to get vaccinated.
For me, I am looking forward to spending time with my family and friends, knowing that I am protecting them and myself by being double-dosed.
The good news is that we are setting new vaccination records almost every day. And I really think the day when we can start to ease restrictions is now in sight.
The Doherty Institute modelling shows if we can hit the 70 and 80 per cent double-dose marks nationwide, and in every state and territory, we can start to open up the country with less likelihood of having to go back into lockdowns.
As of Thursday, our first-dose nationwide vaccination rate was 69.8 per cent, and for second doses, it was 44.7 per cent.
Approximately 23.7 million vaccine doses had been administered across the country.
We know approximately 80 per cent of Australians are either vaccinated or have indicated an intention to get vaccinated, and the current weekly numbers back that in.
Very importantly, we are protecting the health of our most vulnerable Australians. More than 91 per cent of those 70 and over have had a first dose, and about 72 per cent have had a second dose.
Every residential aged-care facility, nationwide, has had both first and second vaccination clinics visit to protect senior Australians.
We are also implementing a plan to significantly accelerate the rate Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Australians are vaccinated to match – or achieve rates even higher than – the wider population when we start to hit the 70 and 80 per cent rates across the country.
We now have three vaccines approved for use in Australia: Pfizer, AstraZeneca, and Moderna. All three are highly effective at reducing the risk of severe illness and death from Covid-19 and all are effective in reducing transmission of the virus.
All three have been approved for use by the Therapeutic Goods Administration, and have been – and will continue to be – incorporated into our rollout program on the advice of the Australian Technical Advisory Group on Immunisation. Our experts at the TGA and ATAGI are world class, so you can be absolutely reassured the vaccine you are offered has been rigorously assessed for its safety and effectiveness.
An important part of the vaccine rollout is to protect Australian children, and the TGA and ATAGI have approved the use of the Pfizer and Moderna vaccines for those aged 12 and over.
Getting a jab is now even more convenient, with Moderna being rolled out through pharmacies.
Everyone who gets a jab is not only protecting themselves, but also their family, friends and their community. They also get us closer to the 70 per cent mark, and then the 80 per cent mark, to enable us to safely reopen our country.
Australia has a very proud history of vaccination – from our world-leading immunisation rates for children, to ensuring our country is free of awful diseases such as polio. I encourage every eligible Australian who is not yet vaccinated against Covid-19 to continue this tradition by rolling up their sleeve to get a Covid jab.

Full text: The sooner we’re jabbed, the sooner we can all be free again, writes Lieutenant General John Frewen
AS co-ordinator-general of Operation Covid Shield, I am constantly talking to people from around the country and from all walks of life to ensure our vaccine rollout program is as effective as possible.
It’s always interesting to hear what motivated a particular person to get vaccinated, or if they haven’t yet had the jab, what would encourage them to do so.
There is a very clear theme to people’s motivation. For people in lockdowns (or who have had to live through them), it’s about getting our freedoms back so we can return to the way of life we enjoyed before the pandemic.
It’s simple things like being able to go out for dinner, instead of getting takeaway. Or going to the hairdresser. Or a mate’s place for a barbecue. Or the footy.
Or swinging a golf club. Or seeing a family member we haven’t been able to see for months. Or getting kids back to school – in part, so they can see their friends again.
Of course, it’s also bigger things such as having the certainty to plan a wedding without fearing it may have to be postponed – yet again!
For others, who are older or who have medical conditions, the motivation might be self-protection – preventing severe Covid-19, which can be a devastating and fatal illness.
I understand all of these motivating factors and it just underscores why it is so important for everyone who is eligible to get vaccinated.
For me, I am looking forward to spending time with my family and friends, knowing that I am protecting them and myself by being double-dosed.
The good news is that we are setting new vaccination records almost every day. And I really think the day when we can start to ease restrictions is now in sight.
The Doherty Institute modelling shows if we can hit the 70 and 80 per cent double-dose marks nationwide, and in every state and territory, we can start to open up the country with less likelihood of having to go back into lockdowns.
As of Thursday, our first-dose nationwide vaccination rate was 69.8 per cent, and for second doses, it was 44.7 per cent.
Approximately 23.7 million vaccine doses had been administered across the country.
We know approximately 80 per cent of Australians are either vaccinated or have indicated an intention to get vaccinated, and the current weekly numbers back that in.
Very importantly, we are protecting the health of our most vulnerable Australians. More than 91 per cent of those 70 and over have had a first dose, and about 72 per cent have had a second dose.
Every residential aged-care facility, nationwide, has had both first and second vaccination clinics visit to protect senior Australians.
We are also implementing a plan to significantly accelerate the rate Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Australians are vaccinated to match – or achieve rates even higher than – the wider population when we start to hit the 70 and 80 per cent rates across the country.
We now have three vaccines approved for use in Australia: Pfizer, AstraZeneca, and Moderna. All three are highly effective at reducing the risk of severe illness and death from Covid-19 and all are effective in reducing transmission of the virus.
All three have been approved for use by the Therapeutic Goods Administration, and have been – and will continue to be – incorporated into our rollout program on the advice of the Australian Technical Advisory Group on Immunisation. Our experts at the TGA and ATAGI are world class, so you can be absolutely reassured the vaccine you are offered has been rigorously assessed for its safety and effectiveness.
An important part of the vaccine rollout is to protect Australian children, and the TGA and ATAGI have approved the use of the Pfizer and Moderna vaccines for those aged 12 and over.
Getting a jab is now even more convenient, with Moderna being rolled out through pharmacies.
Everyone who gets a jab is not only protecting themselves, but also their family, friends and their community. They also get us closer to the 70 per cent mark, and then the 80 per cent mark, to enable us to safely reopen our country.
Australia has a very proud history of vaccination – from our world-leading immunisation rates for children, to ensuring our country is free of awful diseases such as polio. I encourage every eligible Australian who is not yet vaccinated against Covid-19 to continue this tradition by rolling up their sleeve to get a Covid jab.

AMA calls on suffering cities to take it slow

Full text: The Australian Medical Association has cautiously backed the national plan for reopening and says there is no need to vaccinate children as a prerequisite to ending lockdowns, but cities with major outbreaks may need to reopen slower than planned to prevent overwhelming hospitals.
In what it calls a "middle ground" position paper made public today, the peak medical body broadly backs the Doherty Institute's thresholds for reopening the country once 70 and 80 per cent of the population aged 16 and over is vaccinated.
But it tells policymakers that easing restrictions with a large number of new infections a day risks overloading contact tracers and hospitals, and calls for maintaining for longer "high-impact public health measures" in Sydney and Melbourne.
"There's a lot more at stake here than just our ability to go back to our normal lives and go out for dinner," AMA federal president Omar Khorshid said.
The communique comes amid debate over whether 12- to 15-year-olds - who are eligible for a Pfizer jab - should be vaccinated before lockdowns end, and whether the thresholds for reopening should be more ambitious.
Perth-based Dr Khorshid said it was not necessary to wait until that teenage cohort was vaccinated before opening borders. Instead, the AMA is calling for all age groups to be included in vaccination targets for the final "phase D" of the reopening plan, which largely resembles pre-COVID settings.
"We are seeing a lot of research from around the world that the impact of COVID on children is vastly lower than on adults," he said. "We're going to be able to watch what happens in Sydney ... and it's clear that Sydney is not going to wait for childhood vaccinations."
The AMA's statement, backed by its 35-member federal council, is intended to bridge a growing divide between those agitating for a faster reopening and those calling for more caution.
Dr Khorshid said there were strong views on either side and "both are kind of right, so what we're saying is if you do the right things, if you follow the Doherty report properly and not just pick the bits you like, there is a path out".
On Friday - after the AMA's communique was finalised - the Doherty Institute provided updated advice to national cabinet saying "medium" public health measures may be prudent if daily case numbers were still in the thousands while vaccination rates rose from 70 to 80 per cent.
Likewise, the AMA's communique says lockdowns remain a necessary and effective tool while vaccination rates climb, "however, the emergence of the Delta strain has shown that it is very difficult to achieve elimination through lockdowns and we know that they come at a significant social and economic cost that is not sustainable".
The AMA cautions politicians against promoting the easing of restrictions as "freedom day". Dr Khorshid said the NSW government's gradual reopening at 70 per cent next month was reasonable on paper but questioned the timing given hospitalisations are predicted to peak at the same time.
"We're not saying NSW is doing the wrong thing in terms of how much they're opening," he said. "Our only concern there is whether they've done the modelling to know whether their hospital system can cope."
Separately, federal Treasurer Josh Frydenberg predicted the economy would roar back to life when lockdowns end and renewed calls for premiers to stick to the national reopening plan.

Full text: The sooner we’re jabbed, the sooner we can all be free again, writes Lieutenant General John Frewen AS co-ordinator-general of Operation Covid Shield, I am constantly talking to people from around the country and from all walks of life to ensure our vaccine rollout program is as effective as possible.
It’s always interesting to hear what motivated a particular person to get vaccinated, or if they haven’t yet had the jab, what would encourage them to do so.
There is a very clear theme to people’s motivation. For people in lockdowns (or who have had to live through them), it’s about getting our freedoms back so we can return to the way of life we enjoyed before the pandemic.
It’s simple things like being able to go out for dinner, instead of getting takeaway. Or going to the hairdresser. Or a mate’s place for a barbecue. Or the footy.
Or swinging a golf club. Or seeing a family member we haven’t been able to see for months. Or getting kids back to school – in part, so they can see their friends again.
Of course, it’s also bigger things such as having the certainty to plan a wedding without fearing it may have to be postponed – yet again!
For others, who are older or who have medical conditions, the motivation might be self-protection – preventing severe Covid-19, which can be a devastating and fatal illness.
I understand all of these motivating factors and it just underscores why it is so important for everyone who is eligible to get vaccinated.
For me, I am looking forward to spending time with my family and friends, knowing that I am protecting them and myself by being double-dosed.
The good news is that we are setting new vaccination records almost every day. And I really think the day when we can start to ease restrictions is now in sight.
The Doherty Institute modelling shows if we can hit the 70 and 80 per cent double-dose marks nationwide, and in every state and territory, we can start to open up the country with less likelihood of having to go back into lockdowns.
As of Thursday, our first-dose nationwide vaccination rate was 69.8 per cent, and for second doses, it was 44.7 per cent.
Approximately 23.7 million vaccine doses had been administered across the country.
We know approximately 80 per cent of Australians are either vaccinated or have indicated an intention to get vaccinated, and the current weekly numbers back that in.
Very importantly, we are protecting the health of our most vulnerable Australians. More than 91 per cent of those 70 and over have had a first dose, and about 72 per cent have had a second dose.
Every residential aged-care facility, nationwide, has had both first and second vaccination clinics visit to protect senior Australians.
We are also implementing a plan to significantly accelerate the rate Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Australians are vaccinated to match – or achieve rates even higher than – the wider population when we start to hit the 70 and 80 per cent rates across the country.
We now have three vaccines approved for use in Australia: Pfizer, AstraZeneca, and Moderna. All three are highly effective at reducing the risk of severe illness and death from Covid-19 and all are effective in reducing transmission of the virus.
All three have been approved for use by the Therapeutic Goods Administration, and have been – and will continue to be – incorporated into our rollout program on the advice of the Australian Technical Advisory Group on Immunisation. Our experts at the TGA and ATAGI are world class, so you can be absolutely reassured the vaccine you are offered has been rigorously assessed for its safety and effectiveness.
An important part of the vaccine rollout is to protect Australian children, and the TGA and ATAGI have approved the use of the Pifzer and Moderna vaccines for those aged 12 and over.
Getting a jab is now even more convenient, with Moderna being rolled out through pharmacies.
Everyone who gets a jab is not only protecting themselves, but also their family, friends and their community. They also get us closer to the 70 per cent mark, and then the 80 per cent mark, to enable us to safely reopen our country.
Australia has a very proud history of vaccination – from our world-leading immunisation rates for children, to ensuring our country is free of awful diseases such as polio. I encourage every eligible Australian who is not yet vaccinated against Covid-19 to continue this tradition by rolling up their sleeve to get a Covid jab.

Rapid testing fast-tracked for homes

Full text: Federal Health Minister Greg Hunt has asked the country's medical regulator to urgently consider the widespread use of rapid antigen testing in workplaces and in homes as the federal government presses ahead with plans to allow Australians to travel overseas by the end of the year.
Rapid antigen testing is used in many contexts overseas including in the US and Britain as a way of monitoring COVID-19 cases but has not yet been broadly deployed in Australia.
Chief Nursing and Midwifery Officer Alison McMillan advised people to get ready for mobile phone apps that would trace their location if the country embraced home quarantine.
Mr Hunt said introducing home-based testing and quarantine, as well as the digital vaccination certificate and a new digital border pass, would bring Australians closer to overseas travel.
"We want to see Australians to be able to travel overseas at the earliest possible time," he said yesterday. "I'm hopeful that these tests will be available at the earliest possible time for workplaces, and then subsequently, once we have the support of the AHPPC [Australian Health Protection Principal Committee], within the home," he said.
About 68.5 per cent of the eligible population aged 16 and over have had at least one dose of a COVID-19 vaccine, while 43.2 per cent are fully vaccinated.
New modelling from the Doherty Institute will be unveiled at national cabinet on Friday which will reinforce the four-phase national plan to start opening up when 70 per cent of the eligible population is vaccinated. It is expected to provide more evidence that it is safe to move into phases B and C of the plan even with the higher case load and the Delta strain in Victoria and NSW.
The institute will also be asked to model the effect of increasing the number of international passengers arriving under phases C and D of the plan, according to senior government sources.
The Department of Home Affairs and Australian Border Force is also in the early stages of devising a two-zone system at the country's airports whereby countries with relatively low COVID-19 cases would be marked "green" and nations with a higher number of cases would be "red".
Key to raising international arrival caps is the introduction of home quarantine.
Ms McMillan said relying on police to visit people in home quarantine required a lot of resources and could be replaced by mobile phone apps using geolocation technology to ensure people remained in isolation.
Prime Minister Scott Morrison last week wrote to all state and territory leaders asking them to set timetables for their introduction of home quarantine and he wants to hear from them at national cabinet this week on their plans.
South Australia has already begun a home-based quarantine trial whereby people have to download the Home Quarantine SA app to access their testing schedule, complete daily symptom checks and confirm their location with regular check-ins.
The states and territories will be aided by a new digital border pass which will apply to all travellers entering the country and will be introduced within months.

Full text: Pfizer incentive ON Wednesday the new vaccination hub opening in Pooraka for northern suburbs residents was announced.
On Channel 7 news, it was mentioned that anyone over 60 going there would be allowed to have the Pfizer vaccine. I have no argument with that – it’s a great idea. But what about those of us from other areas of the city?
Especially those who live alone, and after vaccination with AstraZeneca, have to live for a month with the anxiety of wondering if we could suffer a serious side effect of the vaccine with no one there to help?
It would be nice to think that we are worthy of the consideration now being given to the concerns of the over-60s in the northern suburbs about vaccination with AstraZeneca.
But apparently not.
L. WATERHOUSE, Henley Beach Any brand works IT is sickening to see during the past few months political football being played by politicians, media and the public about the brand of Covid-19 vaccines.
One would ask you all: Do you know what brand of flu vaccine you have each year? No.
Australia has one of the most stringent registration criteria in the world when it comes to human medicines.
Vaccines are a preventive to help you.
They are not a cure, regardless of brands.
For God’s sake, let’s get on with life and forget about the elections. We have two choices with this germ warfare – live or die.
Let’s get on with it.
I. HARVEY, Port Lincoln Premier effort I APPRECIATE living in South Australia, with its relative freedom of movement and infrequent Covid-19 community transmissions compared to most other states.
This is regardless of Phil Bilsborow’s condemnation of the state transition committee and his disparaging description of our Premier Steven Marshall as “spineless” (“Restricted crowd”, The Advertiser, Thursday).
DAVE RICKARD, Hallett Cove More dobbers BRILLIANCE is the only way to describe cartoonist Broelman’s characterisation of former prime minister Tony Abbott in his budgie smugglers (The Advertiser, Thursday).
One other comorbidity of this pandemic is the loss of individual freedom similar to what happened in the former East Germany with the Stasi (secret police). We now have shoppers dobbing in shoppers, neighbours pitted against neighbours, and state versus state versus federal.
With a population of 25 million, with three tiers of governance, we are totally over-governed. This has become blindingly obvious with the shambolic situation our once-proud nation has become.
IAN KENT, Renmark Lifting Covid’s lid THINKING of Covid-19, which to date has infected about 220 million people worldwide, an artefact from Greek mythology, Pandora’s box, is instructive.
When Pandora lifted the lid of the gift she had coveted for so long, out flew plagues and sorrows for all humankind.
Human pressure on nature, and exploitation of animals on industrial scales, a “gift” to satisfy our desires, has escalated to “lifting the lid”.
Keeping the lid on means protecting the integrity and health of ecosystems in the natural world. It means respecting the necessary separation that exists between homo sapiens and free living creatures.
Animal species lose their habitats to development, crops and livestock. They are unable to survive and reproduce. So they migrate to areas closer to human populations. Animal-to-human infectious viruses can be the result.
Farmed animals raised in unhealthy, close quarters, and live animal markets, are the driver of zoonotic diseases.
Deforestation, most calamitous in the Amazon, has caused destruction of critical biodiversity, upsetting Earth’s natural balance on which humanity depends.
To prevent the explosion of more “plagues and sorrows”, government leaders, corporations and business leaders must prioritise conservation of the world’s ecological assets.
SIMONE HUNTER, Hove Numbers game PRIME Minister Scott Morrison continues to push the idea that, by getting to 70-80 per cent of the population being vaccinated, we will be able to end all lockdowns and border closures and live a carefree and safe existence.
Unfortunately, going by the evidence that has emerged from overseas with countries with higher than 70 per cent vaccination rates, after initial promising results, Covid-19 goes on the march again.
What this suggests is that vaccinations on their own are not going to solve the ongoing crisis of infections and deaths.
So the question is: Why pursue this failed strategy?
Vaccines play a critical role in alleviating the symptoms of Covid. And they can save lives.
But they need to be part of a plan to restrict the incidences of Covid in our communities. Not the sole measure.
Are we so blinded by gold fever that we are willing to accept such a situation? According to the Doherty Institute modelling for the six months following a 70 per cent vaccination coverage, in one possible scenario there would be more than 600,000 new cases, more than 20,000 ward admissions, more than 4000 in intensive care units and more than 2700 deaths.

Full text: A Maitland doctor surgery is offering a $10,000 prize to encourage more people to have a COVID-19 vaccine.
The move comes as vaccination bookings at Lorn Surgery's Maitland Showground clinic have plummeted.
Since the federal government announced Pfizer would be available to 16 to 39 year olds from the end of August, more have chosen to wait instead of booking an Astra Zeneca shot.
Tuesday's clinic saw about 400 people vaccinated with AZ. Just weeks ago more than 1000 people were vaccinated. The supply of Pfizer in Maitland has been slow and appointments before November hard to find.
Lorn Surgery GP Dr Craig Richards has warned there could be 1200 cases of COVID-19 in Maitland by Christmas and up to 5500 in the Hunter, depending on the effectiveness of contact tracing and social distancing. "People are going to be caught out thinking they will be able to get Pfizer before the restrictions decrease. It's probably unlikely," he said.
"The government is very keen to get people back to work and open up the community and the economy but they are doing that before everybody has had the opportunity to be vaccinated."
Dr Richards used modelling in the Doherty Institute report - which is guiding the country out of lockdown - to calculate the expected case numbers. He says the state and federal government's 80 per cent vaccination target needs to be even higher. He is pushing for a "COVID fortress" in Maitland and says the city needs a 95 per cent vaccination rate if residents want to live in a world on par with pre-COVID times.
"At a 95.5 per cent vaccination rate it means there will be a slower spread through the community and there will be a smaller peak in hospitalisations and the need for ventilators and a lower death rate overall," Dr Richards said. "That's the rate we achieve with childhood vaccinations consistently, for years. There is no reason to think people are going to take their own health less seriously than the health of their children."
The surgery decided to offer a prize to help entice people to have the jab. Anybody who has their jabs there has a chance to win the money. The prize will be drawn before Christmas.
"Maitland is going to have the same problem that the rest of the world has had - and that is that this will be a pandemic among the unvaccinated. People who are vaccinated will still catch COVID but they are much less likely to become seriously unwell with it," he said. The clinic offers AZ and was promised Pfizer in October but hasn't had any further correspondence about its arrival.
A spokesman for the Primary Health Network told the Mercury this week that Pfizer would be rolled out in GPs within the next three weeks. The Mercury was unable to find out how many doses would be allocated to the city. Hunter New England Health could not offer any details about Maitland's supply.
Dr Richards said the government was determined to open the community back up as soon as possible, but from a health perspective he thought it better to wait until the end of the year aiming for a 95 per cent vax rate.

Full text: The ACT's chance of coming out of lockdown next week appears increasingly unlikely as more than half of the territory's COVID-19 cases reported in the past week have spent time in the community while infectious.
Chief Minister Andrew Barr said he still hadn't given up hope of the territory reaching so-called COVID zero, but warned even when the lockdown did ease, Canberrans would be subject to strong public health measures in the months to come.
"I'm not going to give up on the suite of public health measures that bend the curve, but it's clear that we're not going to have double zero days tomorrow or the next day," he said.
"We're going to have to continue to vaccinate, we're going to have to continue our effective test trace isolate quarantine scheme."
It was revealed on Wednesday, the hospitalisation rate of Canberra's outbreak sits at 8 per cent but ACT deputy chief health officer Dr Vanessa Johnston said she was confident hospitals could handle the caseload.
There were 20 new cases of COVID-19 reported in the ACT in the 24 hours to 8pm on Tuesday.
Less than half the cases had a confirmed link on Wednesday morning, with the source of 11 cases under investigations.
There were seven cases infectious in the community, seven were in quarantine for their entire infectious period and the infectious status over six is under investigation.
Mr Barr has been adamant that the end of Canberra's lockdown would be contingent on a run of days where there had been no cases infectious in the community.
However, he stressed on Wednesday that any easing of restrictions would be gradual, as set out in the national plan.
The plan, based on modelling from the Doherty Institute outlines low, medium and high public health measures.
Mr Barr said the territory was currently subject to high public health measures and the next step was to transition to medium measures.
Examples of activities that could be allowed under medium public health measures include increased retail activity, seated dining for small groups at restaurants and cafes and five visitors to a household.
"We've been at the high end of the spectrum but we've had one easing, so we're still sitting at the high end of the spectrum, but not the highest," Mr Barr said.
"The next phase of our journey is to transition from high to medium."
Dr Johnston said the rolling five-day average of new cases was going down, but expressed concern about an upward trend of cases infectious in the community over the same period.
"We're not particularly happy with that, so that still remains a concern for us," she said.
Of the 150 cases reported from September 1 to September 8 in the ACT, 80 cases have been confirmed to be infectious in the community. That number is likely to be higher as the infectious status of 17 cases has not been publicly confirmed.
The total number of unlinked cases in Canberra's outbreak is 40.
There have been 424 cases since the outbreak started on August 12, including 193 people who have recovered from the virus. There are 231 active cases.
Throughout Canberra's outbreak there have been 34 people hospitalised with the virus. Six people have required treatment in the intensive care unit.
Dr Johnston said Canberra's hospitals had managed with this number.
"Certainly they're doing really, really very well at handling the cases they have there now and I know there is more capacity coming online as well, so very happy with that," she said.

More than 80 per cent of the ACT's over-70s are vaccinated, which Mr Barr said he believed was an Australian first.
More than 5700 Canberra businesses have applied for the ACT and federal government's jointly-funded support grants, which is available to businesses that have suffered a downturn as a result of the lockdown.
An extra 1852 businesses have started their applications for the grant, which can be up to $20,000.
Mr Barr said that $6.9 million had already been paid out to more than 400 businesses.
But he said that one in three businesses that had applied had given incorrect information and this had held up the process.
He also said other businesses had applied that had gone into administration or were not registered for the GST.
"I do want to send a clear message to anyone who thinks they can try and scam this system, you can't it is being checked," Mr Barr said.
The ACT's opposition has been critical of the slow payments, but Mr Barr said the rollout was faster than the NSW scheme.
"We have more than 100 people working seven days a week assessing applications and we've already paid out nearly $7 million," he said.
"Some payments made within seven days of the scheme open. Comparative with NSW, that's two to three weeks ahead of their rollout of their equivalent scheme."

Full text: Health care rank FRANCE first, Italy second, Australia 32nd and the US 37th. No, they are not the latest soccer scores. They are the 2021 World Health Organisation rankings of the health systems of its more than 190 member states.
There is no kewpie doll for guessing in which direction Australia is heading. The problem is most Australians have been programmed into believing private health care is some form of status symbol when, in reality, the opposite should apply.
We need to be deprogrammed before it’s too late.
BOB RUWOLDT, Seacombe Heights Impounding cars TUESDAY’S editorial refers to the outrageous behaviour of hoon drivers and changes to legislation planned by Attorney-General Vickie Chapman (“Time to take the stick to hoon drivers”, The Advertiser).
I suggest a good start would be to impound the cars of guilty drivers for 12 months ­instead of a paltry one month. This is totally inadequate.
I have a personal interest in hoon driving in that someone close to me was ­involved in a serious accident this year. A hoon driver crashed into him at high speed.
Ironically, although the hoon’s car was basically cut into two, he was able to run away. The person crashed into, however, had to be flown to the Royal Adelaide Hospital with cracked ribs and broken vertebrae and is lucky to be alive.
His modern car was totally written off.
Another matter that needs attention is the deliberate demolition of hoon cars under certain circumstances.
Surely they could be sold and the income allocated to victims of crime. GERRY GREENWAY, Netherby EV penalties WHILE other jurisdictions are providing incentives for people to switch to electric vehicles, South Australian Treasurer Rob Lucas is introducing legislation to penalise EV owners by imposing exorbitant fees (“Push to zap electric car fees to more than V8 rego”, The Advertiser, Tuesday).
May I remind Mr Lucas, and all our politicians, that nothing is more urgent than the climate crisis and the subsequent need to reduce emissions by replacing fossil fuels, including petroleum, with clean-energy sources.
SA has so far been a shining example in that regard.
Please don’t spoil it with a retrograde tax on EVs.
C. FAULKNER, Cheltenham Hotel prices WELL said, Peter K. Jones (“More hotel deals”, The Advertiser, Monday). Hotels are now paying the price for the exorbitant charges they impose when a major event is held in the city.
They will do it even tougher if they wait for me to make a booking. KEVIN STANLEY LACEY, Mount Gambier Move the tower SO, the office tower on the Festival Plaza is finally being built after about 10 years of promises.
Who wants it anyway?
I make no comment on the quality of the building itself. But I question why it must ­occupy public open space.
Say goodbye to unencumbered views of the historic, beautiful northern facade of Parliament House with its unique Kapunda marble. And also the grand entrance to the Adelaide Railway Station.
These are sources of pride in this state but no one in power seems to care. Notice, too, that the mocked-up illustrations always appear to distort the adjacent layout and evaporate these buildings, as if embarrassed by their resultant alienation.
What could have been a magnificent piazza will be obliterated by an office building on a completely inappropriate site that will likely end up looking cluttered and clumsy.
Both major political parties should hang their heads in shame. This will be regretted for generations as the long shadow of Walker Corporation’s tower falls across South Australia’s house of democracy during parliamentary sittings, as if in symbolic defiance of our history.
What does this say about our political leaders? Imagine such a tower looming over the British houses of parliament or the US Capitol.
SIMON HEALY, Beaumont Covid-19 impacts SAM Shahin’s opinion piece was, for the most part, well measured, if overly reliant on the widely misrepresented ­Doherty Institute modelling (Opinion, The Advertiser, Tuesday).
The models are based on assumptions that, as we open up, could not hold true. One weakness is that the impact of infection will be spread evenly. Clearly, it will differentially ­affect areas of relative socio-economic disadvantage.
Another is that contact tracing and isolation will remain effective. I suggest this is not possible due to asymptomatic Covid-19 becoming prevalent in the vaccinated, many of whom will not recognise symptoms and so will not get tested.
What appears missing is the combined effect on our health services of Covid-19 and the usual seasonal influenza outbreaks that will return once we do open up.
We must forward plan for the combined impact next winter. The community must take responsibility to ensure hospitals can continue to offer medical care rather than ­becoming repositories for the Covid and influenza-infected with little capacity for anything else.
Those eligible should get vaccinated for both viruses with whatever vaccines are available and continue to follow public health advice. That, I believe, will ensure the bright future Sam envisages. PAUL DUGGAN, St Peters

Full text: Australia's vaccine supply issues are over and the success of the nation's rollout now hinges on public uptake, the man tasked with leading it says.
COVID-19 Taskforce Commander Lieutenant-General John Frewen has also told Australian Community Media that vaccination rates among Indigenous Australians must be accelerated to avoid leaving them exposed once restrictions begin to ease.
The early stages of Australia's rollout were wracked by an undersupply of Pfizer, a problem compounded by the Australian Technical Advisory Group on Immunisation advising against the use of AstraZeneca in people under 60.
But with an imminent influx of mRNA vaccines, General John Frewen said Australia was on track to ramp up its rollout in September, a month earlier than initially expected.
"This takes us beyond the phase in the vaccine [rollout] where we were really mRNA supply constrained. The vaccines are coming, the distribution networks are in place and expanding. It all comes down now to public willingness to come forward," he told Australian Community Media.
"Sentiment remains strong and high, which is pleasing. But I'm not counting any chickens until we've got everybody through the door.
"We've still got a ways to go to get us to 70 per cent, and international experience tells us you've got work hard between 70 per cent and 80 per cent."

Australia would return the doses by December, General Frewen predicted.
It followed a similar agreement with Singapore for 500,000 doses, and the federal government purchasing an additional one million from Poland.
General Frewen said the deals, coupled with the imminent availability of the Moderna jab, would allow the country's remaining GPs to administer mRNA vaccines.
"[That] is going to help us ramp up through September in ways that we didn't think would be possible until October," he said.
"We've got every opportunity, provided people keep stepping forward. So I really encourage everybody who hasn't made a booking to get in and make one now."
The nation's reopening plan, based on modelling by the Doherty Institute, saw Australia begin to reopen once 70 per cent of each state and territory was fully-vaccinated.
That did not include 12- to 15-year-olds, who were all eligible to make a booking from Monday.

Nor did it include a minimum threshold for Indigenous and Torres Strait Islander Australians, raising the prospect of Australia opening up while they remained vulnerable.
Just over 40 per cent of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Australians aged 16 and over had received a first dose by Monday, well below the broader population of 63 per cent. Just 23 per cent were fully-vaccinated, compared to 38 per cent nationally.
General Frewen conceded vaccination among First Nations peoples had fallen behind during the initial stages of the rollout and, although it had doubled in the last month, the rate was still only keeping pace with the rest of Australia.
"So we've got to accelerate it to catch it up, because we don't want them to be behind when the rest of the nation gets to 70 and 80 per cent," he said.
"We're going to accelerate where we can over the next month by focusing on some of those communities that are most behind right now."
General Frewen would not predict when the Indigenous population would hit 70 per cent, warning vaccine hesitancy would prove the "ultimate variable". He warned a relatively COVID-free existence in most remote communities, some of which had vaccination rates under 10 per cent, had caused complacency over the vaccine.
But the virus' spread through regional NSW, including the first deaths among Indigenous Australians, had prompted a shift in the region. Work was being done with local leaders and trusted community identities to counter disinformation, he said.
"[They are] stressing not only that the vaccines are safe and important, but there is a real urgency to this," he said.
"Western NSW has given us a good reminder that COVID can rip into these communities really quickly, so we're better to get in and get ahead of the curve."

That was complicated by logistical challenges posed by Pfizer, which needed to be transported and stored at freezing temperatures.
And as a September 17 deadline for all residential aged care workers to receive at least one dose loomed, General Frewen insisted Australia was on track to vaccinate the vast majority of the cohort.
Eighty-five per cent had received a first dose and 64 per cent were fully-vaccinated, with roughly 40,000 still requiring a first dose, he revealed.

Full text: Australia's vaccination rollout could reach critical targets for reopening several weeks faster after another swap deal was arranged to get millions of Pfizer doses to Australia earlier than the existing order with the manufacturer.
International travel could resume by mid-December, according to Qantas as it prepares for flights between Australia and New Zealand Fiji, Singapore, the US, Japan, UK and Canada.
From February next year, the airline hopes to add Hong Kong, and more destinations in Asia by April if the federal government reopens the border in accordance with the national plan.
Pfizer dose supply will almost double this month to over 10 million, a result of international swap deals including the UK trading 4 million doses nearing expiry to Australia. In return the UK gets the same number from Australia's order in December when its residents begin taking booster shots.
The swap "breaks the back" of Australia's vaccine shortage ahead of the next bulk order delivering 11 million doses in October and again in November, Prime Minister Scott Morrison told reporters in Canberra.
The new doses will be loaded on two Qantas flights on Saturday, one repatriating Australians and a freight flight, and distributed from Sydney next week.
The extra vaccines will be distributed to states and territories based on population to meet the additional doses required to vaccinate 12-15 year olds that are now approved to take the Pfizer vaccine.
Mr Morrison urged anyone who can take the AstraZeneca vaccine to do so - as half of all those vaccinated in Australia have done.
Australia lags behind most of the developed world in COVID-19 vaccination rates, but recent surges in states with outbreaks have lifted the rate to around 37 per cent of the population over 16.
Health Minister Greg Hunt said vaccination coverage targets of 70 and 80 per cent of the 16+ population were now within sight.
"The burden and balance of vaccination in Australia will have moved forward two months from October and November to August and September," he said.
ACT, New South Wales and Tasmania were on target to reach the 80 per cent target by the end of October. With the earlier access to increases supply, South Australia, Northern Territory and Victoria may also.

Premiers and chief ministers were presented with new modelling information for vaccinating the 12-15 cohort and other vulnerable groups from the Doherty Institute during a meeting of national cabinet on Friday.
Dr Nick Coatsworth accepted there was a "live debate" over whether 12- to 15-year olds should be included in the targets. But he rubbished a push for vaccination targets in the under-12 range, arguing the best way to protect a child under 12 was to have both parents vaccinated.
"I'm a parent of three under 12 and nobody likes the thought of having their children getting COVID. But we just have to accept the reality that this is an overwhelmingly mild disease in children, even with the Delta variant," he told The Canberra Times.
Delta outbreaks in Victoria and NSW have seen a higher proportion of children being hospitalised than from previous strains. But Dr Coatsworth warned that figure was inflated.
"The main reason why kids are going into hospital is because their parents are sick with COVID," he said.
"They're there because the quickest place you can look after a kid in our society is a hospital."
"It's not because of the severity of their COVID, it's because they need to be looked after while their parents recover."

Full text: QUEENSLAND Premier Annastacia Palaszczuk has been slammed for airing concerns about Covid-19 in children that federal Treasurer Josh Frydenberg says contradict the medical advice and exhibit a “denial of reality”.
Ms Palaszczuk on Wednesday withdrew her support for the national reopening plan once the vaccination targets are reached, declaring opening Queensland’s borders would be too risky for unvaccinated children.
“You open up this state and you let the virus in here and every child under 12 is vulnerable, every single child,” she told the Queensland parliament.
Ms Palaszczuk demanded more research be presented on the dangers of Covid-19 for kids before she would reaffirm her commitment to the national plan.
“I want to see a paper. I don’t want to see a slide show, I want to see detailed information,” she said. “I want to know what is going to happen to the children of this state.” But Mr Frydenberg said Ms Palaszczuk was deluded, as medical advice clearly indicated the national reopening plan was safe for children.
“She said she’s scared for Queensland kids, does that wash with you?” Sunrise host David Koch asked Mr Frydenberg.
“No. It’s a desperate denial of the reality and is not based on the medical advice,” the Treasurer replied on Thursday.
Mr Frydenberg stressed the medical advice given to the federal government said Covid-19 was “much less severe” in children than adults.
“The medical advice is that we should vaccinate people aged 12 to 15 – which we’re doing,” the Treasurer said.
“The medical advice is what we are following. The medical advice is what the Doherty modelling is based on.” Mr Frydenberg then warned Ms Palaszczuk about the consequences and realities of attempting to follow a zero-Covid policy past the vaccination reopening targets.
“The states and territories should have no expectation that that level of economic support that we are providing today will continue once we reach those 70 per cent to 80 per cent targets,” he told the Today show.
“The people of Queensland are recognising they have to live with Covid – it’s a reality that is now being accepted.
“They can’t eliminate (Covid-19). No country has eliminated it. That is why it’s so important we stick to the plan and open up accordingly.” But Ms Palaszczuk insisted her state’s hospital system would crumble if Delta crossed into Queensland’s borders.
“The peak (in infections) is not going to be until October. If you want to see a health system on the verge of collapse, you will see that in October,” she told the Queensland parliament on Wednesday.
“I don’t want that here.” Despite Ms Palaszczuk’s concerns, Mr Frydenberg maintained that for the sake of the economy, the Premier should follow the national plan.
“In Queensland, the tourism businesses are doing it really tough,” he said. “Why does (Ms Palaszczuk) want to keep the borders closed when the rest of the country is opening up?”

Lagging states widen the divide before reopening

Full text: The lower vaccination rates in Queensland and Western Australia are deepening fault lines ­between the haves and have-nots in the nation’s Covid-19 response.
A new breakdown of state ­vaccination rates shows that WA will not achieve 80 per cent of over-16s double vaccinated – ending most domestic restrictions under Scott Morrison’s road map to recovery – until November 30, followed later by Queensland on December 7.
In the case of the Sunshine State, this would be five weeks after NSW hit 80 per cent to qualify to shift to a more Covid-normal setting of living with the virus. Citywide and state lockdowns are supposed to have ceased by then.
As of September 1, 32.9 per cent of eligible Queenslanders and 32.66 per cent of those in WA were fully dosed, against 38.68 per cent in NSW and 36.01 per cent in Victoria. NSW has administered 1.09 shots of vaccine per person compared to 0.85 doses per person in Queensland and 0.84 doses in WA.
Queensland Premier Annastacia Palaszczuk, increasingly at odds with the Prime Minister over the reopening plan, on Thursday warned the 70 per cent trigger to begin opening up would also lift Covid-19 deaths to 2240 a month nationally.
But she failed to mention this was a worst-case scenario under the benchmark Doherty Institute modelling, assuming little else was done to contain the virus.
Federal Health Department data shows that Queensland is delivering 48,933 jabs a day and WA 27,002 as the vaccine rollout ramps up. But this is still far slower than in NSW, with 139,914 doses administered on Wednesday. Victoria posted 81,683 vaccinations and there were 16,973 in South Australia, 5896 in Tasmania, 7389 in the ACT and 2796 in the Northern Territory for a national tally of 330,586 shots in the 24 hours to September 1.
Infectious disease expert Paul Griffin, who was charged by Ms Palaszczuk with investigating a disruptive hospital outbreak in July, said Queensland’s sluggish vaccine uptake reflected false ­security in the community that border controls and lockdowns would keep Covid-19 in check.
“The messaging has been ­focused on the fact we are being kept safe and this is an effective way of managing the virus,” Dr Griffin said. “People have this perception that Covid is being kept out of the state and they are being kept safe. Let them know it will keep coming.” While Vaxzevria (formerly AstraZeneca) was given in state-run vaccination clinics in NSW and Victoria, Queensland used only Pfizer, further slowing distribution. “Even people well within the eligible age group were discouraged from that vaccine,” Dr Griffin said, citing controversial comments by chief health officer Jeannette Young questioning the safety of Vaxzevria for under-60s.
WA Premier Mark McGowan has pinned the blame for the state’s low vaccination rates on the decision – which had WA’s support – to prioritise an additional million doses of Pfizer for NSW due to the scale of its emergency. He said on Wednesday it was galling his state was criticised by Mr Morrison “for not having the same vaccination levels as NSW when we didn’t get the million extra doses they got on top of their per-capita share”.
Despite Mr McGowan’s complaints about vaccine supply, a check on the main state-run ­vaccination clinic in Claremont on Thursday showed there were still vaccination slots available on both Thursday and Friday, and on at least one day for each of the next few weeks.
Shafi Sahibzada, a lecturer in epidemiology at Perth’s Murdoch University, said the tight border controls had allowed people in WA to put off getting their jabs.
On top of that, he said the pressures on WA’s health system – which this week cancelled some scheduled elective surgeries despite there being no Covid cases in the state’s hospitals – showed WA was not ready for an outbreak of the scale of those in Sydney and Melbourne.
“We will see spikes and we will see outbreaks and we are not prepared,” he said. “Instead of preparing for that, we are taking the easy path and keeping the border closed. That just won’t work for the long term.” The head of the AMA in WA, Mark Duncan-Smith, said the lack of Covid-19 in the state was the biggest driver of vaccine hesitancy. “The maintenance of zero Covid and avoiding Covid outbreaks in Western Australia has been very good and effective, but it also reduces the motivation to get coverage for vaccination as people don’t feel pressured about it,” Dr Duncan-Smith said.
“The evidence of what’s happening in NSW hopefully will overcome that.” Dr Griffin, director of ­infec­tious disease at Brisbane’s Mater Health, said some of Ms Palaszczuk’s language “had the potential” to fuel vaccine hesitancy. Analysis of the federal Health Department data shows that the ACT will be the first jurisdiction to achieve 80 per cent of over-16s doubled-jabbed on October 20 on current vaccination rates, followed by Tasmania on October 27 and NSW on October 30.

Full text: Federal Labor has distanced itself from Queensland Premier Annastacia Palaszczuk’s attack on the four-stage national plan to live with Covid-19.
Anthony Albanese said there had not yet been a vaccine ­approved for children aged under 12 after Ms Palaszczuk said she would keep the state border closed “until I can get every child ­vaccinated”.
“I support the national plan,” the Opposition Leader said. “And what the national plan provides for is for a reduction in restrictions upon achieving the 70 per cent and 80 per cent full vaccination rates.
“At the moment, there aren’t vaccines … approved for people under 12. And we do need to open up when it is safe to do so.” When asked whether Ms Palas­zczuk was “scaremongering” by raising the risks to young children posed by Covid-19, Mr Albanese said parents were “very worried about their children”.
He shifted focus to the need to vaccinate 12 to 15-year-olds, a step approved by the federal government. Mr Albanese said Labor was supportive of 12 to 15-year-olds being included in vaccination targets under the national plan. “The Prime Minister and the government need to outline what the plan is to vaccinate 12 to 15-year-olds, and whether those numbers should be included as part of those targets,” he said.
“Labor has said that is a matter for the national cabinet, although we are in favour of it.” However, Mr Albanese used a speech in parliament to call on the government to prepare for children younger than 12 to be included as part of the vaccination program.
Federal Labor MPs from Queensland were privately supportive of Ms Palaszczuk’s strategy, saying she was in touch with community sentiment on Covid-19.
One MP said criticism of state governments pursuing zero Covid cases was “Sydney-centric”, given it was a reality in Queensland, Western Australia, Tasmania and South Australia.
Labor MPs outside of Queensland were unhappy about Ms Palas­zczuk’s “ridiculous” attack on the national plan.
On Thursday, the Queensland Premier sent a tweet cherry-­picking data from the Doherty Institute modelling to claim there would be 2240 Covid deaths a month if restrictions ended when the population was 70 per cent vaccinated.
The national plan does not include ending all restrictions when the population is 70 per cent vaccinated but recommends an easing of lockdown measures.
Chief medical officer Paul Kelly said children did not generally get severe illness from the Delta strain of Covid. “There have only been three children under the age of 12 that have been admitted to intensive care. Three out of 3815. That is way less than 1 in 1000,” Professor Kelly said. “While cases have been about 17 per cent of total cases notified this year, that hospitalisation rate and the ICU rate in particular and the fact that there’ve been no deaths in under 12s is very different to what we’re seeing in adults and older children.”

Full text: The lower vaccination rates in Queensland and Western Australia are deepening fault lines ­between the haves and have-nots in the nation’s Covid-19 response.
A new breakdown of state ­vaccination rates shows that WA will not achieve 80 per cent of over-16s double vaccinated – ending most domestic restrictions under Scott Morrison’s road map to recovery – until November 30, followed later by Queensland on December 7.
In the case of the Sunshine State, this would be five weeks after NSW hit 80 per cent to qualify to shift to a more Covid-normal setting of living with the virus. Citywide and state lockdowns are supposed to have ceased by then.
As of September 1, 32.9 per cent of eligible Queenslanders and 32.66 per cent of those in WA were fully dosed, against 38.68 per cent in NSW and 36.01 per cent in Victoria. NSW has administered 1.09 shots of vaccine per person compared to 0.85 doses per person in Queensland and 0.84 doses in WA.
Queensland Premier Annastacia Palaszczuk, increasingly at odds with the Prime Minister over the reopening plan, on Thursday warned the 70 per cent trigger to begin opening up would also lift Covid-19 deaths to 2240 a month nationally.
But she failed to mention this was a worst-case scenario under the benchmark Doherty Institute modelling, assuming little else was done to contain the virus.
Federal Health Department data shows that Queensland is delivering 48,933 jabs a day and WA 27,002 as the vaccine rollout ramps up. But this is still far slower than in NSW, with 139,914 doses administered on Wednesday. Victoria posted 81,683 vaccinations and there were 16,973 in South Australia, 5896 in Tasmania, 7389 in the ACT and 2796 in the Northern Territory for a national tally of 330,586 shots in the 24 hours to September 1.
Infectious disease expert Paul Griffin, who was charged by Ms Palaszczuk with investigating a disruptive hospital outbreak in July, said Queensland’s sluggish vaccine uptake reflected false ­security in the community that border controls and lockdowns would keep Covid-19 in check.
“The messaging has been ­focused on the fact we are being kept safe and this is an effective way of managing the virus,” Dr Griffin said. “People have this perception that Covid is being kept out of the state and they are being kept safe. Let them know it will keep coming.” While Vaxzevria (formerly AstraZeneca) was given in state-run vaccination clinics in NSW and Victoria, Queensland used only Pfizer, further slowing distribution. “Even people well within the eligible age group were discouraged from that vaccine,” Dr Griffin said, citing controversial comments by chief health officer Jeannette Young questioning the safety of Vaxzevria for under-60s.
WA Premier Mark McGowan has pinned the blame for the state’s low vaccination rates on the decision – which had WA’s support – to prioritise an additional million doses of Pfizer for NSW due to the scale of its emergency. He said on Wednesday it was galling his state was criticised by Mr Morrison “for not having the same vaccination levels as NSW when we didn’t get the million extra doses they got on top of their per-capita share”.
Despite Mr McGowan’s complaints about vaccine supply, a check on the main state-run ­vaccination clinic in Claremont on Thursday showed there were still vaccination slots available on both Thursday and Friday, and on at least one day for each of the next few weeks.
Shafi Sahibzada, a lecturer in epidemiology at Perth’s Murdoch University, said the tight border controls had allowed people in WA to put off getting their jabs.
On top of that, he said the pressures on WA’s health system – which this week cancelled some scheduled elective surgeries despite there being no Covid cases in the state’s hospitals – showed WA was not ready for an outbreak of the scale of those in Sydney and Melbourne.
“We will see spikes and we will see outbreaks and we are not prepared,” he said. “Instead of preparing for that, we are taking the easy path and keeping the border closed. That just won’t work for the long term.” The head of the AMA in WA, Mark Duncan-Smith, said the lack of Covid-19 in the state was the biggest driver of vaccine hesitancy. “The maintenance of zero Covid and avoiding Covid outbreaks in Western Australia has been very good and effective, but it also reduces the motivation to get coverage for vaccination as people don’t feel pressured about it,” Dr Duncan-Smith said.
“The evidence of what’s happening in NSW hopefully will overcome that.” Dr Griffin, director of ­infec­tious disease at Brisbane’s Mater Health, said some of Ms Palaszczuk’s language “had the potential” to fuel vaccine hesitancy. Analysis of the federal Health Department data shows that the ACT will be the first jurisdiction to achieve 80 per cent of over-16s doubled-jabbed on October 20 on current vaccination rates, followed by Tasmania on October 27 and NSW on October 30.

A system at the point of collapse

Full text: We're told hospitals will cope with Delta, but there is a deluge coming that threatens to overwhelm us.
When the world first paid attention to COVID-19 last year, World Health Organisation executive director Dr Michael Ryan was asked what he had learned from the African Ebola outbreak. His answer was clear and chilling. "Be fast," he said. "Have no regrets. You must be the first mover." If you fail to move decisively, "the virus will always get you".
So, how is NSW going eight weeks into its third wave? Our system of test, trace and quarantine has been partially successful. But did we move fast enough? The answer is an emphatic no. Active cases have almost doubled in 12 days and are rising. About 5 per cent of infections require hospitalisation and 15 to 20 per cent of these need ICU admission. The number of patients on ventilators nearly doubled in the past week.
We have been repeatedly reassured the health system will cope. As an experienced respiratory doctor at a major western Sydney hospital, I disagree, and so do many of my colleagues. We believe it likely that projected patient numbers will soon be overwhelming. Tragically, their ranks will include many frontline health workers such as paramedics and nurses. From Westmead to Liverpool and Blacktown, ambulances now routinely line up in hospital carparks, unable to discharge their patients. What exactly is going on?
At any hospital, the priority must be keeping COVID-19 contained. Already, we have seen multi-fatality clusters where it is not. But only the newest hospitals are equipped with a handful of negative pressure rooms, engineered to stop the spread of airborne infection. Some wards have been transformed into safe zones, using glass or tight-fitting plastic doors, along with best practice air filters. However, these modifications are barely keeping up with new cases as they present.
Hospitals under stress have reacted out of necessity on their own, moving to cancel non-urgent surgeries and to pivot other services to smaller hospitals. However, there has been no central co-ordination to implement COVID-safe wards by NSW Health. No guidelines, no standardisation to share COVID-19 patients across all of Sydney's hospitals, and apparently no ministerial oversight.
Hospital administrators and clinicians are making it up as they go along. An estimate of the number of COVID-safe wards in Sydney is anyone's guess. Even as governments canvass easing lockdown restrictions based on Doherty Institute modelling, hospitals are yet to receive localised patient number projections, so crucial to creating secure capacity and rostering nurses and doctors in coming weeks. The only meaningful projections that are available come from invested but external epidemiologists and statistical wizards.
Imagine if during last year's bushfires, brigade captains were not informed where fires were moving and what resources might be required. This is exactly what is happening now. Spot fires have turned into roaring blazes of the virus.
I know of a young child with a suspected foreign body in their upper airway who waited hours to be transported from south-western Sydney to an ear nose and throat surgeon due to ambulances being stuck at emergency departments. With the coming deluge of cases, it is possible ambulances will not reach people suffering heart attacks or strokes as quickly as they should.
New cancer diagnoses fell by one-third during the worst of the crisis in Britain. Clearing their backlog of outpatient clinic appointments will take years. If replicated here, it's not hard to guess which patients, from which part of Sydney, will be most affected.
The present head-in-the-sand approach must end. The NSW command-and-response headquarters, the State Health Emergency Operations Centre, must be beefed up so it can communicate in real time with all hospitals on the pandemic frontline. It is running way behind where the action is. Incredibly, hospital response teams are not being approached directly and asked what they need. Experienced nurses are being pulled from under pressure wards in western and south-western Sydney to deliver vaccines. Let this important work be done instead by medical students, allied health volunteers or nurses from further afield.
Most importantly, please rapidly expand COVID-safe wards at all major Sydney hospitals. Those in less affected areas won't, unless centrally directed. More COVID-safe wards means ambulances have more places to take patients quickly - and that will prevent hospitals collapsing domino-style.
Forget 6 million jabs, treats and rewards. More than one in three people aged over 16 remains unvaccinated. Nearly two in three are not fully vaccinated and remain at significant risk of infection.
These numbers are sobering. And discussion of children's jabs, the need for a booster program, and the implications of long-COVID for hospital capacity in NSW has barely begun. It's time to stop the backslapping and resource our health system for what lies ahead.

Full text: EXCLUSIVE ANGRY and anxious children are attacking parents and siblings in lockdown as hospitals deal with more teenagers self-harming, top doctors have warned.
Murdoch Children’s Research Institute mental health expert Harriet Hiscock – who is director of the Health Services Research Unit at The Royal Children’s Hospital and a professorial fellow of paediatrics at the University of Melbourne – told the Sunday Herald Sun repeated lengthy lockdowns were damaging the mental health of children.
“It’s things like pulling out hair, scratching, and kids who start cutting themselves,” she said.
“We are seeing more kids getting angry, irritable, melting down, and they can be lashing out at their families.
“Teenagers who are feeling frustrated, anxious or out of control – there are some who are becoming physically violent towards their siblings or parents. Some kids will withdraw, others will have a fight-flight response.” She said Victorian hospitals had recorded a 90 per cent spike in children with eating disorders, a 10 per cent jump in kids with anxiety and a 12.3 per cent rise in incidents of self-harm since 2019, ­before the pandemic began.
The MCRI figures also ­revealed a doubling in the number of teens contemplating suicide in Melbourne, where they have endured 208 days of stay-home orders and home schooling.
Cooped-up kids failing to cope with lockdown loneliness are showing up at hospital emergency departments in record numbers, with a 45 per cent increase in Victoria and 55 per cent hike in Sydney since the pandemic began.
A recent MCRI study found one in five Victorian children thought about suicide during the first Covid-19 lockdowns last year, double the pre-pandemic rate of one in 10.
Professor Hiscock said children in Victoria were faring worse this year. “Children have gone from feeling lonely and anxious and irritable last year to it ­really intensifying this year,” she said.
She said children in ­lockdown felt “lonely and disconnected”. “They just want to get back their life and mates and school and sport and drama,” Professor Hiscock said.
“They miss structure – kids don’t know if it’s Thursday or Friday or a weekend, it’s all blurred – and everyone is exhausted. The best thing for kids is to get back to school.” One of Australia’s leading child psychologists told the Sunday Herald Sun he had never been more worried about the mental health of young people.
Dr Michael Carr-Gregg has joined a chorus of doctors and mental health professionals in calling for the state government to begin addressing the toll that repeated lockdowns have had.
As part of a new campaign, which has the backing of more than 75 doctors, Dr Carr-Gregg has demanded schools and playgrounds reopen as a matter of urgency, fearing Victoria’s already broken mental health system will not cope with the demand in coming years.
“We will not be able to vaccinate the mental health ­effects of these lockdowns away,” he said, adding the restrictions stopped developing children “dead in their tracks”.
Dr Carr-Gregg said it was time a mental health expert was present in discussions about restrictions between chief health officer Brett Sutton and government.
Business and family groups have urged the government to show Victorians a path out of lockdowns.
Victorian Chamber of Commerce and Industry chief Paul Guerra said: “Businesses across the state are in crisis.
“The Doherty Institute modelling shows a clear path forward. We need a clear commitment from the state that they will follow that road map. Business need hope that these lockdowns will end and we can enjoy a bloody great summer.” Tim Piper, Victorian director of The Australia Industry Group, said devastation was particularly acute in the small business world. “They are really struggling … irrespective of which area you are looking at, people are still struggling,” he said. “It’s excruciating. natasha.bita@news.com.au

Families welcome green light for children's jabs

Full text: Parents have welcomed news their children will soon be eligible for a Covid vaccine, but the federal government has been warned young adults must remain the priority.
Prime Minister Scott Morrison on Friday confirmed parents will be able to book the Pfizer jab for their 12 to 15 year old children from September 13, after it was was granted provisional approval from the Australian Technical Advisory Group on Immunisation.
Health Minister Greg Hunt was optimistic about uptake in the cohort, with increased Pfizer supply and work also underway to approve the Moderna vaccine.
"We are in a position to ensure that all children and all families who seek their children to be vaccinated between the ages of 12 to 15, will be able to do so this year," he said on Friday.
Canberra father-of-two Chris Sheedy was thrilled to hear his 15-year-old son Sam would soon be eligible for the jab.
"The top minds in Australia say it is safe. My only concern now is how long it's going to take. I'll be booking as soon as possible," he said.

He said fears over teenagers being hospitalised had also circulated among Sam's friends.
"I recently got my second shot. On my phone now I have this pretty little green certificate that says I'm fully-vaccinated. Sam was quite envious when he saw that and he wants one," he said.
"The research shows Covid gives [teenagers] brain fog and low moods.
"I thought: good god, with teenage boys, I've already got enough of their brain fog and low moods. I don't need more of that, so it protects me as well!"
But paediatric infectious diseases physician at Westmead's Children's Hospital Philip Britton warned against shifting focus from vaccinating the 20 to 39 age bracket, particularly in disadvantaged communities.
"It's those young adults who are still bringing the infection into their households," he said.
"If we get vaccines to advantaged children at the expense of efforts to get vaccines into the arms of 20- to 40-year-olds, that would be a major concern from the child health perspective.
"[In] the family of four with three children under 12, the most important thing is for the adults in that house to be vaccinated, not the 12-year-old."
Pfizer was provisionally approved for 12- to 15-year-old immunocompromised children, Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander children, and children in remote areas earlier this month. But Dr Britton said there was no evidence it was more dangerous to children outside those categories.
He said that although the vaccine was more effective at minimising severe Covid symptoms, the predominant benefit of vaccinating children was reducing transmission in schools.
"It is reducing risk. That, coupled with vaccinating teachers, is really what we need to give people the sense of confidence to get kids back to school," he said.
Less than half of Australians over 50 were fully vaccinated, though 77.6 per cent had received a first dose. Another 307,090 doses were administered on Thursday, taking the total uptick over the past week to just under 1.9 million.
Australia's path out of Covid restrictions was based on Doherty Institute modelling, outlining new stages to be triggered at 70 and 80 per cent vaccination of the 16 and over population.

Long spring ahead as Canberra balances risk NSW students to return to school from October Qld to have two COVID-19 quarantine camps But the Prime Minister rejected calls for 12- to 15-year-olds to now be folded into the targets, despite pressure from some jurisdictions, particularly the ACT.
"The target is about the overall level of vaccination in the adult population, who are the primary transmitters of the virus. That's the science," he said on Friday.
"There is no recommendation from any of our medical health advisors to [include children in the targets], and so I don't see the point of that. What I see the point of doing is vaccinating children."
While the states would determine whether and when to open their mass vaccination hubs up to children, Mr Morrison expected initial vaccination to take place via the existing GP network.
"That provides the opportunity for family vaccinations, for the family to go along together across those age groups," he said.
Announcing the updated advice on Friday, ATAGI said a trial of 2000 participants produced "high level evidence" the vaccine was effective in 12- to 15-year-olds.
That included an 100 per cent effectiveness against symptoms seven days after children received their second dose. The first dose proved 75 per cent effective, ATAGI said.
It conceded there was uncertainty over teenagers' role in transmitting Covid, but said the virus would increasingly target younger people with a higher proportion of adults vaccinated.
"Susceptible children and adolescents will account for a higher proportion of continued infections in the community contributing to transmission. This has been seen in countries such as Israel and the USA," it said.

Full text: Parents have welcomed news their children will soon be eligible for a Covid vaccine, but the federal government has been warned young adults must remain the priority.
Prime Minister Scott Morrison on Friday confirmed parents will be able to book the Pfizer jab for their 12 to 15 year old children from September 13, after it was was granted provisional approval from the Australian Technical Advisory Group on Immunisation.
Health Minister Greg Hunt was optimistic about uptake in the cohort, with increased Pfizer supply and work also underway to approve the Moderna vaccine.
"We are in a position to ensure that all children and all families who seek their children to be vaccinated between the ages of 12 to 15, will be able to do so this year," he said on Friday.
Canberra father-of-two Chris Sheedy was thrilled to hear his 15-year-old son Sam would soon be eligible for the jab.
"The top minds in Australia say it is safe. My only concern now is how long it's going to take. I'll be booking as soon as possible," he said.

He said fears over teenagers being hospitalised had also circulated among Sam's friends.
"I recently got my second shot. On my phone now I have this pretty little green certificate that says I'm fully-vaccinated. Sam was quite envious when he saw that and he wants one," he said.
"The research shows Covid gives [teenagers] brain fog and low moods.
"I thought: good god, with teenage boys, I've already got enough of their brain fog and low moods. I don't need more of that, so it protects me as well!"
But paediatric infectious diseases physician at Westmead's Children's Hospital Philip Britton warned against shifting focus from vaccinating the 20 to 39 age bracket, particularly in disadvantaged communities.
"It's those young adults who are still bringing the infection into their households," he said.
"If we get vaccines to advantaged children at the expense of efforts to get vaccines into the arms of 20- to 40-year-olds, that would be a major concern from the child health perspective.
"[In] the family of four with three children under 12, the most important thing is for the adults in that house to be vaccinated, not the 12-year-old."
Pfizer was provisionally approved for 12- to 15-year-old immunocompromised children, Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander children, and children in remote areas earlier this month. But Dr Britton said there was no evidence it was more dangerous to children outside those categories.
He said that although the vaccine was more effective at minimising severe Covid symptoms, the predominant benefit of vaccinating children was reducing transmission in schools.
"It is reducing risk. That, coupled with vaccinating teachers, is really what we need to give people the sense of confidence to get kids back to school," he said.
Less than half of Australians over 50 were fully vaccinated, though 77.6 per cent had received a first dose. Another 307,090 doses were administered on Thursday, taking the total uptick over the past week to just under 1.9 million.
Australia's path out of Covid restrictions was based on Doherty Institute modelling, outlining new stages to be triggered at 70 and 80 per cent vaccination of the 16 and over population.

"The target is about the overall level of vaccination in the adult population, who are the primary transmitters of the virus. That's the science," he said on Friday.
"There is no recommendation from any of our medical health advisors to [include children in the targets], and so I don't see the point of that. What I see the point of doing is vaccinating children."
While the states would determine whether and when to open their mass vaccination hubs up to children, Mr Morrison expected initial vaccination to take place via the existing GP network.
"That provides the opportunity for family vaccinations, for the family to go along together across those age groups," he said.
Announcing the updated advice on Friday, ATAGI said a trial of 2000 participants produced "high level evidence" the vaccine was effective in 12- to 15-year-olds.
That included an 100 per cent effectiveness against symptoms seven days after children received their second dose. The first dose proved 75 per cent effective, ATAGI said.
It conceded there was uncertainty over teenagers' role in transmitting Covid, but said the virus would increasingly target younger people with a higher proportion of adults vaccinated.
"Susceptible children and adolescents will account for a higher proportion of continued infections in the community contributing to transmission. This has been seen in countries such as Israel and the USA," it said.

Full text: What is the plan from October 25? From October 25, schoolchildren will start returning in stages. Kindergarten and year 1 will go back first, while year 12 will be allowed full access to their school rather than just a few hours a day ahead of their HSC exams.
The next step is for years 2, 6 and 11 to return on November 1. The rest of the students - years 3, 4, 5, 7, 8, 9 and 10 - will head back on November 8, which is the sixth week of term four. This will give students at least six weeks at school before the Christmas holidays begin.
If a community in NSW exits the "stay-at-home" orders between now and October 25, it will be able to return to school as normal immediately.
So, some schools might not return? Students could keep learning from home beyond October 25. Schools have two benchmarks to meet if they are to reopen.
Firstly, a "high vaccination" threshold. The government expects that NSW will reach a 70 per cent vaccination target in mid-October, which would align with the Doherty Institute modelling that says restrictions can loosen when that is achieved. Most of the state will likely meet this.
Secondly, a "low community transmission" threshold. This could cause delays in some areas because the rate of COVID-19 transmission in the broader community will determine the likelihood of transmission at school.
NSW Health and the Education Department are considering adopting definitions set by the United States' Centre for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), to determine appropriate levels of community transmission for schools to open.
Under the NSW government's interpretation of CDC guidelines, areas would have to record fewer than 50 new cases per 100,000 people within the previous 14 days to be considered to have "low transmission" to keep schools open.
What about LGAs of concern? If vaccination rates improve and case numbers drop between now and late October, local government areas may no longer be designated "areas of concern" or be subject to tighter restrictions under the public health order.
If there still are LGAs of concern come October 25, these areas will continue to learn from home. This applies to students who either live or go to school in the local government area.
What will school be like? Schools will not operate as normal until restrictions in the community lift. You can expect reduced mingling between year groups, face masks and staggered break or school start times.
Face masks will be compulsory for high school staff and students, as well as primary school staff. Masks will be strongly recommended for primary school students, but not mandatory. What about HSC exams? The government announced yesterday that HSC written exams had been further delayed until November 9. We know the NSW Education Standards Authority wants to run as many exams as possible, but won't release its exam timetable until early to mid-September.
"At this stage we are planning for and preparing for the HSC written exams to occur as usual," NSW Education Standards Authority (NESA) chief executive Paul Martin said. He said all students would sit at least one exam.
All students should have had access to vaccination by November 9.
"We will have really strict protocols in place for those students at the exam rooms, numbers of students in rooms, the invigilation, mingling before and after, mask wearing," Mr Martin said.
Vaccinations will not be compulsory for HSC students.
I work at a school. What does this mean for me? The government will make it compulsory for anyone who works in a school setting to be vaccinated against COVID-19. This includes teachers, support staff and administration staff.
"Double doses of COVID vaccinations will be mandatory for any staff on school sites from 25 October and for all school staff from 8 November," the NSW Department of Education told principals in an email.
NSW Health will be providing priority vaccinations for school staff the week beginning September 6. The Education Department estimates that two-thirds of its staff have already had their first dose.

Full text: A fracturing in the national plan to live with COVID-19 could mean Australians have more chance of a Christmas in New York or London than visiting Perth.
Major airline Qantas has backed in the federal government over the phased reopening of international borders by December with country's holding similar vaccination targets to Australia of around 80 per cent later in the year.
The push for the resumption of commercial overseas travel is in despite of a deteriorating national unity between state and territory governments and the Commonwealth about when to ease domestic border restrictions.
Speaking at the release of the airline's bruised results for financial year 2021, Qantas boss Alan Joyce revealed commercial routes to Singapore, Japan, UK and the US could occur before normal flights between Perth and Sydney resume.
"People want to get back to their normal lives," Mr Joyce said.
"I think it would be a terrible shame, if we got to Christmas in New South Wales, you could visit your relatives in London, but can't visit your relatives in Perth.
"Hopefully we don't get there and we can get some consistency with national cabinet pushing through to opening up Australia and us not to be a the hermit nation.
Mr Joyce's weigh-in on the border debate comes after the West Australian government said it would keep borders shut beyond 70 to 80 per cent vaccinations targets to maintain a zero COVID-19 elimination strategy.

Covid vaccine rollout: Decision time for plan to vaccinate children Qantas superjumbo flies again, prompting speculation about international travel Covid vaccines to be mandatory for Canberra Airport staff Queensland has also been lumped into the anti-Australia club, with Prime Minister Scott Morrison on Thursday being slammed by Queensland MP Milton Dick over his "we can't stay in the cave" comments which targeted states unwilling to accept living with the virus.
Mr Morrison responded by saying the national plan would spur on vaccination rates, especially in Queensland and WA which are lagging behind the national average.
"All of us at some point have to be clear that we have to move on and live with this virus," Mr Morrison said during Question Time.
"The national plan is so important and we say to those who are getting vaccinated that when you get vaccinated in phase-C, you will have exemptions, you will be able to do things as [a] vaccinated persons, because you have taken decisions to make sure you are not such a health risk to others."
Federal Labor leader Anthony Albanese in his first interview after the release of the Doherty Institute modelling in July said, vaccination targets were a "good thing", but the findings of the report should be made public.
The Canberra Times understands Labor's position on the national plan is fraying, in part to the polarising stance of the Queensland and NSW Labor state governments with the Morrison Government.
Labor health spokesman Mark Butler said the reopening has to be supported by adequate testing, tracing, isolation and quarantine systems.
"The critical question here is the extent to which Scott Morrison can guarantee that this end to lockdowns, which we all need, we all desire, is going to be done as safely as possible - not recklessly but safely," he told ABC on Thursday.
Mr Joyce said the use of vaccine passports and changes to quarantine rules are a matter of the federal government to address before the international border is partially opened.
"One of the biggest unknowns is the quarantine requirements for fully vaccinated travellers entering Australia," he said.
"If it's 14 days in a hotel, demand levels will be very low. A shorter period with additional testing and the option to isolate at home will see a lot more people travel."
Qantas on Thursday posted an eye-watering loss of $2.3bn as result of the disruption to the aviation sector over the past 18-months.
The company noted it had a net debt position of $5.9bn at the end 2021 financial year and had lost $16bn in revenue.
Since the beginning of the pandemic, more than 9000 jobs have been shed from the Qantas group, which include budget carrier Jetstar.
The airline also unveiled five A380 planes are likely to be brought back into service next year for the earlier anticipated resumption of long-haul voyages to the US and UK.
Mr Joyce said a further five could be brought back into service by 2024 and two of the aircraft will be retired due to surplus.
Destinations such as Johannesburg, Bali and Manila are likely to resume in 2022, while the travel bubble with New Zealand is expected to resume once trans-Tasman vaccine rates are on parity.

Full text: Fighting COVID-19 has been a marathon event - here in Australia and around the world. With every vaccination, COVID-19 becomes a less deadly disease - for us all.
But we can't forget the shadow impacts of the COVID pandemic, including the mental health impacts, particularly on our children.
This week the Murdoch Children's Research Institute released a report outlining the enormous impact COVID is having on the mental health and wellbeing of our young, particularly the most disadvantaged. It says prolonged school closures and lockdowns can exacerbate these impacts.
We are MPs from opposite sides in the Federal Parliament, but we are both paediatricians and we are united in our support for the institute's report, especially its call to prioritise the vaccination of teachers, early educators and school staff to ensure we can get children back to school sooner.
Students across Australia have been missing out. Victorian students have missed almost 150 days of face-to-face learning - one of the highest rates in the world - and they are facing a second year of lockdowns.
The report acknowledges there is no vaccine currently approved for children aged under 12, although vaccine companies have commenced trials in this age group. As such, the report recommends vaccinating parents and adults of all ages to protect children and schools from outbreaks.
Prioritising parents and carers of children has the dual benefit of targeting the age group at the highest risk of transmission of COVID-19 and protecting an age group that does not yet have a vaccine approved for use. It supports the Doherty Institute modelling that shows the age group most at-risk of transmitting the Delta variant is 20- to 40-year-olds.
We note the institute's report also suggests consideration of vaccination of children aged 12 to 15 as soon as possible. While the general rollout in that age group will be based on the advice of ATAGI, we welcome the federal government announcement that the Pfizer vaccination for children aged 12 to 15 is now approved for those with chronic conditions including those on the National Disability Insurance Scheme, as well as Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islanders.
We believe further efforts are needed to ensure these high-risk 12- to 15-year-olds get vaccinated quickly since some chronic conditions, including diabetes and obesity, significantly increase the risk of poor outcomes from COVID infection. Further, children with intellectual disabilities and development difficulties, such as autism, find it difficult to comply with social-distancing measures. For those with severe disability, this places a huge added burden on families.
As Australia's vaccination coverage accelerates and approaches the national COVID plan targets of 70 to 80 per cent, we will see an increase in COVID cases among unvaccinated people, whatever their age. At this point there is no evidence that the Delta variant is resulting in more serious disease, but it is true that more cases in children are now occurring.
What is clear is vaccination protects against serious disease and death, whichever vaccine on offer in Australia is used. While we await the best vaccine options for children, we need to inoculate as many people as possible who might expose young Australians to the virus.
Our children are our future. Their health, wellbeing and education is critical to their future and indeed ours. We need governments of all persuasions to commence development of COVID-safe plans with prioritisation of vaccination of teachers and carers so that students can resume their educational journey and children with chronic health conditions are protected as we move to the next stage of the pandemic response.

We are MPs from opposite sides in Federal Parliament, but we are both paediatricians and we are united in our support for the MCRI report, especially its call to prioritise the vaccination of teachers, early educators and school staff to ensure we can get children back to school sooner.
Students across Australia have been missing out. Victorian students already missed almost 150 days of face-to-face learning - one of the highest rates in the world - and they are facing a second year of lockdowns, more than any other state in the country. In NSW it looks to be some time before students can return to school.
The MCRI report acknowledges there is no vaccine currently approved for children under 12, although vaccine companies have commenced trials to assess the safety in this age group. As such, the report recommends the priority is to vaccinate parents and adults of all ages to protect children and schools from outbreaks.
Prioritising parents and carers of children has the dual benefit of targeting the age group at the highest risk of transmission of COVID-19 and protecting an age group that, as yet, does not have a vaccine approved for use. It supports the Doherty Institute modelling that shows 20- to 40-year-olds are most at risk of transmitting the Delta COVID variant.
We note the report also suggests consideration of vaccination of children aged 12 to 15 as soon as possible. While the general rollout in that age group will be based on the advice of the Australian Technical Advisory Group on Immunisation, we welcome the federal government announcement that the Pfizer vaccine for children aged 12 to 15 is now approved for those with chronic conditions including those on the National Disability Insurance Scheme, as well as Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islanders.
We believe further efforts are needed to ensure these high-risk 12- to 15-year-olds get vaccinated quickly since some chronic conditions, including diabetes and obesity, significantly increase the risk of poor outcomes from COVID infection. Further, children with intellectual disabilities and development difficulties, such as autism, find it difficult to comply with social-distancing measures.

As Australia's vaccination coverage accelerates and approaches the national COVID plan target of 70 to 80 per cent, we will see an increase in cases among unvaccinated people, whatever their age. At this point there is no evidence that the Delta variant is resulting in more serious disease, but it is true that more cases in children are now occurring.
In NSW alone, more than 200 children under nine have been infected. Parents - not only those of children in the high-risk groups - may be impatient for the day all can be vaccinated. But confirmation of safe vaccines for under-12s may be many months away.
What's clear is that vaccination is protective against serious disease and death, whichever vaccine on offer is used, and whatever age the recipient. While we await the best vaccination options for children, we need to inoculate as many people as possible who might expose young Australians to the virus.
Our children are our future. Their health, wellbeing and education is critical to their future and indeed ours. We need governments of all persuasions to commence development of COVID-safe plans with prioritisation of vaccination of teachers and carers so that students can resume their educational journey and children with chronic health conditions are protected as we move to the next stage of the pandemic response.

Full text: A construction company is making a bid to restart the industry in Canberra, by inviting ACT health authorities to see how work is proceeding at an essential infrastructure project on Commonwealth land.
Representatives from the ACT construction industry learnt at an ACT government roundtable on Tuesday there was no timeline to ease restrictions on building sites.
Meanwhile, the ACT branch of the CFMEU has called on the ACT government and construction industry to provide rapid antigen testing for workers, so potential cases of COVID-19 on work sites could be identified quickly.
The ACT director of construction company Icon, Aaron Clingan, said he had invited representatives from the ACT government to see how work was proceeding on the Therapeutic Goods Administration building at Fairbairn.
"We're all keen to get the industry up and running in totality, so anything we could do to help kickstart would be in our interest as well," he said.
Mr Clingan said Icon would also return to work on Wednesday at the Throsby school site, with ACT Health agreeing to allow 50 people on the site to keep the project going.
Workers on both sites would have staggered start times, regularly sanitise, wear masks and be directed by Covid marshals to maintain social distancing measures, he said.
Mr Clingan said the industry supported the original decision to lockdown hard at the start of the outbreak.
"It's just now that we need some direction on what we can do to help the government get it back up and running," he said.
Master Builders Association ACT chief executive Michael Hopkins said the ACT construction industry was facing the longest shutdown of any state or territory, and was disappointed it had no timeframe for returning.
"Even some clarity around a date that we won't be back before, would help industry plan the next week or two. But we're very disappointed to not even get some commitment to a not-before date from the government officials today, either," Mr Hopkins said.
Mr Hopkins said the construction industry had shown in other states it could continue operating throughout outbreaks of the Delta variant of COVID-19.
"It is safe to operate the construction industry through a lockdown with very strict safety protocols in place. We know our members are committed to doing that. In fact, they're committed to whatever measures need to be in place to make sure our industry can be reopened," he said.
Mr Hopkins said current business supports were nowhere near sufficient for large construction companies, the majority of which had stood down more than 90 per cent of workers.

Mr Smith said the roundtable was a positive step, but the industry needed better communication from the ACT government on a reopening plan.
Geocon had stood down 200 staff which had a flow-on effect to about 1000 sub-contractors, Mr Smith said.
"I think anything to get the industry reopened again, the industry would take onboard to achieve that outcome," Mr Smith said.
"Rapid antigen testing is just one way forward. Vaccinations is the ultimate goal, we need to work together as a unit to get the greater construction population, and the greater population at all, vaccinated."
Mr Smith said if the construction shutdown continued, the ACT government would need to take "drastic" action to support the sector.
While Chief Minister Andrew Barr has said the ACT government was working on plans for industry sectors to go back to work, no detail has yet been provided.
When asked about the construction industry, Mr Barr on Tuesday said Sydney was a live case study that showed what happened when lockdown restrictions were eased too quickly.

"The ACT Government has been working productively with industry to identify the types of measures that can be put in place to recommence construction in a COVID safe manner when the health advice enables this to occur," Ms Vassarotti said.
The CFMEU - the ACT's largest construction union - issued a statement on Tuesday calling for the ACT government to support Covid safety measures on worksites, and bring in rapid-antigen testing.
The union encouraged workers to get vaccinated but said it was opposed to making Covid vaccinations a condition of construction workers' employment.
"The community can be protected from COVID-19 without removing the rights of these workers to make informed decisions about their health," the union said.

Victoria lax on vax

Full text: THE Andrews government will compel healthcare workers to reveal if they have had the Covid vaccination, amid growing angst over its failure to make jabs compulsory for frontline staff.
The Herald Sun can reveal the government has ignored a pledge from former health minister Jenny Mikakos, who in February last year suggested a Covid vaccine would be made compulsory to protect the public.
Discussing new laws allowing the state to force healthcare workers to receive vaccines, in response to dangerous flu outbreaks, Ms Mikakos said: “I could say that if we had a vaccine for Covid-19 tomorrow, it would be added to the schedule, to this legislation.
“I would be seeking, if there was a vaccine for Covid-19, to make sure that we could bring this forward, that we could issue a directive … to make sure healthcare workers are vaccinated against Covid-19, and that is to protect them as well as the community against a highly transmissible disease.” Not only do those laws allow for a Covid shot to be easily added to the mandatory vaccine schedule, a source said unions and other key stakeholders had been consulted and agreed to the move as far back as early 2020.
A Labor Party source also told the Herald Sun they were staggered the vaccine had not been made compulsory six months after the first dose was administered in Australia.
“It is like the lessons of last year have been forgotten,” they said. But other sources said mandating the vaccine could be a complex and lengthy process and may affect the morale of the health workforce.
NSW last week announced mandatory Covid vaccinations for all healthcare workers, a move that Western Australia has also raised. Queensland Health has legislated all healthcare workers in areas with Covid patients must be vaccinated.
Grilled on Victoria’s reluctance to follow suit, Daniel Andrews said he did not have any advice that mandating vaccinations was necessary.
“If I did have advice then we’d have to have a long conversation, we’d consult with lots of different people and we might well go down that path,” the Premier said.
Melbourne’s hospitals continue to be hit with Covid cases, with about 450 medical staff at the Royal Melbourne Hospital on forced leave because of an outbreak on site.
More than 20 staff at St Vincent’s have also been put on forced leave with the emergency department listed as a tier 2 exposure site.
It comes as the Doherty Institute issued a statement on Monday standing by its vaccine modelling, on which National Cabinet based a four-stage plan for easing restrictions.
“Once we reach 70 per cent vaccine coverage, opening up at tens or hundreds of cases nationally per day is possible. However, we will need vigilant public health interventions with higher case loads,” the statement said.
It comes after the Herald Sun on Monday revealed hospital bosses had raised major concerns they were struggling to track unvaccinated staff, amid fears vulnerable patients could be endangered.
Hospital managers cannot access official vaccination records for their own staff because the state has not mandated the vaccine. All staff working directly with Covid-19 patients must be fully vaccinated, but the mandate has not been extended across the sector. A government spokesman said ways to increase healthcare worker vaccination rates were being explored, with announcements expected later this week.

Nation must not 'fear' reopening: Prime Minister

Full text: Prime Minister Scott Morrison insists the country must start to reopen when it hits vaccination targets, declaring lockdowns and heavy restrictions are "not a sustainable way" to live.
But Mr Morrison has emphasised Australia won't have a UK-style "freedom day", when effectively all restrictions are removed at once.
His comments came as ACT Chief Minister Andrew Barr again called for the nationally agreed vaccination target to be expanded to include 12- to 15-year-olds.
The national plan to steer Australian out of the pandemic is in jeopardy, with states including Western Australia and Queensland threatening to chart their own paths even once targets are reached.
Under a reopening plan based on modelling from the Doherty Institute, and agreed to by the national cabinet, states and territories would ease some restrictions once they had vaccinated 70 per cent of people aged 16 and over, if the same coverage had also been achieved nationwide.
At 80 per cent, lockdowns would only be used in "highly targeted" situations, and Australia would start to reopen to the world.
Doubts over the safety of reopening the country at those rates have risen in recent weeks, as coronavirus outbreaks have worsened in Sydney, Melbourne and Canberra.
The Doherty Institute's modelling assumed there would be just 30 cases of community transmission at the time states moved to the second stage of the plan - far fewer than the numbers currently being registered across the east coast.
Mr Morrison said in question time that he had received advice over the weekend that the number of cases would not influence the "overall conclusions" of the model.
Labor asked Mr Morrison to table the advice, but was told it was confidential.
The Prime Minister had earlier used a press conference at Parliament House to heap more pressure on the states to hold true to the national roadmap out of the pandemic.
Mr Morrison said with high rates of vaccination, Australia should not fear the prospect of reopening the country and the inevitable rise in case numbers. Instead, it should prepare for and "embrace" the path out of the pandemic, he said.
"[Lockdown] is taking a heavy toll and so they must only continue for as long as they are absolutely necessary and not a day more," he told reporters.
"It is always darkest before the dawn, and I think these lockdowns are demonstration of that, but the dawn is not far away and we are working towards that dawn and we are hastening towards the dawn.
"We should not delay it, we should prepare for it. We should not fear it, we should embrace it and we should move forward together."
Mr Barr said the ACT had agreed to the national plan because it believed there needed to be a "pathway forward".
But the ACT has two points of difference, which Mr Barr reiterated again on Monday. He wants more children to be vaccinated, with the latest outbreaks - including in the ACT - highlighting the threat of the Delta strain to younger Australians.
He also wants the plan to take into consideration the fact that individuals aren't fully protected until two to three weeks after they receive their second dose.
Mr Barr said he was on a "unity ticket" with Mr Morrison about the importance of vaccination and his assurance Australia would not replicate a UK-style "freedom day" once its targets were met.
The ACT Chief Minister took a swipe at unnamed "senior politicians" and media outlets who he said had "glossed over" the details of the national roadmap, which makes clear restrictions - including lockdowns - would remain a possibility even once 80 per cent was hit.

Full text: I want to make a number of comments. First about our national plan, to ensure that we can live with this virus. The national plan we have developed and agreed to is our pathway to living with this virus. That is our goal – to live with this virus, not to live in fear of it. It is a plan based on the best possible scientific, medical and economic advice, I would argue, available to any government in the world. We have the best people working on these issues and it’s based on the best evidence that is available to our government. It is a plan that has been developed very carefully and I want to stress over many, many months.
We began this process earlier this year. We’ve been through two iterations of the Doherty modelling to produce the national plan targets that were agreed a month or so ago. And indeed, as you will recall, the national plan was first agreed without those targets attached to it, understanding what the steps would need to be and then with the science guiding our decisions about what those targets should be. We’ve been cautious during the pandemic and that has saved lives and it has saved livelihoods. There is no doubt about that: 30,000 lives saved; 1 million people back in work as we have combated this virus in all of its strains over more than 18 months now.
But once you get to 70 per cent of your country that is eligible for the vaccine, and 80 per cent, the plan sets out that we have to move forward. We cannot hold back. Our task between that day and now is to ensure that we ready ourselves for that next phase. It means that we must continue to vaccinate at the record paces we are now doing. We must ensure that our public health systems are ready for the increase in the number of cases that will occur. We must be clear about the rules, the common sense rules, that continue to apply post-70 per cent and post-80 per cent, which is factored into the work that is being done, that has been the basis of our plan. Common sense rules. And we must adjust our mindset. Cases will not be the issue once we get above 70 per cent. Dealing with serious illness, hospitalisation, ICU capabilities, our ability to respond in those circumstances. That will be our goal and we will live with this virus as we live with other infectious diseases. That’s what the national plan is all about, was always about, that’s how we designed it and that’s how it needs to be implemented.
Because the national plan is our deal with all Australians. It is the understanding that we have with Australians making their sacrifices now and who have made them over such a long time that that sacrifice will get them to the next step. Because if not at 70 per cent and 80 per cent, then when? Then when? We must make that move and we must prepare to make that move and we must prepare the country to make that move.
The lockdowns now being endured are taking an extremely heavy toll both on the mental and physical health of Australians and on the economic success of Australia. It is taking a heavy toll and so they must only continue for as long as they are absolutely necessary and not a day more.
It is always darkest before the dawn and I think these lockdowns are demonstration of that. But the dawn is not far away and we are working towards that dawn and we are hastening towards the dawn. We should not delay it, we should prepare for it. We should not fear it, we should embrace it and we should move forward together.
There will be those who will seek to undermine the national plan. There will be those who will seek to undermine confidence in it. I think their motives are clear. But there are also those who may fear it and have concerns about what it means when you get to phase B and what it means in terms of increases in cases.
Our goal must be to help people overcome those fears and not give in to them. Because this can’t go on forever. This is not a sustainable way to live in this country – without those freedoms that we all cherish, we understand – all sensible Australians understand that there has had to be restrictions, there has had to be curtailment of what we can do during the course of a global pandemic.
The virus doesn’t respect ideologies, it doesn’t respect any of these things, it’s just a virus and we have to deal with it. Australians get that. But equally, they also know there has to be a plan out, there is a plan out, and we need to move forward with that plan.
These lockdowns, once we reach our goal, we know on the scientific, medical and economic advice, do more harm than good and so it’s important that we move as quickly as we can to that next phase. And there is strong progress towards that plan.

Full text: Liberal MPs are urging Prime Minister Scott Morrison to take a hard line against states that veto plans to ease lockdowns when vaccination rates hit 70 per cent, escalating a political clash over calls to abandon the target when coronavirus case numbers have surged to record levels.
Federal government MPs are demanding a clear path towards easing rules to give Australians a "reward" for signing up for vaccinations, with some calling for states to be able to go it alone rather than being held to the national target.
With national daily case numbers climbing to 917 yesterday, the highest since the pandemic began, state and territory leaders questioned Mr Morrison's claim that the medical advice to national cabinet endorsed the plan even at high infection rates.
The advice, from Doherty Institute professor of epidemiology Jodie McVernon and her colleagues, assumed only 30 cases in one scenario but is being clarified with a new assessment likely to go to states and territories this week.
"We assume that a single outbreak involving 30 individuals initiates community transmission at the time of transition to Phase B once target vaccine coverage is achieved," the Doherty report said.
The latest assessment, sent to Mr Morrison over the weekend, said the conclusion of the modelling over time was "essentially unchanged" if the case numbers were in the hundreds at the start. But the government has not released the new assessment and is fighting growing scepticism about its claims, with Labor leader Anthony Albanese calling for the public to see the full advice so people could know whether it was safe to ease the rules.
While the lockdown rules are under the control of states and territories, federal government MPs are calling for a hard line in Canberra to keep all leaders to the agreement to ease the curbs at 70 per cent vaccination and use lockdowns only in rare circumstances at 80 per cent.
Parliament resumes today for two weeks with government MPs becoming increasingly vocal about the need to ease the lockdowns, in contrast with Labor warning about relaxing the rules too quickly and driving case numbers even higher.
Liberal MP Fiona Martin, who represents Reid in the western suburbs of Sydney, said she was seeing lists of local companies going into liquidation and reports of mental health issues. "By opening up we are protecting people's mental health," said Dr Martin, a psychologist.
Katie Allen, the Liberal member for Higgins in Melbourne, said some of the restrictions already in place were not based on medical evidence, such as curfews, and should be the first to go when the targets were reached. "Once we get to the 70 per cent market we need to give people some incentives for having done the right thing," said Dr Allen, a doctor and medical researcher before she entered Parliament. "There is a divide that is opening up in the community - you're either pro-lockdown or anti-lockdown - and I think good bipartisan leadership will show that you have to transition out of lockdowns.
"It would be better for the country if everyone could agree on what that looked like, and I would like to see strong leadership with people sticking to the national plan they agreed to. The country needs to have some hope."
But Labor MP Mike Freelander, a doctor who represents Macarthur in western Sydney, said the 70 per cent target meant "courting disaster" with high pressure on the health system, at least until children were immunised. "The immunisation rates in high-risk groups - like Indigenous, diabetics, immuno-suppressed, teachers - are so low that it would be cavalier to remove restrictions too soon," he said. "We may get to 90 per cent of Point Piper immunised but 30 per cent of Mount Druitt," he said, contrasting suburbs in Sydney's wealthier east and poorer west. "I think the modelling needs to be questioned in great detail."
The calls from within government ranks follow comments from Treasurer Josh Frydenberg in recent days about the need to accept that the virus cannot be eliminated and will likely cause more deaths, even though vaccines will blunt its impact.
NSW Liberal Senator Andrew Bragg said political leaders had to tell Australians the virus could not be eliminated rather than hold out false hope it could be achieved.
"There could be a case for some restrictions after 70 per cent but they can't be the same punitive restrictions we have at the moment, because the whole point of getting to that vaccination is that we can start to ease," Senator Bragg said.

The national cabinet agreement sets a twin target by saying states should ease restrictions once their vaccination rates reach 70 and 80 per cent and the national average reaches the same levels but there is a push within the party room to allow more freedom.
Jason Falinski, the Liberal member for Mackellar on Sydney's northern beaches, said it was wrong to hold states back by waiting for the national average when states such as Western Australia were lagging on vaccination.
Liberal backbencher Dave Sharma, who represents Wentworth in Sydney's east, said the mortality rate in the NSW outbreak was lower than seen in Victoria last year and this showed the rules could be eased as vaccinations rose.

After almost three years in power, Morrison's toughest moment looms

Full text: As Scott Morrison approaches three years as Prime Minister, Australia's largest state is approaching its ninth week of ever-tightening COVID-19 restrictions.
NSW is the most direct path to victory for the federal Coalition. Earlier this year Coalition types were suggesting up to 10 seats were in play.
No one is talking about that now.
Sydney's citizens are racing to get vaccinated as the Delta variant continues its wildfire spread through the city. Victoria's outbreak is worsening, too.
Yes, voters also blame Premier Gladys Berejiklian for NSW's predicament, given she was slow to lock down and realise that even "gold standard" contact tracers couldn't keep up with the spread.
But Morrison will have little to celebrate on his third anniversary on Tuesday, even though he has already eclipsed Tony Abbott, Kevin Rudd and Malcolm Turnbull, and on Saturday will surpass Julia Gillard.
After winning what many thought was an unwinnable election in 2019, he has had an incredibly difficult term. First there were the tragic Black Summer bushfires, his ill-timed holiday to Hawaii and his now-notorious remark: "I don't hold a hose, mate."
Then the pandemic started. After some initial missteps and false starts - such as being dragged to tougher measures by NSW and Victoria and, similarly, rejecting income support before implementing it - Australians mostly marked the PM up, just as they did state premiers, through the first year of the pandemic.
But the political winds have shifted and this is Morrison's toughest moment.
Labor's attack - "he had two jobs: vaccines and quarantine" - is biting. Australia's vaccination rates are picking up but still lag because of insufficient Pfizer supply and the changing medical advice on AstraZeneca undermining public confidence in the vaccine.
The argument the Prime Minister should be leading rather than delegating to the states on issues such as mandatory jabs is cutting through, too.
To paraphrase Lincoln: the occasion is piled high with difficulty and there is not a sense that the Prime Minister has risen to the occasion.
This is borne out in a swathe of recent polling. The most recent Resolve Political Monitor shows a dip in the Coalition's primary vote and hints at a trend.
Support for the federal government's handling of COVID-19, published last week in The Australian Financial Review's JWS Research poll, has "fallen off a cliff" according to pollster John Scales.
The percentage of voters who think the federal government's handling of COVID has been good or very good crashed from 56 per cent in February to 38 per cent in August.
Treasurer Josh Frydenberg's warning on Thursday night that the Commonwealth was unwilling to provide financial support to states that lock down once the 70 and 80 per cent Doherty modelling vaccination targets are reached was a timely reminder of the feds' relative financial might.
"It is a fallacy for any person in Australia to think that we can actually eliminate the virus. We can't. No country has done it," Frydenberg says.
He's right. But how and when Australia lives with the virus poses huge, difficult questions.
Would the federal government seriously contemplate withdrawing financial support for Queensland or WA if they locked down - particularly with a federal election (due no later than May 2022) just a few months away, and the government desperate to hold onto seats?
Further slippage on the national plan for Australia's re-opening appears likely and Morrison knows this.
His increasingly upbeat and optimistic, hot-gospeller preambles at press conferences about how well the vaccine rollout is going - which undoubtedly grate with some - are an attempt to take charge of the narrative.
The Prime Minister wants Australians to (eventually) focus on hospitalisations, rather than case numbers, as happens with influenza.
But even as vaccination rates slowly ramp up, cases are still rising, deaths are increasing and state borders will remain mostly closed for some time.
To beat Labor at the next election, Morrison must beat Delta in the towns and suburbs of Australia. He has, at most, nine months to do it.

Booster ethics queried amid jab inequality

Full text: The effectiveness of some vaccines is likely to drop below 50 per cent within a year of inoculation, as the rise of the Delta variant is expected to accelerate the timeline for vaccine protection to wane.
However, protection against serious illness and death is expected to remain solid for much longer, according to a paper by a coalition of Australian experts - although this estimate comes with a large dose of uncertainty.
The findings are central to an emerging argument over the role of vaccine boosters.
Australia has purchased millions of booster doses, even as the World Health Organisation calls for a moratorium on boosters while people continue to die in poorer nations that have not even begun to roll out first doses.
"People were hoping it would be a one-stop-shop. But that's not what we do for flu, or for other respiratory viruses. I think it's not really unexpected," said Dr Deborah Cromer, a senior research fellow at the Kirby Institute and the paper's first author.
"Immunity is likely to wane over time, but could then easily get reboosted, either with vaccination or natural infection. And it kind of depends on when you get boosted, whether or not you would see any symptomatic disease."
The paper, a collaboration between researchers across the Kirby, the Doherty Institute in Victoria, and the University of Sydney, uses data from clinical trials and lab studies done around the world to map out how antibody levels generated by the COVID-19 vaccines block the new variants.
The paper has not yet been through rigorous peer review.
COVID-19 vaccines cause our immune system to produce a surge of new antibodies. Over time, those levels drop, and we become vulnerable to reinfection.
Pfizer falls from 91 per cent efficiency down to 84 per cent over six months, for example. A limited Israeli study is even more troubling, showing a drop in effectiveness from 95 per cent to 39 per cent between January and July. Pfizer believes an annual jab will be required to maximise effectiveness.
The emergence of variants, like Delta, that can evade some vaccine-generated antibodies likely further shortens this timeline, the paper argues.
Initially, this vulnerability is likely only to a mild illness, similar to a cold.
"Our modelling in this paper would suggest protection against severe infection and hospitalisation will hold up better over time," said the University of Sydney's Professor James Triccas, a co-author on the paper.
If vaccine immunity regularly wanes, one possibility is we could be subject to regular reinfections - with each infection mild, and serving to boost our immunity back up to a high level.
In response, Israel has rolled out a booster program, while Australia has purchased 25 million Moderna doses if it decides to do the same.
High-income countries have administered almost 100 doses per 100 people; low-income countries have only been able to manage 1.5 doses per 100 people.
The result: in Indonesia, the pandemic's new epicentre, more than 100 children a week are dying from the virus, while just 10 per cent of the country is fully vaccinated. That's led the World Health Organisation to call for a mortarium on boosters.

Primary school children face long wait for vaccines

Full text: Newcastle respiratory specialist Peter Wark says healthy children are at "very, very low risk" of serious COVID-19 illness as parents grapple with the prospect of sending students back to school unvaccinated.
"We will all be exposed to it at some point, including our children," Dr Wark said as the Delta variant spread from Sydney to regional NSW and other states.
The John Hunter Hospital specialist and University of Newcastle conjoint professor said COVID-19 "will not vanish now" and at some point the virus will "get into our community and circulate".
Schools are emerging as hotbeds of Delta transmission in countries such as the United Kingdom and the US which have removed many COVID-19 restrictions.
Dr Wark said vaccinating teenagers and younger children would be a "population decision" to limit the virus' spread.
"At this point, given the very, very low risk to a 14-year-old ... it's difficult to see a great benefit for that individual to rush out and get vaccinated. For children under the age of 10, they're at even lower risk again."

He said someone in their 20s was "probably 30 or 40 times" more likely to suffer serious COVID illness than someone aged 10 to 20.
"It's still that young adult group that are probably at greatest risk of both infection and transmissions."
Premier Gladys Berejiklian has raised the prospect of sending children back to school when NSW hits vaccination targets which could leave millions of people, including students themselves, unvaccinated when face-to-face lessons resumed.
The federal government has approved the Pfizer vaccine for about 220,000 at-risk children aged 12 to 15. It expects recommendations from the Australian Technical Advisory Group on Immunisation regarding Pfizer for those aged 12 to 15 in the "coming months".
Vaccination trials for under-12s are under way in the US, but Pfizer says it does not expect approval for this age group in America until at least the end of this year.
Dr Wark said it was unlikely Australia would approve the vaccines for young children until "the second half of next year easily".
This presents a dilemma for governments if COVID lingers in the community.
Opening up schools could expose the unvaccinated and vaccinated people with suppressed immune systems to the threat of serious disease.
"There is transmission occurring at that level, and it has a flow-on effect filtering through the rest of the communities," Dr Wark said. "It does appear that schools are featuring more highly as the source of transmission."
He said vaccinated people who did not derive the full benefit of the vaccines were "an important group".
"Some people, even if we vaccinate them, they are not going to necessarily get the efficacy reported in the trials.
"These are people particularly who have problems with their immune system or are on medications which are immunosuppressive.
"In this group, it is becoming very, very clear, things such as neutralising antibody levels are significantly less."
Allowing students to return to school would be "more reasonable" in areas with low transmission.
"At some point there clearly has to be a balance between opening up and risk, and where that appetite is going to be is as much a political decision as what it is a medical decision," he said.
"The Doherty modelling assumes ... that you've got to get that mark of 70 to 80 per cent of your population vaccinated, but even they're advocating you're going to need face masks, social distancing, limited lockdowns."
He said countries had become better at protecting the elderly and otherwise vulnerable, reducing the threat of a repeat of the March and April 2020 "nightmare".
In the UK, which opened up on July 19 as Delta cases were rising sharply, infections continued growing to about 45,000 a day then dipped to about 25,000 in early August. They have risen again to about 29,000 in recent days. The daily death rate has risen from about 50 to 90 since July 19.
Average daily deaths in the US have grown from about 200 in July to 650.

Kiwis opt for caution as the world battles to open up

Full text: Time will tell if even a small country can remain Covid-free long term
Most nations, in opening up from the Covid-19 pandemic, accept that doing so carries some risk from living with the virus. Not so New Zealand, where elimination of the virus will remain the Ardern government’s strategy for the rest of the year at least. Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern has accepted the advice of her government’s expert panel, which wants New Zealand to attempt to keep the virus out of the country indefinitely, even after the population is largely vaccinated.
As in Australia, supply problems and isolation from the worst of the pandemic overseas have left New Zealand behind much of the world on vaccines. Only 21.5 per cent of eligible Kiwis are fully vaccinated (compared with 24.3 per cent of Australians) and about 35 per cent of Kiwis (and 46 per cent of Australians) have had one jab. But also as in Australia, the pace is picking up across the Tasman. From the beginning of next month, every New Zealander aged 16 and older will be eligible for a Pfizer shot – the only Covid vaccine approved for use in the country.
Experience overseas in the US, Britain, parts of Europe and Israel shows Ms Ardern is correct when she says opening up too early in the vaccine rollout process can result in significant Covid breakouts. Striking a balance is vital. But little is certain in dealing with Covid-19 or managing recovery. Nations can make their own decisions only based on local considerations while drawing on overseas experience. New Zealand will look at opening quarantine-free travel to vaccinated travellers from low-risk countries from the first quarter of next year.
But unlike Australia, New Zealand is not linking different phases of opening up with particular levels of vaccination coverage. Guided by modelling advice to the national cabinet from the Doherty Institute, Scott Morrison has linked the next phases of relaxing restrictions in Australia, including opening up travel, to achieving targets of 70 or 80 per cent vaccination.
While Ms Ardern’s goal is for her nation to remain Covid-free and stamp on any outbreaks quickly, even a single case can have dire consequences, especially with the highly infectious Delta strain. The ACT now is locked down after three new cases of the virus were reported, taking the territory’s total to four. Three cases were confirmed late on Thursday. The three were close contacts of a man in his 20s from Gunghalin in Canberra’s north.
Despite ongoing vaccine hesitancy, one of the few certainties is the efficacies of vaccinations. Of 62 people requiring intensive care treatment in NSW after contracting Covid-19, 57 were not vaccinated, NSW deputy chief health officer Marianne Gale confirmed on Thursday. The remaining five had one dose of AstraZeneca or Pfizer. Three of the 62 people are in their 20s, seven are in their 30s, five in their 40s, 13 in their 50s, 13 in their 60s, 19 in their 70s and two in their 80s. On the positive side, a new vaccination record was set in NSW on Wednesday with 106,000 people receiving jabs, a figure Premier Gladys Berejiklian said gave her hope. But the outlook is still grim, with 345 cases of community transmission recorded overnight on Wednesday. After almost seven weeks, the lockdown is having a devastating economic impact on parts of NSW. But in the middle of the stubborn outbreak, Ms Berejiklian, in contrast to New Zealand’s inward-looking approach, is looking ahead, offering NSW residents the prospect of some restrictions being relaxed when 50 per cent of the population has been vaccinated. Rejecting the idea she is offering false hope, she understandably is looking to provide an incentive: “If you are fully vaccinated you might be able to undertake an activity which you can’t now; well, that is a positive. I think most people would appreciate that.”

Full text: Premier Gladys Berejiklian is encouraging everyone eligible in NSW to get vaccinated and help the state reach its vaccination target, as COVID-19 continues to spread into the regions.
"Two doses of 70 per cent vaccination [is the target] and NSW, if we had the current pace, we will hit that around the end of October," the premier said on Wednesday.
But life won't be "back to normal" until 80 per cent of the population is vaccinated towards the end of the November, the premier said, referencing the Doherty Institute modelling produced for the national cabinet.
NSW reported 344 new locally acquired cases of COVID-19 in the 24 hours to 8pm on Tuesday.
On the second worst day of the eight-week outbreak, at least 101 of the new cases were circulating in the community for all or part of their infectious period.
Another two people have died - a man in his 30s with underlying health conditions from Sydney's northern beaches and a man in his 90s, taking the number of COVID-related deaths in the outbreak to 34.
Both men were unvaccinated.
There were 30,510 vaccination doses administered in the 24 hours to 8pm on Tuesday night, taking the total in NSW to 1,728,339.
A Sydney man who prompted the Byron Bay lockdown when he travelled into the region while symptomatic with COVID-19 was served a court attendance notice on Wednesday at Lismore Base Hospital, with strict bail conditions.
The 52-year-old man from Rose Bay will be charged, having travelled to Byron Bay with his two children without a "reasonable excuse" and in contravention of the public health orders, police said.
He will appear in Lismore Local Court on September 13.
Ms Berejiklian pleaded with the public to stick to the rules.
"It is just a handful of people doing the wrong thing that really causes grief for everybody," she said.
The Dubbo local government area in the state's central west went into a seven-day lockdown on Wednesday after two positive cases were recorded in the region, prompting panic buying in the town.
The Department of Education was advised by NSW Health late on Tuesday of a case at Dubbo West Public School.
More than six million people in Sydney and surrounds are now in lockdown until at least August 28, with the Hunter, Byron Bay, Armidale and Tamworth areas also enduring lockdowns.
There were no extra cases in Armidale, Tamworth or the Northern Rivers region but it's unlikely the Hunter region will come out of lockdown on Thursday after 14 new cases were recorded overnight.
Ms Berejiklian said some people in NSW might be allowed more freedoms if six million vaccinations were administered by the end of August.
"That is what we are working towards and something that our government is very keen to make possible," she said.

NSW stuck in limbo

Publication info: Sydney Morning Herald ; Sydney, N.S.W. [Sydney, N.S.W]. 11 Aug 2021: 1.

Full text: NSW is in COVID-19 limbo with Premier Gladys Berejiklian adamant the lockdown measures do not need tightening while her Chief Health Officer has warned rising case numbers are too high to consider relaxing restrictions.
With Sydney seven weeks into its lockdown, cases yesterday continued to climb to a record 356 with at least 97 of those in the community while infectious. Three more people died, taking the death toll in the outbreak to 32.
Prime Minister Scott Morrison said NSW was in a "tough fight" with the Delta strain and said he wanted to see the country opened up by the end of the year.
"I want to thank everyone across NSW, right across the country, other places going through lockdowns as well," he said. "But we know that the fight in NSW is the toughest of all those fights and there's a lot at stake.
"Now, I want Australia to get to Christmas, but I want everybody around that table at Christmas time."
The current lockdown order on Sydney is due to end on August 28 but NSW Chief Health Officer Kerry Chant yesterday told a NSW parliamentary COVID-19 inquiry she had not given the government any advice about when any measures in Sydney could be eased.
She said that it was "too premature" to relax restrictions despite Ms Berejiklian indicating that some measures could be eased as early as the end of this month if vaccination targets were met.
Ms Berejiklian yesterday dismissed suggestions of curfews or a "ring of steel" around Sydney, arguing that strategies that may have worked to contain COVID-19 in the past, are not going to have an effect on the more highly contagious Delta strain.
"If we thought that they would have a significant or even marginal impact, of course we would do those things, but there is no evidence to suggest that is the case," she said.
"If we need to do more enforcement we would based on the health advice. But we're not in the business of putting in provisions or asking people to do things if they're not going to have an effect of reducing the case numbers."
Dr Chant said "we need to do more if we're going to see these case numbers come down."
"From my public health perspective I'm not happy that these case numbers are increasing, and we certainly need to do all we can, and compliance will be one of those components," Dr Chant said.
A fourth death was recorded yesterday in a man in his 80s who caught the virus overseas and tested positive in hotel quarantine.
Ms Berejiklian last week said Sydney could start to emerge from lockdown once half of NSW adults were vaccinated despite Doherty Institute modelling for the federal government nominating 70 to 80 per cent.
Dr Chant indicated she believed vaccine rates needed to be much higher than the Premier's 50 per cent target.
"I can't speak for the Premier, but certainly, I'm very committed to the issues around getting our vaccine coverage up, but very much recognise that we need that 70 per cent," Dr Chant told the inquiry.
"I am actually optimistic that at the end of August, we are going to have a higher than 50 per cent first dose coverage," Dr Chant said.
Dr Chant told the inquiry that the early lockdown measures in south-eastern Sydney, which were sparked after the infection of a Bondi limousine driver transporting overseas air crew, were effective.
However, she identified a birthday party at West Hoxton as a "super-seeding event" which saw the Delta strain escape into the community.
There have been 5805 cases since June 16 and 32 deaths.
Dr Chant said with hindsight, it was now "very easy to see that there was a greater risk of the seeding in south-western Sydney than was appreciated at the time."
Public health advocate adjunct Professor Terry Slevin, of the Public Health Association of Australia, told the COVID-19 inquiry it was not accurate to suggest government's made decisions based only on health advice.
"When any government says they're exclusively and purely following the health advice, don't believe them," he said.
"Governments actually do have a responsibility to put a filter across the public health advice for the other things for which they have responsibility; for safety, for economies and so on."
Bondi Beach Public School, in Sydney's east, was shut on Tuesday after a student tested positive to COVID-19, however the bulk of infections continues to emerge in Sydney's west and south-west.
Canterbury-Bankstown continues to be the largest source of daily cases. Twelve new cases also emerged in Georges River, dashing hopes raise the region could expect an easing of restrictions if cases remained low.
Mr Hazzard said police in Byron Bay were looking closely investigating at the circumstances of a man who tested positive after travelling to the region to look at property in the area.
Byron Shire, Richmond Valley, Lismore and Ballina Shire local government areas were placed under stay-at-home orders for one week on Monday, after it was discovered the man in his 50s had visited a number of sites.
Dr Chant said more measures were needed to stop people going into the regions, an issue she said she had discussed the issue with police.
Mr Hazzard added that he had called on NSW Health's legal team to consider whether they can "tighten" rules regarding travel from Sydney into regional areas, which is permitted for people moving and to look at real estate.

Vaccination levels pave way back to work

Full text: NSW is on track to hit six million vaccinations by the end of the month – enough to ease restrictions on work and schools by September, according to the road map out of lockdown touted by the ­Berejiklian government.
With 4.4 million jabs administered in NSW, the Premier insisted on Sunday that some restrictions could be eased at a threshold of 50 to 60 per cent of the population vaccinated – much lower than the 70 to 80 per cent target set by the Doherty Institute modelling for the federal government released last week.
But Gladys Berejiklian denied suggestions her targets were at odds with Scott Morrison’s, saying that the federal target applied to pre-lockdown level restrictions.
“We are currently in lockdown, and lockdown plus some level of easing of restrictions is possible once we get to 50 or 60 per cent rates of vaccination,” she said. “It doesn’t mean you get to what you would ease if you are at 70 per cent, but there are certainly opportunities for us to look at what we can ease in September; so long as we hit our vaccination targets, we can look for opportunities as to how we live in the month of September.” About 40 per cent of people across NSW have received at least one jab, with the government ­organising special weekend mass vaccinations for groups of essential workers.
A “Super Sunday” vaccination was held at Sydney Olympic Park for supermarket workers, cafe and restaurant staff, with 5000 doses on AstraZeneca on offer. A similar event will be held for 8000 construction workers next Sunday.
The Premier discounted the prospect of mandatory vaccinations but again suggested incentives would be offered for people to get jabbed in exchange for greater freedoms such as the ability to work.
“I urge people now to come ­forward and get vaccinated, ­especially if you are in a job which traditionally has a lot to do with people, if it has face-to-face contact,” she said.
“We encourage you to get vaccinated as soon as possible, so that we have options moving forward into September about how we can move forward more freely.” An indication of how that might play out came with the ­announcement that construction workers from the worst hit local government areas would be able to return to work sites provided the locations remained at half ­capacity – and that the workers were vaccinated. From Wednesday workers from those LGAs will have to be able to show proof of immunisation or of a negative Covid-19 test result. Rapid antigen testing is likely to be approved soon to speed up the process.
Harsh lockdown restrictions were extended into large parts of Penrith on Sunday, as the Covid-19 outbreak spread from its current Canterbury-Bankstown cluster.
With case numbers only marginally down – 262 new cases ­reported, with fewer than a third isolating while infectious – the government said it had no choice but to extend the lockdown to 12 suburbs close to the eight LGAs ­already subject to the harshest restrictions.
Residents in those 12 suburbs must stay in their local government area and can leave only for work if they are an essential worker.
Health authorities are concerned by the large numbers of new cases that were infectious while out in the community. At least 72 of the 262 new cases ­ were not in isolation during all or part of their infectious period, with the isolation status of a further 104 still under investigation.
There are now 362 cases in hospital, with 58 in intensive care and 24 cases needing ventilators to breathe. An unvaccinated woman in her 80s from the Wyoming Nursing Home in Summer Hill, in Sydney’s inner west, died at Royal Prince Alfred Hospital on Saturday.

Full text: I've yet to see any of the perpetrators - Liberal tribal mythmakers, industry lobby groups and business media cheer squad - admit to their part in the humbling of that "gold standard" virus fighter, NSW Premier Gladys Berejiklian (a woman I quite like).
All those business people feeling the pain of NSW's protracted lockdown have no one to blame but the short-sighted, self-centred urgers on their own side.
The great "learning" from our earlier struggles to control the coronavirus was the medicos' advice that the exponential nature of pandemics meant the best strategy was to go early, go hard.
The economic modelling Treasury did to accompany the Doherty Institute's epidemiological modelling confirmed this wisdom. Treasury concluded: "Continuing to minimise the number of COVID-19 cases, by taking early and strong action in response to outbreaks of the Delta variant, is consistently more [economically] cost-effective than allowing higher levels of community transmission, which ultimately requires longer and more costly lockdowns."
Another relevant "learning" - drawn by Treasury from economic studies overseas - is that, should governments not impose lockdowns, anxious people will significantly curtail their economic activity. The assumption that it's the government's lockdown, not the virus's threat to people's health, that does all the economic damage is fallacious.
Yet going early and strong is just what Berejiklian failed to do. Why? Because of all the pressure she was under from her own side to be a true Liberal and control the problem without resorting to lockdowns or border closures.
That pressure started at the top with Scott Morrison and his ministers, but was eagerly pursued by the business lobbies and the business media cheer squad. In his efforts to score points off Victorian Premier Daniel Andrews, no one worked harder than Treasurer Josh Frydenberg to propagate the mythology that only Labor premiers were so dictatorial and disregarding of business wellbeing as to lockdown and close state borders at the first sneeze, whereas Liberal premiers knew how to get results with superior testing and contact tracing.
To be fair, Labor's Mark McGowan in Western Australia and Annastacia Palaszczuk in Queensland, both with elections coming up, were aware of the votes to be reaped by gratifying locals' xenophobic tendencies towards possibly plague-ridden people from "over east" or "down south".
But with Sydney and Melbourne being our two main international gateways, it's been eminently sensible for the other premiers to protect their states from infection by closing their borders. Yet they've been subject to continuing abuse from the national press.
And in view of the medical advice, the pressure to which premiers have been subjected over lockdowns and borders amounts to trying to wish the virus away. "Don't worry about contagion. Just keep making money."
This is hardly enlightened self-interest. It's short-termism at its worst, wilfully disregarding the greater good. "Ignore other 'stakeholders' - even the consumers I hope will still be able to buy my product - I'm just gunna keep pushing my own self-interest."
The nation's business people don't need me to tell them our politicians can be trusted to favour their own survival at the next election over the prospects for businesses beyond the election.
But I do wonder whether business people understand the potential for conflict between their interests and those of others anxious to take up the cudgels on their behalf - for the small fee.
The industry lobby groups work in Canberra representing the interests of member businesses.
Much of their communication with members would be via the media, where they need to be seen as shouting louder than rival interest groups.
Being able to see the other side's viewpoint - or the government's difficulty in balancing conflicting objectives - wouldn't be career-enhancing. Like the pollies, they'd worry more about appearances and impressions than about making all things work together for the ultimate good.
The media business cheer squad's business model says telling people what they want to hear is more rewarding than telling them what they need to know. Commercially, they may be right. But, as you may have gathered, it's not the way I do business.

Full text: YESTERDAY I received an email from a year 12 student in my electorate. It was heartfelt and heartbreaking.
As a young person, he said “each lockdown hurts me more than the last,” creating “a massive toll on my mental health”.
Disillusioned and concerned, he’s not alone.
Many Victorians, young and old, while remarkably resolute and resilient throughout this pandemic, are now in lockdown number six, fatigued and weary.
But we must stay the course as there is light at the end of the tunnel. Every day, tens of thousands of our fellow Victorians are getting vaccinated, with the program rapidly gaining pace.
Recent days have seen a record number of doses delivered, including more than one million in the past six days.
This is a stark contrast from just months ago, when it took 45 days to deliver the first one million doses.
More than 40 per cent of the eligible population have received their first dose, and more than 80 per cent of those aged over 70.
Our focus on suppressing the virus and vaccinating the most vulnerable has helped save 30,000 lives, and seen Australia avoid the fate of other nations.
In Canada, more than 26,000 people have lost their lives, and in Britain about 130,000.
The focus from here must be on vaccinating as many people as possible, as quickly as possible, with modelling from the Doherty Institute identifying a 70 per cent vaccination rate as a key threshold to reach.
At this point, it says, lockdowns become less likely and the transmissibility of the virus reduces, as does the chance of serious illness for those who are vaccinated.
Just as the health outcomes improve, so do the economic ones, with Treasury analysis estimating the cost to the economy from moderate restrictions and early action to get on top of outbreaks less than a fifth of that incurred by longer and more severe lockdowns.
This is why everyone must get the jab, to not only protect the health of themselves and their loved ones, but also the security of their jobs.
The reality is that until we reach a 70 per cent vaccination rate, we are likely to see state governments respond to outbreaks with short and sharp lockdowns, as we’ve just seen in Victoria.
Where these lockdowns occur, the Morrison government is quick to provide support.
This includes payments to individuals in Victoria of up to $750 a week for those who have lost work.
Applications can be made through Services Australia and, in some cases, are processed in under an hour.
The federal government has also agreed to jointly fund a $400m support package for small and medium-sized businesses in Victoria, including for sole traders.
It builds on a $400m package that we announced for Victoria just last week. Gyms, hairdressers and cafes are among the nearly 100,000 eligible businesses, with grants of up to $20,000 to be made to larger hospitality venues disrupted by the lockdown.
The federal government is also working with the banks to see that their customers are provided with relief on loan repayments as a result of hardship caused by the lockdowns.
Similarly, I have spoken to the Australian tax commissioner who through the ATO is seeking to be flexible and practical in assisting taxpayers during this difficult period.
As was the case last year during the height of the pandemic, it will take a Team Australia effort, government and business working together towards the one goal of helping our fellow Australians get through Covid.
I am confident that despite the challenges we face today, we will be stronger on the other side.
As recently as June, unemployment in Victoria had fallen to 4.4 per cent, and the national unemployment rate was at a 10-year low.
Business and consumer confidence was up, job advertisements were at a record high, and employers spoke of their desperate need to get more workers.
Australia, ahead of any advanced economy in the world, had more people in work, and an economy that was bigger than before Covid-19 began.
This proven ability of the Australian economy to bounce back from the lockdowns should give Victorians confidence about their future.
As the Governor of the Reserve Bank of Australia said just yesterday: “There is a pathway out of the current difficulties”.
“Australia’s experience is that once restrictions are lifted, spending recovers strongly,” he said.
And the bank is forecasting a “return to strong growth in 2022’’. There is no doubt this is a difficult time for Victorians, as it is for the nation. But we must stay strong, we must stay safe, and we must look after one another. JOSH FRYDENBERG IS FEDERAL TREASURER

‘Older Aussies should encourage grandkids to get shots’

Full text: Former governors-general are calling on Australia’s youth to get vaccinated in the fight against Covid-19 after Doherty Institute modelling showed deaths and hospitalisations would be nearly halved under a strategy to vaccinate all adults as opposed to older people first.
As NSW recorded a record 291 cases, of which at least 50 were ­active in the community, Peter Cosgrove said jabs were the pathway back to normality.
“There is no doubt the best way we can protect one another and get back to normal is through vaccination. So my advice is that everybody should get both vaccinations and thus protect their families, their communities and all Australians,” Sir Peter said.
“In particular, I send this plea to younger Australians: you’re our nation’s future so get vaccinated.” Quentin Bryce echoed the call, declaring vaccinations an essential protection. She said older generations knew the power and importance of vaccinations and encouraged them to share that ­information with their grandchildren. “Grandmothers like me know the power of vaccination in preventing disease. We have seen it again and again. Whooping cough, polio, chickenpox ... Our top priority is always the health of our young ones – their futures, the next generations,” she said.
“We must keep on to them with texts, phone calls and when they drop groceries at the front gate about vaccinations and thoughts of our dear ones and neighbours living alone. Grandmothers are great advocates. Our most pow­erful tool is our voice and the ­example we set.” Dame Quentin, who is locked down in Indooroopilly, Brisbane, and last week had her second dose of AstraZeneca, said vaccines could make a difference to one’s piece of mind.
“At home alone in Indooroopilly in sudden lockdown, there is a strange stillness. Even the birds are quiet,” she said. “The schoolchildren who come in their thousands to our neighbourhood every day are quarantined.
“It’s hard to stop thinking about them and their families, at risk in the pandemic.
“In the park nearby, cars line up at the testing station, set up on Saturday. Uncertainty and anxiety are palpable in conversation ­behind masks. What are the rules? What should I be doing?” For her, the answer is clear: vaccination.
Sir Peter said there was a lot to be proud of in terms of Australians’ response to the pandemic, but vaccines were the final piece of the puzzle. “We’ve looked after each other to a great degree by our sense of civic responsibility and personal sacrifice,” he said.
Lieutenant General John Frewen, commander of the nat­ional vaccine rollout, has developed a plan to get younger people vaccinated sooner, with “peak trans­mitters”, Australians aged 30-39, brought forward to the end of this month and the 16-29 age group from October.
“All age groups can access ­AstraZeneca,” General Frewen said this week. “The main reason for not opening up all cohorts to mRNA (right now) is filling up booking systems and not realistically being able to access the stuff.
“Again I’d encourage every Australian to make an informed choice now about whether they want to get vaccinated with what’s available right now or whether they wish to wait.” Additional reporting: Joe Kelly

Vaccine assurances as doses redirected to Sydney

Full text: The Port Stephens community has been given an assurance from the state government that 'no resident in Port Stephens will miss out on being vaccinated' as a result of a decision to redirect Pfizer vaccinations to Year 12 HSC students in locked down Sydney.
Parliamentary secretary to the Hunter Taylor Martin told the Examiner this week the government's decision would, however, mean that some appointments in the next few weeks would be rescheduled.
"During the summer bushfires we shared resources and sent them to the regions where they were needed most. Our response during a pandemic should be no different. We should have empathy for those most affected and do whatever we can to get through it together," Mr Martin said.
"I really want to thank those people who have been affected by this change for their enthusiasm to get vaccinated. In the next few days they will be provided with a code to ensure that they can get priority when more Pfizer appointments are released."
Mr Martin said that up to 40,000 Pfizer doses were being redistributed from NSW Health's rural and regional supply - including 5,500 from across the Hunter - to be lent to south-west and western Sydney, to help vaccinate Year 12 students.
"Year 12 students in particular this year have had their senior years of schooling massively impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic," Mr Martin said.
"By prioritising these students, we are giving them the best opportunity to get back to the classroom, and most importantly reduce the chance of disruption during their HSC exams.
"We have successfully kept COVID out of Port Stephens for a long time. We need to do everything we can to combat COVID in Sydney, to crush it and keep it as far away from Port Stephens as possible."
State MP Kate Washington said that she had received a mixed response to the decision before adding "but really it shouldn't have come to this diabolical situation".
"Port Stephens sits on the edge of the lockdown area and we have one of the oldest communities in the state. Many people are feeling very vulnerable and we are all fearful of the virus' return to Port Stephens," she said.
"Our community should not be paying the price for the Prime Minister's vaccine rollout failure. Decisions by both the state and federal governments have left our community vulnerable, and at the best of times, our local health services are already stretched to their limit."
She said that staff at the Tomaree Hospital were constantly being asked to do more with less.
"As our population has grown there hasn't been the investment in our hospital to meet the increasing health needs. We will continue to fight for more local GPs and better local healthcare services, so our community is safer and our over stretched doctors, nurses, hospital workers, paramedics and GP clinic staff are better supported."
Federal MP Meryl Swanson was equally critical of the federal government's role in the vaccine rollout.
"This government has failed in its job to secure enough Pfizer to immunise the Hunter, it should never have been Sydney vs Hunter, we should have had enough to protect the state in its entirety," she said.
"Locals are constantly telling me they want certainty around the vaccine rollout. My office is being inundated with calls about appointment cancellations, many of these people are among the most vulnerable in our community.
"We are talking with many locals who are confused and concerned about the mixed messages on the vaccine rollout."
LOCAL NEWS: Aboriginal mural a uniting force in Medowie The Port's only vaccine hub, the Raymond Terrace Family Practice located in Jacaranda Avenue, has not been impacted by the redirection of Pfizer vaccinations.
"Our supply is direct from the Commonwealth, it is the NSW Health supply that is being redirected," said the clinic's Dr Damien Welbourne.
He said the clinic had been overwhelmed with requests for appointments for both the AstraZeneca and Pfizer jabs in recent weeks.
In May they were administering 900 a week; that number has grown to 1,350 a week and could reach its 2,000 capacity in the near future.
"We have had to open up extra clinics to keep up with the demand," he said. "In most cases as soon as we open up appointments on a Sunday they are getting snapped up. The current wait for a Pfizer vaccine is around three weeks and a little shorter for the AstraZeneca."
Dr Welbourne said that there was a defined process people had to go through in order to get the Pfizer vaccine.
"People are inquiring [about any potential health risks] ... some are prepared to wait and conversely we have people under 60 willing to get the AstraZeneca."
Locals can check for available GP appointments via the Australian government eligibility checker.

Full text: NSW is aiming to have six million doses of COVID-19 vaccines in arms by the end of the month as part of a push to get Greater Sydney out of lockdown.
But easing restrictions in September will depend on the case numbers, which even Premier Gladys Berejiklian admits are "anyone's guess".
NSW recorded 199 new locally acquired cases in the 24 hours to 8pm on Monday, 82 of which were in the community while infectious.
"I have to be honest about this - (we don't know yet) whether we're through the worst of it or not," Ms Berejiklian told reporters on Tuesday.
"There's clearly been a plateauing in the last week but we don't know if we'll see (the numbers) worsen before they get better."
An outbreak of the virulent Delta strain will keep Greater Sydney and surrounding regions in lockdown until at least August 28.
The government's willingness to ease the lockdown at the end of the month depends on vaccination rates and the case numbers.
But hitting the target of six million jabs - roughly equivalent to 50 per cent of the population - would not mean the state could fully open up.
Modelling provided to National Cabinet by the Doherty Institute and published on Tuesday suggests thousands would die if an uncontrolled outbreak occurred with 50 per cent vaccination coverage.
But Ms Berejiklian said NSW "would never completely relax" at that rate.
Just over four million doses have already been administered in NSW, with 42.23 per cent of those aged 16 and over receiving at least one dose and just under 20 per cent fully vaccinated. Some 460,000 shots were administered in the past week alone. The government wants vaccines concentrated in the eight south western and western Sydney local government areas identified as of highest concern.
The two priorities for easing restrictions are getting children back to school and getting parents back to work, Ms Berejiklian said, and the government is considering incentives for those who get vaccinated.
Instead of a cash payment suggested by the federal opposition, Ms Berejiklian said she is contemplating offering greater freedoms to the fully vaccinated.
"(People) want peace of mind that they can move more freely, send their kids to school, work, so any incentives around those things we think are great motivators," Ms Berejiklian said.
Chief Health Officer Kerry Chant urged people living in neighbourhoods near the LGAs of concern to also be on high alert. "The disease has actually got the potential to creep," Dr Chant warned.
Meanwhile, a major Sydney hospital and two nursing homes are dealing with COVID-19 outbreaks.
Thirty-six staff at Westmead Hospital are in isolation after a vaccinated colleague who worked three shifts last week while infectious tested positive.
COVID-19 cases at Wyoming Nursing Home in Summer Hill on Tuesday rose to 19 residents and two staff members. All residents on one floor at the Wyoming Nursing Home have been taken to hospital as a precaution. The facility said in a statement on Tuesday that more than 80 per cent of its residents and staff are vaccinated.
Another contract staffer at another nursing home, St Hedwig Village at Blacktown, has also reportedly tested positive for the virus but no other cases have been identified so far.
The Greater Sydney, Blue Mountains, Central Coast, Wollongong and Shellharbour area regions have been in lockdown since late June. Since the outbreak began seven weeks ago in Bondi, 3832 people have contracted the virus and 15 people have died. There are now 250 COVID-19 patients in Sydney hospitals, with 53 people in intensive care units and 20 people ventilated.

QRR plan to let flights overseas resume

Publication info: Sydney Morning Herald ; Sydney, N.S.W. [Sydney, N.S.W]. 04 Aug 2021: 1.

Full text: Australians will use a QR code vaccine certificate for international travel under a multimillion-dollar federal government plan to reopen the borders, but the Coalition disagrees over whether to extend the requirement to domestic travel.
The Herald can reveal the government's expenditure review committee of cabinet last week debated a proposal for vaccination certificates, which would lead to quarantine-free international travel. It would involve linking people's vaccination status on their MyGov accounts - a secure online portal that stores Australians' personal information - with new digital vaccination certificates and border declarations.
Prime Minister Scott Morrison is pushing for use of the certificates domestically on the basis it will encourage more Australians to get vaccinated faster under national cabinet's planned four-phase reopening of the country. He yesterday released new Doherty Institute modelling that supported an end to lockdowns once national vaccine rates hit 80 per cent of the eligible population.
But the issue remains contentious within the Coalition party room, with several MPs from within its conservative ranks voicing opposition against any mandatory system. Several more MPs are prepared to support the system for both international and domestic travel but want it ruled out for supermarkets and other essential activities.
Proof of vaccination or negative COVID-19 tests vary among nations. Britain and France have pushed ahead with plans to extend them to large-scale sporting events, nightclubs and major tourist attractions.
A senior Coalition figure, speaking on condition of anonymity because they are bound by cabinet-in-confidence, said the government was seeking a practical way through because of a realisation the proposal could be met with significant levels of opposition.
Under the plan submitted by Employment Minister Stuart Robert, Foreign Minister Marise Payne, Health Minister Greg Hunt and Home Affairs Minister Karen Andrews to the expenditure review committee last Wednesday, Australians would able to get their vaccine certificates through MyGov.
It would be in the form of a QR code and could either be printed out or put into a digital wallet on an electronic device.
The international vaccine certificates, which the government aims to roll out by October, would use a technology promoted by the International Civil Aviation Organisation called a Visible Digital Seal.
This will be aided by a deal Services Australia has reached with Apple and Google to allow digital wallets on both iPhone and Android devices to show Australians' COVID-19 vaccination records from their MyGov accounts.
Qantas last week confirmed it would roll out a digital health pass for international flights, which will confirm passengers have clearance to fly.
The airline said many countries required either proof of vaccination or a negative test result to allow entry without quarantine. These include Britain, the United States and Canada.
Federal Tourism Minister Dan Tehan has previously flagged an intention to establish a vaccine passport system in Australia for domestic travel, but industry sources said there was doubt that any airline would be able to efficiently implement such a system.
The vaccine certificates, being developed by Services Australia and the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade, would also link with a new technology being developed by the Department of Home Affairs called the Digital Passenger Declaration, which will allow for collection of health information.
The government is still trying to devise how to link the three services.
While DFAT is the department that issues passports, it has no legal basis for collecting Australians' vaccination status under the Australian Passports Act, which may mean the data has to be stored by other agencies such as Services Australia or Home Affairs.
Some Coalition MPs - including Nationals MP George Christensen and Liberal senators Alex Antic, Gerard Rennick and Eric Abetz - have spoken out about any move to require vaccine certificates for domestic travel. Mr Christensen, who also opposes vaccine passports for international travel, voiced his opposition to the move at the Coalition joint party room meeting yesterday morning.
Senator Antic said he did not have a problem with requiring vaccination certificates for international travel, but he was "concerned that a domestic COVID vaccine passport will lead to discrimination against Australians and create a two-tiered society".

Labor calls for $300 payments for vaccinated Aussies

Full text: Labor has demanded a one-off $300 payment for any Australian fully-vaccinated before December.
Prime Minister Scott Morrison on Friday revealed new details of Australia's path out of COVID-19 restrictions, relying on a high vaccination uptake in each state and territory.
COVID-19 Taskforce Commander Lieutenant-General John Frewen was optimistic about Australians being offered vaccinations by the end of the year.
And in a bid to encourage Australians to come forward, Labor has called for $300 to be sent to any Australian to have received their second dose by December 1.
"The government has failed on its two jobs this year, the rollout of the vaccine and fixing quarantine. It needs to use every measure at its disposal to protect Australians and our economy," he said.
The money would be back-paid to Australians who had already received the vaccine.
Labor claimed the cash payments would provide a $6 billion boost to an economy crippled by NSW's extended lockdown.
The party's treasury spokesman Jim Chalmers on Monday lashed the Mr Morrison's claim Australia would be in a "goal medal race" to get vaccinated.
"Let's be brutal about it: we're at the arse-end of the medal tally when it comes to vaccinations," he told ABC Drive.
The federal government on Friday revealed a 70 per cent full-vaccination rate among eligible Australians would be required to enter Phase B of its four-step reopening plan.
In a sign the government was mulling incentives to get vaccinated, an outline of the plan revealed Phase B may include moves "encouraging uptake through incentives and other measures".
The next phase, which will see lockdowns almost entirely eradicated, will be triggered once an 80 per cent threshold is reached.
Health Minister Greg Hunt said on Monday modelling from the Doherty Institute, on which the reopening plan was based, will be revealed "in the coming days".
"Our goal here is to ensure everybody who seeks to be vaccinated is vaccinated this year. The number is unlimited," he said.
The Grattan Institute on Friday suggested a $10m-a-week lottery with an entry for each dose, as well as vaccine passports for domestic flights and attend large events.

But as NSW's crisis deepened, Prime Minister Scott Morrison has stressed the jab was available to all adults after consultation with a GP.
"People take risks driving their car every year, and that's greater than what we're talking about with this vaccine, or any vaccine for that matter," he told 4BC Radio on Monday.
"All vaccines, any medicines have these very mild and small risks ... You can give your informed consent."
Health Department data showed 13,391 AstraZeneca doses had been administered to people aged 16-50 across the ACT.

Full text: Labor has demanded a one-off $300 payment for any Australian fully-vaccinated before December.
Prime Minister Scott Morrison on Friday revealed new details of Australia's path out of COVID-19 restrictions, relying on a high vaccination uptake in each state and territory.
COVID-19 Taskforce Commander Lieutenant-General John Frewen was optimistic about Australians being offered vaccinations by the end of the year.
And in a bid to encourage Australians to come forward, Labor has called for $300 to be sent to any Australian to have received their second dose by December 1.
"The government has failed on its two jobs this year, the rollout of the vaccine and fixing quarantine. It needs to use every measure at its disposal to protect Australians and our economy," he said.
The money would be back-paid to Australians who had already received the vaccine.
Labor claimed the cash payments would provide a $6 billion boost to an economy crippled by NSW's extended lockdown.
The party's treasury spokesman Jim Chalmers on Monday lashed the Mr Morrison's claim Australia would be in a "goal medal race" to get vaccinated.
"Let's be brutal about it: we're at the arse-end of the medal tally when it comes to vaccinations," he told ABC Drive.
The federal government on Friday revealed a 70 per cent full-vaccination rate among eligible Australians would be required to enter Phase B of its four-step reopening plan.
In a sign the government was mulling incentives to get vaccinated, an outline of the plan revealed Phase B may include moves "encouraging uptake through incentives and other measures".
The next phase, which will see lockdowns almost entirely eradicated, will be triggered once an 80 per cent threshold is reached.
Health Minister Greg Hunt said on Monday modelling from the Doherty Institute, on which the reopening plan was based, will be revealed "in the coming days".
"Our goal here is to ensure everybody who seeks to be vaccinated is vaccinated this year. The number is unlimited," he said.
The Grattan Institute on Friday suggested a $10m-a-week lottery with an entry for each dose, as well as vaccine passports for domestic flights and attend large events.

‘Freedom incentives’ to spur vaccination as Scott Morrison rejects cash

Full text: The government ­received advice last week outlining the merits of financial ­incentives as other countries, including the US and Britain, announced inducements to maintain the momentum of their vaccination programs.
The research — prepared by the Behavioural Economics Team of the Australian Government, led by the Health Department and officials at Prime Minister and Cabinet – concluded that financial incentives were “unlikely to drive vaccine uptake in Australia”.
Instead, the government will likely prioritise non-financial incentives, including partnering with businesses to provide discounts and frequent flyer point bonuses, ahead of a US-style cash approach. Joe Biden said last week $100 should be paid to people who were fully vaccinated.
There were 220 new Covid-19 cases recorded on Monday – 207 in Greater Sydney and 13 in Queensland, where the government extended a lockdown across the state’s southeast until Sunday.
Health officials also declared 11 southeast Queensland local government areas as commonwealth hot spots, recommending vaccines be made available to vulnerable children as young as 12.
The Australian’s Dennis Shanahan says Scott Morrison has decided to break out of appearing to lack leadership by declaring to the country "the war will be over by Christmas" if the nation meets a 70 per cent vaccination rate.
Ahead of vaccine supply ramping up in September, the government is examining a range of incentive options considered crucial for Australia to progress to the second and third phases of national cabinet’s reopening plan, requiring 70 and 80 per cent vaccine coverage.
Anthony Albanese on Tuesday will put forward a $6bn vaccine plan which proposes a $300 payment to all Australians who get vaccinated by December 1.
The Opposition Leader said Labor’s proposal would ­deliver a “much-needed shot in the arm for businesses and workers struggling from lockdowns made necessary by the Morrison government’s failures with the vaccine rollout”. “These payments will deliver significant cash stimulus for ­businesses who have paid the price for Scott Morrison’s failures on vaccines and quarantine for the past eighteen months,” Mr Albanese said.
The BETA research said financial incentives could set an “expensive precedent for future vaccine strategies”.
“Offering financial incentives may be effective in increasing vaccine uptake if the monetary value is immediate, very high and guaranteed (one experiment found an incentive of over 3000 euros would be required),” it reads.
“But financial incentives also run the risk of increasing people’s risk perceptions if it’s construed people have to be ‘paid’ to get the vaccine … Financial incentives can also be costly as, in order to be fair, they need to include all vaccinated people – not just those who become vaccinated after the ­reward is introduced.”
Relaxing restrictions for vaccinated people, rather than financial incentives, was identified as a successful tool for governments with vaccination rates in France spiking after Emmanuel Macron on July 12 threatened to restrict access to public places for unvaccinated residents. “ ‘Returning to normal’ and the ability to travel are strong motivators for many,” the report said. “Providing vaccinated people with personal freedoms, and restricting the freedoms of those who aren’t, is likely to drive ­vaccine uptake. Examples could include attending large public events (sporting events and music festivals) and expanded travel ­options.”
The Prime Minister said on Monday that when the country moved to the second phase of national cabinet’s reopening plan, exemptions from health restrictions would likely be provided for fully-vaccinated residents.
Prime Minister Scott Morrison has revealed he wishes the vaccination targets for reopening had been set lower, but he is still hopeful they will be met.
“It’s exemptions that would apply to people who are vaccinated because they’ve taken the step to reduce their risk to other people and to themselves,” Mr Morrison said. “Where people have taken those steps, well, clearly it’s just common sense that they can be exempted from restrictions that would be necessary for those who haven’t got that protection and are very vulnerable.”
Mr Albanese said the government’s vaccination program had failed. “(The government) needs to use every measure at its disposal to protect Australians and our economy,” the Opposition Leader said.
The BETA report said: “Incentives make a difference by enhancing the perceived benefits of the vaccine (or increasing the costs of not vaccinating).
“This should be the primary consideration when considering the design of an incentive program. Incentives provide people with an additional and more immediate benefit. For some, incentives make the benefits of vaccination to outweigh its risks, thereby encouraging vaccination behaviour.”
“An incentive may also serve as an additional cue to action by signalling appropriate behaviour. This should be a secondary consideration. Small incentives are not sufficient to directly influence this complex decision process.”
The British government on the weekend announced incentives to drive vaccine take-up among younger residents, with Uber, Deliveroo and other businesses offering discounts for vaccinated customers.
The BETA research examined the effect of Covid-19 vaccine lotteries adopted by some US states, including California and Ohio.
“The number of Californians getting their first vaccine dose increased modestly the day after (Governor Gavin) Newsom announced the vaccine lottery but continued to mostly decline after that,” it said.
“Several US states have conducted lotteries to incentivise residents to get vaccinated. These have only begun in the last few months and rigorous evaluations have yet to be conducted. Early analysis of the Ohio and California lotteries showed they had little or no impact … Some announcements also coincided with more people becoming eligible to receive the vaccine, so it is unclear whether the lotteries simply brought forward those who always planned to get vaccinated, rather than swaying people who were undecided.”
Independent Senator Rex Patrick says Prime Minister Scott Morrison must release the Doherty Institute COVID-19 modelling.

Full text: Australia's biggest companies will set up mammoth schemes to vaccinate employees and their families with unallocated vaccines in a bid to boost the national rollout and help end sweeping lockdowns.
Supplies of the AstraZeneca vaccine are the most readily available, with roughly 3 million doses sitting in clinics or warehouses across the country as CSL in Melbourne continues to produce about 1 million doses per week.
Companies are working out the details with COVID Taskforce head Lieutenant General John Frewen about using their own health teams to distribute AstraZeneca vaccines not being taken by state governments, doctors and pharmacies. Some of the corporate programs are set to start within weeks.
News of the project came as Prime Minister Scott Morrison announced vaccinated Australians would be able to avoid lockdown restrictions once 70 per cent of the eligible adult population had received two doses, and international border rules would be loosened to allow more people to come home.
Once the national total hit 80 per cent, broad lockdowns would not be used in major cities, he said, caps on returning Australians would be abolished and all restrictions on vaccinated travellers leaving the country would be removed.
Mr Morrison said national cabinet agreed to the plans yesterday afternoon after considering scientific modelling from the Doherty Institute and economic advice from Treasury.
"So if you get vaccinated, there will be special rules that apply to you," he said last night.
"Why? Because if you're vaccinated, you present less of a public health risk. You are less likely to get the virus. You are less likely to transmit it."
Data revealed to the Herald shows NSW has ordered just 17 per cent of the AstraZeneca doses available to it, the lowest rate of any state or territory. Of the 964,920 doses available to week 25, NSW had ordered 164,020 doses. Victoria had ordered 77 per cent, or 664,480 doses, of the AstraZeneca allotted to the state.
The Commonwealth Bank has one of the most advanced corporate vaccination projects, which would use the company's health contractors to replicate its annual flu vaccine program with an AstraZeneca or Pfizer dose for all staff and their families in a voluntary program. Those vaccination clinics could also be opened to the general public.
The CBA, which has 40,000 staff, is talking to its flu vaccine provider about offering the COVID-19 vaccines at bank offices if and when it can secure supplies from the federal government.
A bank spokeswoman said the company supports the vaccination program and will do whatever it can to help as many Australians as possible get vaccinated.
"We have offered annual flu shots to our people and their families for several years and we would work closely with federal and state health authorities to help roll out a vaccination program at CBA," she said.
General Frewen said he was working with businesses to accelerate the vaccination program.
"We've already started in-reach programs to vaccinate key distribution centre workers for the retailers and will shortly be looking at a similar program to help vaccinate construction workers," he said.
The Business Council of Australia, which represents 130 member companies with more than 1 million staff combined, held a conference call with General Frewen on Tuesday to canvass ways employers could back the vaccine rollout. BCA chief executive Jennifer Westacott said companies were offering support to the federal government.
"Whether that's adapting existing flu vaccinations for staff to also provide COVID shots, making premises available for new public vaccination hubs or providing administrative staff to help with the rollout," she said.
Mining and other resources companies are exploring ways to use their infrastructure in regional areas, such as transport links and remote offices, to vaccinate staff and Indigenous communities, but business won't replace more traditional routes to vaccination.
General Frewen was also encouraging pharmacies and GPs to order more AstraZeneca, and those doses would be fast-tracked particularly to pharmacies in NSW where there had been a strong uptake of the vaccine.
In a speech to the Australian Medical Association's national conference today, Mr Morrison is expected to say the federal government had made a conscious decision to back doctors as the main component of the rollout.
"Our GPs have worked tirelessly to provide well over half, the lion's share, of Australia's COVID-19 vaccines to date," he will say.
At the same conference, acting Chief Medical Officer Professor Michael Kidd will urge doctors "not to get too comfortable" even as more people get immunised. "There will be plenty of twists and turns as we continue along the pandemic journey - and as the current Delta variant is tragically demonstrating, future variants are going to pose significant public health challenges," he will say.
There will be the continuing impact of long COVID for some people, as well as an increase in deaths from chronic diseases, he will warn.

Full text: Under-40s drive massive vaccine delivery result YOUNGER Sydneysiders are answering Australia’s call to arms and getting the AstraZeneca vaccine in record numbers, with more than 12,000 under-40s in NSW receiving the jab this week in the four days from Sunday to Wednesday alone.
According to figures seen by this newspaper the momentum is increasing, with 4839 of those jabs being administered just on Wednesday, the same day the nation recorded a ­record 201,470 vaccine doses delivered.
If the trends continue, it will mean that more than 20 per cent of the state’s daily jabs will have gone to under-40s heeding the calls by Prime Minister Scott Morrison and Premier Gladys Berejiklian to seek health advice from their GP and get vaccinated.
The news comes as worrying new data revealed that Sydney’s second Covid wave is mainly hitting younger ­people. Sixty-five per cent of cases recorded in the past week were in people under 40.
“We have to also remember that the communities of southwestern and western Sydney are also particularly young,” Chief Health Officer Kerry Chant said. Young people are being hospitalised with Covid-19, including two teenagers currently in intensive care, as well as eight ICU patients in their 20s, and four in their 30s.
The age group with the most infections in the past week were 30 to 39-year-olds – representing 227 cases. Experts say the numbers show that younger Australians are keen to do what they can to protect themselves and help get the country out of the ­pandemic.
Edgecliff resident Adelaide Bracey, 26, has booked in to get her first jab because she “just wants to do the right thing”. “I want Australia to open up again and I want to protect my family and my friends,” she said.
Professor Lyndal Trevena of the School of Public Health at the University of Sydney applauded the positive approach by younger jab recipients.
“Until recently there was some pent-up demand because younger people weren’t eligible, but we have also hit that tipping point where the risks of the disease are seen to outweigh the very small risks of the vaccine.” Provocate managing director Troy Bilsborough said the news about the uptake was positive as the NSW lockdown proved Australia’s economy – and the Morrison Government’s political fortunes – could not afford for people to wait for Pfizer later in the year.
The news comes as national cabinet prepares to meet on Friday to discuss modelling to guide the nation’s reopening plan, which will be based on hitting as-yet undetermined vaccination thresholds.
Writing in The Daily Telegraph today Lieutenant-General John Frewen, co-ordina­tor general of the govern­ment’s Operation Covid Shield, said “the momentum is building” behind the vaccine program. OPINION PAGE 64

Full text: Australia has been warned 80 per cent of all 25.7 million residents being fully-vaccinated is the "only way" to see life return to normal.
The Grattan Institute has demanded national cabinet make lockdowns and border closures a thing of the past by pledging to hit the "ambitious target" by March.
Australians had supported a hardline approach which had averted disaster but, after months punctured by state lockdowns, were increasingly "tired and frustrated" with disruptions to their lives, it warned.
"Australians shouldn't and won't accept high death tolls or indefinite restrictions. Achieving very high vaccination coverage is the only way to avoid these outcomes," its report read.
"We cannot abandon our zero-Covid strategy too early and risk the calamity we have so far avoided.
"But on the other hand, we cannot remain walled inside Fortress Australia indefinitely, cut off from the rest of the world and periodically cut off from one another."

"We can vaccinate enough Australians to tame Covid ... [Our targets] will give us the best chance of gradually returning to normal life," it said.

Prime Minister Scott Morrison revealed the Doherty Institute, tasked with providing a vaccination target needed to reopen, had provided its modelling to the federal government.
State and territory leaders will begin discussions on Australia's reopening timeline at national cabinet on Friday.
Grattan said an 80 per cent target was achievable by March, and could even be reached by the end of the year if vaccines were approved for children under 12.
But that would require a drastic increase in full-vaccination rates among the most vulnerable, including over 70s. Just 36.6 per cent of over 70s had received two doses by Sunday, a figure that would need to hit 95 per cent.
To do that, Grattan has called for vaccines to be administered in workplaces, schools, and pop-up clinics.
A number of measures to incentivise uptake were also touted, including a national vaccine lottery and vaccine passports being required for certain activities.
Aged care workers will be required to receive the jab by September, and Grattan said mandating vaccination in other "high-priority" workforces may also be needed.

Aussies set for vaccine passports

Full text: AUSTRALIANS will have an internationally recognised vaccine certificate by October, but it will be up to individual states to decide if the document is required for certain activities within the country.
Prime Minister Scott Morrison is in ongoing discussions with other world leaders as they develop a system to easily identify and formally recognise the vaccination status of any person.
“Later in the year, about October we estimate, we’ll have a vaccination certificate that will be able to be used (and) ­internationally recognised to facilitate when people are moving out of the country and into the country, being able to recognise others’ certificates,” he said last week.
The news came as NSW chief health officer Dr Kerry Chant lamented the slow take-up rate of the AstraZeneca vaccine for Sydney residents over the age of 60, as the state recorded 145 new Covid cases — 51 who were active in the community while infectious. There were two more Covid-19 deaths – a man and a woman, both aged in their 80s.
Dr Chant said it was concerning NSW residents over 60 were not taking up “plentiful” supplies of the AstraZeneca vaccine. “It is actually quite distressing, when I review the numbers, to see how few over even 60-year-olds and over 70-year-olds we have managed to reach,” she said.
Victoria recorded 11 new ­locally acquired Covid-19 infections on Monday — all were in quarantine. The news prompted authorities to consider an end to the state’s fifth lockdown with an announcement expected on Tuesday.
Mr Morrison said it was ultimately up to the states how they might use a vaccine certificate and whether they would use it to restrict how people move about within their own state.
“The commonwealth government can’t do that,” he said.
“Only the state governments can place restrictions on people entering a venue or ­entering a place of work.” He said there were also industrial relations issues that would apply to mandating vaccines in a workplace.
“(States) can apply the public health orders that mandate vaccinations, like the Western Australian Premier has done in terms of quarantine-based workers,” he said.
“They have those powers.” The federal government has already developed a tamper-proof digital Covid-19 vaccine certificate which is automatically generated when an Australian receives their second jab. The document is connected to a person’s MyGov account and will be continually updated with information from the Australian Immunisation Register, potentially including if and when booster shots are introduced.
The government expects the passport will be able to be accessed easily through digital apps like the Apple Wallet within weeks.
The document could be used by states as the basis for health orders requiring vaccination in certain settings.
Mr Morrison said he believed Australia had the supply, depending on “external shocks”, to offer everyone a vaccine who wants it by the end of 2021.
He suggested a certificate allowing people to do certain activities could encourage people to take up the jab.
“What the level of vaccinations (is) will be a function of how many Australians take that up, and we’ll be seeking to maximise that as much as possible,” he said. National cabinet has tasked the Peter Doherty Institute for Infection and Immunity with modelling the different levels of risk from Covid-19, including specifically the Delta variant of the virus, depending on the level of vaccination achieved in Australia.

Lessons of NSW v Victoria lockdowns

Full text: We have a natural experiment happening before our eyes. Victoria going hard and early; NSW going slow and steady - until it revved things up on Saturday.
Pending the outcome of Victoria's current snap lockdown, modelling groups are unanimous. Going hard and early is costly (in GDP and societal terms) per day. Yes, we get that. But such a lockdown is likely over quickly, costing less in the long run than soft or pseudo lockdowns that drag on.
But imagine now you are the NSW Treasurer. From his perspective, the maths may be different because he (and NSW) bear disproportionately more of the cost of a hard lockdown compared with a soft lockdown. Think business subsidies.
This, I suspect, is a major cause for what ostensibly appears to be irrational NSW decision-making. We, as a country, need a unified approach so the correct cost signals (in additional to health impacts) are what are considered holistically by the decision-makers.
We are now facing a virus that moves very fast. Last week I pontificated to a couple of media outlets that I would be surprised if the virus was to spread at the MCG. Why? Because I reasoned that removalists from NSW jaunted around an apartment building and infected a man 48 to 60 hours before he went to the MCG. Surely, I thought, that while infected he would not yet be infectious. Wrong. People are getting infected, then becoming infectious and infecting others with fleeting or minor contact, incredibly quickly.
As a country, we are very vulnerable to Delta until our vaccine coverage is much higher. And that coverage needs to include those who drive transmission: the young and mobile.
Vaccination is not perfect at reducing Delta infection - about 80 per cent effective for Pfizer and 60 per cent for AstraZeneca. Fortunately, of those vaccinated who still get infected, they are half as likely to pass it on. Increasing our vaccine coverage, be it Pfizer or AstraZeneca, as fast as possible is the best thing to do.
However, it would take 90 per cent (at least) vaccine coverage for vaccination alone to really dampen transmission and achieve herd immunity. The Pacific Island nation of Niue has just achieved 97 per cent vaccine coverage, but I fear Australia will not top 90 per cent - including children.
The next year or so will see us needing to augment vaccination with the tried and true measures. Mask wearing, at least on public transport and in high-risk indoor environments, is here for some time.
From October, I believe we can partially open borders to vaccinated and pre-departure-tested travellers from low-risk countries such as China. Indeed, the risk of such a traveller bringing the virus into Australia now without quarantine is less than the risk of travellers from much of the rest of the world bringing the virus in through formal quarantine. Quarantine - as we all know - is far from perfect.
In early 2022 we will have reached the point where all Australians (including children) have had the opportunity to be vaccinated. Then we can open the borders more fully for quarantine-free travel.
If we reach about 70 per cent vaccine coverage, and we open up to about half the pre-COVID volume of travellers, from countries with low to moderate infection rates - and all tested and vaccinated pre-departure - we might expect one infection a day to arrive in Australia. This will, I think, be "manageable" with COVID mortality about 100 in a year and about 2000 hospitalisations a year. We need to pivot next year to accepting some level of risk - trading that off against restrictions and lockdowns.
Most of the morbidity and mortality when we open up will be among the unvaccinated. This raises an ethical dilemma. To what extent should society limit the freedoms of all its citizens due to the greater vulnerability of those who are not vaccinated? At the very least, I hope that when we do open the borders, there will be another surge in vaccination.

Full text: Scott Morrison says his four-phase plan to reopen ­Australia and “return to normal” is still on track despite the lockdown of half the country amid a sharp rise in cases of the highly ­infectious Delta variant.
The Prime Minister on Friday moved to assure Australians stuck at home that the vaccine rollout was gathering pace, with half a million jabs administered over the previous three days.
After a sluggish start to the rollout, 34.5 per cent of the Australian population aged 16 years and over have now had a first dose, with 12.9 per cent fully vaccinated.
“I want to assure people that the path out of this and the four-step plan that national cabinet agreed some weeks ago is very much on our agenda despite the challenges we are currently facing in NSW and Victoria,” Mr Morrison said.
“Work continues to chart that way out and the vaccination rates we will need to achieve over the course of the rest of this year and next year.” National cabinet agreed to a four-step blueprint earlier this month for a phased easing of ­restrictions once Australians have met the new vaccine thresholds, which will be set using yet-to-be completed scientific modelling from epidemiologists at the Doherty Institute in ­Melbourne.
Mr Morrison confirmed the leaders had formally switched from an elimination to a suppression strategy with the goal of having as few cases of Covid-19 circulating in the community as possible.
“I do note that both premiers (Victoria and NSW) have made it clear and this is the focus of ­national cabinet, that the target here is to reduce as far as possible to zero the cases that are infectious in the community,” Mr Morrison said.
“This is the challenge both in NSW and Victoria, that we ­reduce those cases that are out there and infectious in the community.
“We have seen that rising and we need to see those come down and so (we are) encouraging people to stay home, to get tested and get vaccinated.” Mr Morrison also took a crack at Labor leader Anthony Albanese’s proposal to only open the borders once Australia develops domestic mRNA manufacturing, has a national purpose-built quarantine system, and an effective public information campaign.
“Anthony Albanese’s plan (is) to open Australia up in 2023,” the Prime Minister said.
“I don‘t think it’s something that Australians would welcome. It’s either an absurd plan or he doesn’t understand how long it takes to implement that element of what he’s talking about.” Mr Morrison said state and territory leaders had also discussed the use of pharmacists to ­assist with the administration of jabs once vaccine supplies ­increased.
“We will be seeking over the weeks ahead to bring more pharmacists into the metropolitan program in a limited way at first,” he said.
“We will see pharmacists play an increasing role in the months ahead as the supply increases. There is no point having more points of presence with a static amounts of supply.” Mr Morrison also confirmed the striking of a long-term ­national cabinet deal on Covid-19 disaster payments following a week of bickering between the states over the equity of commonwealth assistance. Under the agreement, locked down workers will receive federal support through the Covid-19 ­disaster payment, even where a lockdown has been imposed by a state or territory government for a period of fewer than seven days.

States must honour PM’s plan to reopen the nation

Full text: Vaccine targets for each phase should be realistic and achievable
On Monday the nation begins the first full week of the new financial year with a springboard for reopening to the world post pandemic. Scott Morrison’s four-phase transition plan must not be bungled or sabotaged by a recalcitrant state as Australia faces the major economic and productivity challenges outlined in the Intergenerational Report. As business leaders said on Sunday, the states, after agreeing to the plan, must honour it in the national interest. On Friday the Prime Minister conceded significant ground to Labor premiers, agreeing to a 50 per cent reduction in international travel caps until at least the end of next month.
That proviso is producing alarming consequences for hard-pressed Australians abroad and their families, with some one-way economy airfares from London to Australia soaring at the weekend. Capacity needs to be restored as soon as possible, especially if the vaccine rollout continues at its present pace of about a million jabs a week. Business, quite reasonably, is pushing hard for the road map to have lockdowns scrapped and the international border reopened by the start of next year.
With 9 per cent of Australians fully vaccinated and 30 per cent having had one jab so far, GPs will begin offering the Pfizer vaccine to 40 to 59-year-olds from this week. It will push the rollout closer to allowing the nation to move to the next phase of Mr Morrison’s plan. In the meantime, phase one includes important steps that will help boost the economy and encourage greater movement. State leaders need to co-operate in implementing those measures. They cover new quarantine options, including home quarantine for returning vaccinated travellers; expanding trials for the entry of student and economic visa holders; and lockdowns being used only as a last resort.
Barring unforeseen disaster, the current NSW lockdown should be the nation’s last. At this stage, the Berejiklian government is quietly confident it will be lifted on schedule at the end of this week.
At this stage, setting the vaccine thresholds for moving to the next phase of the four-phase plan is a critically important step. The targets – to be set by the COVID-19 Risk Analysis and Response Taskforce, based on scientific modelling conducted by the Doherty Institute – need to be realistic or the whole four-step agreement will fail, as Australian Industry Group chief executive Innes Willox warns: “We don’t want to set ourselves up to fail.” What is agreed has to be achievable and in a reasonable time frame, as he says. “To have a percentage target that is too high just defeats the purpose of having an agreement.” The federation is fragile enough, as Mr Willox says, without a premier or chief health officer taking it on themselves to think they know best and undermining co-operation. The last thing the nation needs is a repeat of last week’s spectacle when Queensland Premier Annastacia Palaszczuk and chief health officer Jeannette Young unleashed a reckless assault on the vaccine rollout. Once set, the timetables will work only “if all the states and territories agree to end the patchwork of restrictions and work together in the national interest”, as Business Council of Australia chief executive Jennifer Westacott says. As well as being critical to long-term productivity and prosperity, executing Mr Morrison’s four-phase plan will be an important test of the ability of the federation to unite in a crisis. In the early stage of the pandemic, national cabinet served the public well. Subsequent brawling, however, highlighted the shortcomings of the system. In the recovery phase, the states and territories need to look beyond parochialism to ensure borders can open and interaction with the outside world can resume as soon as possible. In a global economy, operating in a bubble is not conducive to trade, investment, public and business confidence, and building momentum for growth and jobs when other nations have reopened. Premiers must be accountable for honouring the agreement.

Full text: AUSTRALIANS have been through a lot these past 18 months as we have battled the Covid pandemic together.
We’ve listened to the medical advice, put up with lockdowns, sacrificed weddings and funerals and birthdays. And we have done it as a deal to save lives, and to save livelihoods.
But on Friday, national cabinet put forward a new deal for Australians – if you get vaccinated, we can make lockdowns, border closures and restrictions a thing of the past. A new deal that charts the way back to normal life.
The good news is our vaccination program is accelerating. One million doses have been administered in the last eight days – a new record. As of Friday, eight million doses have been administered, including 3.5 million over the past month.
If we keep at least the pace we have achieved during June, we can vaccinate almost 70 per cent of Australians by the end of the year. And that’s without the increase in supplies we are anticipating.
We’re seeing strong take-up rates with Australians who are particularly vulnerable to Covid-19. Every aged-care facility except one has now had a first and second visit for vaccinations – and 70 per cent of Australians over the age of 70 have had a first dose.
While Australia has been a world leader in suppressing the virus and saving lives and livelihoods, we are still in uncharted waters as we navigate our way out of this pandemic.
The national cabinet has agreed to set out a four-stage path. It is to be based on expert medical evidence and modelling work being done by the Doherty Institute.
The key to moving through the stages is vaccination numbers. These are the stages: STAGE 1: THE VACCINATE, PREPARE AND PILOT PHASE This is where we are at now – suppressing the virus and offering every Australian an opportunity to be vaccinated with the necessary doses of the relevant vaccine as soon as possible.
As part of this stage, we will temporarily reduce commercial inbound passenger flights by 50 per cent from current caps by July 14. This will reduce the pressure on quarantine facilities due to the increased risks of the Delta virus.
However, we will increase the number of commonwealth-facilitated commercial flights to Darwin utilising our facility at Howard Springs.
We recognise Australians who do the right thing and get vaccinated pose less of a risk to others than people who are not vaccinated.
As part of that recognition, we will trial and pilot the introduction of alternative quarantine options, including home quarantine for returning vaccinated passengers.
We will also adopt the existing digital Medicare vaccination certificate as well as establish digital vaccination authentication at international borders.
STAGE 2: POST VACCINATION PHASE In this stage, with confidence in the vaccine take-up, we can shift our concerns from our current focus on Covid case numbers to the numbers of people with serious illnesses, hospital admissions and fatalities – because vaccination significantly cuts your chance of getting sick, ending up in hospital and dying from the disease.
This change means we will be able to ease restrictions for vaccinated residents. In this stage, lockdowns will only be in extreme circumstances to prevent escalating hospitalisations and fatalities.
As well, we will be able to restore inbound international arrivals caps, allow the capped entry of students and economic visa holders (subject to quarantine arrangements and availability) and introduce less stringent quarantine arrangements for vaccinated residents.
STAGE 3: CONSOLIDATION PHASE In this stage, we will manage Covid-19 consistent with public health management of other infectious diseases.
We will see the complete end of lockdowns and a continued easing of the border controls that have protected us for so long. In other words, we will be able to see normal life from here.
STAGE 4: FINAL PHASE This is the stage we are all working for. The return of normal life. In this stage, there will still be prudent controls at our borders, but for the most part Covid will be managed just like any other infectious disease. It will be a lot like the flu – for the most part manageable, and only rarely, extremely dangerous.
Our pathway through these stages will be based on the recommended vaccination targets developed by our medical experts.
Over the past 18 months, I have asked a great deal of Australians. There is still a way to go – but we can be confident and have hope.
We know the pathway – but in the meantime, we must still follow the public health advice; make our appointments to get vaccinated and continue to look out for each other, particularly older family members, neighbours and friends.
We have a deal on the table for Australians.
If Australians do their part and get vaccinated as our supplies increase, we’ll be able to get back to normal and this is our plan to get there. SCOTT MORRISON IS THE PRIME MINISTER OF AUSTRALIA

Roadmap aimed at restoring trust

Full text: Five days after Prime Minister Scott Morrison blindsided state and territory leaders with his pronouncements on AstraZeneca and sparked days of confusion and criticism, he tried to present a united front.
After a second national cabinet meeting at the end of a week of crisis, he outlined a new plan for the country to tackle the momentous task of vaccinating the population and reopening Australia to the world.
Mr Morrison laid out the new outlook with four phases on Friday - one that would see governments move away from lockdowns and hard border closures and move towards allowing COVID-19 to become just another seasonal virus. But the plan requires crucial boxes to be ticked along the way before that end goal is reached.
Vaccination percentage thresholds are the missing puzzle piece Australia needs in order to progress to each new phase, and one the Prime Minister shied away from committing to just yet.
A vague indication suggesting the country would start to slowly ease restrictions for vaccinated people - the second phase - next year was flagged, but it could hardly be seen as a commitment. While the plan sounds otherwise promising - a clear outline of Australia's staggered return to normal - it feels all too familiar.
At the start of the year, the Prime Minister and Health Minister Greg Hunt had confidently predicted 4 million Australians would be vaccinated by the end of March. In reality, by that time the rollout had barely reached a quarter of the government's initial hopes. The Health Department released figures this week showing about 8 per cent of the eligible population had received the required two doses.
Australia, once envied by the world for our low COVID-19 cases numbers, has fallen badly behind on vaccination. All while others, such as the United Kingdom, have more than half their population fully vaccinated, and are returning to relatively normal life.
So, what will make the public believe the government this time? After a so-far shambolic rollout and recent confusion over which vaccine should be taken, it's a tough sell. Filling in the gaps on dates or vaccination percentage targets might be the only move the government has left to make. Mr Morrison said those details would be provided by the Doherty Institute once its modelling on targets had been completed.
If things go to plan, we can assume we will see a return to international travel at the earliest some time next year. But as the experience of the pandemic has showed, plans fall apart. Optimistic forecasts are made at peril.
Right now, the challenge for the Prime Minister is to win back trust and build credit with Australians frustrated by recent events. For the sake of any re-election hopes his government entertains, and far more importantly for the sake of the nation, we have to hope for fast progress on this new roadmap.

Full text: Restrictions on vaccinated Australians travelling to states or subject to lockdowns could be eased next year if plans fall into place, Prime Minister Scott Morrison has announced.
States and territories have also agreed to trial home quarantining for vaccinated travellers while reducing incoming passengers by 50 per cent to deal with the COVID-19 Delta strain, as authorities race to speed up vaccination rates across the population.
Freshly surfacing from a two-week quarantine at the Lodge, the Prime Minister met with state and territory leaders on Friday morning to discuss the national situation amid new outbreaks across capital cities and conflicting vaccine advice.
Mr Morrison said leaders had agreed to a new four-stage plan, which would allow the country to treat COVID-19 as an infectious disease like any other in our community.
He signalled plans to allow those vaccinated to move more freely across cities and interstate while those who hadn't yet received the jab would remain subject to strict public health orders.
Progressing to the next phase of the roadmap would be tied to achieving a particular vaccination target for the population, which will be finalized in the coming weeks.
In a rallying cry to Australians, Mr Morrison held up the vaccine as the ticket to a future free of lockdowns, border closures and international travel bans.
"A lot of people say - why should I get vaccinated? There's not much COVID around in Australia. I've got more chance of getting run over by a car than I have of catching COVID in this country," Mr Morrison said.
"We're prisoners of our own success in this.
"If you get vaccinated you get to change how we get to live as a country. You get to change how you live in Australia."
The first - and current - phase is focused on suppressing the virus' spread in the community and vaccinating the population. Lockdowns should be used as a last resort.
In the second phase, which the Prime Minister hoped Australia would enter next year, leaders agreed vaccinated Australians would face eased restrictions in the event of future outbreaks and lockdowns and a limited number of international students would be allowed into the country.
The third phase would result in lifting restrictions for vaccinated persons on travelling internationally and extending the travel bubble to include countries such as Singapore, the Pacific and others that are deemed suitable. There would be no lockdowns.
It's expected caps on international students and humanitarian visa holders would also be increased.
The fourth and final phase, which Mr Morrison could not provide a planned date it would be reached by, would be a near return to normal.
Some additional measures, such pre-and post-flight testing for the virus, would be undertaken while parts of the population remained unvaccinated.
The vaccination targets would be based on modelling from the Doherty Institute, Mr Morrison said.

"To temporarily reduce commercial inbound passenger arrivals to all major ports by 50 per cent from current caps to reduce the pressure on quarantine facilities, due to the increased risks of the Delta strain of the virus," he said.
"We'll have fewer commercial flights coming but we'll have increased facilitated flights from the Commonwealth to get Australians home.
"We will trial and pilot with individual jurisdictions the introduction of alternative quarantine options, including home quarantine for returning vaccinated travellers."
Mr Morrison later said it was likely the reduced international flights cap would last for the remainder of the year subject to health advice.
The announcement on Friday was Mr Morrison's first public appearance since he sparked fresh confusion and political sniping by encouraging under-40s to consult their GPs about taking the AstraZeneca vaccine.
Mr Morrison strongly rejected any assertion that he misspoke when issuing the advice, saying his statements were consistent with the position of the government's expert immunization panel.

Full text: Melbourne strong endures THANK you, Victorians.
Over past months, as this state faced the very real threat of the second wave of COVID-19 breaking beyond hope of any control, the community was called upon to respond.
And respond it has.
Some have supported the extent of harsh restrictions, agreeing with their necessity, while many have not, seeing elements as disproportionate and, to some extent, almost as destructive as the virus.
Yet on one issue, there has been unanimity.
While no-one has supported the reason for the second wave — disastrous breaches in hotel quarantine — the community has nonetheless overwhelmingly stood up and complied with what was being asked of it.
We have endured the frustration and emotional impacts of isolation, missed important family occasions, foregone all sense of normality in our social lives.
We have missed the rhythm of our sporting life, passions have drifted interstate as the AFL competition was forced from its heartland. Unimaginably, this year’s Grand Final has been surrendered to our sunny Queensland cousins.
Tens of thousands of businesses have been stuck in nervous hibernation and, even now, so many face an uncertain future.
Family and small businesses, years of hard work and investment may have, for too many, now been ruined.
More than 450,000 jobs have been frozen and who knows how many will return as the state and national economies navigate through a recession of unmapped duration.
Household finances, mortgages, personnel and business loans and rental commitments have been stretched or worse. For many, savings have been depleted.
Students have had their year severely disrupted, an entire generation which will need to regain learning focus and make up ground.
Mental and emotional health has been tested and, sadly, depression and self-harm ideation has spiked.
Tragically, almost 790 people have died from COVID — almost all of whom have been our most vulnerable citizens — leaving families to mourn, often without being able to come together.
But Victorians, throughout this horrendous year, have held it together, have worked together to drive down infection rates through physical distancing, movement, work and school restrictions, even the unpopular curfew and 5km travel limit.
We have looked out for one another, used technology to stay together and to offer support.
Sons and daughters have done shopping runs for elderly parents, neighbours have offered support to those who have struggled.
In greater Melbourne, where COVID has spread at its most damaging, people have tapped a personal strength, a discipline and a forbearance some did not know they had.
Just 45 days ago, Victoria hit a frightening peak of 725 daily cases and the weekly average a horrid 521 daily infections.
Yesterday, we had plummeted to record five new cases, amid a rolling average of 20.3, while regional Victoria’s average remained steady at just 0.6. It was the first time greater Melbourne had seen a single digit increase in new cases since June 12.
Crucially, Melbourne’s “Ref” number — the effective reproduction value representing how many people are infected on average by a single person — was just .69 according to Department of Health and Human Services modelling, while Doherty Institute analysis put it at .75 over the last week.
Both numbers show an infected person is passing the virus on to less than one person — a vital tipping point where infection rates continue to decline.
All this has been possible because people across suburban Melbourne and regional Victoria have listened to the health messages and acted.
Even more than that, they have recognised the challenge presented by the pandemic required a degree of selflessness. To suspend some normal sense of individuality for the greater good. To wear a face mask when you are not sick, but as communal protection against spread. To abide by curfew, even though such a draconian limitation sits at stark odds with our liberty. To get tested in massive numbers to identify cases.
While there has been loud and, in cases, justified criticisms about the Andrews government’s stage four restrictions, people have complied regardless of their personal or political views.
There have been those who have taken their protests to the streets, but the reckless few — who ignored the threat they posed in sparking new infections — will owe the coming return of their freedoms to the sacrifice and hard won gains of the many who quietly worked to beat the virus. The next step back to those renewed freedoms and some greater sense of normality will arrive in three weeks time — if we hit the target average of five new daily cases.
Currently, there are 359 active cases across the state, including 182 in aged-care, with 49 people in hospital, including eight in intensive care.
We are not out of the woods yet, plenty of hard work remains, but the trajectory has been undeniable.
Victorians will see this out with continued acknowledgment that it is not government or bureaucratic decisions which decide COVID’s fate. It is ordinary people, doing the right thing in extraordinarily tough times.

Full text: Food supplies, $2.3bn at risk if borders stay shut BORDER closures will wipe $2.35bn in agriculture from the NSW economy and could disrupt food supplies unless all leaders agree to end the “insanity” and allow farm workers to cross state lines.
It’s D-Day for states to agree to new national definitions of COVID-19 “hot spots” and an agriculture code to guarantee movement across borders, with the federal government vowing to introduce guidelines regardless of premiers’ decisions.
National cabinet will on Friday be presented with a proposal from the Australian Health Protection Principal Committee defining a hotspot, which can then be used as the medical basis for border movement decisions.
New modelling by the NSW Department of Primary Industries, obtained by The Daily Telegraph, shows that over the coming financial year the nation’s horticulture industry will lose $6.83bn due to border closures.
The direct hit to NSW is $1bn but the true cost to the state more than doubles factoring in the extra cost of maintaining the restrictions.
NSW has backed the national agriculture code, but farmers now fear an 11th-hour push by other states to allow each jurisdiction to “respond to differing COVID-19 risks” will undermine the whole operation.
The AHPPC on Thursday “noted” the principled code and supported giving the federal government the medical backing to pressure states who do not sign up.
The biggest risk for NSW farmers is Queensland, with Premier Annastacia Palaszczuk expected to produce rival medical evidence if she denies entry to ag workers.
NSW Agriculture Minister Adam Marshall said the entire fate of the industry was on the line. “If other states don’t sign up to the code it will be, in my opinion, an abject failure of leadership,” he said. “I want to see a code that has teeth and compels jurisdictions to remove farcical border restrictions.” The border measures are strangling the workforce, restricting supply of labour to just 20 per cent of capacity.
Federal Agriculture Minister David Littleproud said the Queensland border restrictions were “abhorrent” and must end.
“As a Queenslander I’m ashamed today when the premier of Queensland can allow 400 AFL executives to swan around a resort in the Gold Coast but won’t allow teenage boarding school children to go home to see their parents in remote NSW,” he said.
National Farmers Federation chief executive Tony Mahar said if governments could not “put politics aside” Australia’s food supply chain would be seriously damaged.
“We do have concerns about disruptions to food supply,” he said. “We’re not talking about an open slather approach here, this is specific measures to keep food and fibre supply chains going.” Deputy Prime Minister Michael McCormack said city residents would soon feel the impact if farmers were not granted exemptions. “People in cities need people in regional Australia, three times a day, every day – it’s called the food they eat and the drink they drink,” he said.
Gunnedah farm contractor Andrew Thibault said he had pegged all his financial hopes on getting into Queensland to harvest his clients’ crops next month, and he was relying on the mercy of premiers to keep his business alive.
“After three years of drought, we really need this harvest,” he said. “Our equipment is already over the border waiting but if we can’t get there to do the harvesting we could lose the job.”

Full text: MATHEMATICAL modelling, once considered by many to be an obscure academic exercise, has become an intense focus of public interest as we navigate our response to COVID-19.
At a time of great uncertainty, models are an important tool used by government to plan and respond to an emergency. But models are often misinterpreted as sources of truth that provide unique insights into the future.
Models of infectious disease don’t replace data or evidence. They provide a means of thinking logically about how a particular infection, in this case COVID-19, may spread through the community. They allow us to consider the resulting clinical outcomes, interpret the information that is available, and think about what might happen next if we do nothing or take alternative actions to limit the impact of disease.
Models expose critical gaps and uncertainties in our knowledge and response capability. This helps to focus research efforts that enhance understanding; promote development and best use of interventions for prevention and treatment; and inform next steps.
Scenario models developed to prepare Australia for influenza pandemics have been repurposed to help guide our early strategic responses to COVID-19. Initial models, based on data collected from Wuhan in January and early February, made it clear an uncontrolled epidemic in Australia would rapidly cause disease and overwhelm our health system. Many people would have died from COVID-19. Many would have died from other preventable causes because they couldn’t have accessed essential clinical care.
Tragically, we have since seen what the virus can do in many countries. More recently, our model assumptions were refined and updated to incorporate new evidence on clinical severity and health outcomes. These were used to anticipate the likely medical needs of COVID-19 patients, with a particular focus on life saving, critical care capacity — hospital beds, ventilators and the like.
These models served their purpose, buying Australia valuable time to prepare for the worst-case scenario, while hoping it would never actually happen. They reinforced the need to further strengthen our clinical and public health systems, and they made the case for imposing widespread social distancing measures to reduce infection spread.
These measures have ensured our health sector and society have not been overwhelmed. But these models weren’t predictions of Australia’s likely epidemic course. That picture is yet to unfold and depends very much on what we, as a society, do next.
How will we know where we are headed? Mathematical models, combined with statistical analysis of the Australian data, are again useful. This approach is called “nowcasting”, and it tells us about the current state of our local epidemic. We measure how quickly new case numbers are growing or declining, providing feedback to policy makers on whether control measures in place over the preceding weeks have been working.
The key measure of interest is the effective reproduction number, or the average number of secondary infections produced by each identified case. Right now, in Australia this number is less than one, so each infected person is not quite “reproducing” themselves in the population.
Our current best estimate is that for every 10 infectious cases, only five new infectious cases are produced. This finding indicates the local epidemic is currently in decline, and the combined public health and social distancing measures in place have been doing their job. But a word of caution: COVID-19 remains every bit as infectious as before, and if we were to go back to “life as normal” right now, those 10 cases would produce 25 new ones and the epidemic would rapidly accelerate.
Similar to how our daily weather forecasts are generated (by mathematicians and data scientists), our models can also be used to forecast case numbers and hospitalisation requirements over coming weeks.
The forecasts need to factor in known delays between catching the infection, showing symptoms, and possible progression to needing hospital care. These delays pose a challenge for public health experts and decision makers considering how to safely relax social distancing measures, because it will take several weeks for the true consequences of today’s actions to be fully revealed.
Models can help ensure health services are prepared. And if numbers are growing too rapidly, they can signal a requirement to return to stronger measures.
Models are a guide. Indeed, they are often the best guide we have. But they are not a crystal ball. Australia is in the fortunate position of having avoided early uncontrolled spread of COVID-19. But we’re not yet out of the woods and must not become complacent. Models have had a role to play in getting us to where we are and will continue to guide our pathway through this pandemic, locally and internationally. But it’s a path every one of us must tread carefully and responsibly to “flatten the curve” and limit the toll.

Full text: A long-term strategy to ease ­social-isolation restrictions and expose Australians to COVID-19 in manageable doses, without overwhelming the public health system, is being considered by the country’s chief health officials and some NSW government ministers.
As infection rates continue to fall across the country, The Australian has learned suppression strategies may eventually be eased — if only slightly, and in a staggered form — as part of an ­effort to expose healthy Australians to the disease to lift immunity rates.
The Australian Health Protection Principal Committee, which provides advice to the National Cabinet, had been modelling scenarios for how to deal with COVID-19 if a vaccine is not developed. Some NSW government ministers are agitating for the state to recalibrate social-distancing measures currently in force. Some believe that not only are they damaging the economy, but they are viewed as unsustainable if the virus were to continue through the rest of 2020.
Last Wednesday, NSW Health Minister Brad Hazzard and NSW Chief Health Officer Kerry Chant held a conference call with a large number of NSW MPs in which the pros and cons of suppressing the virus were weighed up. One MP said they were told that if the state were to try to contain the virus entirely, as some states have attempted to do by shutting their borders, it could leave the NSW community at a disadvantage. “If that was the approach, we’d end up with a large portion of the population who are still susceptible, with no immunity,” the MP said, citing remarks made by Dr Chant.
A senior NSW health official told The Australian that controlling the spread of contagion ­remained an absolute priority to prevent hospitals and intensive care units being overrun by ­patients, particularly during the Easter holiday period.
But eventually increasing ­levels of community immunity through exposure to the virus could provide an answer for ­society to return to a state of ­normalcy, particularly given the uncertainty about when or if a vaccine can be developed for COVID-19. “People have to get sick for this to pass,” said a senior government MP.
This could involve partial lifting of social-distancing restrictions for people known to be less vulnerable to the virus, such as schoolchildren, or young people less likely to die from the illness.
“We do need it to go through the community at a gentle pace,” the official said. School-aged children and young adults were “the least ­likely to have symptoms — it would start to increase the herd immunity for the country”.
NSW Premier Gladys Berejiklian said on Tuesday that ­although restrictions could be eased in the future, social distancing was the new “way of life’’ until a vaccine could be developed.
Since social-distancing restrictions were put in place, NSW has been buying time to enhance its healthcare capacity to prevent a rush on facilities — infection rates have been dropping steadily, reaching lows of 49 reported cases on Monday night, while intensive care capabilities have been lifted.
In NSW, which has the highest concentration of COVID-19 cases, the government has been working to quadruple the number of intensive care beds from its current 874 capacity, including 730 with ventilators.
Australia has recorded a total of 5908 COVID-19 infections and 48 people have died. There are currently 305 people in hospital with the illness, with 93 in intensive care units nationwide, 37 of them requiring ventilators.
The usual capacity of intensive care units around the country is approximately 2200 beds, but the federal government has set a goal of having 7500 ventilator-equipped ICU beds in public and private hospitals. Even at that level of capacity, infections would need to be kept under tight control in order not to overwhelm hospitals.
The NSW official said: “The issue for us in Australia is that at some point you’ve got to start weighing up the consequences. If this goes on for six to 12 months, that could do much greater destruction to our economy and lifestyle than the virus is doing to us in the real terms.” Infectious disease physician and microbiologist Peter Collignon said social-distancing ­measures could not continue ­indefinitely, and governments were going to have to grapple with the question of how many people they were prepared to let the virus infect. “If we flatten the curve too much and have no immunity in the population, we might be in a worse position than the US or Italy come six months’ time,” he said.
“But the trouble with the idea of building up herd immunity, which I think Sweden seems to be following, is you’ve got to get to 60 or 70 per cent of the population infected.
“The trouble with that is that with the mortality rate of this virus, that’s an awful lot of deaths. So I’m actually not sure I think that’s the best idea.” Professor Collignon, from the Australian National University, said he did not think it was a good idea to lock down everybody to the degree that was being experienced in Victoria or NSW.
James McCaw, an infectious disease modeller with the Doherty Institute, said that if social-­distancing measures were relaxed, the numbers of infections would skyrocket.
“We know that our population is still largely susceptible, and so if we relaxed and went back to normal we would see a rapid and explosive resurgence in epidemic activity,” he said.Professor McCaw acknowledged that keeping the current stringent level of social restrictions was not feasible in the long term.
