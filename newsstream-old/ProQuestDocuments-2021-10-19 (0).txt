Full text: From 11:59pm on Tuesday, fully vaccinated people travelling from “red zones” will need to have tested negative for Covid within 72 hours of departure, and will need to get tested again within 72 hours of arrival in Victoria, and isolate until they receive a negative result.
Those travelling from “orange zones”, such as the ACT, will no longer be required to isolate and get tested on arrival, as long as they are fully vaccinated.
For those who are not fully vaccinated, the requirements remain for red zone arrivals to complete 14 days of home quarantine and orange zone arrivals to test and isolate.
The new rules will also allow non-Victorian residents to travel to Victoria from NSW – overriding current rules which permit only residents to return.
Children aged under 12, who are not able to be vaccinated, will travel under their parent’s permit.
“Our border settings are changing as we move towards a managed easing of restrictions, and people who are fully vaccinated have a right to reduced requirements, because they present reduced risk,” Health Minister Martin Foley said.
Victoria records slight case drop
Victoria reported 2179 locally-acquired cases of coronavirus in the 24 hours to midnight on Thursday, and six Covid-related deaths.
There has been a slight fall in the number of Victorians in hospital with coronavirus in the past 24 hours.
However, given there is generally a lag between testing positive and requiring hospital treatment, it is not yet clear whether case numbers surpassing 2000 per day in recent days will convert to a rise in hospitalisations.
Victorian Health Minister Martin Foley says the state has recorded 2,179 cases of COVID-19 and six deaths.Mr Foley said two women in their 80s, one woman in her 50s, and three men in their 80s had died.There are 695 people in hospital, with 157 in intensive care and 101 requiring ventilation. Mr Foley said 73,942 COVID-19 tests were underdone, and 38,752 vaccines were administered.
Victorian Covid logistics chief Jeroen Weimar says Friday’s 2179 new Covid cases show Thursday’s record 2297 was not a “one-off high number”.
“From yesterday’s numbers we are clearly seeing a step up in the number of cases we are dealing with here in Victoria,” Mr Weimar said.
He said 55 per cent of Friday’s new Covid cases were in previously undiagnosed households, adding to more than 1200 of Thursday’s cases.
“We know with a high attack rate of coronavirus, of Delta strain, within households, we expect to see significantly more numbers coming out of those new households in the coming days and weeks,” Mr Weimar said.
“So these are, as ever, worrying numbers.”
Woman in her 50s among latest deaths
As of Friday, there are 695 people in Victorian hospitals with coronavirus, including 157 in intensive care, of whom 101 are on ventilators.
This compares with 704 in hospital on Thursday, including 147 in intensive care, of whom 100 were on ventilators.
Six Covid-related deaths reported on Friday include those of three men in their 80s from Brimbank in Melbourne’s west, Darebin in the north, and Boroondara in the east, two women in their 80s from Hume and Moreland in the north, and a woman in her 50s from Moonee Valley in the northwest.
The deaths take the state’s toll for the current outbreak to 131 – adding to 820 deaths of people with Covid in 2020.
Friday’s 2179 cases are down slightly on Thursday’s record 2297 cases, and compare with 1571 cases reported on Wednesday, 1466 on Tuesday, 1612 on Monday, 1890 on Sunday, the previous record of 1965 cases on Saturday, and 1838 last Friday.
There are currently 21,324 active cases. As of Thursday, there had been 59,710 Covid cases confirmed in Victoria since the pandemic began.
There were 704 people in Victorian hospitals on Thursday with coronavirus, including 147 in intensive care, of whom 100 were on ventilators.
This compares with 705 people in hospital on Wednesday, including 146 in intensive care, of whom 92 were on ventilators.
TAUS iframed Victorian Daily Cases
The latest cases come after 73,942 tests were processed on Thursday, down from a record 82,762 on Wednesday, the previous record of 79,200 on Tuesday, 68,509 on Monday, 73,138 on Sunday, 74,105 on Saturday, 73,443 on Friday, and 77,554 last Thursday.
According to latest commonwealth figures, 87.15 per cent of Victorians aged 16 and over had received at least a first dose of Covid vaccine as of Wednesday — including 0.45 per cent of the group who had a first jab that day.
The full vaccination rate for Victoria is at 62.65 per cent, including 1.16 per cent who had their second dose on Wednesday.
Victoria is currently on track to reach its 70 per cent double vaccination target on October 22 – four days ahead of the Andrews government roadmap date of October 26.
Based on the current rate of second doses, Victoria will reach 80 per cent full vaccination on November 1 – also four days ahead of schedule.
Despite the surge in case numbers, Premier Daniel Andrews on Thursday pledged to stick with his road map out of lockdown, which will see restrictions eased from late next week when the 70 per cent target is reached.
The vow comes amid much lower rates of hospitalisation than forecast in Burnet Institute modelling on which the road map is based, and much lower rates than those experienced at the peak of the NSW Delta cluster early last month, due to higher vaccination rates.
The current outbreak emerged just over 10 weeks ago, amid short-lived celebrations of a zero case day on August 4 – the day before the state’s sixth lockdown was announced.

Full text: Western Victoria MP Bev McArthur has reignited questions about the scientific basis of the government's regional roadmap after raising the issue in state parliament last week.
Ms McArthur raised the issue, uncovered by The Standard, that the Burnet Institute modelling underpinning the roadmap only models metropolitan Melbourne.
"When Daniel Andrews claimed that the roadmap was based on the Burnet Institute's modelling, did he forget that Victoria's borders do not end at the Ring Road or did he just mislead the public?" she said.
The issue was also put to Minister for Education James Merlino when he announced details of regional Victoria's back to school plan.
Mr Merlino disputed the fact the Burnet modelling only looks at Melbourne, seemingly contradicting Burnet Institute head modeller Dr Nick Scott as well as the Department of Health, which had previously confirmed the modelling was confined to metro Melbourne.
"I don't think that's right... the Burnet modelling, and the broader public health advice looks at the epidemiology of the situation across the whole of Victoria," said Mr Merlino.
The minister was asked to revise or clarify his comments in light of the contrasting evidence, but he declined to respond.

In response to follow up questions from The Standard, the Department of Health said it "draws on large amounts of data, including modelling, to determine the public health measures".
The department said it was difficult to model regional Victoria, which had few cases over a large geographical area.
Public health officers remain fearful of a regional outbreak that could paralyse the local health system, such as occurred in Mildura, or plunge much of the community into isolation, as occurred in Shepparton.
Those concerns, combined with a lack of scientific data, are the reason many regions are having to cope with apparently harsh restrictions.
The department declined to share any specifics about the additional data or modelling it said was being used to develop regional public health measures. It is unclear why the Burnet modelling has been shared with the public while the regional data and analysis has been suppressed.
The Minister for Health has 30 days to respond to Ms McArthur's request for more information.
Melbourne University epidemiologist Professor Tony Blakely said it was possible to model regional areas accurately, but it was very difficult.
"You could do it, you could build a really flash model for it, but it would take too long," he said.
Professor Blakely, who has worked on COVID-19 modelling for the state government, said it was important to remember modelling didn't provide black and white answers.
"The way to think about modelling is that it creates a structured way of thinking, getting a feel for what you should do," he said.
He said the infectiousness of the COVID-19 Delta variant made it even more difficult to model.
"What we've seen recently is the spread has been in specific populations and specific areas, rather than others," Professor Blakely said.
This phenomenon, where particular groups have different levels of risk, is called heterogeneity. "Trying to anticipate it is hell," he said.
"Modelling only goes so far, there's only so much you can do."
But he said modelling still provided valuable guidance, meaning the lack of modelling in regional areas created an extra layer of guesswork when developing the roadmap.
Professor Blakely said it was possible areas like Warrnambool were more restricted than necessary, but he warned against throwing off the shackles.
"We find if you don't keep up a minimum level of restrictions then it's not pretty.
"Once we get to 80 per cent fully vaccinated we can chill out a bit," he said.

‘Possible’ Victoria’s latest Covid wave has peaked, despite worst-case Burnet modelling

Full text: But virus experts say the roadmap — based on Burnet Institute modelling of current and possible post-lockdown scenarios — forecast a worst-case scenario in relation to the number of people who will wind up in hospital.
So far, one expert says, we are going better than expected.
The modelling predicted Victoria was set to reach a peak seven-day average of 1960 daily cases on October 25. So far, our seven-day average is sitting at 1732.
Under the modelling, more than 1660 people would be in hospital and 360 in intensive care, but as of Monday, only 677 and 133 were in hospital and ICU respectively.
NED-4592-projected-effect-of-easing-restrictions
The Burnet Institute predicted a cumulative death toll of 946 between July and December this year. Victoria’s death toll so far is 913 for the entire pandemic.
Deakin University Epidemiology chair Professor Catherine Bennett said it was a good thing the predictions on hospitalisations and deaths had so far not stacked up.
“The model isn’t a perfect fit, in a good way,” Prof Bennett said.
“Even if we haven’t reached our peak we can cope with the hospitalisations as we have looked at the worst-case scenario.”
Prof Bennett said it was quite possible Victoria had hit its peak and daily case numbers may plateau this week.

“We are hoping we have kind of peaked now. Where we are in relation to hospitalisation … is a lot lower … than what they were predicting,” Prof Bennett said.
“The good news is while we have seen cases, we have more people with a single dose and that’s keeping them out of hospital.”
“That, or the virus has been circulating in younger people, and not the older age groups as they have been vaccinated, and they (younger people) are less at risk (of being hospitalised).”
“All of this makes a big difference in how the case numbers translate to hospitalisation,” she said.
The Burnet Institute declined to comment on September’s modelling.

Full text: The Victoria Racing Club has welcomed a plan to allow 10,000 punters into Flemington for the Melbourne Cup, and says the race that stops a nation will restart the city.
If 80 per cent of eligible Victorians are fully vaccinated by November 2, up to 10,000 fans will also be permitted to attend the final two days of the Melbourne Cup Carnival — Oaks Day on November 4 and Stakes Day on November 6.
Crowds will not be allowed to attend Derby Day on October 30, with Premier Daniel Andrews saying the state would not hit the key vaccine milestone in time.
“It would be great to say that was a chance,” he said.
“I think the notion that we could hit 70 per cent and 80 per cent so close together — all the evidence is that we won’t, and that is a shame because that is often regarded as perhaps the best day’s racing of the carnival.”
To date, at least 85.2 per cent of eligible Victorians have received their first vaccine dose, while 57.7 per cent are fully vaccinated.
Fans will be spread across a number of zones at Flemington with allocated seats. They will be required to wear a mask and be fully vaccinated, or have an exemption.
VRC Chairman Neil Wilson said the Melbourne Cup is “Australia’s original major event, with a global audience reach of 750 million people, and is a significant driver of economic activity for Victoria.
“We are delighted that the race that stops a nation will herald the restart of our city.”
VRC chief executive Steve Rosich said the club will work closely with authorities for further details of the event parameters for attendance.
Mr Rosich said: “We are ready to host a Covid-safe event with crowds across three days of the Melbourne Cup Carnival that utilises our numerous hospitality venues and expansive grounds, marking a major step in the reopening of our city and the state of Victoria.”
Victorian Chamber Chief Executive Paul Guerra said a return of racing crowds was “so very Melbourne and exactly the shot of confidence we need”.
“This bold move will propel Victoria to reclaim our mantle as the events and sporting capital of Australia,” he said.
“Images of crowds enjoying the spring racing carnival will be beamed across the world, sending an important signal that Melbourne is back in business.”
The state government also announced on Sunday that music lovers will also be able to attend a concern at the Sidney Myer Music Bowl on Saturday, October 30.
While an exact capacity is yet to be decided, “several thousand people” will be allowed to attend the outdoor concert on October 30, days after the state is tipped to hit the 70 per cent double dosed milestone.
Smaller gigs are planned around the state at the same time, subject to the tick of approval from chief health officer Brett Sutton.
Meanwhile, health authorities have locked in a “vaccinated economy” trial across 14 businesses in six local government areas from Monday.
The businesses, including cinemas, hotels, cafes, a gym, a church and a beauty clinic, will test vaccine certificate technology and will be able to begin operating with higher density limits.
Patrons attending these venues will be required to show they are fully vaccinated using Covid-19 digital certificate through the Service Victoria, Medicare or equivalent smartphone app or certified printed copy.
These venues include:
• Bass Coast – North Pier Hotel in Cowes, Churchill Island Cafe
• Buloke – Terminus Hotel in Wycheproof
• East Gippsland – East Gippsland Art Gallery in Bairnsdale, Lakes Squash and Movie Theatre in Lakes Entrance
• Greater Bendigo – Anglican Church of Australia in Flora Hill, Bendigo Art Gallery, Village Cinemas in Bendigo, Body Fit Training in Bendigo
• Pyrenees – Avoca Hotel
• Warrnambool – Darlings of Beauty, Roberts One Real Estate, Warrnambool Racing Club (race meeting), Warrnambool Art Gallery.
Premier Daniel Andrews said a midweek race meeting would go ahead and capacity limits in pubs and clubs would be expanded as part of the trial to help transition the state to a Covid-normal.

1890 NEW CASES, FIVE DEATHS Health authorities announced 1890 new Covid cases and five deaths had emerged in the past 24 hours.
The latest deaths are two men in their 50s from Melbourne and Brimbank, two men in their 70s from Maribyrnong and Wyndham and a woman in her 80s from Yarra.
As of Sunday morning, there are 609 Victorians in hospital with Covid-19. Of those, 126 were in intensive care, including 88 on a ventilator.
Half of Victoria’s 1890 new Covid cases announced on Sunday were from six local government areas, Covid-19 commander Jeroen Weimar said.
“Ones that we’ve all become very familiar with — Brimbank, Casey, Hume, Melton, Whittlesea and Wyndham,” he told reporters.
“We are seeing the shift we’ve been talking about over the last 10 days towards the southeast with Casey (recording) 164 cases, the most cases we have in the southeast.
“With only 50 per cent of those cases in the six LGA areas, it means there’s a lot of cases across other parts of Melbourne and regional Victoria.
National - 2021 - Covid Vaccination Stats
“The Hume LGA, we are seeing a slightly lower number of cases today - 188 cases - so we are seeing a definite cooling off in the case growth rate there which is welcome.”
Premier Daniel Andrews gave a “stark” warning to unvaccinated Victorians as the state prepares to open up.
Mr Andrews said less than 7 per cent of Victorians in hospital with Covid were fully vaccinated.
“If you are vaccinated, your chance of finishing up in hospital gravely ill are but a fraction, a tiny fraction of what an unvaccinated person’s risks are,” he said.
“Of course, it will change and become even more stark as we open up.
“When we get to 80 per cent double dose … the virus will spread, especially among those who are not vaccinated … you are at a much higher risk.
“I’m not pleased to say this, but it is the science of it. The data, the facts.”
Nearly 40,000 vaccinations were administered in state-run clinics on Saturday.

HOW VICTORIANS WILL SHOW THEIR JAB STATUS From Monday, fully vaccinated Victorians will be able to upload their vaccination certificate into their Service Victoria app.
That will mean businesses and venues can access a person’s check-in at the same time as their vaccination status.
Government Services Minister Danny Pearson said a step-by-step guide on how to share the digital certificate to the app is available through the Department of Health website.
The 15 venues involved in the vaccinated economy trial will be the first to use the updated Service Victoria app and show proof of vaccination.
“For those concerned about privacy, I stress that the Victorian government does not have access to any medical data linked to a person’s Medicare account,” Mr Pearson said.
“Getting vaccinated is our way out of this pandemic. This technology is going to play a vital role in the state’s reopening.
“The technology we’re using will enable that to occur quickly, efficiently and effectively.”
Users will need to update their Service Victoria app to add their vaccination status.

STATE PULLING AHEAD OF VAX TARGETS Health chiefs say Victoria is pulling ahead of vaccination target dates in the state’s reopening road map, but fear record rises in Covid-19 cases could swamp hospitals.
Health authorities on Sunday announced 1890 Covid cases, along with five deaths.
It comes after another strong turnout for testing, with more than 74,1000 tests received.
State hubs administered nearly 40,000 vaccines on Saturday.
Melburnians were out and about enjoying the spring sunshine on Saturday as the state inches closer to freedom.
There were a whopping 1965 coronavirus cases reported on Saturday, and five deaths, and modelling predicts daily infection numbers could rise to 3000 within weeks.
The record numbers spurred on calls for people to get jabbed as soon as possible, with vaccination protections the key to bringing down infections.
Health Department deputy secretary for Covid-19 response, Kate Matson, backed calls from community leaders in the Saturday Herald Sun for people to “close the gap” between doses.
“I think it is possible that we hit the October 26 and November 5 (reopening) dates earlier, if people do rush to their local vaccination sites, pharmacies and GPs,” she said.
“It’s in all our power to bring those dates forward.”
The October 26 and November 5 dates were targets the government set to have 70 and then 80 per cent of people over the age of 16 double-jabbed.
Ms Matson said modelling by the Burnet Institute would be “refreshed” in coming days to update likely hospitalisation rates from recent case surges.
In a desperate bid to prop up the struggling hospital network once lockdowns ease, the government has flown in health professionals from overseas.
Contact tracers are focusing on Melbourne hot spots in the north and southeast, as well as Mildura where 20 extra cases were identified on Saturday.
As plans for reopening take shape, Mr Pearson announced a $15 million fund for arts and entertainment groups to prepare for when live events could be held once more.
Victorian Chamber of Commerce and Industry chief executive Paul Guerra has also called for Melbourne’s New Year’s Eve fireworks to be brought back to encourage people into the city.
“While the theatres and the restaurants and a bit of retail will help, it’s the events that really drag people in,” he said.
“We’ve got to have a summer calendar of events that starts to encourage people to be back in the CBD.”

CONSTRUCTION SITE COVID ‘PROTOCOL GAP’ DETECTED Construction industry player Master Builders Victoria has identified a Covid “protocol gap”, after an unvaxxed maintenance technician moved through a construction site while infected with Covid.
The technician transited through part of a construction site earlier this week to access roof fans.
Construction workers must now have either received two doses of a Covid vaccine, one dose or a medical exemption to be on site, but maintenance and service workers are not yet legally required to be vaccinated.
However, it is understood the risk of widespread exposure in this case was minimal due to the reduced site capacity and the fact all other Covid protocols were followed.
Master Builders Victoria chief executive Rebecca Casson said this Covid protocol gap had been detected early.
“We have acted swiftly and collaboratively to ensure any gaps in the new system are addressed,” Ms Casson said.
She said maintenance and service workers need to be made aware when they arrive at a construction site that they are only permitted to go to the areas they are servicing or otherwise, be vaccinated.
Earl Setches from the Plumbing and Pipe Trades Employees Union said this case stressed the importance for all workers attending construction sites to “immediately get vaccinated to protect themselves, their families, their workmates and our community”.
“It is essential that (maintenance and service) workers are vaccinated so that they can legitimately access, and Covid safely navigate, both facilities management areas and construction sites.”
Maintenance and service workers will be legally required to be vaccinated by October 22 as they are classified as authorised workers.

NEW DELTA STRAIN TRACED TO TRAVELLER A new strain of Delta in Sydney has been traced to a returned traveller.
The new Covid Delta strain, revealed on Friday by NSW chief health officer Dr Kerry Chant, has been traced back to a returned traveller who arrived in Sydney in September.
“NSW Health is continuing to investigate the source of the Delta strain … we’ve linked that back to a person who returned from overseas but the exact mechanism of how that new Delta strain emerged and got into the community in Western Sydney is still under investigation,” Dr Chant said.
So far only the traveller and a separate family of seven people have been identified with the new strain.
Dr Chant urged Australians not to become too panicked about the new strain, saying it did not appear to be any more dangerous than the original Delta variant.
“There’s nothing about this Delta strain from looking at the genomics that suggested it’s any more transmissible, or going to cause illness or any other issues additional to the current Delta strain,” she said.

Full text: Mildura will be locked down again from midnight, with 12 cases in the area prompting the snap move.
Meanwhile Shepparton and Moorabool will exit lockdown at midnight after being ordered to stay at home for seven days.
Covid cases continue to climb in regional Victoria, with 18 cases in Geelong, 15 in Colac, 11 in Baw Baw and 10 in Ballarat.
There are also new wastewater detections in seven regional cities, including Portland, Apollo Bay, Aireys Inlet, Cobram, Wonthaggi, Swan Hill and Ballarat.
Chief health officer Brett Sutton said on Friday afternoon the Mildura LGA would revert to the same restrictions as Melbourne, excluding the curfew.
“If you’re in the Mildura Rural City Council area, please follow the lockdown restrictions, get tested if you have symptoms, and get vaccinated if you haven’t already,” he said.
“We’ve seen regional communities get through an outbreak so we know it can be done — it’s vital we protect the local community and the rest of regional Victoria from significant outbreaks.”
In Mildura, nine active cases had been reported as of Friday, with three further cases identified late in the day.
Among the cases is a male offender who tested positive to Covid-19 while in custody at Mildura Police Station on Wednesday.
Multiple police officers have been identified as close contacts and ordered to isolate.
A significant number of police have been redeployed to Mildura as part of the NSW border patrol operation.
Police would not confirm how many officers were in quarantine but said the station remained open.
“The Mildura community can be assured that service delivery to the public will remain unaffected during this time,” a Victoria Police spokeswoman said.
Prof Sutton said public health teams were concerned about onward transmission in the Mildura and had determined that the seven-day lockdown was needed to limit growth in cases.
Victoria has recorded 1838 cases and five deaths from coronavirus in the past 24 hours.
The surge in new infections is the highest daily tally recorded since the pandemic began.
There were 36,600 vaccines administered on Thursday and 77,554 test results received.
The state now hosts 16,823 active infections.
Victoria’s vaccination rates are now at 85 per cent first dose and 56 per cent fully vaccinated.
There are now 620 Victorians in hospital with the virus, including 114 in ICU and 76 on ventilators.
Treasurer Tim Pallas said just eight per cent of those in hospital with Covid-19 were fully vaccinated and about 66 per cent had not been vaccinated, while 26 per cent were partially vaccinated.
And from midnight on Friday, directions banning people from removing their mask to consume alcohol outdoors will be removed.
It comes as just seven per cent of 10,000 recent Covid-19 cases in Victoria were fully vaccinated, as experts predict new infections will soon begin to fall.
New data from the Department of Health revealed 79 per cent of new infections in the week to Tuesday were unvaccinated.
Fifteen per cent were partially vaccinated, while only 7 per cent had received both doses.
“This is unfortunate because it’s despite the fact that 87 per cent of the cases were eligible for vaccination at the time they were diagnosed with Covid-19,” acting chief health officer Professor Ben Cowie said.

FACE MASK MANDATE FOR STUDENTS Victorian students in grades 3 to 6 will be required to wear a face mask in classrooms as schools start to welcome children back.
Chief health officer professor Brett Sutton flagged the new rule on Friday, saying schools needed to adopt “appropriate measures” as more students returned.
But face masks for children in prep and grades one and two would only be “strongly recommended”.
“There is good evidence to support this decision,” Professor Sutton said.
“We have certainly seen in cases such as England and the UK where schools reopened without strong mask use from the get go … there was an estimated 8 per cent of students absent from school in those early weeks with suspected or confirmed Covid.
“In many states in America, school mask mandates have been put in place and they have helped to reduce transmission.”
Chief health officer Brett Sutton said it would help mitigate the risk and “keep a cap on transmission” rates in schools.

REGIONAL VICTORIA RECORDS ONE DEATH A woman living in regional Victoria is among five people to die from Covid-19 in the past 24 hours.
The woman from Shepparton was in her 70s.
A man in his 80s from Brimbank in Melbourne’s west, a woman in her 80s from Whittlesea, a woman in her 70s from Knox and a man in his 70s from Moreland also died overnight.
Vic Locally-acquired Covid-19
WHERE VICTORIA’S CASES WERE FOUND The majority of the state’s Covid-19 infections continue to emerge in Melbourne’s northern suburbs, accounting for 7100 active cases in Victoria.
Chief health officer Brett Sutton said cases in the city’s north represented 42 per cent of Victoria’s new cases on Friday.
In the city’s west, there were 553 new cases, which was 30 per cent of total new cases.
There were 424 new cases in the southeast and 107 cases were from Melbourne’s eastern suburbs.
In regional Victoria, there were 113 new cases, which was six per cent of total cases.

TREASURER DEFENDS PREMIER OVER FOOTAGE Treasurer Tim Pallas has defended Daniel Andrews over a video of him walking across a carpark in Melbourne without a mask.
Police are investigating the incident.
But at Friday’s Covid-19 press conference — with Mr Andrews absent — Mr Pallas said the Premier had always been “diligent”.
“I have had a brief look at the footage and it looks like he is approaching a camera for the purpose of doing a piece-to-camera,” he told reporters.
“You are allowed to not wear a mask for that.”

BORDER PATROLS SCALED BACK Hundreds of police will return to normal duties as the force scales back its NSW border operation.
Victoria Police has revealed the dedicated border operation, involving 300 members, will cease on Tuesday.
Local police will still patrol the borders to ensure permit conditions are adhered to.
“Due to updated health advice, Victoria Police will be scaling back its enforcement at the NSW state border,” a Victoria Police spokesman said.
“The police presence will gradually reduce over the next few days and as of Tuesday, the dedicated border operation with more than 300 police will come to an end.
“After that point, Victoria Police will use its local resources to patrol the border to ensure ongoing compliance with the permit conditions.
One hundred police will be redeployed to patrol the metro regional border in Victoria and the other 200 officers will return to their original duties or Covid-19 enforcement operations.

‘NO RISK’ TO ROADMAP Meanwhile, the Burnet Institute – which was tasked with driving Victoria’s road map out of lockdown – said the state was on track to meet targets despite record daily case numbers.
Mark Stoove, the head of public health at the medical research institute, said the road map was not currently at risk of alteration.
Prof Stoove said recent cases – which had stabilised between 1000 and 1500 – were still “within the bounds of our modelling”.
“I don’t see any reason why the government would want to change its road map at the moment,” he said, adding that he expected daily case numbers to decline in the next week or two.
“Our latest look at the data in NSW actually suggests that the comparable vaccine coverage we’ve got in Victoria at the moment was clearly responsible for the bending of the curve in NSW.
“I think Victorians should be reasonably optimistic about where we’re heading at the moment.”
Ten dedicated vaccination pop-up clinics will also be rolled out across the state specifically for people with a disability.
Disability Minister Luke Donnellan announced the $5m program in a bid to boost low vaccination rates across the cohort.
As at September 30, more than 71 per cent of Victorian NDIS participants aged 16 and over had received their first dose compared to the national rate of 67 per cent.
Mr Donnellan said current rates were “just not acceptable”.
“We can’t open up when we’ve got people living with disabilities, with vulnerabilities, if they’re not at a higher rate of vaccinations,” he said.
Of Thursday’s 1638 cases, 566 were detected in the northern suburbs, 485 in the west, 351 in the south east and 114 in the eastern suburbs.
Regional Victoria recorded 115 cases in the past 24 hours, with 707 of the state’s 15,074 total active cases outside metropolitan Melbourne.
There are 564 Victorians in hospital with Covid-19 including 115 in intensive care and 74 on a ventilator.

BOOSTER SHOT BACKED FOR SOME The nation’s expert immunisation panel is on the verge of recommending a third Covid-19 shot for some Australians.
The Herald Sun understands a decision could be announced as early as Friday, with people who are severely immunocompromised urged to get another vaccine dose.
Pfizer supply will be offered to most people, with the ­recommended interval expected to fall between two to six months after their second Covid-19 jab was administered.
The Australian Technical Advisory Group on Immunisation in September revealed it anticipated a “relatively small cohort of individuals, such as those with severely immunocompromising conditions” were likely to require a third dose.
This is in step with the US, where the drug regulator in August amended both Pfizer and Moderna authorisations to enable certain immunocompromised people to get an ­additional dose.
However, Australian authorities are not expected to announce a decision on booster shots for the rest of the public country until November.

WOOLWORTHS BANKS ON RAPID TESTS Rapid antigen testing has been keeping Woolworths operating during the state’s latest Covid outbreak.
The supermarket giant has performed more than 60,000 tests at its distribution centres since mid-September and found 18 positive results.
These people were then asked to do more detailed PCR tests, similar to those used at state centres, and 10 tested positive.
Woolworths believes the tests have helped them prevent new Covid exposures at their distribution centres, which are needed to stock supermarket shelves.
Rapid tests are increasingly being rolled out across Victoria and can return a result within 20 minutes.
Woolworths Group Covid response lead, Ross Spencer, said the tests help them find the virus among workers without symptoms.
“This is key when dealing with the Delta variant,” he said. “We’re conducting tests with our team members every day before they enter our distribution centres.”

MAN ACCUSED OF JAB-FOR-CASH SCHEME A Melbourne father has been accused of a jab-for-cash scheme where he was paid to get a Covid vaccine on behalf of another man who is believed to have needed it for his job.
Timothy Murphy, 36, allegedly pocketed $300 to attend the 10.50am vaccination appointment for another man at the Direct Chemist Outlet in Dingley Village on September 28.
Police allege Mr Murphy purported to be the man, rolled up his sleeve and received a dose of the AstraZeneca vaccine.

PROTEST COPS IN HOSPITAL WITH COVID Two police officers who worked at violent anti-­lockdown protests in the city have ­contracted Covid, with two becoming so ill they had to be hospitalised.
It is believed the two officers, who both come from an inner-city police station, ­contracted Covid after working at a series of demonstrations in September.
Another 23 police officers from that station have been stood down from frontline ­duties to undertake a 14-day quarantine after being exposed to the virus.
The Herald Sun understands those 23 are vaccinated and have all returned multiple negative tests.

This is in step with the US, where the drug regulator in August amended both Pfizer and Moderna authorisations to enable certain immunocompromised people to get an ­additional dose.
However, Australian authorities are not expected to announce a decision on booster shots for the rest of the public country until November.

WOOLWORTHS BANKS ON RAPID TESTS Rapid antigen testing has been keeping Woolworths operating during the state’s latest Covid outbreak.
The supermarket giant has performed more than 60,000 tests at its distribution centres since mid-September and found 18 positive results.
These people were then asked to do more detailed PCR tests, similar to those used at state centres, and 10 tested positive.
Woolworths believes the tests have helped them prevent new Covid exposures at their distribution centres, which are needed to stock supermarket shelves.
Rapid tests are increasingly being rolled out across Victoria and can return a result within 20 minutes.
Woolworths Group Covid response lead, Ross Spencer, said the tests help them find the virus among workers without symptoms.
“This is key when dealing with the Delta variant,” he said. “We’re conducting tests with our team members every day before they enter our distribution centres.”

MAN ACCUSED OF JAB-FOR-CASH SCHEME A Melbourne father has been accused of a jab-for-cash scheme where he was paid to get a Covid vaccine on behalf of another man who is believed to have needed it for his job.
Timothy Murphy, 36, allegedly pocketed $300 to attend the 10.50am vaccination appointment for another man at the Direct Chemist Outlet in Dingley Village on September 28.
Police allege Mr Murphy purported to be the man, rolled up his sleeve and received a dose of the AstraZeneca vaccine.

PROTEST COPS IN HOSPITAL WITH COVID Two police officers who worked at violent anti-­lockdown protests in the city have ­contracted Covid, with two becoming so ill they had to be hospitalised.
It is believed the two officers, who both come from an inner-city police station, ­contracted Covid after working at a series of demonstrations in September.
Another 23 police officers from that station have been stood down from frontline ­duties to undertake a 14-day quarantine after being exposed to the virus.
The Herald Sun understands those 23 are vaccinated and have all returned multiple negative tests.

Full text: The LNP last week formally asked Speaker Curtis Pitt to refer the Premier to the Ethics Committee, alleging she had deliberately misled parliament by relying on extrapolated worst-case scenario Doherty Institute modelling to claim thousands would die if there wasn’t a “serious discussion” on the path out of Covid-19.
The claims made by Ms Palaszczuk, in which she said 2240 people would die a month if the state opened up at 70 per cent fully vaccinated, have been debunked by experts and authorities as misleading.
The LNP, in referring the matter to the Speaker, said there was sufficient evidence to prove she had misled parliament.
“The Premier was extensively briefed on the Doherty Institute modelling. However, the reckless statement the Premier gave to parliament does not reflect the modelling and has been staunchly refuted by experts,” Opposition Integrity spokeswoman Fiona Simpson said.
But Mr Pitt, in a decision tabled in parliament on Wednesday, threw out the complaint because it was “not meritorious”.
“On the face of it, the argument in this matter is not particularly meritorious. I have, therefore, decided to dismiss the matter without further inquiry and I will not be referring it to the Ethics Committee nor publishing any further correspondence,” he said.
Mr Pitt also slammed the LNP for allegedly briefing the media about the complaint saying there were “two choices” when someone believes an MP has breached parliamentary privilege or committed contempt — due process in parliament or trial by media.
“A choice must be made as to which approach to take, but it is both discourteous and an abuse of procedure to do both,” he said.
Mr Pitt referred MPs to comments made by his predecessor, Peter Wellington, who in 2017 said that he took “a dim view” of MPs who write to him on a matter of privilege and then go to the media with it.
“Such tactics are not only a discourtesy to the office of Speaker, but may in some instances be viewed as an improper attempt to influence my decision making process,” he said.
“I advise that such tactics may result in my dismissing matters that are unmeritorious on their face without further inquiry.”

Andrew Bolt: Doom and gloom virus models holding Victorians hostage

Full text: “I don’t want us to finish up like Sydney,” he said.
Congratulations, Premier: Melbourne today looks nothing like Sydney.
It’s worse. Victoria’s infections are rising faster than Sydney’s ever did – 950 new cases on Wednesday, compared to 863 in NSW, a bigger state.
Melbourne also has the nastiest lockdown, plus curfew and mass protests, while Sydney is without a curfew and opening up.
What’s clear is not just that Andrews’ lockdowns have been pointlessly cruel.
It’s also clear that the models premiers cite to justify their lockdowns are little better than junk. They’re like the climate models which predict disasters that don’t happen.
If these virus models – computer simulations of outcomes of various policies – were right, Melbourne would be free and Sydney the basket case.
But they’re not. Just two weeks ago, Professor Raina MacIntyre, a Kirby Institute epidemiologist, criticised the softer lockdown in NSW, warning “our model estimates there will still be numbers in the high thousands by middle of October”.
Instead, new infections in NSW have fallen to one tenth that number.
That won’t deter MacIntyre, who remains a media favourite even though her scary models keep flopping.
In March last year, she warned that “hundreds of thousands” of Australians could die of the virus. True death toll: under 1300.
She then warned that Christmas last year would be “ a ticking time bomb” spreading infections through NSW, which “could be looking at 3000 cases by January 8”.
True number of cases on January 8: just four.
But it’s not just MacIntyre who should chuck whatever she’s using for her models.
Right at the start of this pandemic, the Prime Minister’s advisers said their own models predicted at least 50,000 of us would die.
Another dud model, reported in the Medical Journal of Australia, warned in March last year that “Australia could run out of ICU beds to treat coronavirus patients in as few as 10 days”.
When those 10 days were up – with many hundreds of ICU beds to spare – Australia’s then chief medical officer doubled down: “This is a horrendous scenario. A daily demand for new intensive care beds of 35,000-plus”.
True number of Australians with Covid-19 in intensive care today: fewer than 300.
Yet this farce continues.
The Burnet Institute two months ago urged a harder lockdown of Sydney, because unless new controls worked “our model projects that Sydney will have about 7700 cases per day four weeks from now”.
Instead, the NSW government eased its restrictions and infections never topped 1600 a day, and are now half that.
The Burnet Institute, undaunted, now advises the Victorian government, predicting up to 2900 daily cases a month from now, but note the critical difference.
In Victoria, Premier Andrews seems to treat models as holy writ, either to cover his backside or maybe because they tell him what he wants to hear: go in even harder.
In contrast, the NSW government now takes such models with a pinch of salt. On Tuesday, NSW Health Minister Brad Hazzard explained why: he said he well remembered being told that models showed 20,000 people in his state would die by last Christmas.
But why are these virus models always so pessimistic? Why are global warming models also so ludicrously catastrophic?
Blame human nature. Which expert is safest and heard more eagerly: the one who predicts the worst and then is pleasantly surprised, or the one who says “don’t panic” and then gets scapegoated when governments are caught out unprepared?
I suspect some virus experts – like global warming academics – also know the kind of models their political masters often prefer. They like ones that falsely predict catastrophe, so they can later take credit for saving us from horrors that were never going to happen.
Brett Sutton, Victoria’s chief health officer, has played that game. Already in April last year, he touted modelling by Monash University and the Doherty Institute to boast that the government’s lockdown had helped save up to 36,000 Victorians from death.
“Hundreds of thousands of Victorians would have been infected, if we just had isolation and quarantine.”
That’s plainly crazy. Sweden – with twice Victoria’s population and no ocean moat to keep out the infected – had no hard lockdowns and now lives with no restrictions. Yet its death toll is 14,000.
Sutton should file his models under “trash” and check the real word. As should we all.

Burnet Institute refusing to return JobKeeper despite $60m surplus

Author: Morrow, James

Full text: According to the 2020 annual report of the Melbourne-based non-profit Burnet Institute, taxpayer subsidies of $4,558,000 “enabled the Institute to maintain a high level of productivity and a pipeline for research discoveries and important laboratory capacity to respond to Covid-19 initiatives”.
At the same time, the Institute also netted $56 million from the sale of property, as well as an $8 million profit from the sale of Biolabs 360 Pty Ltd, in which it held a 75 per cent stake.
The Burnet Institute’s pandemic modelling, which has informed both NSW and Victorian government responses, has come under increasing scrutiny its dire predictions have failed to come true.
On August 2, Burnet Institute modelling claimed that Sydney would reach 8,000 cases per day by the end of the month.
On August 19, Burnet CEO Brendan Crabb told The Today Show that NSW was “in a steam train that is heading towards a cliff, not heading towards a station” and that cases would have to get back to “zero or close to zero” before lifting restrictions.
“The best outcome (for NSW) is lockdown till Christmas, keeping a lid on numbers like they are now,” he said.
Two weeks ago, on September 14, Burnet researchers claimed that without restrictions like curfews and the closure of hardware stores, cases in Sydney’s LGAs of concern would be tracking at around 4,000 cases a day – and not because of vaccination rates that are among the highest in the nation.
NED-4534-NSW-Roadmap-to-freedom
Burnet modelling has also been criticised for overstating the number of hospital beds and ICU units that would be needed during the current Delta outbreak in Sydney, and for sticking to an “eliminationist” mindset.
A spokesman for the organisation said that the institute “has always been a not-for-profit research organisation, which means we don’t make profits. Any surplus goes to helping improve the health of vulnerable people, not to shareholders.”
“In 2020, like many organisations facing challenges in the pandemic, JobKeeper was crucial to our work continuing. Our Board, like many boards around Australia, is looking at JobKeeper and that continues to be an ongoing discussion.”
NSW Senator Andrew Bragg said that he was surprised Labor, which has recently been pushing for private businesses to return JobKeeper payments, was ignoring operations like Burnet, which took in millions while pushing for “Covid Zero” policies and warning of the dangers of lifting lockdowns,
“Labor is very quiet about JobKeeper payments to fellow travellers,” he said.
“Labor works hard for their mates – unions, super funds, and public health lobbies, but they hate small business.”

Full text: A group calling itself National Education United, which claims to represent workers from multiple industries, said the protest will take place in Coolangatta as a “show of support” for anyone whose job was at risk if they refused vaccination.
Queensland’s decision to make vaccines mandatory for truckies came after a driver was revealed to be one of four new local cases recorded overnight.
The driver was infectious in the community for a week.
Truck drivers must get their first dose by October 15 and their second dose by November 15.
A specialist vaccine station will be set up at Tugun on the Gold Coast after Premier Annastacia Palaszczuk said seven truck drivers had now entered Queensland with the virus.
She revealed Brisbane’s new local cases at press conference at Caloundra on Tuesday morning, including two cases of particular note.
She said one of the four people with coronavirus, the truckie, had spent the week in shared accommodation, and an aviation worker had spent three days in the community while infected.
The wife of the aviation worker also tested positive, as did a fourth person who had completed 14 days in hotel quarantine beforehand.
Ms Palaszczuk said masks were the “best line of defence” against the coronavirus.
“There’s no need to panic because Queenslanders have been doing the right thing,” she said.
Masks have to be worn indoors again across Brisbane and Moreton Bay.
“We want to go back to people wearing masks indoors if you live in the Brisbane area and the Moreton Bay region,” Ms Palaszczuk said.
The Queensland Government has launched a series of ads encouraging citizens to be vaccinated for Covid-19.
She said two more overseas acquired cases were detected in hotel quarantine.
Transport Minister Mark Bailey said the state government has been “working with” the freight industry to address lower vaccination rates than the general public.
Truckies will need to have tested negatively for the virus at least seven days before entering Queensland.
Mr Bailey said Queensland Health would prioritise freight workers, including truckies, for vaccinations.
He predicted about 200 jabs would be provided at the Tugun facility daily.
Ms Palaszczuk said truckies were “absolutely essential” to keep “food on the table” and rebuild the economy.

“Regular testing has meant cases have been picked up quickly. But due to the nature of their work, we know that many freight workers and truck drivers are at greater risk of contracting Covid-19,” she said.
“That’s why we’re ramping up our vaccination rollout and making it quicker and easier for truck drivers crossing through the Gold Coast border to get vaccinated.
“Many drivers are already vaccinated – but for those that aren’t, we want to make it as easy as possible for them to get the jab.”
Health Minister Yvette D’Ath and chief health officer Dr Jeannette Young provided details at a press conference about 10.30am.
Ms D’Ath urged eligible Queensland residents to get fully vaccinated as soon as possible.
“There is no reason not to be getting vaccinated now,” she said.
Dr Young said she “does not believe a lockdown is warranted”.
Queensland Health has listed new exposure sites in the city, including a McDonald’s, a child care centre and a guesthouse.
The Gold Coast business community and Mayor Tom Tate were on tenterhooks on Tuesday morning, with fears about potential impacts on the near-sellout weekend Rugby Championship double-header at Cbus Super Stadium, featuring the All Blacks, Wallabies, South Africa and Argentina.
Meanwhile New South Wales Health Minister Brad Hazzard announced at a press conference in Sydney on Tuesday morning that Tweed and Byron would exit lockdown at 12am on Wednesday.
He said NSW had recorded 863 new locally acquired cases and seven deaths.
Queensland Health later announced that Tweed and Byron shires would be reinstated to the Queensland border bubble.
A Queensland Health spokesman said residents would be allowed to cross from 1am on Wednesday for work, food and medical purposes as previously permitted.

Premier refuses to commit to Christmas reopening Earlier: Premier Annastacia Palaszczuk refuses to commit to reopening borders by Christmas, saying she’s awaiting more modelling as federal heavyweights pile on the pressure.
Prime Minister Scott Morrison has said he saw no reason why people should be separated by state borders when an 80 per cent national vaccination target is reached.
Ms Palaszczuk, visiting the Gold Coast mass vaccination hub at Broadbeach on Monday, said she was looking forward to revised modelling of predicted Covid deaths by the Doherty Institute, whose predictions are guiding the national reopening plan.
She hoped to receive new Doherty modelling on Friday at national cabinet and said she hoped the Prime Minister “will release all of that publicly so everyone can see it”.
Asked if Queenslanders could expect to reunite with loved ones interstate come December, she said it depended on “the modelling and our discussions at national cabinet”.
“Look at what our life is like now in Queensland, I’m pretty proud of the life we have at the moment,” Ms Palaszczuk said.

“I’m sure the tourism operators would not want Delta here, that’d be catastrophic to the Queensland community.”
Federal Ministers are piling on the pressure for Queensland and WA to reopen in line with the rest of country, with Deputy Prime Minister Barnaby Joyce saying he didn’t realise Ms Palaszczuk was an epidemiologist.
Ms Palaszczuk responded: “I think Barnaby should be sitting down with Darren Chester who just left the Nationals. He’s got to focus on his own job and let me do my job.”
Her comments came after visiting embattled Coolangatta on Monday amid months of public outcry, speaking with business owners suffering due to the border bubble’s removal for the second time in weeks.
“I know it’s tough down there, that’s why the government has put in money for the hardship. I can see some businesses are closed and I do look forward to the day that hopefully, the Northern New South Wales area can be lifted from that lockdown,” she said.
Deputy Prime Minister Joyce told Sunrise: “I didn’t know (Ms Palaszczuk) was an immunologist. I didn’t know her epidemiology was so up to speed. She’s prepared to put her views ahead of the Doherty Institute and sending business broke.”
Queensland Deputy Premier Steven Miles has indicated the state border could stay closed for Christmas.
Queenslanders are enjoying some of the most relaxed Covid restrictions in the country, and the state government did not want to “let Covid in for Christmas”, he said.
Queensland chief health officer Jeannette Young, asked if in favour of reopening at 80 per cent, said: “It’s not a simple straightforward process. You can’t pick something and then say it leads to something else.
“We should all prepare and hope and get everyone vaccinated, that’s the most important thing business can do.”

New vax hubs on Coast, no new Covid cases September 28: Queensland has recorded no new locally or overseas acquired Covid-19 cases in another “double doughnut day” for the state, according to Premier Annastacia Palaszczuk.
Ms Palaszczuk announced the lack of new coronavirus cases – and new vaccination centres at Coomera and Tugun – during a press conference at Gold Coast Convention and Exhibition Centre on Monday morning.
The new hubs were revealed minutes before New South Wales Premier Gladys Berejiklian said there had been 787 new cases and a dozen deaths in her state in the previous 24 hours.
Guns N’ Roses tour delayed again
Ms Palaszczuk said the Coomera centre is due to administer 2500 vaccinations per day before ramping up to 3000 within a fortnight, while the Tugun centre will give 800 jabs each day.
It comes after Ms Palaszczuk reportedly visited the Queensland-NSW border at Coolangatta earlier in the morning.
The visit follows the revelation by Destination Gold Coast that tourism losses have reached almost $1 billion for the September quarter, compared to pre-pandemic times in 2019.
The city’s leading tourism body aired the shocking find after Deputy Premier Steven Miles gave the strongest indication yet Queensland’s borders will be shut over Christmas – even if 80 per cent of the eligible residents are vaccinated against the coronavirus.
NED-2822-GCB-APP
Almost 45 per cent of the state is now fully vaccinated, while a touch over 60 per cent of Queensland residents have had their first of two jabs.
More to come.

Full text: Instead, Premier Gladys Berejiklian made good on her promise that there would be no “freedom day”, announcing Monday that with 80 per cent of over-16s double dosed a swag of restrictions would remain in place, from a cap of 10 vaccinated visitors to the home to 4sq m limits on indoor hospitality.
“I don’t want to be a party pooper but I’ve said let’s not think about this as a freedom day but let’s think about this as a staged reopening to getting back to normal,” she said.
Covid stats
And while the announced road map does provide for a further winding back of ­restrictions in December, ­including allowing the ­unvaccinated to participate in more activities, it also foreshadows ongoing restrictions and localised lockdowns for years.
NSW residents also potentially face years of checking in to shops and venues after the Premier contradicted Customer Services Minister Victor Dominello, who was quoted on the weekend saying that QR codes and vaccine passports would be over once we reached “saturation levels” of vaccine coverage.
“Notwithstanding that these are my babies, I will be the first to turn them off,” Mr Dominello told local media.
“They are only to be used in pandemic situations.”
However, suggesting that the government is not prepared to treat Covid as endemic, rather than pandemic, as much of the rest of the world is doing, Ms Berejiklian said Monday that “QR codes could be with us (as long as) Covid is”.
This despite the agreed ­national cabinet plan being to “manage Covid-19 consistent with public health management of other diseases”.
However a look around the world at places like New York, the UK, and Denmark shows that Sydney’s new “normal” will not be so normal after all – though they might point a way forward for our overly-cautious policy makers.
NEW YORK CITY The Big Apple is back.
Having experienced a horror start to the pandemic, made worse by government orders shipping positive Covid patients to nursing homes, New York City began planning to re-open the city as early as June, 2020, long before the ­development of vaccines.
While there were strict limits on indoor dining for much of the pandemic, through the winter of 2020-2021, hospitality continued to trade, with restaurants creating sometimes quite elaborate makeshift table areas carved out of streets with concrete bollards.
Notably, while the city experienced a second wave of deaths that peaked at about 100 a day earlier this year, this was a fraction of the 700 or more lives lost daily at the worst of the pandemic.
Today, the city has vaccination rates lower than locked-down Sydney’s, but comparable fatality rates – even as most of the city gets back to business.
Restaurateur Keith McNally, who owns a number of the city’s most famous restaurants including Balthazar and Minetta Tavern, regularly posts reports of the recovery on his Instagram account.
One recent report he shared from one of his maître d’s tells the story: “Tonight was a very busy night from the start. Lots of walk ins throughout to go with the reservations we had.
“We ended up with a total of 580 covers, 310 reservations, 270 walk-ins, 58 no-shows and 6 cancellations.”
And all without a square- metre rule in sight.
UNITED KINGDOM When British Prime Minister Boris Johnson announced that the UK would end all coronavirus restrictions on what quickly became known as “freedom day”, commentators and many epidemiologists were aghast.
“In the competition between cautious policy change and recklessness, the British government appears to have chosen recklessness,” wrote Australian epidemiologist and Oxford University professor David Hunter at the time, summing up the views of many.
Daily Telegraph - News Feed latest episode
However, in a country that had endured some of the highest casualty rates from the pandemic as well as some of the toughest lockdowns, the prospect of an end to the rolling nightmare was worth the risk.
And, contrary to those who thought that an end to restrictions would mean total disaster, cases rose but deaths stayed far lower through a wave of the Delta variant than they did during the worst of the earlier waves of the pandemic.
Much of this is credited to a high rate of immunity in the population, with as many as 90 per cent of the population thought to have antibodies via vaccination or previous infection.
More important though is the change in attitude. Australian expats living in London remark that the local press barely covers coronavirus, while in Sydney it remains front-page news.
”It’s pretty much back to normal here," Londoner David Scullion said.
“The only thing different is travel in and out of the country and you’re supposed to wear a mask on the Tube, but it’s not the law anymore and lots of people don’t.”
DENMARK Earlier this month Denmark took the extraordinary step of ending all pandemic restrictions – and getting to the stage envisioned by Australia’s own Doherty Institute modelling, which imagines that one day we too will live with the disease as we do with the flu and other illnesses.
With a population almost exactly that of Sydney, Denmark has had a relatively easy pandemic, suffering 2642 deaths.
Starting earlier this year, the country embarked on a program to see it out the other side of the pandemic, focusing on a vaccine program that concentrated on older and more vulnerable populations.
They also instituted a Coronapas, or coronavirus passport app, that showed the holder had either been vaccinated, been infected within the last three months (thus proving antibodies) or had recently had a negative test.
Experts say that high levels of social trust enabled the society to get there but that it is not impossible, even for Australia, where community spirit has been battered by extended lockdowns and state versus state bunfights.
“By end 2021, NSW should reach 90 per cent of eligible populations fully vaccinated (equating to more than 75 per cent total population),” infectious diseases physician Greg Dore of the UNSW’s Kirby Institute said.
“It would then be in a similar position to countries such as Denmark which has very safely removed almost all Covid restrictions.”

Full text: Ms Palaszczuk wants Prime Minister Scott Morrison to release “revised Doherty modelling” before Friday’s meeting and then publicly, which she says she needs to determine border reopenings and ongoing restrictions.
But a spokesman for the Prime Minister’s office said the Premier already has all updated modelling of how cases will grow if the country opens up amid NSW and Victorian outbreaks.
The conflicting statements follow weeks of Ms Palaszczuk insisting she needs the further work to decide on border reopenings, the further lessening of restrictions and how to respond to future outbreaks in a 70 or 80 per cent double-vaccinated society.
“I look forward to seeing the modelling before this week’s National Cabinet meeting,” she said when asked exactly what she wanted to learn at Friday’s forum.
“In order to chart a course out of this pandemic and protect our way of life in Queensland, we must have the best, most up-to-date research.
“I encourage the Prime Minister to release the revised Doherty modelling before Friday’s meeting and then publicly.”
A spokesman for Ms Palaszczuk said she was expecting to receive an update to the modelling in order to understand what happened to Covid-19 spread at 70 or 80 per cent vaccination rates if the country opened up when a massive outbreak was already under way.
But a spokeswoman for the Prime Minister's office said National Cabinet had been provided that “final sensitivity analysis” on higher case numbers and vaccinating children under 16 at their last meeting on September 17.
“Doherty is now undertaking complimentary work that focuses on how to best manage high-risk groups, including Indigenous Australians and other cohorts such as schools, as Australia moves forward with the agreed plan to reopen the country,” she said
The extra work being done by Doherty Institute researchers, to be presented on Friday with more to come in mid-October, includes how public health measures such as contact tracing can be enhanced or updated to work best when the country starts opening up at 80 per cent vaccination levels, and tailoring health measures to best protect certain cohorts, including those with disabilities.
The Doherty Institute is also looking at what measures, like home quarantine, will work best at reducing transmission of the virus when international travel resumes.
The confusion comes as the NSW Government gave the clearest indication of what living with Covid might look like, releasing its plan for when the state hits 70 and 80 per cent full vaccination levels.
At 80 per cent, vaccinated residents will initially be able to travel anywhere freely in NSW, stand to drink at a pub, welcome up to 10 visitors to a home, gather with 20 people outside, and have 200 people at a Covid-safe event and 500 at a ticketed and seated event.
Doherty Covid Modelling
Community sport will resume, venues will operate with a one person per 4 square metres rule and there will be no limits on guests at weddings and funerals for fully-vaccinated people.
The unvaccinated will be able to enjoy those freedoms later, when mask restrictions will significantly ease and there will be no limits on people gathering.
Queensland chief health officer Jeannette Young said businesses and residents should “prepare and hope” for borders to open by Christmas, but said it was too “simplistic” to commit to opening at 80 per cent.
“It would be wonderful to be able to know we’ve got to 80 per cent and something will happen,” she said.
“Unfortunately, it’s just not that straightforward.”
Ms Palaszczuk said she was “pretty proud” of the life we had in Queensland at the moment, but would love to see as many people as possible reunited with their families.
“The Prime Minister is working on those countries where there can be a travel bubble into the future,” she said.
Her spokesman said the Premier agreed with the national plan that provided for more localised lockdowns at 70 and 80 per cent and pointed out Queensland was only closed to declared local government hot spots.

Questions raised over regional roadmap COVID modelling

Full text: The Burnet Institute modelling underpinning Victoria's roadmap out of lockdown appears to only look at metropolitan Melbourne, casting doubt on the scientific basis of the government's regional roadmap.
When he announced the roadmap Premier Daniel Andrews said it was "developed based on expert modelling from the Burnet Institute", but the researcher who led the modelling has told ACM, regional Victoria wasn't included in the analysis.
"The regional roadmap plan was developed independently to us," the Burnet Institute's Dr Nick Scott said. "We provided modelling for the metropolitan one and the reason our focus was on the metropolitan one was that was where the cases were to model."
It raises questions about how the government decided on Victoria's regional roadmap and current restrictions, particularly in light of the negligible changes flagged for country areas before the end of October.
The Department of Health confirmed the Burnet Institute modelling did not consider regional Victoria. The department said it was necessary to keep regional areas tightly restricted, arguing there was a high risk of super spreader events until 80 per cent of Victorians over 16 were fully vaccinated, but didn't provide specific data.
"A large amount of information was used by the Department of Health when developing the roadmap including how to safeguard the statewide health system and protecting against the increased possibility of seeding cases in regional areas," a spokesperson said.
Chair of epidemiology at Deakin University Professor Catherine Bennett said it was "very weird" the Department of Health hadn't asked for modelling of regional areas.
"I would've thought you would factor that in because you might open up certain areas earlier," she said. She also said there was a risk of underestimating the second peak in cases in December without the modelling.

LNP want Premier probed by ethics committee over Doherty Institute modelling ‘misuse’

Full text: The Premier, in a highly charged parliamentary performance earlier this month, relied on extrapolated worst-case scenario Doherty Institute modelling to claim thousands would die if there wasn’t a “serious discussion” on the path out of Covid-19.
“Doherty Institute modelling predicts that even with 70 per cent of the population vaccinated, 80 people will die each day from COVID once the outbreak reaches six months after it started,” she said.
“That is 2,240 who will die each month.”
The assertions, which were also made on social media, have been debunked by the media and experts, including ABC’s Fact Check, as misleading.
Federal Health Minister Greg Hunt at the time blasted the Premier for “selectively misusing the Doherty modelling”.
He said the Doherty Institute made it clear that “with optimal public health measures and no lockdowns this can be significantly reduced to 2787 infections and 13 deaths (nationally)”.
Doherty Institute modelling shows if the country opened up at 70 per cent and the national plan was followed, the number of deaths in the first six months of an outbreak would be 12.
If there were no low level restrictions and test and trace measures were failing, in the worst case scenario deaths would be about 1456 in the first six months - lower than the Premier’s calculations.
On Friday afternoon Opposition Integrity spokeswoman Fiona Simpson confirmed the LNP had formally asked Speaker Curtis Pitt to refer the Premier to the Ethics Committee.
“There is sufficient evidence the Premier has misled Parliament,” she said.
“The Premier was extensively briefed on the Doherty Institute modelling. However, the reckless statement the Premier gave to Parliament does not reflect the modelling and has been staunchly refuted by experts.
“The Ethics Committee should consider whether the Premier is in contempt of Parliament.”
A spokesperson for Ms Palaszczuk said the Premier was using figures outlined in the Doherty report which is publicly available.
Ms Palaszczuk has been found guilty of contempt before.
In October 2019 the Ethics Committee ruled her in contempt of parliament over her threats to strip Katter’s Australian Party (KAP) MPs of staff after they refused to denounce former colleague Fraser Anning’s speech calling for a Muslim immigration ban.
She apologised at the time.

Is reopening model right on hospitals?

Full text: The next few weeks will be critical for Victoria's COVID-19 modelling, as scientists watch to see how fast the state's coronavirus outbreak is growing after recording its highest-ever daily case number of 766.
The Burnet Institute's model for Victoria's reopening, which projects large caseloads of COVID-19, and an overwhelmed healthcare system, includes a key uncertainty about how fast the outbreak will spread. The model assumes it will continue to grow at its current pace before vaccination starts to bend the curve in a few weeks. But the virus might be spreading in particularly vulnerable communities at the moment, which would make it look like it is spreading quickly. As it passes into less vulnerable communities, it may slow.
Dr Nick Scott, the institute's head of modelling, said it was "equally plausible" the rate of growth would stay the same or slow.
The Burnet model, commissioned by the state government and released alongside the reopening road map, predicts high infection levels in coming months: about 120,000 diagnosed cases in December after restrictions are eased.
The model notes the uncertainty about how fast the epidemic will grow by giving a broad range for its projections for reopening: between 2778 and 6761 daily cases at the peak, and 1455 to 3152 deaths between July and December.
"Only five days ago, I was confident that the Burnet model had overcooked it, estimating too high," said Professor Tony Blakely, who heads a separate modelling team at the University of Melbourne. "Then in the last couple of days, the numbers in Victoria have kept trucking up. I think they are overestimating the likely health harms, but it's fairly good."
The Doherty Institute projects 914,357 cases Australia-wide, with 35,322 hospitalisations, 7611 ICU admissions and 6402 deaths over six months. The University of Melbourne, looking just at 2022, projects a fraction of that: 200 ICU admissions and 250 deaths. However, the trade-off would be Victorians spending about 14 per cent of the year in lockdown.
Despite the differences between the models, several independent teams said their data was starting to say the same thing: reopening at a vaccination rate of 80 per cent would mean high levels of infection, hospitalisation and death unless other restrictions are in place.
"All the models are converging at this point," said Dr Jason Thompson of the University of Melbourne, who worked on the Victorian government's epidemic modelling. "They are all converging on a vaccines-plus strategy."
The other key difference is the Burnet's modelling is the only one to incorporate higher mortality rates from the Delta strain. The Burnet's model is also more pessimistic than the Doherty's about how well vaccines stop people passing on the virus, although it does not model waning immunity.
"We need to be thinking about booster shots now because there is mounting evidence of waning efficacy," said Will Mackey, a senior associate at the Grattan Institute.
The Burnet's model puts the current effective reproduction number - the average number of people each infected person passes the virus to - at about 1.6.
University of South Australia biostatistician Professor Adrian Esterman estimated that number had hovered near 1.2 this week, with a sudden blip yesterday when the state recorded 766 cases.

Doherty expert agrees Delta strain could push NSW hospitalisations higher than initially thought

Full text: Doherty Institute director of epidemiology Jodie McVernon on Thursday told a NSW parliamentary inquiry that new international research had improved the community’s knowledge of the Delta strain, with a possible rise in NSW case numbers and hospitalisations to be reflected in future modelling.
The research in question – from the University of Toronto in Canada – found the Delta variant is more than one-and-a-half times more likely to kill and nearly twice as likely to leave a patient in hospital than the Alpha variant.
Earlier this month, the NSW state government released modelling, based on analysis by the Burnet Institute in August that showed Sydney coronavirus hot spots will see up to 2000 cases per day, and by the beginning of November, 560 people would be in intensive care units from Covid-19 alone.
Premier Gladys Berejiklian said at the time the number of people in intensive care without Covid-19 at any given time was usually about 400.
The state has capacity to treat a total of 1550 ICU patients at the same time.
Prompted by a question from Greens MP Cate Faehrmann, Ms McVernon on Thursday agreed Delta was worse, and that the number of cases and hospitalisations NSW was expecting could go beyond what was expected.
Ms McVernon did however stress that the Doherty Institute’s own strategy was one of minimising case numbers, with the new Delta research not substantially changing that.
“Now, some people see scenarios that produce tables of relative outcomes as predictions … so in that situation you would need to increase those numbers,” Ms McVernon said.
“But, those numbers are really there to compare outcomes to give you a strategy. So in terms of actually mapping … it again brings you back to the situational assessment which is, okay we’ve now updated our understanding of severity, if our objective locally is to keep things within health system capacity, then we need to see how current infections are tracking to our estimates of local burden.”
NSW recorded 1063 new coronavirus cases and six deaths on Thursday.

Full text: Peppered with questions about Qld’s reopening and whether the state’s strategy was in line with the national plan to open at an 80 per cent vaccination rate, Ms Palaszczuk snapped at the press pack, pointing to her record on keeping the coronavirus out.
Journalists were accused of not being “across the issues” when the Premier was pressed for detail and Ms Palaszczuk said agitation “coming from Canberra” was a key reason for the criticism she had faced as she bit back at each question.
“Let me say, say this, if we get a Delta outbreak here, we’ll all be in lockdown and no business is really operating,” Ms Palaszczuk told a reporter.
“Do you want that? Do you want that?”
“I don’t understand these constant criticism of Queensland doing well. I will always stand up for this state, I am sick of being attacked for Queensland doing a great job, and Queenslanders doing a great job.”
Ms Palaszczuk has been quick to shut the border and enforce localised lockdowns to keep the state largely virus-free, with a strict hotel quarantine regime also credited with preventing a Delta surge such as that seen in NSW and Victoria.
But Queensland’s hard line border stance has also faced criticism – particularly from the federal coalition government and state opposition – while the state’s tourism sector has also called for clarity on the vaccination target needed to reopen.
Ms Palaszczuk has so far refused to commit to a timeline for opening the state’s borders while demanding updated modelling from the federal government on the potential impact to unvaccinated children under the national plan to reopen the country.
Media referencing the national plan at Thursday’s press conference drew a sharp reply from Ms Palaszczuk, who repeated that the plan was a federal government responsibility.
“Everyone talks about the national plan, there’s the national plan for you right there, I’ll give you a copy,” Ms Palaszczuk told a journalist who asked about it.
Then, to The Australian’s Lydia Lynch: “I haven‘t got the papers Lydia! Go and ask the federal government for the papers!”
Ms Palaszczuk stressed on Thursday that Qld currently enjoyed more freedoms than NSW and Victorian residents will at 80 per cent vaccination rates.
“In Victoria, at 80 per cent, they will be allowed 30 people to visit for Christmas dinner. Here, Queenslanders can have 100 people over,” she said.
“I’m sick of constantly being attacked for doing the right thing.”
Earlier on Thursday, the RMIT ABC Fact Check division found comments made by Ms Palaszczuk on Doherty Institute modelling and death rates to be misleading.
Ms Palaszczuk told parliament this month that even with 70 per cent of the population vaccinated “80 people will die each day from Covid once the outbreak reaches six months after it started. That is 2,240 who will die each month.”
Fact Check reported that Ms Palaszczuk had selected an “extreme” estimate with lower probability, and not the central estimate in the modelling.
Queensland currently has more than 61 per cent of eligible residents with a first dose and 42 per cent are fully vaccinated.
Thursday’s testy press conference came after the state reported one new locally acquired case of Covid-19 in the 24 hours to 8pm last night.
The new community case – a female student at St Thomas More College – is a close contact of another pupil who had been infected in the Sunnybank outbreak. The new case has been in home isolation.
Chief health officer Jeannette Young expressed her gratitude to the girl’s family and said it showed how important it was to abide by quarantine rules.
“She actually tested positive day nine in home quarantine had been in home quarantine for her entire infectious period, so this just shows yet again how important it is that when people are asked to go into quarantine, they need to remain in quarantine for 14 days,” Dr Young said.
Ms Palaszczuk on Thursday also announced there was one new case that arrived in hotel quarantine in the 24 hours to 8pm last night.
Thursday’s presser came as footy fans were being enticed to pop-up clinics in Brisbane on Thursday and Friday, with 3000 double passes to the weekend’s NRL preliminary finals at Suncorp Stadium up for grabs if they get the jab.
Meanwhile, police reported 10,000 vehicles had crossed Queensland’s borders in the past 24 hours, with 220 turned around.
There were 424 people processed at the state’s airport borders, with six people refused entry.

Thousands of retired healthcare workers to return to the frontline as Covid ICU surge approaches

Full text: Almost 29,000 healthcare workers across Australia who recently stopped working have been made eligible to return to their full scope of practice for up to 12 months if they answer the call to join the Covid-19 response.
The Australian Health Practitioner Regulation Agency has now added 55,000 people to its sub-register since the pandemic began, creating an opt-out pool of practitioners from which to draw a surge workforce.
The medical watchdog on Wednesday contacted more than 8000 people in NSW to let them know they might be asked to rejoin the healthcare system, which is struggling with high caseloads while losing staff as they are forced into isolation.
Of the 12,810 active cases in NSW, 1232 people are admitted to hospital with 242 patients in intensive care, of whom 122 require ventilation.
NSW Health has already issued a public plea for retired nurses to return to work, while final year medical students have been signed up as assistants in medicine to aid in the crisis.
Modelling from the Burnet Institute, which underpins the Berejiklian government’s reopening plan, predicts intensive care admissions in NSW will peak at almost 950 in early November.
The modelling warns already stretched hospitals will become overwhelmed, while Premier Gladys Berejiklian has acknowledged the healthcare system is under significant pressure.
NSW health officials on Wednesday evening confirmed another major hospital in Sydney had been hit by a Covid-19 outbreak.
Liverpool Hospital in the city’s southwest has in the past week seen 24 patients and five staff members infected in six separate exposure site events at the hospital across multiple wards.
The hospital was the site of another outbreak in early August – after a partially vaccinated student nurse tested positive for the virus – that was linked to 10 deaths.
Contact tracers are still working to determine the source of the latest infection.
A South Western Sydney Local Health District spokeswoman said all of the staff members who had tested positive were vaccinated and the hospital had strict infection control measures in place.
“We thank all those at Liverpool Hospital for their continued dedication to providing outstanding patient care to all patients during these most challenging of times,” the spokeswoman said.
Australia’s Chief Nursing and Midwifery Officer Alison McMillan said earlier this month that the AHPRA sub-register would boost staff numbers to allow people to work where they were most needed.
“So where we might have had nurses doing testing and vaccinations in significant numbers, we’re looking at using undergraduate students in medical and nursing and allied health to support our vaccine program so we can potentially move nurses back into the primary health and hospital system,” Professor McMillan told the ABC.
AHPRA chief executive officer Martin Fletcher said it was working with governments to help support Australia’s health system response to the pandemic.
“Public safety remains an important focus of AHPRA and the National Boards,” he said.
“Our focus has been on ensuring that practitioners available as a potential surge health workforce are properly qualified, competent and suitable to be on the sub-registers.”

Coronavirus: Non-Covid healthcare under stress, says AMA president Omar Khorshid

Full text: Dr Khorshid told a Senate committee scrutinising the government’s response to the Covid crisis on Tuesday that non-covid care had clearly deteriorated since the beginning of the pandemic, which would have “significant impacts” for years to come.
“Our health system was not ready for this pandemic, it has done a lot of preparation at an acute end but we haven’t prepared it to deal with routine healthcare while dealing with Covid healthcare,” he said.
Dr Khorshid said Australia should be aiming for the highest possible vaccination rates, declaring he was very concerned that as the nation opens up “the cracks will widen”.
“We face very significant impacts particularly if we open up too fast or go too far acting ahead of vaccination rates … we should be easing out cautiously, slowly and looking at results before moving to the next phase of opening up.”
Dr Khorshid said 12-15 year olds who want to be vaccinated should be offered a jab before any substantial easing of restrictions in the months ahead.
However he noted the Doherty Institute modelling indicated there wasn’t a lot of difference between health outcomes if children were or weren’t included in the 70 to 80 per cent vaccination targets.
Former Deputy Chief Health Officer Nick Coatsworth told the committee it was time for “cautious optimism” and that he was most worried about states that had experienced minimal covid would prevent the country from moving forward.
He cautioned Australia was in a very different position this year compared to 2020.
“It’s time to inject a little more optimism,” he said. “Covid was a disease that was terribly scary in 2020, and it remains scary, but moving forward we can develop a lot of confidence.”
“The states like Queensland and Western Australia, South Australia, the Northern Territory, that don’t have Covid, sort of look towards the states that have Covid with a significant amount of fear and you can understand that, because they haven’t seen it,” he said.
“It’s almost as though you have to have Covid circulating in your community to get used to it, really. We don’t want to see huge amounts of that, and morbidity associated with it, but nor do we want to make our policy decisions based on the reality of 2020, not the reality of 2021.”
Mary Louise McLaws said the government should take heed of the experience of countries like Singapore and Israel where children infection rates increased after restrictions eased and vaccinate as many young Australians as possible.
She said issues resulting from delays to the rollout had been exacerbated by the Delta strain as young people, who had only recently been given access to vaccines, were those that would spread it.
“What we should have had but didn’t have was enough vaccine to roll it out to those who were going to acquire it and spread it and that’s definitely the 20-39 (age group),” she said.

Models and road maps vary wildly as virus keeps us guessing

Full text: Has any modelling put forward by scientific institutes throughout the pandemic ever proved accurate? That may well be the question members of the public would be asking themselves after reading of many scary estimates of cases numbers, deaths and hospitalisations that do not come to pass.
At the beginning of August, the Burnet Institute, which has been commissioned by the NSW and Victorian governments to provide modelling to inform their road maps for opening up, was predicting there would be 7000 cases a day in NSW. The number ended up being only about 1200 a day.
Now the Burnet Institute is predicting a peak seven-day average of 4543 cases in Victoria come January and somewhere between 1455 and 3152 deaths between September and the end of December.
How can that be when NSW, whose cases so far have peaked at about 1500 infections a day, has ­recorded only 245 deaths so far during its Delta wave?
One explanation has now emerged for why Burnet’s case and fatality estimates for Victoria are so high. In its estimate of deaths, Burnet made an assumption that the death rate from Delta is double that of the original strain of the virus. It may prove to be the case, but it has yet been established by the available evidence worldwide.
Burnet’s case projections were also based on the rate of the exponential rise in cases during the past few weeks, whereas the rise in cases has already begun to slow.
Based on these factors, Tony Blakely, whose School of Population and Global Health at the University of Melbourne has just released some new modelling of its own, believes Burnet’s estimates of cases and fatalities are too high.
“The modelling is really good, but I think the estimates are too high,” he said. “They use that two-fold higher mortality and morbidity rate. They may well be correct on that, I don’t know yet, but I’m pretty confident that we’ll improve our treatments, and even if it is two-fold higher without those new treatments, the mortality rate will go back to something like it used to be.” The Burnet Institute predicts that there is a 58 per cent chance that Covid-19 cases in Victoria will exceed the state’s hospital and ICU capacity. It predicts ICU cases to peak at 706, with a peak of 3150 hospitalisations.
The model predicts that based on the current epidemic growth rate, a peak in seven-day average daily diagnoses of 1400 to 2900 is estimated to occur between October 19 and 31, and there will be a second peak in mid-December.
Professor Blakely’s modelling predicts that under a default scenario of 80 per cent vaccine coverage of people aged over 16, there would be 320 infections per day, 4000 hospitalisations, 860 ICU admissions and 1000 deaths over the course of 2022.
However, if 80 per cent of people over the age of five years were vaccinated, there would only be 64 infections a day and 250 deaths. And if vaccination coverage was 90 per cent, of all children and adults, Covid-19 hospitalisations would be slashed by 80 per cent.
“The key headline of this model is basically 2022 will be better; it will be OK (but) it’s not going to be brilliant,” Professor Blakely said.
“Our current toolkits are enough to scape by on next year, but we really need to innovate and do some of these things like better ventilation that actually reduces the reproductive rate of the virus.” In NSW, Premier Gladys Berejiklian warned on Monday that ­although the state recorded its lowest daily figure since late August, with 935 new local infections, cases would explode once restrictions were relaxed.
“We have to accept that once we start reopening, cases will go through the roof but it won’t matter as much because people will be vaccinated,” she said.
October is expected to be the worst month for NSW’s healthcare system, with hospitals “technically overwhelmed”.
NSW modelling predicts that between 2200 and 3900 people will be hospitalised at the peak.
NSW has not released estimates of deaths from Covid-19 over the coming months. The Doherty Institute NSW’s plan to ease restrictions at 70 per cent vaccination was consistent with its new modelling, which recommends cases are kept suppressed until 80 per cent vaccination is achieved. Epidemiologist Jodie McVernon said that while the original Doherty modelling – which projected case numbers from a base of only about 30 cases a day – was “robust”, adjusting the modelling based on there initially being thousands of cases a day resulted in higher projected case numbers.

Based on these factors, Tony Blakely, whose School of Population and Global Health at the University of Melbourne has just released some new modelling of its own, believes Burnet’s estimates of cases and fatalities are too high.
“The modelling is really good, but I think the estimates are too high,” he said. “They use that two-fold higher mortality and morbidity rate. They may well be correct on that, I don’t know yet, but I’m pretty confident that we’ll improve our treatments, and even if it is two-fold higher without those new treatments, the mortality rate will go back to something like it used to be.” The Burnet Institute predicts that there is a 58 per cent chance that Covid-19 cases in Victoria will exceed the state’s hospital and ICU capacity. It predicts ICU cases to peak at 706, with a peak of 3150 hospitalisations.
The model predicts that based on the current epidemic growth rate, a peak in seven-day average daily diagnoses of 1400 to 2900 is estimated to occur between October 19 and 31, and there will be a second peak in mid-December.
Professor Blakely’s modelling predicts that under a default scenario of 80 per cent vaccine coverage of people aged over 16, there would be 320 infections per day, 4000 hospitalisations, 860 ICU admissions and 1000 deaths over the course of 2022.
However, if 80 per cent of people over the age of five years were vaccinated, there would only be 64 infections a day and 250 deaths. And if vaccination coverage was 90 per cent, of all children and adults, Covid-19 hospitalisations would be slashed by 80 per cent.
“The key headline of this model is basically 2022 will be better; it will be OK (but) it’s not going to be brilliant,” Professor Blakely said.
“Our current toolkits are enough to scape by on next year, but we really need to innovate and do some of these things like better ventilation that actually reduces the reproductive rate of the virus.” In NSW, Premier Gladys Berejiklian warned on Monday that ­although the state recorded its lowest daily figure since late August, with 935 new local infections, cases would explode once restrictions were relaxed.
“We have to accept that once we start reopening, cases will go through the roof but it won’t matter as much because people will be vaccinated,” she said.
October is expected to be the worst month for NSW’s healthcare system, with hospitals “technically overwhelmed”.
NSW modelling predicts that between 2200 and 3900 people will be hospitalised at the peak.
NSW has not released estimates of deaths from Covid-19 over the coming months. The Doherty Institute NSW’s plan to ease restrictions at 70 per cent vaccination was consistent with its new modelling, which recommends cases are kept suppressed until 80 per cent vaccination is achieved. Epidemiologist Jodie McVernon said that while the original Doherty modelling – which projected case numbers from a base of only about 30 cases a day – was “robust”, adjusting the modelling based on there initially being thousands of cases a day resulted in higher projected case numbers.

Full text: At the beginning of August, the Burnet Institute, which has been commissioned by the NSW and Victorian governments to provide modelling to inform their road maps for opening up, was predicting there would be 7000 cases a day in NSW. The number ended up being only about 1200 a day.
Now the Burnet Institute is predicting a peak seven-day average of 4543 cases in Victoria come January and somewhere between 1455 and 3152 deaths between September and the end of December.
How can that be when NSW, whose cases so far have peaked at about 1500 infections a day, has ­recorded only 245 deaths so far during its Delta wave?
One explanation has now emerged for why Burnet’s case and fatality estimates for Victoria are so high. In its estimate of deaths, Burnet made an assumption that the death rate from Delta is double that of the original strain of the virus. It may prove to be the case, but it has yet been established by the available evidence worldwide.
Burnet’s case projections were also based on the rate of the exponential rise in cases during the past few weeks, whereas the rise in cases has already begun to slow.
Based on these factors, Tony Blakely, whose School of Population and Global Health at the University of Melbourne has just released some new modelling of its own, believes Burnet’s estimates of cases and fatalities are too high.
“The modelling is really good, but I think the estimates are too high,” he said. “They use that two-fold higher mortality and morbidity rate. They may well be correct on that, I don’t know yet, but I’m pretty confident that we’ll improve our treatments, and even if it is two-fold higher without those new treatments, the mortality rate will go back to something like it used to be.”

Covid modelling behind our roadmap out of lockdown explained

Full text: The state government released its roadmap out of lockdown on Sunday, based off Burnet Institute modelling, which considers four scenarios and how each would impact the daily case numbers, hospitalisation rates and ICU admissions and deaths.
We asked leading health experts to explain what each scenario means.

STAY IN LOCKDOWN If we remain in lockdown, Covid cases in Victoria will continue to rise.
The modelling shows we will hit our peak seven-day average of 1960 (or between 1359 to 2938 cases) on October 25.
Hospital and ICU demand is expected to reach 1200-2500 and 260-550 admissions respectively, with 24 per cent of simulations resulting in hospital demand exceeding 2500 beds.
It’s estimated the total number of deaths would be 964, or between 669 and 1426.
Burnet Professor Margaret Hellard said lockdowns weren’t a viable way of moving forward — and things were expected to open up.
NED-4595-Modelling-outcomes-NEW-DIAGNOSES
NED-4595-Modelling-outcomes-HOSPITALISATION

FOLLOW ROADMAP Once we reach 80 per cent of the eligible population double jabbed, we’ll still see high hospital admissions.
The seven-day average of daily Covid cases will rise significantly in late October and early November, and peak at 4543 in mid-December.
The number of hospital and ICU admissions would double (compared to figures if we remained in lockdown) — with 63 per cent of modelling simulations exceeding 2500 hospital demand. Total number of deaths would reach 2202.
Professor Hellard said cases were always scheduled to increase.
“We have an outbreak happening. As you set along the roadmap, because the cases are high there is a real risk the cases will increase,” she said.
“That’s why it’s critically important that everyone does the little bits they can to stop transmission now.”
“The less cases we have over the next two to four weeks, when we hit 70 per cent and 80 per cent fully vaccinated rates, the better our ability to control it and in essence, do good work to break the model.”

ROADMAP WITH MORE TESTS If fully vaccinated Victorians were to get tested at the first sign of illness, this would drive down hospital admission rates, according to modelling.
Burnet Professor Margaret Hellard said this was hard to achieve in practice.
“We know not everyone who has symptoms gets a test,” she said.
“(In the modelling) you try and factor what level of compliance you will get for restrictions and make that as reflective of reality as possible.”
While this scenario relies on individuals taking the initiative to get tested as soon as they develop symptoms, Professor Hellard said introducing regular mandatory tests for the fully vaccinated wouldn’t help drive case or hospitalisation rates down.
Deakin University Epidemiology chair Professor Catherine Bennett said a combination of symptomatic testing and screen-based event or workplace testing may be the way forward.
“If vaccinated people get symptoms, even mild symptoms, and get tested, then that’s a better outcome than making everyone whose fully vaccinated get testing. You can’t keep getting everyone tested,” she said.
NED-4595-Modelling-outcomes-ICU-DEMAND
NED-4595-Modelling-outcomes-CUMULATIVE-DEATHS

ROADMAP WITH 15 PER CENT REDUCTION IN NON-HOUSEHOLD TRANSMISSION This scenario predicts a drop in case numbers and hospital admission rates — far greater than if we remained in lockdown — as long as the majority of Victorians obey Covid restrictions.
That is, everyone gets tested when they first show symptoms and isolate until they receive their results.
This would result in a seven-day average of 1708 daily Covid cases (peaking on 26 November).
Burnet Professor Margaret Hellard said this scenario relied on a number of factors.
“The 15 per cent improvement leads to a better outcome for all of us,” she said.
“Get vaccinated as fast as possible, if you have symptoms get tested, stay at home and follow the restrictions, if you’re going to see friends do so outdoors.”
“The more we can do now means that road ahead is a better road.”
NED-4592-projected-effect-of-easing-restrictions

WHAT DOES THIS ALL MEAN? Professor Catherine Bennett said the modelling wasn’t set in stone and could be shaped by our behaviour in the coming weeks.
“If our vaccination rates are high and people are complying with the rules, then these are the ways you beat the model,” Professor Bennett said.
“If we all do the right thing, we can make those rules pay as much as we can.”
“Because we are still in lockdown, you get better value for effort. The more we can use lockdown to full effect, the better.”
Professor Bennett said if Victoria’s Covid reproductive rate was remaining steady at a 1.2 average and if lowered in next four weeks, then we’d beat the modelling.

National cabinet considers updated plan for Australia’s reopening with a major change

Full text: The new analysis warns the “importation of the Delta variant into every Australian jurisdiction is now inevitable”, but says restrictions including stay-at-home orders and travel bans should remain in areas of concern even when 70 per cent of the eligible population is vaccinated.
Under the Doherty Institute’s four-phase reopening plan, Australia will begin a staggered reopening once 70 per cent of people aged over 16 are fully vaccinated, with more freedoms including international travel to be introduced once 80 per cent have been double-dosed.
The state and territory leaders agreed to the original plan in early August, but have since fallen into fiery disagreement over whether the country should reopen amid outbreaks in the eastern states, which currently number almost 20,000 active cases in total.
NSW recorded 1284 cases on Friday, while Victoria confirmed 510 new infections and the ACT 30.
NSW Premier Gladys Berejiklian has committed to reinstating many freedoms to millions of locked down residents next month when the state hits its 70 per cent double dose target, while Victorian Premier Daniel Andrews is expected to announce his own road map out of lockdown on Sunday.
But states with no or few Covid-19 cases have taken a different stance, with West Australian Premier Mark McGowan and Queensland Premier Annastacia Palaszczuk reluctant to reopen their borders to states with high caseloads.
Doherty sensitivity analysis of its own modelling, presented to the national cabinet on Friday, found the highly infectious Delta variant could be managed at vaccination rates of 70 per cent and 80 per cent even if an outbreak started with hundreds or thousands of cases.
These targets will need to be combined with appropriate test, trace, isolate and quarantine practices, and public health and social measures to control transmission and manage capacity of the health system.
If this is achieved, the Doherty modelling expects overall case numbers and deaths to be similar to seasonal influenza.
But the institute said medium restrictions would “improve outcomes” between the 70 per cent and 80 per cent threshold in places where daily case numbers were in the thousands, because the ability to effectively test, trace and isolate was compromised.
The “medium” measures it outlines include staying at home except for work, study and essential purposes, allowing seated dining for small groups at hospitality venues but with capacity limits to small groups outdoors.
The Morrison government expects the transition from 70 per cent to 80 per cent double-dose to take about two weeks given the current pace of the rollout.
Australia on Friday tipped over 70 per cent of the eligible population vaccinated with at least one dose of a Covid-19 vaccine, with 45.3 per cent fully inoculated.
More than 1.9 million vaccines have been administered in Australia in the past seven days.
The first doses of the Moderna vaccine are set to arrive in the country on Friday night and will be rolled out from next week.

Full text: It seems like every time there is a light at the end of the tunnel, along comes a rump of like-minded experts who think only in worst case scenarios to tell us that it is in fact an oncoming train.
Australia, meet OzSAGE, which this week put itself forward as the umbrella group for the Covid alarmist wing of the country’s scientific community.
OzSAGE made its debut in a sympathetic press that seems addicted to bad news by trotting out their prediction that the nation’s two-stage, 70-then-80 per cent reopening plan will be a double-barrelled disaster, and that NSW’s hospitals will be “overwhelmed by Christmas” if in five weeks fully vaccinated Sydneysiders are allowed back to the pub.
If the name rings a bell, it’s because OzSAGE is modelled on the UK’s own Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies.
The UK’s SAGE was led by Professor Neil Ferguson, who famously used dodgy modelling to scare the nation into believing that Covid-19 would kill 550,000 Britons before being forced to resign when it came out that he was breaching lockdown rules to meet his married lover.
While not having the government imprimatur of the UK’s SAGE, OzSAGE clearly wants to be taken just as seriously.
Their website attempts to make them come off as sober and reasonable and not at all extreme.
Dissect it more closely, though, and the group’s manifesto relies on a deep belief in the precautionary principle and a puritanical obsession with crushing Covid that sees personal liberties left by the wayside.
Elimination, they admit, is their goal, though they redefine it as keeping Covid down to occasional outbreaks rather than living with the virus circulating through a largely vaccinated population.
Opening up the nation under the agreed Doherty framework would be catastrophic, they say, particularly if children are not jabbed – though all available evidence suggests that for otherwise healthy kids, Covid is not a big deal.
NED-3760-NSW’s new Covid restrictions
There is no talk of international borders, though we can assume quarantine camps will be the order of the day for those who do decide to visit or return to OzSAGE’s mask-topia.
OzSAGE is also very big on providing proper ventilation to schools and other public buildings.
Cynics might note that these two policies could provide plenty of opportunities for a future Labor government to turn the pandemic into an infrastructure spending spree. Building the Covid Revolution, anyone?
Of course, things like restaurants, hospitality, tourism, and anything that might count as real life doesn’t seem to get much of a mention. Instead, “normal” life is made the servant of the health system.
The group also calls for “vaccines plus”, saying the current jabs are not sufficient and that we will need to do things like wear masks in public places potentially for years, despite outdoor transmission being negligible. You see where this is going.
So who is behind OzSAGE?
It’s certainly no surprise to find the Kirby Institute’s Raina MacIntyre amid OzSAGE’s number.
One of the loudest restrictionists in the public health world, Prof MacIntyre is on the speed dial of every ABC producer who wants a grab about why we should wear masks outdoors until kingdom come or hold back reopening far beyond the 80% target set by the Doherty Institute.
Prof MacIntyre has been a longstanding believer in eliminating the virus from Australia and was also one of the loudest voices calling for Christmas’ Northern Beaches lockdown to be extended across all of Greater Sydney.
On December 20 of last year, she predicted that “with 100 per cent certainty” Christmas and New Year’s Eve would turn into “the mother of all super-spreading events,” leading to 1000 or more cases per day by the first week of the year.
There are plenty of other OzSAGE names that will be familiar to readers including Dr Tony Blakely, who just two weeks ago was on The Project – where Lisa Wilkinson recently led the cheers for tighter lockdowns – saying Gladys Berejiklian’s plan to re-open NSW was “overpromising completely”.
But OzSAGE’s scary stories only make sense if you spend too much time with the other six per cent of Australia that regularly uses Twitter, where the group’s members find a ready echo chamber for their stories about “long Covid” in children and attempts to drag the goalposts for reopening out to kingdom come.
Happily other experts in the field are speaking up about the group, with epidemiologist Peter Collignon saying Wednesday: “We need to be very careful in accepting these dire predictions. Just look at what some of these people predicted over the last year or more about Covid spread and deaths in Australia.”
The fact is, most of the rest of the world is learning to accept that Covid cases and, yes, some deaths, are now a part of life, and can be without overwhelming the health care system.
In New York this week unmasked celebrities and politicians partied at the Met Ball, in a city whose eight million people are sitting at about 60 per cent fully vaccinated.
There, bars and restaurants are pumping, a vaccine passport is anecdotally semi-enforced, and they are managing to cope with a wave of Covid infections that has already seen the link between cases and deaths all but broken.
It’s the same across much of the world. Denmark has declared the disease will no longer be considered an emergency, and even Ireland – which led as grim a campaign against Covid as Australia – is opening up.
Unlike OzSAGE, they realise that eliminating Covid must be balanced against lost schooling, mental health, destroyed businesses, and the simple fact that it is cruel and counter-productive to keep people locked up through summer when outside is the safest place to be.

Full text: The professor behind a model provided to the West Australian government that predicted scores of coronavirus deaths in that state if restrictions were relaxed too soon says the Doherty Institute modelling on which the national reopening plan is based is "perhaps too optimistic".
University of Western Australia Professor George Milne's modelling, given to the WA Department of Health a fortnight ago, paints a far more pessimistic picture about what will happen when Australia reopens compared to Doherty Institute modelling commissioned for the national cabinet.
The model forecasts 13,390 cases, 1373 hospitalisations and 186 deaths in the six months after WA reopens; big numbers for a state that has recorded just 1088 cases and nine deaths over the entire pandemic.
"It tells you we're going to have lots of people becoming ill, frankly," said Professor Milne, a pioneer of agent-based modelling now based at the University of WA. "Our modelling results suggest we need to be about 85 per cent vaccination coverage."
Under the plan discussed at national cabinet, based on modelling by the Doherty Institute, states will begin relaxing lockdowns and restrictions when 70 per cent of the population is vaccinated. Further freedoms will be granted at 80 per cent and beyond.
On Thursday, after weeks of posturing, WA Premier Mark McGowan finally announced his state's border was likely to remain closed until at least February next year. The state will seek to get well above the 80 per cent vaccination mark set for moving into phase C of Prime Minister Scott Morrison's national reopening plan, and wouldn't be opening up until then.
"I suspect that comes from
our documents we produced for them," Professor George Milne told The Age.
"I think the Doherty data is perhaps too optimistic. It does not correlate with what we're finding," he said.
The Doherty Institute's modelling has shaped the entire national conversation on reopening; the federal government's plans rest almost entirely upon it.
However, a range of other models exist: some more optimistic, some more pessimistic.
And the Doherty model's crucial underlying assumptions and mechanisms - the key inputs that vary between models - are yet to be made fully public.
"It's very hard for even people like me to figure out how the assumptions differ. A lot of the values are unknown, a lot of it is kept confidential," said Professor Tom Kompas, a modeller at the University of Melbourne.
"We need a conversation where the models are clear, and the conversations are clear, so we can actually have a debate."
The Doherty Model
The Doherty's model - actually done by more than a dozen modellers across several different institutions - projects if Australia reopens with 80 per cent of adults vaccinated we can expect 275,918 symptomatic infections, 8720 hospitalisations and 980 deaths over the next six months.
Most will be in unvaccinated people; a small fraction will be children. Crucially, it assumes that vaccination rates will continue to rise past 80 per cent after reopening.
The model does not project beyond six months. Some projections, including daily new infections, continue to rise beyond the cut-off point - leaving the peak unclear.
"The next report will address your initial questions," a spokeswoman for the Doherty Institute said. "The team has said it's a logical conclusion that scenarios that take 180 days to peak will do so at a far lower level than more rapidly growing scenarios."
The Doherty's model assumes many virus-control measures will stay in place. It also assumes each person infected with the Delta strain of the virus will pass it on to 3.6 other people on average.
This number is much lower than other models assume - some go as high as eight - but the authors argue it is based on real-world data from NSW in March when few social restrictions were in place.
Crucially, for the Doherty's projections to be met, contact tracing needs to operate about as well as it did in Victoria at the peak of its second wave. Authorities yesterday said they were still contacting more than 99 per cent of positive cases within 24 hours of their test result as case numbers hit 392.
The Doherty projections did not model a contact tracing system entirely overwhelmed by extremely high caseloads, said Dr Stephen Duckett, who has developed his own modelling at the Grattan Institute.
The model also assumes we will not vaccinate children - and that they play almost no role in spreading the virus.
This may explain why Professor Milne's model is so much more pessimistic: it assumes children play a major role in spreading COVID-19.
Beyond that, independent modellers say, the Doherty's model is hard to critique - because the key mechanisms have not been made public, nor has it been peer reviewed.
"No one, let alone 25 million, people should be taking much notice of a model that does not meet this standard," said Professor Emma McBryde, a modeller based at the Australian Institute of Tropical Health and Medicine.
Alternative futures
The most optimistic projections come from models built by the Grattan Institute and the University of Melbourne.
The Grattan Institute projects about 2000 deaths nationwide over 300 days if we reopen with 80 per cent vaccinated.
Soon-to-be-released University of Melbourne modelling, provided to The Age, projects between 390 and 1400 deaths in Australia over 12 months.
"This is much less than any comparable numbers in the Doherty Report - because we model policy dynamically. And here is the price to pay - this scenario also has us in soft or hard lockdown 41 per cent of the time to keep the numbers in check," says Professor Tony Blakely, the epidemiologist who led the modelling.
Then there are two models drawing attention for projecting very high death tolls.
Modelling led by James Cook University projects 8 million cases and 12,500 deaths. Australian National University modelling produces a headline-grabbing figure: 50,000 deaths.
However, these models are very unlike the Doherty's.
The James Cook model looks at how many people will be infected over the course of the epidemic; it concludes that 85 per cent of the unvaccinated will be infected if we open up at 80 per cent vaccinated.
The ANU's is even simpler. It asks: if we relaxed all restrictions and exposed everyone in Australia to COVID-19, what would happen?
This is how such high numbers are produced.
Both models also assume vaccination never rises above 80 per cent, and children under 15 are unvaccinated.
These models are not realistic for the next six months, their authors admit. But they do point toward the long-term consequences of reopening with 80 per cent vaccination rates - leaving 4.1 million adults unvaccinated - and allowing the virus to circulate: unless we can continue to push vaccination rates up, many unvaccinated people will fall sick and die.

Full text: Tradies will be given priority access to Covid vaccines over the next fortnight, with operating hours extended and walk-ins open at major jab hubs.
Around 20,000 further priority Pfizer appointments will made available to construction workers statewide.
Over the next fortnight, the Ford Campbellfield site, Heidelberg Repatriation Hospital, Wyndham Eagle Stadium, and the former Bunnings in Melton will open for walk-ups for construction workers from 8am until 11am.
AstraZeneca walk-ups will also be available for construction workers at the Melbourne Convention and Exhibition Centre each afternoon from 3pm.
Expanded hours for walk-ups will also begin at the Ford Campbellfield and Heidelberg Repatriation Hospital vaccine clinics between 5pm and 8pm.
The Wyndham and Melton sites will open for walk-ups between 5pm and 6pm on Thursdays and Fridays.
Priority bookings can be made on the coronavirus hotline at 1800 675 398.
The announcement came after Premier Daniel Andrews announced 100 vaccine priority postcodes across the state, with pop-ups centres to be set up in a bid to accelerate jab rates.
Health authorities are targeting the construction industry after an alarming number of cases linked to the sector.
Covid testing boss Jeroen Weimar on Monday called out tearooms as the “most dangerous place” to spread the virus.
Mr Weimar said transmission had occurred in tearooms in both the V/Line rail network and construction industry.
“It’s probably where we drop our guards and physically drop masks to eat and drink and where we see people in the workplace,” he said.
“Tearooms for many of us at work are the most dangerous of everything you do in that environment and I’d ask that you minimise your time there.”Vic Locally-acquired Covid-19
A four-week blitz is also being launched to ensure the industry complies with coronavirus rules.
Authorities are concerned some sites aren’t following Covid-safe protocols, leading to a massive virus spread within the industry.
Treasurer Tim Pallas put the industry on notice, saying it was in a precarious position.
“What we’re seeing is that the average construction worker, the outbreak case, lives basically about 20km away from the original outbreak site, compared to what we’re seeing with the average 4km for outbreaks connected, for example, to supermarkets,” he said.
“The majority of the construction industry is doing the right thing. But, we all know and we’ve all talked to people who have expressed concerns about examples they’ve come across in this industry where the right thing is not being done.”NED-4476-Covid-19-Vaccine-Rates-Melbourne
It comes as Victoria announced 473 new Covid cases on Monday, with just 202 of those linked to existing outbreaks, bringing the total number of active cases across the state to 3507.
It’s the biggest daily increase since Victoria’s worst day on August 5 last year, when 725 cases were announced.
Health Minister Martin Foley revealed a dire Covid-19 statistic for young Victorians, saying 87 per cent of the state’s active cases were under the age of 50, including 585 people aged 19 or younger.
“This continues to be a pandemic of the young and the unvaccinated,” he said.
More than 30,000 Victorians received a Covid vaccine on Sunday.
The state is poised to hit a vaccine milestone, with 66.2 per cent of eligible Victorians receiving their first dose as of Sunday. The state needs to deliver just 22,797 more doses to hit 70 per cent.
Currently, 40.8 per cent of eligible Victorians have received two doses of the jab.
Eased restrictions at 70pc vaccinated

WHERE LATEST CASES WERE FOUND Of the 474 infections announced on Monday:
• 338 cases were in Melbourne’s northern suburbs including Craigieburn, Roxburgh Park Meadow Heights, Broadmeadows and Glenroy;
• 97 cases in the western suburbs including in Truganina, Altona North, and Tarneit;
• 23 cases in the southeastern suburbs including Casey, Cardinia, Dandenong, Berwick and Clayton;
• Nine cases in the eastern suburbs including Doncaster East and Ferntree Gully; and
• Six cases in regional Victoria, with three in Mildura, and three in Geelong.

VIC CAN HANDLE 2000 CASES A DAY One of Australia’s leading epidemiologists believes Victoria could “tolerate” 2000 coronavirus cases a day, but has warned the state faces an uphill battle to flatten the curve in the weeks ahead.
University of Melbourne epidemiologist Tony Blakely said the state’s health system can handle that amount of daily infections, as there should be sufficient vaccination coverage in the community when Victoria’s case numbers reach that figure.
“If you look at New South Wales they are starting to struggle (with their daily case numbers), but we should be able to cope by the time we get to 2000 as we will have more people who are vaccinated,” Professor Blakely said.
“I’d be very nervous to commit to a (figure that is safe) above 2000.”
Professor Blakely called on the state government to have an honest conversation with the public if they intend to ease restrictions in the months ahead.
“The policy settings need to be honest and transparent,” he said.
“If we are going to be opening up, we need to know what that is going to do, this needs to be communicated to the public.”
He said Victoria must be extremely cautious when it eases restrictions – and said the current policy settings should remain in place if the state “can’t turn the curve around” by October.
“I’m really concerned about where we are going with Victoria,” he said.
“We are fighting for dear life to keep the numbers down.”
He called for greater investment in building ventilation and rapid testing, and for high-quality free masks to be distributed in Covid-ravaged areas to contain future outbreaks.

JEWISH LEADERS WANT EXEMPTION Melbourne’s ultra-Orthodox Jewish community has requested an exemption to gather on their holiest day of the year.
Nine Melbourne-based Rabbis and seven medical providers have called on Premier Daniel Andrews to allow them to observe Yom Kippur in person.
It comes after several members of an ultra-Orthodox group were this month fined $5452 each for breaching lockdown rules to hold religious meetings at a Ripponlea synagogue.
Yom Kippur — which begins at sunset on Wednesday — is described as the “holiest day on the Jewish calendar”.

DOG GROOMERS GIVEN GREEN LIGHT TO OPERATE Mobile pet groomers have been given the green light to operate after the health department did a U-turn on its ban.
It comes after animal rights advocates and vets launched calls to overturn the ban, fearing it would lead to an animal welfare crisis.
While vet clinics were permitted to provide grooming services, veterinarians have said it was an added burden they couldn’t manage.
Greencross Chief Vet Dr Magdoline Awad said grooming prevented skin irritations and painful matting which can cut off air flow in dog hair and often leads to more serious issues.
“Many people think grooming is done just for aesthetic reasons, but it’s really something that needs to be undertaken for many animals to reduce pain and prevent serious health conditions,” Dr Awar said.
“When there’s no end to (lockdown) and there’s a huge backlog, it’s so important that animals are seen urgently.”
Dog groomer Penella Etyngold said the demand for her service was at an all-time high.
“Any business can run click and collect but you can’t drop your dog off at the door,” she said.
“I really think the government has no idea about animal welfare. They think (grooming) is something that can be done at home.
“We don’t want to do fluffy, beautiful coats, we want to do buzz cuts, especially as the season is changing.”
Pet grooming mobile services that can be undertaken in a contactless manner, and that operate outdoors where physical distancing can be maintained at all times are able to operate.

BIZZARE RULE CLOSES SOUP KITCHEN FOR HOMELESS A community group is outraged after police ordered it to dismantle its soup kitchen during lockdown and fined one man for not having a worker’s permit.
The Herald Sun believes the Community Union Defence League was told its soup kitchen outside the State Library breached council by-laws on furniture.
Community Union Defence League supervisor Lachlan McCracken said police and council workers told them to remove their tables and marquees outside the State Library on the past two Sundays.
“We serve usually 200 people,” he said.
“We’re there because the community wants us to be.
“We kept running and took down our furniture.”
He said police still didn’t leave them alone and walked past to make sure they didn’t replace their marquee once it started raining.
A video, posted on social media by the CUDL, shows police warning an organiser they were “uncooperative” and need to take down their set-up.
The communist volunteer group’s national representative Joseph Wannous said the policing of soup kitchens was an “unfortunate” but “recurring issue” across the country.
He said they didn’t have a permit from council on principle and because they couldn’t afford the public liability insurance.
“We barely have enough money to buy containers, cups and coffee,” he said.
A City of Melbourne spokeswoman said organisations need to obtain “appropriate permits” to set up infrastructure in public spaces “for community safety”.
“We continue to work closely with community organisations who provide important support to our city’s most vulnerable,” she said.
“It is vitally important that any organisation operating within the municipality does so in line with Activities Local Law 2019.
“We recognise the role that organisations like the Community Union Defence League play in our municipality, and we will continue to work with them to ensure they can deliver their services to the community safely.”
A police spokeswoman said “patrolling police came across a group of people gathered at several marquees in Melbourne’s CBD at 5pm on 5 September”.
“It was determined the group did not have a current council permit and they were asked to remove the marquees, which they eventually did.
“One man was fined for not having a work permit under the current CHO directions.”
They did not comment on any interaction between police and the group on Sunday, September 12.

WEEK’S WAIT FOR LOCKDOWN ROAD MAP Premier Daniel Andrews has promised to detail a reopening plan for Victorians within days.
Amid growing calls for more hope and certainty for Victorian businesses, families and schoolchildren before term 4, Mr Andrews said on Sunday he would release a comprehensive plan “in about a week’s time”.
“That will give people a sense of schools, hospitality, where they can go, who they can visit, all of those things,” he said.
The state government will this week receive more Burnet Institute modelling on the effect of easing restrictions as vaccination targets are hit.
The Premier has previously suggested a very minor easing of Melbourne’s lockdown, including an extension of the 5km travel limit to 10km, when the state hits a 70 per cent single dose vaccination rate – projected to be September 17.
On Sunday, he said that any “road map in that race to 80 per cent” would include caveats based on the number of active cases and people in hospital.
He also said it would include better ventilation at schools and staggered entry times for students, but refused to commit to a term 4 date when students would return to the classroom. It comes as Opposition Leader Matthew Guy called for the government to consider “social interaction bubbles”, allowing small gatherings between families, in time for the AFL grand final on September 25.
“The government has got a couple of weeks now to prepare for it,” he said.
“I hope they do because Victorian families deserve it. They have earnt that.”

FITZROY NORTH SCHOOL UNDER FIRE A private primary school that was operating with around 60 kids during lockdown and has since been the source for a 31-case cluster is set to be investigated by the health department.
The Herald Sun understands Fitzroy Community School in Fitzroy North will be issued with a please-explain and asked to justify why each student was attending face-to-face.
Health department investigators are examining concerns up to 100 people were on site on some days, with 189 close contacts already identified.

DELTA FORCES PRISON LOCKDOWN Hundreds of prisoners have been forced into lockdown after a prisoner brought Covid-19 behind bars.
A prisoner who arrived at the Metropolitan Remand Centre on Friday has tested positive to coronavirus.
It’s the first known case to hit Victoria’s prison system since the highly infectious Delta strain entered the state.

Deoples COVID-19 Victorian Exposure Sites Table

CHILDCARES FORCED TO CLOSE Four Melbourne childcare centres are among the new tier one coronavirus exposure sites identified overnight, forcing children, teachers and parents to isolate for 14 days.
The Little Learners Early Education & Kindergarten in South Morang is listed as an exposure site across various times on September 2, 3, and 6.
A positive coronavirus case also visited the Ilim Learning Sanctuary Glenroy on September 3, and again on September 6, 7 and 8.
Anyone who visited Yarra Childcare Centre between 7am and 5pm on September 2, 3, 6, and 7 is also required to get tested and isolate regardless of the result.
St Catherines Early Learning in Toorak is also listed as a tier one exposure site between 7am and 5pm on September 6.

VIRUS SPREADS TO REGIONS The number of active Covid cases continued to grow on Sunday, seeping into regional Victoria and causing chaos for V/Line, with some services scrapped completely.
Victoria recorded 392 locally acquired cases, a drop from Saturday’s 450; 107 cases were linked to existing outbreaks and the number of active cases rose to 3112.
More than 48,000 tests were processed.
There are 147 Victorians in hospital, including one person who is fully vaccinated; 34 of those are in intensive care and 28 are on ventilators.
Authorities are scrambling to contain the V/Line outbreak, and four workers have tested positive since Friday.
A regional train driver worked for four days while infectious, visiting the Traralgon and Southern Cross depots.
V/Line services were brought to a halt to allow for contact tracing, with buses replacing trains where possible.
Outbreaks in the northern suburbs, home to two-thirds of Sunday’s cases, continued to be of concern.
The vast majority of new cases were in Hume with 137, as well as 49 in Moreland and 42 in Whittlesea.
About a quarter of the cases came from the western suburbs including 30 in Wyndham, 19 in Hobsons Bay and 13 in Brimbank.
Worryingly, regional Victoria reported five cases, including one in Greater Geelong, one in Mildura, two in Gippsland and one in the Macedon Ranges – linked to the V/Line cluster.
Deputy chief health officer Dan O’Brien identified the Fitzroy Community School in North Fitzroy as the most “significant emerging outbreak” involving at least 30 staff and students.

PM, TREASURER BACK GRAND FINAL VAX HUB IDEA Scott Morrison and Josh Frydenberg have joined a host of footy legends in backing a special vaccination hub to give Victorians a “jab at the ’G”.
But the state and federal governments are still working on how to turn the MCG into a vaccination site that could be used on the grand final public holiday and the day of the game.
Victorian Covid response deputy secretary Naomi Bromley said the initiative – proposed by a Sunday Herald Sun campaign – would be a “lovely thing to do” and was “certainly one of the options on the table” as the state’s rollout expanded.
National – 2021 – Covid Vaccination StatsDaniel Andrews said there was “no shortage of ideas” to bolster the program, although the Premier warned the government did not have “unlimited resources”.
“Our priority is to take the vaccination program where the cases are,” Mr Andrews said.
The federal Treasurer told the Herald Sun: “Any opportunity to drive a faster and greater take-up of vaccines using the iconic MCG is not only welcome but would be kicking a goal for Victoria.”
“We would be pleased to assist the state government if they were to support this initiative,” Mr Frydenberg said.

THE 100 PRIORITY POSTCODES TARGETED IN JAB BLITZ Pop-up vaccination centres will be set up at schools, council buildings and places of worship across 100 priority postcodes as Victoria’s vaccination race is accelerated with a massive supply injection.
The federal government is sending an extra 417,000 Pfizer and Moderna doses to Victoria over the next three weeks in a blitz aimed at the northern and western suburbs, where case numbers are soaring amid lower vaccination rates.

CLUBS APPROACHING ‘FINANCIAL CLIFF’ Clubs at the heart of regional communities are warning of thousands of job losses from density limits for their venues, with 44 per cent approaching a “financial cliff” within three months if they cannot bring more people in.
The Andrews government is being urged to rethink the current capacity limits outside Melbourne for clubs, which allow just 10 visitors indoors and 20 outdoors. Community Clubs Victoria believes a fraction of its venues plan to reopen under the rules and that the restrictions are putting them in a perilous financial position.
A survey of members showed 44 per cent would be in dire straits within the next 12 weeks unless they were allowed at least 100 patrons inside.
Chief executive Andrew Lloyd said venues with more space needed bigger capacities and a path to plan for their future.
Staff shortages are also a major concern, with 40 per cent of clubs saying they will not be able to open fully because workers have left for better job security.
Those with permanent staff may be forced into redundancies because they cannot sustain paying them for a full working week under limited numbers.
Mr Lloyd said many community clubs had bigger spaces than cafes or restaurants and could safely operate.
Warragul Social Club general manager Jenny Smith said they would open under limited numbers but this would be extremely difficult.
“Running costs are going to blow out to the extreme,” she said. “We support the community, we sponsor sporting groups and non-profit charities with the regions … Clubs are important parts of the community.
“We understand the government are trying their best but we just need to get capacities lifted.”
A government spokesman on Sunday evening said: “Like every decision we’ve made since the beginning of the pandemic, density limits in place in regional Victoria are based on public health advice.”

Full text: Premier Gladys Berejiklian has unveiled her government’s highly anticipated roadmap out of lockdown, which will allow home visits and a reopening of hospitality and retail venues.
People who are fully vaccinated will be able to dine out at restaurants, drink beers at the pub, get their hair cut, train at the gym and visit friends and family.
Masks will remain mandatory indoors.
These and other new freedoms will kick in once the state achieves its double dose target for 70 per cent of people aged over 16, which is anticipated in mid-October.
Some large regional areas have already emerged from lockdown.
In Sydney and other parts of the state, millions of people who have spent months indoors will spend the next five to six weeks relishing the prospect of freedom.
But not everyone is happy about it.
The gravest warning came from the Australian Medical Association, who accused the Berejiklian government of cherrypicking expert advice.
“We already know it is beyond the capacity of the NSW health system to effectively trace contacts of many hundreds of cases a day,” AMA president Omar Khorshid said.
The AMA said an impending hospital crisis could deepen if the reopening plan was predicated on vaccination rates alone, ignoring soaring case numbers.
The doctors’ lobby group even warned the state would be at considerable risk of having to lock down again if restrictions were scrapped “too fast and too soon”.
NSW confirmed a record 1542 new infections on Friday, taking the total number of cases to 34,804 since the Delta outbreak began in June.
There have been 1156 Covid-19 cases admitted to hospital, with 207 people in intensive care, 89 of whom are on ventilators.
The state’s hospitals are bracing for a huge spike in ICU patients, which is likely to hit around the same time NSW reopens and could persist until December.
Modelling released earlier this month showed hospitalisations would peak around the end of October and put “overwhelming” pressure on intensive care.
Sydney’s healthcare workers have warned they are already under immense strain, with some hospitals forced to turn Covid-19 patients away because of a lack of beds.
Alan O’Riordan, assistant secretary of the Australian Paramedics Association NSW, said he had fears and reservations about an “abrupt” reopening.
“It’s not taking into account the potential bed crisis that will exist. We are going to have a shortage of ambulances on the roads,” he told NCA NewsWire.
“I am very fearful of what’s ahead. We’ll have a population that’s been cooped up for at least 16 weeks. They want to get out and see the outdoors again.
“It’s totally understandable but with that you have onset of trauma, other medical conditions, with Covid-19 sitting on top of it I’m not sure how our emergency departments and our hospitals are going to function.”
Deputy Premier John Barilaro, the self-described “architect” of the reopening plan, said the government expected case numbers to peak in the next fortnight.
“We’ll see case numbers come down well before we open,” he said.
“But there will still be case numbers and we’ve left in the roadmap the opportunity for health, if we believe that there are areas of concern, that we will still possibly put in place some suppression measures.”
Mr Barilaro said his roadmap had the support of NSW Health and of chief health officer Dr Kerry Chant and her team.
But the premier and other senior ministers reportedly overruled health officials, who advised the state should reopen when vaccination levels were closer to 85 per cent.
Ms Berejiklian has refuted the report and announced she will no longer hold her daily 11am press conferences from next week.
NSW Ambulance Commissioner Dominic Morgan said extra resources were being deployed to the regions to help smaller hospitals cope with potential outbreaks.
“The risk that they could be overwhelmed by comparatively smaller numbers of Covid-19 patients being really unwell is much higher,” he said.
When restrictions are eased next month, trips to regional NSW will be permitted again, meaning communities with no Covid-19 cases could face the virus for the first time.
The ongoing outbreak in western NSW has shone a spotlight on the state’s regional healthcare crisis, which is being examined by a parliamentary inquiry.
Hospitals in the central west that were already struggling with resourcing have had to fight Covid-19 with dozens of staff in isolation after being deemed close contacts.
NSW opposition health spokesman Ryan Park said the time was coming to ease restrictions but he was concerned about overstretched rural hospitals.
“It will put an enormous pressure on those if there are increased Covid-19 cases,” he told NCA NewsWire.
He said the government needed to ensure there were enough vaccines for rural NSW, with the state’s reopening based on a 70 per cent overall inoculation rate that could leave some communities vulnerable.
Port Stephens MP Kate Washington echoed similar concerns, saying many people in her electorate were struggling to book Pfizer vaccine appointments.
“In areas like mine we are going to see a tsunami of Sydneysiders come to our area,” she told NCA Newswire.
“You could have 100 per cent of the north shore with a double dose and areas in regional NSW sitting far lower than 70 per cent.”
Labor has also called for certainty around Sydney’s Covid-19 hot spot local government areas, whose residents have endured the toughest restrictions of anyone in the state.
The Berejiklian government’s reopening plan comes with the caveat that areas with high numbers of cases could be subject to further restrictions.
The retail and hospitality sectors, meanwhile, face their own challenges.
In order to reopen, all staff and patrons must be fully vaccinated.
The policing of whether or not customers have had two jabs is likely to fall to businesses, with fears this will place an unfair burden on staff.
Customers are expected to use a “vaccine passport” through the Service NSW app when they check into a premises with a QR code.
The NSW government has promised a trial of the technology before it is rolled out across the state, but the details are yet to be revealed.
Australian Hotels Association NSW director John Green said the scheme needed to be seamless by the reopening date.
“There’s always teething problems when a new process gets rolled out and that’s why we’ve indicated that we’re supportive of any pilot or trial,” he told NCA NewsWire.
“Our staff and licensees are really looking forward to being able to get back open again. They’re champing at the bit. We’re very keen to get back on the tools.
“We just need people to understand that we’re operating under government conditions and be a bit patient with our staff.”
More than 42 per cent of NSW residents are now fully vaccinated, with the state on track to hit 80 per cent single doses on Monday.
University of Sydney epidemiologist Stephen Leeder said the reopening plan was a “brave move” and would be an experiment.
“It’s reasonable on the available evidence to try it as an experiment and be ready to change our course or do other things if the evidence suggests it’s not the right way to go,” he told NCA NewsWire.
“Right from the start with Covid-19 we’ve been in new territory. It’s a bit like landing on Mars.”
Professor Leeder, an emeritus professor of public health and community medicine, said the government would need to keep a close eye on the state’s hospitals.
“Sitting back and waiting until the whole thing blows up is not an option,” he said.
“We need a sophisticated view of what the demand on the health system will be, it’s not just a matter of beds and ventilators, fundamentally it’s a matter of staff.”
Other public health experts have raised concerns that the reopening plan appears to be focused on business interests rather than the healthcare system.
When the state hits the 80 per cent double dose target, the Berejiklian government intends to open up further freedoms around international travel, community sport, and major events.
The warnings come as Sydney prepares to enter its 12th week of lockdown.

Full text: Gladys Berejiklian’s government ignored a key detail in the virus modelling it used to plan the state’s reopening, according to the Australian Medical Association.
It said the Doherty Institute modelling the Premier relied on had warned restrictions should not be eased until case numbers are so low that contact tracers can manage them.
“Unfortunately, (Thursday’s) plan appears to leave NSW at considerable risk of having to return to lockdowns,” AMA president Omar Khorshid said.
NSW hospitals are currently bracing for a huge spike in ICU patients, which is likely to hit around the same time NSW would open up and could persist until December.
Modelling released earlier this month by the state government and prepared by the Burnet Institute showed hospitalisations will peak around the end of October and put “overwhelming” pressure on the intensive care system.
The late-October crisis would be a result of an expected peak in Covid-19 cases in the coming weeks.
But the AMA said the Burnet analysis was based on restrictions remaining as they are. That means the current hospital crisis could last longer and get more severe if restrictions for fully vaccinated are eased without a dramatic drop in cases.
“The Burnet analysis shows that NSW is likely to ease restrictions at a time when there will still be more than 500 infections each day and with the health system under considerable stress,” Dr Khorshid said.
“We already know it is beyond the capacity of the NSW health system to effectively trace contacts of many hundreds of cases a day.”
He called on the government to be transparent with the modelling it used to justify the reopening plan.
“NSW needs to release the modelling it has used to inform (Thursday’s) changes to either reassure the community that infection numbers will continue to come down to manageable levels or give the community an honest assessment of their impact on the health system,” he said.
NSW plans to scrap a whole range of restrictions for the fully vaccinated once that cohort makes up 70 per cent of the state’s population.
That’s projected to occur on October 18. The government said it would ease the restrictions on the Monday after the target is reached, meaning it could happen either on October 18 or the following Monday.
“We all want to get back to normal but moving too fast too soon risks everything we have already sacrificed,” AMA NSW president Danielle McMullen said.
The current coronavirus outbreak in NSW has infected more than 33,000 people and contributed to the deaths of 153 people.

Burnet Institute’s Brendan Crabb says NSW likely to stay in lockdown until Christmas

Full text: There will be no “freedom day” in the state – rather restrictions will have to taper off slowly in order to safely open up, Burnet Institute director Brendan Crabb told Channel 9’s Today show on Wednesday.
In Melbourne the lockdown could last even longer than in NSW, Mr Crabb said.
“I’ve said you’re in lockdown till Christmas and I think that’s looking pretty likely,” he said.
“It would be wonderful if it was a month before that or so, and it would be wonderful if some freedoms kicked in before that, and I think they might.
“But as a general comment, restrictions are here till December or so in Sydney and, certainly, probably for longer here in Melbourne.”
Mr Crabb said people shouldn’t expect coronavirus restrictions to disappear overnight once case numbers were managed and the protection due to mass vaccination kicked in.
Rather, he said he would recommend easing restrictions slowly and making sure case numbers are less than 100 per day so that contact tracing can proceed effectively.
“There’s a good end in sight but it’s not happening suddenly,” he said.
“You can start doing things easier and easier but there’s no ‘freedom day’. The restrictions will have to be maintained until the numbers are low.”
The Burnet Institute is behind modelling released this week that showed Sydney’s lockdown and vaccine rollout prevented almost 5000 deaths and almost half a million Covid-19 infections.
The medical research organisation has also provided modelling to the NSW government that shows Sydney hotspots are likely to experience up to 2000 coronavirus cases per day within the next two weeks.
By the beginning of November, 560 people will be in intensive care units, according to the modelling released on Monday.
The modelling was released as state health officials are bracing for a surge in Covid-19 hospitalisations, expected to hit before the effect of mass vaccination kicks in.
“I can’t emphasise enough how difficult and exhausting this is going to be for our staff,” said Dr Nhi Nguyen, clinical director of the Intensive Care Network NSW.
NSW Premier Gladys Berejiklian has promised some rules will ease once the state reaches a goal of fully vaccinating 70 per cent of the population, a target that could be hit by October.

Hospitals prepare for surge in cases

Publication info: Sydney Morning Herald ; Sydney, N.S.W. [Sydney, N.S.W]. 07 Sep 2021: 1.

Full text: Sydney's worst-affected COVID areas will have 2000 cases a day by next week as hospitals prepare to implement emergency plans to call back nurses from vaccination hubs and turn operating theatres into intensive care units.
New modelling from Melbourne's Burnet Institute shows projections for the next three months in Sydney's COVID-19 hotspots, but Premier Gladys Berejiklian has refused to make public the full modelling.
Instead, she has released the "worst-case scenario modelling" for only the 12 local areas of concern, which projected rising case numbers based on mask-wearing, social distancing and increased vaccination rates.
Ms Berejiklian's office did not respond when asked why only selected sections of the modelling were released and whether she intended to make the statewide modelling publicly available, which includes hospitalisation rates.
The modelling includes a four-step plan, based on current trends, until the end of November with impact levels on ICU operations reaching "overwhelming" in the next two months.
NSW reported 1281 new local COVID-19 cases yesterday, as well as six deaths, including that of an Aboriginal woman in her 70s from the remote community of Enngonia, near Bourke, where 21 of the fewer than 200 residents have tested positive.
The grandmother is believed to be the second Aboriginal person to die from the virus in Australia. She died at Dubbo Hospital and had not received a vaccine.
There are four children under the age of 12 being treated for COVID-19 in intensive care. In the past two weeks, 2200 children aged nine and under have been diagnosed with the virus.
The Burnet Institute modelling suggests the estimated ICU bed occupancy in Sydney's worst areas will peak at 947 by November.
More than half, or 560 beds, will be taken up by COVID-19 patients under the model.
Ms Berejiklian said the state had a surge capacity of up to 2000 ventilators and 1550 fully staffed ICU beds.
Professor Margaret Hellard, an infectious disease physician and director at the Burnet who worked on the NSW modelling, said the models released yesterday only related to the 12 areas of concern and looked at the "impact of enhanced vaccination".
Professor Hellard confirmed there was broader modelling which the government did not release.
The Premier said she released the modelling, which is based on data as of August 23, "so the public has confidence that our system has been preparing, the system is ready".
"All the planning means you prepare for more than what you think you need to make sure that if things go a different way than what you anticipated, everybody's covered," she said.
While the modelling does not consider the easing of restrictions when NSW reaches 70-80 per cent vaccination, Ms Berejiklian said freedoms at that time would be only for fully vaccinated people.
"When we do open up 70 per cent, anyone who interacts with each other will be completely vaccinated, so that massively reduces the chance of anybody requiring hospitalisation. So, [the projections] are what we best anticipate will occur," she said.
Canterbury-Bankstown and Cumberland continue to have the highest number of cases but Deputy Premier John Barilaro said the curfews in south-western and western Sydney had not worked, and were introduced only following media pressure.
Mr Barilaro said he would not support a curfew for Dubbo despite rising case numbers.
"So the idea of a curfew is one that was put in place in an area that was so out of control and you would question its ability to work," he said.
"If you look at the numbers since we put the curfew in, nothing has occurred, nothing has changed - numbers continue to rise." He said a curfew in Dubbo would do "nothing more than hurt the wellbeing of that community."
His comments followed calls from NSW Labor leader Chris Minns to end the curfews in hotspot areas. Mr Minns yesterday added that there was no health advice to impose such a curfew.
NSW Health deputy secretary Susan Pearce said modelling was always an estimate of a point in time but expressed confidence in the projections so far.
"We'll see whether or not it continues at the moment. But just with a ruler, to me, it's still looking very accurate in terms of that trajectory up that line," she said.
"We have to be realistic about the fact that there will be days when things are incredibly challenging, depending on where the calls come from."
According to the Burnet modelling, daily cases are expected to continue rising in hotspots to about 1100 to 2000 cases until mid-September when vaccine immunity is expected to kick in alongside ongoing restrictions.
A peak in hospital and ICU admission will follow, with between 2200 and 3900 people expected to require hospitalisation.
The total estimated peak hospitalisations of COVID and non-COVID patients will reach 3434 at the end of October before declining to about 2625 by the end of November.
Unions said they were awaiting further details on how the surge plan would work.
"We're seeking further information around what the plan specifically means regarding numbers of patients nurses will be expected to care for, how the nursing teams will be configured, and where these 2000 upskilled nurses are," NSW Nurses and Midwives Association general secretary Brett Holmes said.
Australian Paramedics Association NSW vice-president Scott Beaton said paramedics were concerned about the impact on response times if an increasing number of critically ill patients would need to be diverted between hospitals across Sydney. with Pallavi Singhal

Full text: Appearing Tuesday morning on the Today Show, Shorten said, “Well, the reality is it should be one in all in. What destroys morale in a community is not just being locked down yourself, but a sense that there’s two sets of rules in this country.”
“When we hear examples of some people getting special treatment and others not getting that treatment, that really wrecks the whole sense that we’re all in this together,” he added, in response to a plan by the state government to trial pub reopenings in suburbs with low Covid case loads.
Shorten’s comments backed in the position of state Labor leader Chris Minns who on Monday said “you can’t have a situation where one third of Sydney is under curfew but you can go and get a rosé on the northern beaches and north shore it’s just not fair.”
The former Labor leader has been increasingly vocal in recent weeks about the need to re-open Australia.
A fortnight ago, along with Hunter backbencher Joel Fitzgibbon, Shorten publicly backed in the Doherty Institute modelling behind the four-phase National Cabinet plan, essentially forcing opposition leader Anthony Albanese to throw his support behind it as well.
On Monday, however, the opposition leader appeared to walk back from the plan, suggesting that 12 to 15 year olds might need to be included in vaccination targets, and not criticising the Tasmanian government for suggesting that they might disavow the deal and set a 90 per cent target for reopening.

Coronavirus vaccine rates surging in Sydney hotspots

Full text: Almost 86 per cent of residents in the Blacktown local government area have received their first dose of the Covid-19 vaccine, the sixth-highest coverage rate across any part of the country.
The new vaccine coverage figures came as modelling for the NSW government forecast the outbreak to peak with 2000 daily infections in mid-September.
The modelling, prepared by the Burnet Institute, suggests hospital intensive care units may have to move to a status classed as “overwhelming impact” as total admissions triple in October.
Gladys Berejiklian will press ahead with planned health restriction relaxations, starting Monday, and said ICU capacity could be expanded to 1550 patients.
“We certainly don’t want to have to use all of those beds and staff because we know what pressure it will put on the system, but we want everybody to be reassured that the capacity is there,” the NSW Premier said.
Anthony Holley, the president of the Australian and New Zealand Intensive Care Society, said ICU nurses who worked at a ratio of one nurse to one patient would likely face increased workloads.
“The way that could work is that you could have one qualified critical care nurse supervising two other nurses with a good skill set, but not necessarily having a certificate in critical care,” he said.
If Covid-19 patients in ICU exceeded 1000 then interstate support would likely be required “in one shape or another”, including the use of additional staff, Dr Holley told The Australian.
But Australia was in a stronger position than most other countries, he said, with a ratio of 9.1 ICU beds per 100,000 people, compared with 3.4 in Britain.
There will be increased freedoms for vaccinated people in October when NSW is estimated to hit a 70 per cent double dose vaccination rate across the population.
Ms Berejiklian is this week expected to announce further details of rule relaxations – contingent on 70 per cent of residents being fully vaccinated.
Data released by the commonwealth showed Queenscliffe, a small government area near Geelong, has the country’s highest single-dose rate – 91.8 per cent.
But the local councils of Blacktown, Campbelltown and Parramatta – all classified as areas of concern by the NSW government – had first-dose coverage rates of more than 80 per cent.
There were five deaths and 1281 cases recorded in NSW on Monday – 831 in Sydney’s western and southwestern suburbs – while Victoria reported 246 new infections.
The ACT recorded 11 cases.
In Victoria, Daniel Andrews has also outlined a vaccine-dependent road map out of lockdown. On Monday, the Victorian Premier said he hoped regional areas in his state would come out of the lockdown next week.
“That’s great news for regional Victoria but it would also be a pretty logical place for us to do some of this piloting work,” he said.
Across Victoria, 61 per cent of adults have received at least one dose. In NSW, 74.1 per cent of people have received their first dose of a vaccine, with 41 per cent of residents fully inoculated.
The NSW modelling released on Monday predicts a spike in case numbers to occur next week followed by a significant increase in hospitalisations during the latter half of October and the first two weeks of November. It will occur just as the state embarks upon its most ambitious plans to reopen the economy.
The six-page document predicts that ICU occupancy – including non-Covid related cases – will reach 947 cases in October before tapering off in late November.
Of these cases, approximately 560 are expected to be directly attributable to Covid-19. As of Monday there were 177 Covid-19 patients receiving intensive care across the state’s hospitals, including three children.
NSW Health Deputy Secretary Susan Pearce says NSW Health does not anticipate a need for field hospitals yet, however, have planned and prepared for the scenario if it does eventuate.
To cope with the strain on ICU operations, operating theatres will be used as makeshift intensive care facilities and each staff member will be tasked with a higher number of patients. Other “pandemic resource-based strategies” will also be deployed, the document said. “Achieving uniform vaccination in the LGAs of concern is critical as vaccination rather than reduced infection numbers will be the intervention that leads to a fall in hospitalisation,” the modelling stated.
The modelling indicates that the health system will likely experience an “overwhelming impact” on its usual operations during mid-October, the designation being the highest level of impact specified in the document; others include “minimal”, “moderate” and “severe”.
Last week the Australian Medical Association wrote to Scott Morrison and state and territory leaders warning that the nation’s hospitals were “ill prepared for plans to open up” their respective state economies.
Omar Khorshid, the association’s president, said although he believed expanded ICUs would be able to cope with increasing numbers of Covid-19 patients, he cautioned there may be ongoing elective surgery suspensions.
“In order to look after the people with Covid we’re going to compromise the care of everyone else,” Dr Khorshid said.
Health Services Union NSW secretary Gerard Hayes said the modelling showed a system “planning for the worst and hoping for the best”, which made “good sense”. But he cautioned that regional and rural centres would be far more vulnerable if an outbreak were to occur during the peak hospitalisation period across Sydney.
“Unfortunately, the same capacity does not exist in the regions, where the distances are longer and the ICU capacity is lower. We simply cannot afford a significant delta outbreak outside.”

Full text: The four-year-old girl is a close contact of a 46-year-old Logan truck driver who triggered an alert this week.
The child attended the Boulevard Early Learning Centre – Mt Warren Park on Tuesday and Wednesday this week, with children, staff and visitors urged to immediately get tested and quarantine at home with household members for two weeks – regardless of a negative result.
The centre is also used as an after school care for students who attend Windaroo State School, with all students, staff and visitors who attended the school between Tuesday and Friday to quarantine with their household members for 14 days.
The school late on Friday confirmed in an email to parents that it would be closed for two weeks.
Windaroo State School principal, Alisha LeBrese said she had been liaising with Queensland Health to ensure the safety and well-being of school children and students.
“All school, school events and activities are closed and postponed until the quarantine period ends and we have advised that we can resume,” Ms LeBrese said.
For those who require testing, a COVID-19 drive-through collection centre will be located at Eden’s Landing on September 4 and 5.
The unfolding situation has also forced authorities to reinstate visitor restrictions at aged care facilities, disability services and hospitals in the Logan Local Government area.
Contact tracers were on Friday night scrambling to get in touch with those impacted, with more information to be provided on Saturday.
It’s understood testing was being undertaken on Friday night with the results to determine whether another lockdown is required.
Meanwhile, Queensland would remain an isolated kingdom until a splintered approach to reopening under Covid, with Scott Morrison confirming there may be a future in which states like NSW open international borders and others remain cut off.
The Prime Minister painted the fractured picture after a fortnight of hesitation by Premier Annastacia Palaszczuk to remain committed to the national plan informed by Doherty modelling of case numbers once vaccination levels reach 80 per cent and restrictions are relaxed, making it clear the rest of the nation wouldn’t wait.

But after loud criticism of her use of worst-case scenario modelling to highlight death numbers and concerns around sick children that haven’t been backed by medical professionals, a more measured Ms Palaszczuk backed a more “constructive debate” going forward and finally apologised over her government’s decision to allow in an NRL entourage while borders were closed to returning Queenslanders.
It came before the national cabinet meeting where further Doherty Institute modelling, focused on reopening with the current case numbers in NSW, was presented.
The details of the updated modelling is expected to be made public next week.
It is understood there was further discussion about what public health measures can be removed once vaccination rates hit the 70 per cent and 80 per cent milestones, but no final decisions were made.
Earlier Mr Morrison confirmed international borders would open for states that reached 80 per cent vaccination, if they wanted it, without waiting for those jurisdictions lagging behind.
“The national plan (for reopening) sets that out very clearly,” he said.
Under the national plan, all restrictions on outbound travel are lifted for vaccinated Australians and travel bubbles will be expanded to countries such as Singapore and the Pacific Islands, pending agreements being struck, once 80 per cent vaccination rates are hit.
Queensland has the second lowest vaccination levels, at 32.9 per cent double doses and 51.6 per cent with a single dose.
Despite Ms Palaszczuk’s comments this week, Mr Morrison said all states and territories had agreed to the national plan.
“It doesn’t come without risks and it’s important it is done safely and it is a safe plan,” he said.
“It sees a soft opening as you ease into a more broad opening when we hit 80 per cent.”
Mr Morrison described the Premier’s comments that 2240 people would die every month if the nation opened up at 70 per cent as a “misreading” of the Doherty analysis and a “scenario where there is no ongoing vaccination, where there are virtually no public health, social measures in place and that’s not what the national plan indicated”.

Meanwhile, three days after The Courier-Mail revealed exemptions had been granted for NRL players’ families, and following days of sustained criticism both in the community and in Queensland Parliament, the Premier conceded it wasn’t the right decision.
“It was not the right thing to do when we had the pause (on hotel quarantine),” she said.
“It shouldn’t have happened.
“Unfortunately, it did happen, and I extend my apologies to the public about that.”
It came after the state government defended the decision all week.

Palaszczuk poisons reopening plan with faulty analysis of Doherty modelling

Full text: Only someone intent on scaring people would take to social media and distort medical evidence with a claim about thousands of deaths.
Political leaders usually leave the tactic for anonymous accounts on social media or, at worst, rogue backbenchers. But Queensland Premier Annastacia Palaszczuk went out of her way to mislead Australians yesterday and the ploy tells everyone the national cabinet plan to open the country is "national" in name only.
Every state has its own idea of what it means to ease restrictions when the vaccination rate climbs to 70 and 80 per cent of people aged 16 and over.
Prime Minister Scott Morrison conceded this, on some issues at least, when Labor asked him about state border controls this week. "Ultimately, everything is a state matter," he told Parliament.
Palaszczuk is so determined to go her own way that she bent the Doherty Institute medical advice - on which the national plan is based - to suit her needs.
"Doherty Institute modelling predicts, even with 70 per cent of the population vaccinated, 80 people will die each day six months after the outbreak," she tweeted yesterday morning. "That's 2240 who will die each month."
There was no link to the source and no quotation from the report saying 2240 would die each month - because there was no such finding in the report. Only those who went hunting could find a chart that made it look like the scenario might be true.
But the number was Palaszczuk's extrapolation, not the Doherty Institute's conclusion.
One chart in the report, Figure 3.3 on page 17, shows an increase in deaths at a 70 per cent vaccination rate, assuming only baseline restrictions and partial testing, tracing, isolation and quarantine. It does not show what happens after 180 days. In other words, Palaszczuk engineered her own worst-case scenario. But it is her claim, not the work of others.
The actual finding from the Doherty Institute is different. "In the COVID-19 modelling, opening up at 70 per cent vaccine coverage of the adult population with partial public health measures, we predict 385,983 symptomatic cases and 1457 deaths over six months," the institute said only last week.
"With optimal public health measures (and no lockdowns), this can be significantly reduced to 2737 infections and 13 deaths."
Even the worst of those two options means deaths would be about one-tenth the number Palaszczuk claimed.
Another chart in the Doherty modelling, assuming "optimal" rather than "partial" protections, also predicts lower deaths. Rather than say the modelling was wrong, Palaszczuk dreamt up her own number. This makes Palaszczuk an outlier in a significant week for pandemic policy. Victorian Premier Daniel Andrews made a necessary shift this week by admitting the Delta variant has changed everything.
"We will not see these numbers go down," he said. The elimination illusion is over.
What else could he do? What further restriction could the state impose on its people to stop Delta? This is the practical question. The Victorian decision reveals the answer: there is no sustainable new measure to halt a variant that spreads so much faster than the original. That brings him closer to NSW Premier Gladys Berejiklian.
Andrews is levelling with Victorians. Palaszczuk is leading Queenslanders the other way. What is telling is her calculation about the best way to keep her followers: to distort the medical advice and frighten them all.

Queensland Premier Annastacia Palaszczuk apologises for NRL WAGS flight

Full text: However, the Queensland Premier hit back at federal and state counterparts who criticised her border policies in recent days.
On Friday morning, Ms Palaszczuk admitted it “wasn’t right” to allow the families of rugby league players across the state while returning residents were barred.
“They were outside the cap, but I can understand that Queenslanders could see that in the light of when we were actually trying to reduce the number of people coming in ... it was not the right look,” Ms Palaszczuk said.
“Because we had the pause, we should not have had anyone come in.”
She added that without allowing the players and their families in, the NRL wouldn’t be going ahead.
The premier also hit back at federal and state leaders who criticised her Covid policies.
“Rather than picking fights and attacks, let’s have a decent educated conversation … it is not about being against a national plan,” Ms Palaszczuk said.
“I want to preserve our lifestyle. I want to see Queensland as being kept safe,” she added.
Queensland Deputy Premier Steven Miles lashed the prime minister and federal ministers for “attacking Queensland” over the hard border closure and its refusal to commit to reopening.
“We haven’t seen a pile-on like that since before the state election last year, not one of them mentioned the outbreak in Sydney,” Mr Miles said.
“It’s as though Queensland is somehow responsible for the NSW outbreak - it’s clear the prime minister has both eyes on his own election, and no eyes on the outbreak ripping through Sydney right now.”
Earlier it was revealed Ms Palaszczuk’s own party has distanced itself from the premier after she came under fire for her hard border closure and “damaging public confidence” by misquoting Covid-19 death rate modelling.
Deputy Labor leader Richard Marles on Friday said it was important all states were on the same page about the path out of Covid-19, emphasising Federal Labor supported the Doherty Institute modelling which underpins the Prime Minister’s national plan.
When asked whether he was on the same page as Ms Palaszczuk, he appeared to take a swipe at her, telling Nine News: “I would be distancing myself from the comments of Annastacia, is the honest answer.”
He said while he understood the reason the premier wanted to keep the Delta strain out of Queensland, it was important Scott Morrison got the nation on the same page in National Cabinet on Friday.
“We don’t want to be spending an extra day in lockdown. But at the end of the day, you know, you can understand why states that don’t have Covid want to stay in that situation. And we need to see the Prime Minister actually getting the country on a plan, on the same page, so we get to the other side of this,” he said.
The comments come after Ms Palaszczuk misinterpreted modelling by the Doherty Institute on Thursday, claiming there would be 80 deaths a day, six months after Australia reopens at 70 per cent vaccination, attracting criticism from Health Minister Greg Hunt.
“Selectively misusing the Doherty modelling breaches good faith and damages public confidence,” he said.
Ms Palaszczuk’s claim ­assumed Australia never achieved a vaccination rate above 70 per cent, had minimal restrictions and only partially effective contact tracing and isolation for at least six months.
In reality, Australia’s nat­ional plan only moves to significant reopening at 80 per cent of the adult population vaccinated, while restrictions may still come and go.
Under this scenario, the Doherty Institute suggests there would be about 980 deaths in the first six months — about five per day.
Following mass public outcry, Ms Palaszczuk also had to backtrack on a decision to block Queenslanders from their own state, announcing just 50-people would be allowed into hotel quarantine.
She also backflipped on a decision to block three-year-old boy Memphis Francis from returning home to his parents in Queensland from NSW after a mass public outcry.
And in bizarre scenes, border town residents in NSW and Queensland have swarmed to the makeshift barriers dividing the two states, passing supplies, sharing hugs and ­offering assurances to family members trapped on either side.
Ms Palaszczuk also doubled down on her claim young children under 12 would be at risk of Covid-19 if she reopened her state before they were vaccinated.
That’s despite Australia’s Chief Medical Officer Paul Kelly saying there was currently no vaccine available in the world for this age group, and that all the data showed they were far less impacted by serious Covid-19 disease.
Meanwhile, a charity flight organisation is ready to reunite Memphis with his parents in Queensland, after the three-year-old spent almost two months in lockdown on his grandparent’s cattle station in southwestern NSW.
He hopes to jump on-board an Angel Flight rescue mission on Friday, heading from Griffith to Hervey Bay providing health authorities give the green light.
On Thursday Queensland’s chief health officer Jeannette Young claimed Memphis’ family had not previously approached her ­department for an exemption for the child’s return, but health officials had since been “able to sort it all out”.

Full text: Ms Palaszczuk’s comments came as West Australian Premier Mark McGowan warned he could keep borders with NSW and Victoria closed for months, accusing the commonwealth of trying to “infect the public” by pressuring states to lift the restrictions.
The intensifying row – after Attorney-General Michaelia Cash told The Australian that legal -arguments upholding the constitutionality of state border closures would weaken once Australia hit 80 per cent vaccination coverage – could leave the nation split until well into next year.
“Until I can get every child vaccinated, we will stand firm and we will stand strong (on border -closures),” Ms Palaszczuk said.
Victorian Premier Daniel Andrews on Wednesday conceded his state would not be able to eradicate Covid-19, instead outlining a plan to ease restrictions starting on September 23, when 70 per cent of adults are expected to have received their first vaccination.
But further restrictions – including stay-at-home orders and curfews – may not be lifted until Victoria reaches 70 or 80 per cent full vaccination coverage, currently forecast for November.
“We have thrown everything at this, but it is now clear to us that we are not going to drive these numbers down; they’re instead going to increase,” Mr Andrews said.
“Now it’s up to us to make sure they don’t increase too fast and they don’t increase too much, relative to the number of people who are getting vaccinated.”
Victoria recorded 120 cases on Wednesday; NSW, where Premier Gladys Berejiklian will begin easing restrictions for fully vaccinated adults on September 13, recorded 1116 new Covid-19 infections.
Some 70 per cent of those cases – and all four of the deaths recorded on Wednesday – were from Sydney’s western and southwestern suburbs. There are now 917 people in NSW hospitals.
The growing number of Covid-19 case in NSW and Victoria has alarmed Mr McGowan and Ms Palaszczuk, who on Wednesday cast doubt on the Doherty Institute modelling that underpins national cabinet’s plan out of the pandemic.
That modelling recommends restrictions ease when 70 per cent of the adult population is vaccinated. Lockdowns would stop when vaccine coverage hit 80 per cent.
Ms Palaszczuk said the modelling had failed to take into account cases among children.
“It is a fundamental question that is omitted from any modelling,” she said. “It is omitted from any plan and every single Queenslanders must be included in that plan. I want to see a paper, I don’t want to see a slide show, I want to see detailed information.
“You open up this state and you let the virus in here and every child under 12 is vulnerable.”
Commonwealth officials have previously noted a lack of vaccination programs for children under 12 overseas, while public health academics say serious illnesses in this age group are rare.
Mr McGowan reacted furiously to Senator Cash’s comment questioning the constitutionality of state border closures as vaccination rates rose. The hard border had the support of the community and his state’s businesses, Mr McGowan said.
“Why are they on this mission to bring Covid into Western Australia to infect our public, to ensure that we shut down parts of the economy, that we lose jobs, people get sick and some people die?” he added.
“Haven’t they seen what’s happening in NSW.”
While Senator Cash reaffirmed the government’s position was not to take court action against state border closures or jeopardise the four-step national plan, there were expectations billionaire Clive Palmer or others could make another attempt to overturn borders closures through the courts.
Despite outlining a path out of Covid-19 restrictions, Mr Andrews left open the possibility of keeping Victoria’s borders with NSW shut until next year.
In response to a question on whether the border could remain shut well into 2022, Mr ¬Andrews said: “Yep, and no one’s happy about that but again we’ll have many more options when we get to 80 per cent.”
Ms Berejiklian seized on Senator Cash’s legal analysis and said the commonwealth could look at stopping state border closures.
“I understand there are sections in the Australian Constitution which allow the commonwealth to look at those matters. I hope it does not come to that,” she told the Seven Network
Josh Frydenberg called on state leaders to stick to the national road map out of the pandemic.
“When it comes to kids, we’ve got to be very conscious of what the medical experts tell us about the impact on children … they found that the virus … was much less severe in children then it is an older cohorts,” the Treasurer said.
Just under 60 per cent of adults across the country have had one dose of the vaccine, while 35.7 per cent have had both.
Sky News host Peter Gleeson says there are two premiers in the country who are “not part of team Australia” when it comes to the national plan out of the pandemic.

No new SA cases but 99 in quarantine linked to Covid-positive NSW truckies

Full text: More than 140 people have been forced into quarantine after visiting 14 exposure sites the truckies visited in the past 10 days, three quarters of whom have returned a negative test.
But contact tracers were still hunting at least 24 people last night who are believed to be contacts of the pair, aged 23 and 29, up from 16 earlier in the day.
The truckies, who were in the one lorry, made two trips across the state, creating exposure sites in Port Augusta, Ceduna and Nundroo.
SA Exposure Sites
SA Health and WA authorities reported no new cases on Monday. A WA Health spokesman said all 24 contacts have returned negative tests.
A WA Health spokesman said all 24 contacts have returned negative tests.
Chief public health officer, Professor Nicola Spurrier, who expressed frustration about the poor QR code compliance, flagged a new crackdown on Monday.
She told Five AA Breakfast radio the truckies, who had at least one Pfizer vaccine and worse masks, stopped at another SA truckstop but had no contact with any locals.
“Well, I do think there is some luck and I think there is some good management,” she told the program.
“I also think it’s about South Australians doing the right thing, understanding the need to QR check-in and wear masks.
“We may have had cases we don’t know about, but the chains of transmission haven’t progressed.”
Prof Spurrier said the transition committee would consider easing Queensland border restrictions at its meeting today as local restrictions are also debated.
Authorities say major changes are unlikely as NSW and Victoria battle Delta outbreaks.
NSW Health said the cluster in the state’s far west, including Broken Hill and Wilcannia rose by nine patients to 79 cases.
A Broken Hill woman, aged in her 40s, is stable in the Royal Adelaide Hospital’s Intensive Care Unit.
Premier Steven Marshall said authorities had learned about the two truckies “very early”, allowing a net to be placed over contacts.
Mr Marshall on Monday briefed Prime Minister Scott Morrison on the home quarantine trial using a specialised facial recognition and geolocating phone app.
A week into the trial, Mr Marshall said it had so far gone “extraordinarily … and magnificently well” but said some “behavioural issues” – such as how long people have to reply to random checks – were still being ironed out.
Mr Marshall also defended the state’s slow vaccination levels, arguing a national cabinet decision had allowed NSW, Victoria and Queensland to bring forward additional doses.
He said SA would get a supply surge within weeks, in which the lag would be corrected.
“We will be catching up,” he said. He said SA was on track to achieve 80 per cent well before Christmas as hesitancy disappears.
SA Health on Monday announced the Ridgehaven Waterworld Covid-19 drive-through testing clinic was now the state’s third permanent 24/7 testing site.
No new cases amid growing fears over truckies South Australia recorded zero new cases on Monday despite growing concerns over two Covid-positive truck drivers who visited the state’s north and west twice in the past nine days.
SA chief public health officer Nicola Spurrier said there were about 150 contacts identified, with 99 people directed into quarantine as a precaution.
“The team have given me an update last night. I’ve been in contact with about 150 contacts, not all of those will be close contacts, but at this stage 99 people have been directed into quarantine for 14 days,” Professor Spurrier said on radio this morning.
“There were 20 negative tests overnight, but that will be an underestimate, there’ll be a lot more people that have been tested, and we’ll be putting those numbers together this morning.”
Prof Spurrier again expressed disappointment in the lack of QR code check-ins at the tier 1 exposure sites and said her team was frantically trying to contact 15 people who had not done so.
Professor Spurrier said regional South Australians needed to stop thinking of Covid-19 as a “city problem”.
“Because of those trucking routes and people in our essential sector workforce and the electricity and the gas and important infrastructure in our state we do have people that have come from those states where there is Covid.”
She said SA Health was looking to use food safety inspectors from the Adelaide City Council to check on QR code compliance at hospitality venues.
“We have a team that’s being built up in one of our public health sections and they work very closely with the local council.”
“We are looking at improving compliance through those inspectors that normally go into food stores and cafes and restaurants and do the checks on food hygiene.”
EARLIER Premier Steven Marshall confirmed on Sunday that the pair, who tested positive for the coronavirus on Thursday in Perth, had travelled through South Australia on August 21 and August 22, as well as August 25 and 26.
They visited several petrol stations in Port Augusta, Ceduna and Nundroo.
Professor Spurrier expressed frustration that some people were still not using QR codes, even though it was a legal requirement.
“If people had just done a QR check-in, we would have already had these people contacted and they would know that they’re at risk and we could have done the follow-through,” she said.
“Because we’ve got that gap in our information, we’re now looking at bank records when people have paid by credit, and also looking at the CCTV footage itself.’’
WATCH SUNDAY’S PRESS CONFERENCE HERE
Local sporting finals were cancelled on Saturday and tourist attractions have been closed in Port Augusta, Port Pirie and Ceduna
“We are taking no chances whatsoever – we’ve identified those sites that they came into and attended during their two visits to South Australia,” Mr Marshall said.
“We’re saying to people, if you were at these sites, please identify yourself, we do need to make sure that we are taking no chances with regard to the Delta variant.”
Eight more exposure sites in Port Augusta, Ceduna and Nundroo were added Saturday night, once the additional visit had been confirmed.
SA Health is continuing to track the movement of the truck drivers but Mr Marshall said he believed this was a “low-level risk for us’’.
The trucker pair, aged 23 and 29, tested positive for coronavirus in Perth on Thursday night after their cross-country trips, during which they visited several petrol stations in Ceduna, Port Augusta and Nundroo.
The duo, who had each had one dose of the Pfizer vaccine and wore masks outside their trucks, drove almost 4000km from Sydney to Western Australia via Victoria and South Australia.
Among those in quarantine are six staff and three customers who used QR codes.
No border crackdowns have been imposed.
Mr Marshall said Covid was a “nasty virus and there is no silver bullet to make our state 100 per cent impenetrable”.
“The situations at our two eastern borders puts us at high alert,” he said.
NSW recorded 1290 new local Covid cases on Monday and four more deaths, while Victoria recorded 73 new locally acquired cases.
Port Augusta mayor Brett Benbow said the shocked community had rallied. “They realise the importance,” he said.
National – 2021 – Covid Vaccination Stats
Sport cancelled in two regions An SA Health spokeswoman said Covid management plans had also been cancelled for various sporting leagues, while the local council has announced tourist attractions have closed “out of an abundance of caution”.
Port Pirie events were also affected.
The Western United Football Club at Penong, west of Ceduna and Port Augusta football and netball preliminary and semi-finals have been postponed.
The spokeswoman praised the organisations for the “responsive and cooperative approach” with SA Health and their excellent co-operation at short notice.
Port Augusta mayor Brett Benbow urged the community to not panic and to follow health advice.
“I think they realise the importance, you can always rearrange a football or netball match,” he said. “Everyone is following the directions. There’s no concern at the moment but contact tracers are working through it all.”
A spokesman for the local sporting organisations told locals a decision had been quickly made to cancel “due to the current exposure sites and the potential risk that playing sport may pose”.
He also urged people to follow local protocols.

Coronavirus world: Aussie Wuhan bat scientist, Danielle Anderson, gives dire warning on virus origin

Author: Vallejo, Justin

Publication info: The Daily Telegraph (Online) ; Surrey Hills, N.S.W. [Surrey Hills, N.S.W]. 27 Aug 2021.

Full text: “I think it’s a really good possibility that we’ll never know where Covid came from,” Dr Anderson said.
“The first [SARS] outbreak took 10 years for the reservoir to be found, and there are plenty of cases where the actual reservoir hasn’t been found.”
The dire prediction that the cause of the global pandemic may forever remain unknown comes as US intelligence agencies failed to discover a smoking gun that the virus leaked from a lab in Wuhan.
The World Health Organisation’s investigation team, meanwhile, this week warned they are running out of time to find a smoking gun of their own as the window closes on tracing natural origins in China.
Dr Anderson, an expert in bat-borne viruses who conducted research at China’s BSL-4 lab until November 2019, said she’s not surprised that the review ordered by US president Joe Biden did not find whether the virus leaked from a lab.
But, she said, the possibility isn’t entirely beyond the pale, either.
“The lab-leak accident, if something came out, some evidence, I won’t say it never happened,” Dr Anderson said. “In the past, there’ve been incidents coming out of a lab. Not just in China, all over the world.”
“If there was evidence to show this is what happened, I’m not going to say that’s nonsense. I can foresee how it could happen,” she added.
Dr Anderson is currently a senior research fellow at Melbourne’s Peter Doherty Institute for Infection and Immunity. New modelling from the Doherty Institute, presented at Friday’s national cabinet meeting, showed lifting Australia’s Covid-19 restrictions won’t lead to more deaths than waiting for cases to fall.
Ms Anderson finished her research at the Wuhan lab in November 2019. Early cases of Covid-19 were first reported to December 2019, while
analysis has suggested it first emerged as far back as early October, with the most likely date being November 17.
Chinese government data, first published in The South China Morning Post , traced the first known case of Covid-19 to a 55-year-old woman in the Hubei province. A “patient zero”, however, has never been confirmed.
A US intelligence report, meanwhile, suggested three researchers from China’s Wuhan Institute of Virology became sick enough in November 2019 that they went to a hospital for treatment.
Dr Anderson said she did not see any sick colleagues before her time at the virology institute ended, but that her lab was geographically apart from other areas of the campus.
From her knowledge of papers produced by the institute’s scientists, and the work she’s aware of, Dr Anderson said nothing meet the definition of “gain of function” research. The controversial practice of combining viruses has been the centre of questions about whether the virus could have emerged at the institute.
The White House’s Chief Medical Adviser to the president, Dr Anthony Fauci, has clashed with US politicians over whether his National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases funded gain of function research at the Wuhan lab.
Critics of Dr Fauci and the World Health Organisation’s investigation team say they have a conflict of interest to obscure the origin of the virus if it came from a laboratory, which would make the research relevant to the lab leak hypothesis.
Among her circle of collages, Dr Anderson says the general belief is that the virus emerged zoonotically, jumping from animals to humans.
“Investigating the origins is better undertaken by scientists and epidemiologists, rather than intelligence agencies,” she said.
“I don’t know what tools they would have been using, but from the intelligence side they would have only found evidence on the assumption there was a cover-up.”

Full text: We are not talking about just a few deaths but many deaths, possibly in the thousands, if Australia is to join the rest of the Western world in opening up and resuming something approximating normal life.
It’s a jarring but necessary transition for a country that prided itself on a low death count during the deadliest phase of the pandemic last year and then became addicted to the fantasy idea that zero Covid was possible into the future.
This week saw a historic tipping point in Australia’s debate over the pandemic. For the first time, the momentum is clearly swinging towards accepting and understanding the need for deadly trade-offs to regain freedoms as soon as vaccination rates meet the threshold targets of 70 and 80 per cent of the eligible population.
The change in rhetoric is being led by the Morrison government, especially Josh Frydenberg. But the mood is also changing among epidemiologists, health professionals and business operators who are increasingly taking a broader view of the growing social, economic and health costs of endless lockdowns in NSW and Victoria.
It is also being powered by changing public opinion, as exhausted locked-down populations in NSW and Victoria realise the Delta variant cannot be contained and that there is no choice but to live with it.
Nothing better illustrated this changing debate than NSW Premier Gladys Berejiklian this week announcing an easing of restrictions of social gatherings on the same day as her state clocked up 1029 new Covid cases, a new national record.
But this mood shift is not yet a uniform one or a national one. The Morrison government and the NSW Premier are sharply at odds with the premiers of low-Covid states, especially Western Australia and Queensland, who have threatened to delay reopening if it means Covid coming into their state.
A very uncivil war is also being fought in suburbs across the country where the debate over freedoms versus health risks continues to pit neighbour against neighbour. Social media is a sewer of abuse as dominant left-leaning voices continue to portray lockdown critics as reckless granny killers.
The fast-growing pace of the vaccine rollout, after a disastrously slow start, has emboldened a previously cautious Morrison government to finally take more assertive leadership in trying to change the national psyche to accept the necessity of death as a price for reopening the country.
“The only long-term solution for Australia is to live with Covid, and people expect their leaders to be upfront with them as to what that means,” the Treasurer tells Inquirer.
“More cases, severe illness and, tragically, the loss of life will occur. People need to be conditioned to this reality given that, to date, states have used the bluntest of instruments, namely lockdowns, but in the process Australia has avoided the loss of life seen elsewhere.
“Now that we have the vaccine rollout gaining real momentum there is an alternative.”
Scott Morrison, who says the country must “adjust” its mindset, has warned Australians will be stuck “in the cave forever” if any premiers abandon the agreed national plan to progressively ease Covid restrictions at 70 and 80 per cent vaccination rates.
WA and Queensland have baulked at reopening borders or ruling out lockdowns once the vaccination targets are reached, knowing that this will inject Covid into their state – especially if NSW continues to have high case numbers.
“Just because the NSW government has made a mess of it doesn’t mean the rest of us should suffer,” WA Premier Mark McGowan says.
“We should do everything we can to stay in the state we are currently in, and at the same time vaccinate like hell.”
But the Prime Minister has, in effect called their bluff, by posing the logical question: “If not at 70 per cent and 80 per cent, then when?
“We must make that move and we must prepare to make that move and we must prepare the country to make that move,” Morrison says.
As Berejiklian says, a zero-Covid target by any state is “completely unrealistic”. “I don’t know any state or nation on the planet who abides by those rules,” she says. “It’s just not possible. We can’t pretend we’re special or very different from other places.”
The bottom line is that McGowan and Queensland Premier Annastacia Palaszczuk are avoiding having an honest conversation with their own voters about the inevitable infections, illness and deaths that will be a consequence of Australia’s reopening.
The standoff has pushed the Doherty Institute, the modeller of the Covid national vaccination plan, into the spotlight after Queensland this week argued that the 70 and 80 per cent inoculation targets were not modelled on having such a large Covid outbreak in NSW.
It was a potentially perilous moment for the national reopening plan, but the plan remains intact after the institute publicly denied the claim, stating that its modelling is still valid even with higher case numbers in NSW and elsewhere.
The institute has also given Australians the first glimpse of the projected deaths involved in reopening once the initial 70 per cent vaccination target has been reached.
“Opening up at 70 per cent ‘with partial health measures’ we predict 385,983 symptomatic cases and 1457 deaths over six months,” the institute says.
This quote was spotlighted by the media and by those who support higher vaccination rates ­before reopening, but Health Minister Greg Hunt argued it was the second Doherty projection, involving “optimal” not “partial” health measures which was more relevant – “With optimal public health measures (and no lockdowns) this can be significantly reduced to 2737 infections and 13 deaths,” the Doherty Institute says.
The institute also places these projected deaths in context, pointing out that some 600 Australians die of the flu each year: “Any death is a tragedy but our health system can cope with this.”
However, it did say there would be no “freedom day” like in Britain and any easing of restrictions would need to be a progressive one even after vaccination targets have been met.
The experience of other highly vaccinated nations – although not a direct apples-for-apples comparison – suggests infection rates and deaths upon reopening could be higher than the Doherty Institute estimates.
Britain, with 67 million people, has about 75 per cent over 12 years of age fully vaccinated and is currently experiencing about 33,000 new Covid cases a day with 100 daily deaths.
The United States, with 330 million people, has about 52 per cent fully vaccinated and is recording about 150,000 new cases a day with some 900 daily deaths. However, the key statistic in both of these countries – and also throughout the rest of Europe – is that more than 95 per cent of all Covid deaths are people who are unvaccinated by choice.
By the time Australia reaches the Doherty Institute vaccination targets, everyone over the age of 16 who wants a vaccine will have had the opportunity to have one. So the deaths that will occur here in Australia later this year when the country opens up will overwhelmingly be among those who have chosen not to get vaccinated.
A more balanced debate in Australia about the trade-off between Covid deaths and freedoms has been long overdue compared to the rest of the Western world where high infections and deaths are accepted as an unfortunate price for freedoms once people have had a chance to be vaccinated. The debate here is now being fast-tracked by the situation in NSW, where the uncontrolled Covid outbreak has led Berejiklian to rely on vaccination rates rather than suppression as the only realistic path to lifting the state’s lockdown.
This focus on vaccinations rather than new cases is now the most relevant statistic for Australians as they race towards the Doherty targets but most premiers have yet to adjust their thinking as they continue to fixate on case numbers.
Victoria also appears to have lost control of its Covid outbreak, with about 50 to 80 new cases a day dashing hopes of any reprieve from that state’s lockdown for many weeks and possibly months.
The inability of Victoria’s lockdown-prone Premier Daniel Andrews to quell the Delta outbreak in Melbourne, despite locking down early and hard, sends a message to the rest of the country that it is all but impossible to keep the highly infectious Delta variant out of large cities in the long term. But Andrews, who is easily the country’s least sympathetic premier when it comes to understanding the broader costs of lockdowns, shows no sign of following Berejiklian in relaxing lockdown rules in the face of ongoing infections.
Some epidemiologists are now softening their advice to account for this new Delta reality, even if some premiers refuse to listen.
University of Melbourne epidemiologist Professor Tony Blakely says it may be time to consider a “soft lockdown” in Victoria if the state cannot get below 40 cases a day by September 2.
He expressed concern about the impact of another prolonged lockdown on people’s mental health and the economy and says certain freedoms like bubbles between vaccinated households, industries resuming work and curfews being ditched could be part of the plan.
“I think we need a week as a civil society to start chatting about these things,” Blakely says.
But Andrews, who has not given up the notion of defeating the latest outbreak, rejected Blakely’s idea, saying Covid case numbers would inevitably rise under a softer lockdown.
This week another prominent infectious diseases expert, Professor Peter Collignon of Canberra’s ANU, also flagged the need to take a more balanced approach to the debate as Australia gets closer to the vaccination targets.
“We will need to start thinking about how our mindset will need to change if we want to not just minimise deaths but also minimise the many long-term social, education, psychological and economic impacts caused by severe restrictions to slow transmission,” he says.
“The Delta variant has made ‘zero Covid’ an unlikely sustainable long-term, or even medium-term strategy,” he adds.
Former deputy chief medical officer Nick Coatsworth now says he regrets that the country’s medical establishment did not more aggressively challenge those commentators and academics who for so long have called for an indefinite zero Covid strategy.
“We should have been a lot firmer. We needed stronger voices out there,” he says.
But the government’s plan for a unified national reopening is also being threatened by the growing disparity in vaccination rates around the country.
In NSW, where fear of catching Covid is highest, about 60 per cent of first doses have been delivered, putting the state on track to reach its 70 per cent double jab target around October 29 and 80 per cent around November 16.
Victoria is set to reach the 70 per cent full vaccination threshold around November 3 and 80 per cent around November 21. But the national laggards are the largely Covid-free states of Western Australia and Queensland which are sitting at around 46 per cent for the first dose.
At current rates, Queensland is not expected to reach a 70 per cent full vaccination rate until about December 4 and 80 per cent around December 28, while WA is not projected to reach 70 per cent until around November 11 and 80 per cent around November 29.
Unless this changes, the Morrison government will be faced with an uneven relaxation of restrictions around the country including the continued imposition of cross-border travel bans between Covid-free states and those with ongoing outbreaks, which will include NSW and probably Victoria.
With the country’s two biggest states in a prolonged lockdown, the Morrison government’s political fortunes are hugely dependent on reaching the Doherty Institute targets as quickly as possible.
As a new part of this plan, national cabinet this week examined proposals to encourage jabs by ­allowing fully vaccinated Australians to fly freely on planes and visit restaurants, sporting venues and bars under a uniform standard.
Polls show that such a move, which is similar in practice to a so-called vaccination passport, would be welcomed by most Australians if it restores many of the basic freedoms they have lost in lockdowns.
Recent opinion polls show that Australians, especially those in lockdowns, are now restless to open up as vaccination rates continue to rise.
A new poll taken for the Centre for Independent Studies found the NSW lockdown has sparked a marked shift in public attitudes ­towards Covid-19 restrictions. More than two-thirds of Australians, 71 per cent, now want restrictions and lockdowns to end as soon as possible or when vaccine targets are met and do not believe that returning to zero Covid-19 cases is possible. Only 10 per cent argue that everyone should be vaccinated before restrictions are lifted.
The dilemma for the Morrison government will be if full vaccination rates stall short of the 70 and 80 per cent rates.
Public opinion is unlikely to support ongoing lockdowns and restrictions regardless of the Doherty targets if every Australian who wants a vaccine has had the opportunity to get one. Failure to lift restrictions at this point would mean that the country was being held hostage by anti-vaxxers.
But for now, this remains a ­hypothetical problem for the government because the vaccine take up is strong and vaccine hesitancy is falling.
As Frydenberg puts it, the Doherty Institute plan is the only credible and safe way out of the country’s Covid crisis.
“The plan must be adhered to if we are going to give people hope,” he says.
“The plan is the right plan and it is the agreed plan. The health of the Australian public and the economy depend on it being followed.”

Doherty Institute numbers will test Australia's appetite for coronavirus death and illness

Full text: At the start and finish of a press conference in Canberra yesterday, Prime Minister Scott Morrison said he wanted to thank the 335,420 people who had doses of coronavirus vaccine administered the day before.
That's an enormous number - almost 1.3 per cent of our estimated 25.8 million population - and it must reflect a massive effort across all of the arms of this country's vaccination machine.
Mr Morrison described the journey towards the desired vaccination rates as "this march of hope".
DOMESTIC COVID:
'I'm not going to take the risk': cabbie whacked over COVID rules Negative tests for Windale residents after 'concerning' exposure Donut day for Hunter as lockdown extends, NSW daily cases surge past 1000 What you can do after September 13 if you're vaccinated COVID charge after Jesmond vaccine appointment turns ugly It will also be, for many people, a march of trepidation, because modelling from the government's transition advisers, the Doherty Institute, predicts that ending lockdowns once 70 per cent of over-16s were vaccinated would be followed by between 13 and 1457 deaths, and 2737 and 386,983 infections, in just six months, depending on the "public health measures" used instead of lockdowns.
These figures are at the heart of a statement this week by the Doherty Institute for Infection and Immunity (to give the organisation its full name), summarising the outcomes of its complex modelling for the general population.
The statement compares COVID with influenza, saying Australia typically records about 600 deaths from about 200,000 flu cases each year.
Such numbers are indeed significant, but they are well below the 1500 coronavirus fatalities the institute says are possible in just half the time.
And they do not take into account the real differences between the viruses themselves.
As fatal as influenza can be, it is an adversary we are used to dealing with.
This is not the case with COVID, which still holds many surprises despite an unprecedented global research effort since the Wuhan outbreak.
In NSW, we are learning first-hand how entrenched this virus can become.
Yesterday's editorial observed that 919 cases put us close to talking about cases in the thousands, not the hundreds.
INTERNATIONAL SCENE:
Japan suspends Moderna shots on contamination concerns Kiwi cases edge higher with 68 new cases Global coronavirus snapshot New York 'hid' 12,000 deaths from figures, says new governor Now, at 1029 cases, that distinction is behind us. Hopes of a plateau in numbers are evaporating.
Two months have passed since Premier Gladys Berejiklian was applauded for restricting the Sydney lockdown to four council areas.
Yesterday Deputy Premier John Barilaro justified continued lockdowns in zero-case regions, saying "you can't be an island surrounded by cases".
The virus was in charge in June, and it's in charge now.

New Stay At Home rules for grandparents in Victoria

Author: Drill, Stephen

Full text: Covid Response Commander Jeroen Weimar confirmed there was a tough interpretation of child care rules in Victoria.
That type of care was no longer considered normal household activity and was now outside the rules.
New restrictions were uploaded in a document put up on the Department of Health and Human Services website this week.
The Stay at Home orders were updated at 11.59pm on Thursday.
Mr Weimar said on Friday that the rules “suck” but they were needed to reduce the spread of the virus.
“We know that for many people if you know, if you’re if your nan looks after your kid, every Tuesday, that’s a normal thing, you may regard that as part of your normal household activity and that’s okay,” Mr Weimar said.
“At this point in time it’s not and that really sucks.
“But we’re trying to do everything we can to reduce this contact now, because those cases we’re talking about on the west, it could happen in any other part of our city, continue to be fuelled by those by those small little exchanges where the virus finds a way through into another grouping, another set of targets.”
The document published this week on the Department of Health and Human Services website puts a clearer interpretation on how grandparents can give care.
Page 15 and 16 of the document restricts grandparents’ care to people who are authorised workers or those with vulnerable children.
A government source confirmed the update, but said it was a clarification of existing rules, rather than a new order.
The details were updated online in the frequently asked questions page this week.
They were further clarified following questions from parents about babysitting rules.
Under the rules, grandparents can only provide childcare if:
• The parents of the child are authorised workers
• The grandchildren are classed as vulnerable
• The child’s parent needs to go to a medical appointment for themselves that the child cannot attend
• To look after children for authorised workers on shift work, and to allow them to sleep
The rules came into effect on Friday, just days after Premier Daniel Andrews had said there were few options to make Victoria’s lockdown measures tougher.
It followed confusion last weekend when childcare was closed in Victoria.
There were questions about whether both or only one parent needed to be considered an authorised worker to access childcare in Victoria.
Two sets of rules had been in place during different lockdowns last year.
The current rules were finally clarified on Sunday evening, stating that only one parent needed to be an authorised worker.
Confused childcare centre staff were swamped with requests on Monday as parents tried to work out if they were able to still send their children.
It comes after grandparents were being urged to get a Covid-19 jab to help get their grandchildren back to school.
Victoria’s chief health officer Professor Brett Sutton said higher take-up rates of vaccination among people over 60 would allow more options for authorities to ease lockdown restrictions.
There is a surplus of six million AstraZeneca vaccines, which is the recommended option for those over 60.
But only 58.85 per cent of over 70s have been fully vaccinated in Australia despite having access to jabs since March.
Prof Sutton said if the rate in that age bracket was closer to 100 per cent, the Victorian government would have more ability to change restrictions.
When asked if grandparents who wanted to get their grandchildren back into classrooms should get a vaccine, Prof Sutton said: “Absolutely.”
“For everything, the protection that they’ll have in terms of going out in the community themselves, their interactions with their broader family, including kids, of course,” he said.
Prof Sutton said higher vaccine coverage of the over 60s was important because they had a higher risk of being hospitalised with Covid-19.
“We know that the higher the coverage for those most at risk individuals, over 60, over 70 prevents hospitalisation and ICU admission,” he said.
“From the global picture and from ICU admissions in Victoria and New South Wales in particular, a fully vaccinated person is a rare individual in ICU.”
He said a close to 100 per cent vaccination rate in that group would keep them out of “ICU and stops them dying”.
National - 2021 - Covid Vaccination Stats
“So, of course, that provides greater assurance that we can ease restrictions without putting that very significant cohort of the population at risk,” Prof Sutton said.
Federal Health Department data shows that almost 60 per cent of those over 70 have been fully vaccinated across Australia.
The fully vaccinated take up in the over 70s age group has jumped from 39.3 per cent four weeks ago.
And 85.8 per cent have had their first dose, which means they were in the system to get a second dose within 12 weeks.
The office of Federal Health Minister Greg Hunt said the Government was guided by the Doherty Institute Modelling on plans to open up at 70 and 80 per cent fully vaccinated rates.
“We have already reached over 81.6 per cent first vaccination for over 60s, and 86.2 per cent first vaccination for over 70s, and 88.6 per cent for Aged Care residents,” a spokesman for Mr Hunt said.
“I’d urge every young person to encourage their grandparents to be vaccinated to protect themselves and their community, and every grandparent to encourage their children and grandchildren to vaccinate, to protect themselves and their community.”
The National Cabinet has agreed that lockdowns would be unlikely when vaccination levels reached 80 per cent across the board, but Prof Sutton said “we know we can keep going”.
Victoria and New South Wales remain in lockdown, with cases continuing to climb.
Victorian Premier Daniel Andrews refused to give a timeline of when students could return to classrooms.
New South Wales Premier Gladys Berejiklian plans to provide a timeline for school reopenings on Friday.
But children in NSW were unlikely to be back in classrooms before the start of term four.
Victoria’s lockdown was scheduled to finish on September 2, but a spike in cases on Thursday has thrown those plans under a cloud.

Full text: The Australian can reveal the modelling, to be discussed at a meeting of national cabinet on Friday, conducted analysis of three scenarios over a 180-day period based on Covid case numbers in the tens, hundreds and thousands when restrictions were lifted and found no material difference in ­expected fatality rates.
The updated modelling, provided to state and territory leaders on Wednesday, comes as Scott Morrison seeks to hold the premiers to the national cabinet agreement for restrictions to be eased at vaccination rates of 70 to 80 per cent.
The Doherty Institute said this week the original advice on its modelling still held, irrespective of case numbers.
The new analysis will quell concerns from state leaders about the outbreak in NSW by suggesting the spiralling number of infections does not present a major obstacle to proceeding with the national cabinet’s four-step reopening strategy.
NSW Premier Gladys Berejiklian on Thursday became the first state leader to commit to returning individual freedoms to fully vaccinated residents amid an outbreak, as the state recorded 1029 cases.
From September 13, restrictions in NSW will be eased for ­fully vaccinated people living outside local government areas of concern, allowing them to participate in outdoor gatherings with up to five people, including children, provided it is within their LGA or 5km from their home.
Residents within LGAs of concern will be able to gather outdoors for recreation, but it will be limited to one hour.
Further restrictions will be eased in October when 70 per cent of the state is fully inoculated.
National cabinet leaders are due to discuss the vaccine rollout among high school students, with the Australian Technical Advisory Group on Immunisation finalising its advice on jabs for children aged 12 to 15.
Responding to calls for children to be included in the national vaccine targets, the Prime Minister said this was not in the advice from the Doherty Institute which had based the transition between the four-steps of the national plan on increasing numbers of people aged 16 and over getting the jab.
“That does not by implication say there is no need to vaccinate children 12 to 15,” Mr Morrison said. “And, that will be a very clear decision of my government that we will need to go ahead and vaccinate children 12 to 15.
“These two objectives are not working against each other, I see them working completely together with each other.”
A preliminary list of exemptions for vaccinated Australians – prepared by Victoria, Tasmania and the Northern Territory – is also on Friday’s national cabinet agenda. Momentum is building to allow returning Australians to isolate at home ahead of Christmas, with national cabinet preparing an overhaul of quarantine rules.
With the hotel quarantine system under stress, the national cabinet will use South Australia’s “at-home” pilot to support a new approach to Covid-19 quarantine arrangements when the country moves out of the suppression phase.
Under national cabinet’s reopening plan, international travel to green zone countries with high vaccine rates or limited Covid-19 cases would resume once the vaccination rate reached 80 per cent double dose coverage. Those countries could include Singapore, the US, Britain, Japan, South Korea and Pacific Island nations.
After Qantas declared it was planning to resume international travel in December, in line with projections that Australia would have reached 80 per cent vaccine coverage, Tourism Minister Dan Tehan said he hoped ­returning Australians could “quarantine at home in the lead-up to Christmas”.
In addition to the South Australia pilot program, former Health Department secretary Jane Halton is leading a second national review of hotel quarantine arrangements alongside Graeme Head, infectious disease expert Peter Collignon and professor Andrew Wilson.
Ms Halton’s first review last year warned that the hotel quarantine system was vulnerable to breaches that were “hard to eliminate”. “It is also an expensive resource and comes at a high cost to individual, social and economic wellbeing,” Ms Halton wrote.
The Australian Health Protection Principal Committee considered two options to quarantine international travellers in June last year, which included reducing the time of quarantine and combining it with home quarantine. The AHPPC opted for the 14-day, hotel-quarantine model because “the risk of Covid-19 in travellers returning from many countries is increasing”.
A senior source close to the process said it was unlikely Australians would “put up with hotel quarantine beyond this year”.
“They want to get life back to normal and they want to travel,” the source said.
Qantas chief executive Alan Joyce, who spoke with Mr Morrison this week, said the resumption of international flights would be influenced by whether travellers could quarantine at home.
NSW Premier Gladys Berejiklian has called on state counterparts to uphold their end of the bargain and reopen once 80 per cent of Australia’s population has been fully vaccinated.
New Zealand, which is facing a Covid-19 outbreak of the Delta strain, this month announced it would adopt a UK-style traffic light system with a tiered ­approach to quarantine measures for returning citizens and travellers. Travellers from countries on its green list must take Covid-19 tests but are not required to quarantine. Unvaccinated travellers from amber countries can quarantine at home for 10 days.
Mr Morrison welcomed the launch of South Australia’s home quarantine program and said record surges in the vaccine rollout, off the back of 335,420 vaccines delivered on Wednesday, gave businesses the confidence to know “they can come through”.
“That their financiers and their investors can have that same confidence, that people will be able to get those hours back and go back to work. That people can get on the bus again and on the tram again and go to work,” Mr Morrison said. “That performers can get on the stage at live venues again. That people can gather in restaurants, and they can do it not just for a couple of days or a couple of weeks, but know that can be their life again going forward, and we can have the certainty.”
Mr Tehan said the federal government expected to see the resumption of interstate travel once the 70 per cent target was achieved, warning any delays would further damage the tourism industry.
“The national plan is our way out of the pandemic, and it’s incredibly important for the tourism industry that we stick to the national plan — 660,000 jobs depend on it,” Mr Tehan said.
Health Department analysis presented to the Prime Minister on Thursday showed that vaccinations had resulted in a much smaller number of deaths from Covid-19 infections in the NSW outbreak this year, about one in 160 cases, than in last year’s Victorian outbreak, when about one in 23 people with Covid-19 died.

Full text: Figures released by The University of Sydney on Thursday found the unvaccinated will make up the bulk of new infections when restrictions are fully lifted.
And it warns the question of whether we have “a soft landing or crash landing” will be determined by hospital preparedness.
Doherty Institute modelling used by the federal government to set the nation’s vaccine targets recommends restrictions be eased once the nation achieves 70-80 per cent vaccination.
At the current vaccination rollout rate, 80 per cent of adults (65 per cent of the total population) are projected to be vaccinated by mid-November, at which point social distancing restrictions are expected to be removed.
But the USYD’s Centre for Complex Systems data found daily Covid-19 case numbers are likely to continue to climb reaching their lockdown peak in early October.
If restrictions are fully lifted when 80 per cent of adults are vaccinated, infections across Australia may surge to 40,000 per day and exceed half a million cases within a month – even with continued testing, tracing, isolation, quarantine and international travel restrictions.
Professor Mikhail Prokopenko, the centre’s director, said their findings were much “steeper” than those in the Doherty Institute report – and that is a reason to worry.
“In a sense the numbers are of the same order, for example if you look at the total cases the Doherty Institute estimated over 180 days, you do get in the hundreds of thousands of cases, maybe 300,000 to 500,000 cases over six months.
“We say what you will experience is in the order of 500,000 in a month or a month-and-half, it’s much steeper.
NED-4439-pandemic-peak
“Similarly if you look at the peak of daily cases we say we could approach 40,000 a day by mid-December or end of the year while Doherty say yes, you could approach up to 50,000 a day or 60,000 a day, but at later date – maybe three months. So in that sense they are not unimaginable numbers, it's the steepness that worries me.”
The study, modelled on daily case numbers from July 26 to August 25, found Covid-19 infections are expected to slow from mid-December, with 75 per cent of the population vaccinated and natural immunity developed by three to five per cent of the entire population by the end of the year.
Alike the Doherty report, the new modelling also found 80 per cent of infections post-lockdown will be in unvaccinated Australians.
Prof Prokopenko said even if we wait until 90 per cent of the population is vaccinated to reopen, the rise in cases will happen but they “will be simply delayed”.
The clear take away from the findings is that the healthcare system needs to be prepared, he said.
“If we wait till 90 per cent and if that is the limit to the vaccination extent then the rise in cases will be simpy delayed but they will still happen,” Prof Prokopenko said.
“So we are simply saying if we are to open at 80 per cent then we should just brace for this surge and the question of whether there will be a soft landing or crash landing is a question about the preparedness of our health system.
“This will depend on the community continuing its high vaccine uptake, people maintaining social distancing over the coming months, and our healthcare system preparing and bolstering itself to meet the surge of hospitalisations which will come after the lockdown.”
“How is our healthcare system prepared to meet this and deal with that surge?”

Full text: Businesses with an annual turnover of up to $1 billion will now be eligible for the Jobsaver program, jointly funded by the state and commonwealth governments.
On Wednesday night the changes to the scheme were signed off by the NSW crisis cabinet as they continued to debate loosening restrictions when vaccinated targets were reached.
Under the expanded relief package to be announced on Thursday, payments would be made at 40 per cent of weekly payroll costs.
Businesses with a turnover of between $250 million and $500 million would get up to $300,000 per week if they had experienced a decline in turnover of at least 50 per cent.
Businesses with a turnover between $500 million and $1 billion would get up to $500,000 per week if they had seen a 70 per cent turnover drop
Under the road-map being considered by crisis cabinet, Covid restrictions could completely revert to settings in place before the Delta outbreak when NSW reaches 80 per cent double-vaccination rates, .
Senior ministers are considering the plan back to normal, which could include reopening measures to restart the economy when 70 per cent double-dose rates are achieved, likely to be in October.
However, September will only see minimal easing of restrictions, designed to improve “wellbeing” of locked-down residents.
The state government’s crisis cabinet signed off on some freedoms that vaccinated people will be able to do come September.
Daily Telegraph - News Feed latest episode
The minimal freedoms are designed, in part, to ensure people continue following strict lockdown rules – even as NSW reported a record number of 919 new cases.
“This is going to be a journey with the community, we need to maintain those high levels of compliance,” chief health officer Kerry Chant said.
A staged return to school is expected to come from Term Four, though possibly not from day one.
There is concern about Covid incursions in rural and regional NSW, and mobility of people through major regional centres.
A cautious approach is expected, but some areas of the state could come out of lockdown at the end of August if they are not being impacted by Covid.
Ministers hope Christmas will largely be back to normal – unless Covid throws a “curveball” at authorities.
Premier Gladys Berejiklian has repeatedly said that when 80 per cent of the population is double-vaccinated, life will return to the settings which were in place before the current outbreak.
Some additional freedoms will be announced for certain vaccinated residents on Thursday, but it is unlikely that there will be any major changes to lockdown rules.
Restaurant and Catering Industry Association boss Wes Lambert said some restrictions on hospitality should be eased in September and then escalate as the state hits 70 per cent and 80 per cent vaccination rates.
“We would like to see a gradual reopening which begins with some outdoor dining with some indoor that then transitions so it’s not just a light switch from nothing to some heavily restricted environments,” Mr Lambert said.
Committee of Sydney strategic director Ehssan Veiszadeh has pushed the government to make schools its priority, with plans in place for outdoor dining, cafes, restaurants, gyms and clubs.
“Give people a timeline of when they (hospitality and gyms) will be allowed to occur with a vaccine certificate. Outdoor dining is quite low risk with fully vaccinated staff and customers,” Mr Veiszadeh said.
Meanwhile, Labor Leader Anthony Albanese has declared his support for the Doherty Institute modelling which allows for some reopening at 80 per cent vaccination coverage.
“I support the national plan. It has proposals at 70 per cent and 80 per cent. It is, as it is written, there is scope there for lockdowns, but targeted if they’re absolutely necessary,” he told the ABC.

Full text: Ninety-one were in isolation throughout their infectious period and 33 were in isolation for part of their infectious period.
Sixty-one cases were infectious in the community, and the isolation status of 844 cases remains under investigation.
One of the three deaths was a man aged in his 30s.
Premier Gladys Berejiklian said no one is coming out of lockdown in NSW this weekend.
The regional lockdown has been extended for another couple of weeks to Friday September 10.
She also said that “additional freedoms” will be given to those who are vaccinated from next month.
From 12.01am, Monday, September 13:
· For those who live outside the LGAs of concern, outdoor gatherings of up to five people (including children, all adults must be vaccinated) will be allowed in a person’s LGA or within 5km of home.
· For those who live in the LGAs of concern households with all adults vaccinated will be able to gather outdoors for recreation (including picnics) within the existing rules (for one hour only, outside curfew hours and within 5km of home). This is in addition to the one hour allowed for exercise.
Ms Berejiklian then called on the community and industry to prepare for opening up more widely when NSW hits 70 per cent double dose vaccination of the eligible population.
She said this could be as soon as the middle of October.
“That is when there will be more freedoms,” she said.
NSW deputy premier John Barilaro said regional NSW was “sitting on a knife’s edge” and they needed to keep the lockdown on to keep people safe as more get vaccinated.
“It is a tinder box waiting to explode,” he said.
NSW Chief Health Officer Dr Kerry Chant said they have 698 people admitted to hospital and 116 people in intensive care, 43 who require ventilation. The age range is from their 20s through to their 70s.
“So, again, Covid can impact in a very serious way on all age groups, and there is no room for complacency,” she said.
“The vast majority of people - 102 of the 116 people in ICU - are not vaccinated. So, again, please do not delay.
“Access vaccines now. Vaccines are available through pharmacies, GPs, through the booking system, so go online. Please get vaccinated.”

PM: JABS FOR KIDS COMING ‘VERY SOON’
Prime Minister Scott Morrison has said 18 million Covid-19 vaccine doses have now been administered in Australia with 1.9 million in the past week alone.
Fifty-five per cent have had their first dose. He described it as “the safe plan” to get Australia out of the pandemic.
He also said “today has been another day of hope” as the final advice from ATAGI will be coming “very, very soon” on vaccinating 12 to 15 year olds.
It comes as more than two-thirds of Australians want lockdowns to end as soon as possible and don’t believe returning to zero Covid-19 cases is achievable.
A new YouGov study revealed most think lockdowns should be lifted after 80 per cent of the population is vaccinated, according to The Australian.
The NSW lockdown has sparked a marked shift in public attitudes towards Covid-19 restrictions, vaccination and government control, according to the poll taken for the Centre for independent Studies think tank.
The YouGov survey found a total of 71 per cent believed Covid-19 restrictions and lockdowns should be raised either as soon as possible or after the national cabinet’s agreed vaccine thresholds were reached, The Australian reports.
Less than a quarter wanted some restrictions to continue until complete elimination of Covid-19 (13 per cent) or even to continue after the pandemic (13 per cent).

VICTORA HAS 80 NEW CASES

Victoria has recorded 80 new locally acquired Covid-19 cases on Thursday, the highest daily figure of the latest outbreak.
The state’s health department announced the new local cases about 9am, which included another 13 mystery infections.
The department said 67 of the 80 new cases could be linked to existing outbreaks.
But alarmingly, only 39 cases - less than half - were in isolation throughout their infectious period, meaning 41 were out in the community.
Victoria’s sixth Covid lockdown is due to end in a week with a call on whether it will be extended drawing ever closer.
Covid-19 commander Jeroen Weimar said it was still possible for contact tracers to get a ring around the outbreak by September 2 but another day over 50 new cases comes as a blow to that hope.
More than 50 new local cases has been recorded on six of the past seven days.
“If we continue to work together, we have pulled six, seven outbreaks now in the last eight months, so collectively as a Victorian community we can absolutely (get a ring around the outbreak),” Mr Weimar said.
It comes as 150,000 bookings to get the Covid vaccine were made on Wednesday at the state government’s mass hubs after the Pfizer jab was finally opened up to Victorians aged 16 to 39.
There are now more than 800 exposure sites in multiple suburbs across metropolitan Melbourne and more than 17,400 people remain in isolation across the state.
There are now 600 active cases across the state, up from 538 on Wednesday.
Covid-19 commander Jeroen Weimar said 114 of the 538 active cases were aged 9 and under, 101 were aged between 10 and 19 years old, and 89 were aged in their 20s.
No new cases were recorded in hotel quarantine on Thursday.

48,000 LIVES SAVED BY TRAVEL BANS
Travel bans imposed at the beginning of 2020 prevented 48,000 Covid cases coming to Australia, new modelling by the CSIRO shows.
The modelling shows the February 1 travel ban from China, which was the first to be implemented, was the most effective at stopping the virus, with 94.5 per cent efficacy.
The March 1 ban on travellers from Iran was much less effective, with a 32 per cent success rate, but the South Korea travel ban implemented on March 5 was almost as successful as the China ban, with 94 per cent efficacy.
The ban on travellers from Italy implemented on March 11 after it became the first country in Europe seriously impacted by Covid-19 was 77 per cent effective, according to the CSIRO model.
“Our modelling shows that without travel restrictions, over 48,000 Covid-19 cases were likely to have been imported to Australia from January to May 2020,” lead researcher Dr Jess Liebig said.
“However all of Australia’s travel bans successfully lowered imported cases into Australia by 88 per cent, to an estimated 6000 cases over the studied period.”
The research team said their model provided a flexible framework that could be used in determining border openings and international travel restrictions in future.

BARNABY JOYCE ATTACKS QLD PREMIER

Deputy Prime Minister Barnaby Joyce has slammed Queensland Premier Annastacia Palaszczuk after she enforced a hard border between NSW and Queensland to stop the spread of Covid-19.
Ms Palaszczuk said Brisbane’s 22 quarantine hotels were all full and could no longer accommodate the large volume of people travelling from NSW, Victoria and the ACT.
The Premier subsequently banned arrivals from those areas for two weeks on Wednesday, sending police and army personnel to patrol the NSW-Queensland border.
Mr Joyce blasted Ms Palaszczuk for the move, stating she was “on the wrong side of history” for pursuing a border lockdown policy that many Australians no longer supported.
“We had the idiot position at one stage … where a person‘s front gate was in Queensland, the house was in NSW and they had to get a permit to drive out or drive in,” Mr Joyce told Sky News Australia host Chris Kenny.
“This is the sort of lunacy that’s happening,” he said.
The Deputy PM accused Ms Palaszczuk of being tone deaf to Australians’ feelings about the management of Covid-19, accusing her of “not reading the tea leaves”.
“People have moved on ... what people were highly supportive of and right behind maybe some months ago, now they just want their lives back,” Mr Joyce said.
“The only job you have now is to work to a process of giving Australia back the liberties and freedoms that all the people who voted for you were born with.”
But Ms Palaszczuk was firm in her decision, insisting her state “simply does not have any room at the moment”.
“Queensland is being loved to death,” she said as the border crackdown came into force on Wednesday.
But Mr Joyce told Sky News that Ms Palaszczuk was cheering for a losing team in taking such a hard-line stance.
“If you're banging on about keeping people locked up in their house, mothers locked up in their houses, if you’re being part of that process, no matter what side of the border it affects, you’re on the wrong side of history,” he said.
“Egotistical plays for power that might have worked maybe half a year ago, but by gosh they ain't working now.”
The Queensland border shutdown is set to last until September 8.
Essential workers are permitted to cross the NSW-Queensland border only if they have received at least one dose of the Covid-19 vaccine.

WOMAN, 30, DIES IN NSW
Ianeta Isaako, a 30-year-old mother of three, on Monday became the youngest woman in NSW to die with the virus.
Friends and family have written on social media with tributes to Mrs Isaako and well wishes to her husband Sako, who is also fighting Covid-19.
“I know there is nothing in this world matters anymore, when death takes the most beautiful part of your heart. I want you to think of what she would've wanted you to do,” one person wrote.
“My heart is broken,” said another.
Health officials on Tuesday afternoon confirmed Mrs Isaako’s death, the 75th since NSW’s latest outbreak began on June 16.
“NSW Health extends its deepest sympathies to her loved ones,” the department said.
“This tragic death is being investigated by the Western Sydney Local Health District.”
Her death has been referred to the coroner.
Earlier on Tuesday, NSW chief health officer Kerry Chant said authorities were aware of the media reports but were unable to determine the cause of her death.
It is not yet known if the woman had any underlying health conditions or whether or not she was vaccinated against Covid-19.
NSW Premier Gladys Berejiklian praised Blacktown, the local government area the woman lived in, for dramatically ramping up its vaccine rollout.
“We've seen Blacktown go from one of the lowest rates of vaccination to the highest in the state. Thank you to the people from Blacktown for coming forward and getting the jab,”.
Six million people have now received their first vaccine dose in NSW, which recorded 753 new locally acquired cases of Covid-19 on Tuesday.
PM’S CHRISTMAS PLAN
Prime Minister Scott Morrison says there is no reason families can’t be reunited for Christmas, but only if the states stick to the agreed national vaccination plan.
Australia’s road map to a Covid normal life has been under threat in recent days as Western Australia and Queensland indicated they want to keep their borders closed to stop the virus creeping in from NSW.
But Mr Morrison on Tuesday urged state premiers not to waiver from the national plan to ease restrictions when vaccination rates hit 70 and 80 per cent.
“Let me be clear, there is nothing more powerful to deal with Covid-19 than the vaccine,” he told Sunrise.
“There is no government, no individual, no set of border protections that is more powerful than the vaccine.
“Once the vaccine is there at 70 and 80 per cent, you do more harm than good to your people by locking them down and locking them up and keeping them in the cave.”
Mr Morrison said if the plan was followed then there was “no reason” why Australians couldn’t be reunited for Christmas.
“I believe we will be able to be in that position if we had those marks of 70 per cent and 80 per cent because there is no reason why you shouldn't be,” he said.
The prime minister has sought to ramp up the pressure on the states to fall into line and to prepare Australians for more cases and deaths as restrictions ease.
Queensland Premier Annastacia Palaszczuk on Monday said “the goalposts have changed” since she agreed to the plan.
The plan, Ms Palaszczuk argued, was modelled on an initial outbreak of 30 cases, noting there are now “thousands” of cases across Australia.
“This is a book that hasn’t been written, folks. This is uncharted territory,” she said.
But late Monday evening, the Doherty Institute – which mapped Australia’s way out of the pandemic – said reopening the country was still safe despite higher case numbers.
“There is light at the end of the tunnel – once we achieve 70 per cent -80 per cent vaccination we will see less transmission of Covid-19 and fewer people with severe illness, and therefore fewer hospitalisations and deaths,” a statement read.
“Covid-19 won’t go away but it will be easier to control in the future.”
“This level of vaccination will make it easier to live with the virus, as we do with other viruses such as the flu.
“However, it won’t be possible to maintain a situation where there are no cases at all.”
The Doherty Institute estimated at phase B – or 70 per cent – Australia could see 385,983 symptomatic cases of Covid-19 and 1457 deaths over six months.
Testing and tracing cases as well as isolating and quarantining those who test positive, will assist in keeping the numbers down.
Mr Morrison said the restrictions in this phase is just “common sense”.
“There is not zero restrictions, there are common sense baseline level restrictions and I wouldn't even call them restrictions, it’s just common sense behaviour,” he said.
“Washing your hands and maintaining good hygiene and doing all that sort of common sense stuff.”

Tom Minear: Alarming Covid modelling divorced from reality

Full text: The bottom line? “Assuming 80 per cent vaccination coverage for only those over 16, as per the national plan, there could be approximately 25,000 fatalities,” an ANU professor said.
A slew of equally alarming news stories quickly emerged, prompting frenzied commentary. Greens leader Adam Bandt said the “terrifying” modelling showed the plan would send kids “straight to the ICU”.
At this point, there are two things you need to know. A scientific model is not a crystal ball – it does not describe the future, but it offers an educated guess. In that sense, the ANU’s work could be a useful contrast to the Doherty Institute model, which underpins the national plan.
It could – and this is the part you really need to know – if it wasn’t based on an assumption divorced from reality. In the words of Walter and Eliza Hall Institute Professor Ivo Mueller, the ANU model is unrealistic, unhelpful and irresponsible. Why? Because it assumes that once vaccination thresholds are reached, Australia will let Covid rip.
The national cabinet’s plan actually mandates ongoing low-level restrictions, likely to include masks, density limits and QR code check-ins. Authorities will also persist with testing, tracing, isolation and quarantine to contain the virus.
The Doherty Institute forecasts that even if these containment measures are overrun once 80 per cent are vaccinated, 761 people will die in six months – not 25,000. If these measures work effectively, the predicted death toll is six.
Others sought to twist the Doherty work this week by highlighting a table from their report which purported to show Australia would remain in lockdown 31 per cent of the time once the 80 per cent vaccination threshold was reached if tracing and testing did not keep up.
This overlooked another table which predicted the figure would be 0 per cent – no more lockdowns – if low-level restrictions were maintained, as the national cabinet agreed to do.
Science can be spun in many directions. It was a point Anthony Albanese made to Labor MPs this week as he encouraged them to read the national plan, not “Morrison’s spin on it”.
If the events of recent days have taught us anything, it is that far too many people involved in the debate that will define Australia’s future have not bothered to read this plan and the modelling upon which it is based. Either that, or they are deliberately distorting the details.
There are some legitimate arguments to be had about the way forward.
Parents are rightly concerned about reopening when their children are unvaccinated. That’s why Scott Morrison is pushing as quickly as the medical advice will allow to open jabs for kids over 12. No country in the world is vaccinating children younger than that, but trials continue.
The NSW and Victorian outbreaks have also sparked questions about whether the Doherty model would be skewed by reopening with hundreds of cases a day. The institute’s experts have now affirmed this situation does not alter the required vaccination thresholds.
Whether containment measures can keep up once the country is open is another issue, raised particularly by Albanese’s team. There are no guarantees, although state authorities have had 18 months to get it right, and higher vaccination rates make their job easier.
But with the backing of the national cabinet – in their meetings if not in public – the PM has decided that once enough Australians are vaccinated, lockdowns do more harm than good. On this point, the evidence is in his favour, both on health and economic outcomes.
Pollsters judge Morrison has also correctly captured the mood of the country.
“If not at 70 per cent and 80 per cent,” he asked this week, “then when? We must make that move ... the lockdowns now being endured are taking an extremely heavy toll.”
Albanese may think this is spin, dubbing Morrison the “gaslight on the hill”, but if he disputes the national plan then the PM will paint him as a Covid-zero zealot supporting indefinite lockdowns. Labor cannot afford for that to stick.
The questions about the plan need to be resolved, and have prompted complaints from WA and Queensland which threaten to derail yet another national cabinet agreement.
Morrison has demonstrated, however, that he will not bow any more to the popular premiers. While he has been known to shrink in the face of difficult fights, this is his red line, drawn in the week marking three years since he claimed the nation’s top job.
On Saturday, Morrison will reach another milestone as the longest-serving PM since John Howard. If he wins the next election, he’ll move well into the top 10 of all time. For someone still seen by some to be an accidental leader, this would be rare air.
Morrison won his first election with a small-target strategy. He will only win again by meeting the most important target of all.

45 new cases, vaccine booking website buckles under rush of Pfizer bookings

Full text: The Covid crisis has been labelled “an outbreak of young people”, with Pfizer bookings now open to young Victorians and VCE students being given vaccine priority.
It comes as the state recorded 45 Covid cases overnight after a bumper day of testing.
Health Minister Martin Foley said 114 of the state’s active cases were aged under nine, 101 aged between 10 and 19, and 89 are in their 20s.
He said that while it was “heartening” that case numbers had reduced, the outbreak risk was still very real.
“It’s our public health officials that tell us there’s a lot of work to do,” Mr Foley said. “We know that numbers bounce around.”
The latest infections include 10 linked to MyCentre childcare in Broadmeadows; 10 household contacts of known cases; nine linked to the Shepparton/Royal Melbourne Hospital outbreak; four linked to Hobsons Bay, two to North Melbourne and one to Glenroy West primary.
There are also nine mystery cases. Victoria now has 56 mystery cases still under investigation.
Authorities also revealed the state’s latest outbreak is spreading among essential workers, with 28 of the latest cases in the community while infectious.
Health department deputy secretary Kate Matson revealed an alarming detail, saying some cases waited a week before being tested.
“The cases we are seeing are usually permitted workers – healthcare workers, people who work in construction and are out and about,” she said.
“This also reiterates why getting tested with symptoms is always our No.1 message.
“But more specifically, please, get tested as soon as you develop those symptoms. That day, or the next day, if it’s too late in the day to access a testing site.
“Some of the recent cases that I’ve mentioned haven’t been tested for seven or eight days.”

NEW INFLUX OF MEDICS FOR VICTORIA Roughly 350 highly trained medical professionals from overseas will be brought to Victoria to take up critical roles in our health system over the next few months.
The professionals will be employed in almost 30 public health services across Victoria, including in rural and regional areas, as the state battles with increasing numbers of local staff being furloughed.
About 90 per cent of the health professionals are doctors and the remainder are specialist nurses or midwives.
Some are experienced professionals who will share critical skills, supervision and knowledge while in Australia.
Many are resident hospital medical officers who will meet staffing demands in emergency departments and other critical areas.
Almost all will start by October 2021, a government spokeswoman confirmed.
The spokeswoman said the pandemic had placed “enormous pressure” on all parts of the health system, including the state’s workforce testing and vaccinating workforce.
“To ensure our health services continue to deliver high quality care, we are recruiting highly trained medical professionals from overseas that will take up critical roles in our health system,” she said.
“Roughly 350 health professionals will take up critical roles in our health system over the next few months, with the first group of arrivals set to work across Melbourne and Bendigo.”
All of the recruited health workers have an occupation identified on the Priority Migration Skilled Occupation List.

VACCINE BOOKING WEBSITE SWAMPED The health department’s online vaccination booking service was crushed by high demand as Pfizer bookings opened to the under-40s, leaving people stuck in an online queue to claim an appointment.
The booking system on Wednesday left people unable to schedule appointments over the phone, forcing them to abandon their call and ring back.
Visitors to the booking site were also met with slowed loading times before the landing page timed out.
Photos from outside the Melbourne Convention and Exhibition Centre vaccination centre on Wednesday morning showed hundreds of people lining up awaiting their Covid jab.
Long queues were also being reported at Royal Exhibition Building hub in Carlton and in St Kilda.
Deputy secretary for vaccines Naomi Bromley said 25,000 vaccine bookings had been made by 9am.
There were also 50,000 hits per minute on the Victorian government’s vaccination website on Wednesday morning.
More than 1.3 million calls had been to the hotline as of 11am Wednesday.
“Tens of thousands of Victorians are trying to book in right now,” Ms Bromley said.
“So it is slow. It is busy. Please be patient. Please be kind to our staff.
“But people are getting through and making those bookings, which is really fantastic. There are still plenty of appointments available.
“We have had an extraordinary response to the changes to eligibility.”
Health Minister Martin Foley reminded Victorians people aged 16 and 17 are only eligible for Pfizer, while people aged 18 to 59 are eligible for either Pfizer or AstraZeneca.
People aged over 60 are eligible for AstraZeneca.
“We have seen an absolutely extraordinary level of influx of bookings through our state-run clinics this morning,” Mr Foley said.
“We’ve seen the system put under substantial pressure, but at the same time we’ve seen huge numbers of bookings being made.
“What is fantastic to see is so many people … want to be part of the recovery of our way out of this pandemic through the vaccination program.”
NED-4292-Percentage-of-eligible-population-fully-vaccinated-by-state
Mr Foley refused to “rule anything in or not” when it came to more freedoms for vaccinated Victorians when the state reached 70 per cent coverage.
Almost half a million Victorians aged over 16 are finally able to get a Pfizer jab after state-run clinics released more than 830,000 new first-dose appointments — including 450,000 Pfizer shots — at 7am.
It means anyone aged between 16 and 39, who is not part of a priority group, will be given their first shot at securing a Pfizer vaccine.
Eligible young Victorians who booked their vaccine appointment on Wednesday or earlier would be offered both Pfizer and AstraZeneca when they arrive at their appointment.
But from Thursday onwards, Victoria needed to book the specific vaccine they want to receive.

Victoria Vaccine Locator
919 NEW CASES IN NSW NSW has announced another grim record, with 919 new infections overnight.
Two more Covid patients have died, including a woman in her 30s.
Only 106 of those were confirmed to be in isolation for their entire infectious period.
About 125,000 tests were taken in the community on Tuesday.
Mr Foley flagged tougher border closures with NSW, saying Victoria’s biggest threat was importing the virus again from its northern neighbour.
“This is where is came from in the last couple of incursions. We cannot send it back, I wish we could, but what we can do is take all of the measures that the public health team recommended to us to keep that border protection as strong as possible,” he said.
“Given the deteriorating position in NSW, I don’t think we can rule out further measures being taken.”
Victoria’s border with NSW has been closed completely since July 20, and border bubble residents can only cross the Murray with a permit for five permitted reasons.

JAB PRIORITY FOR VCE STUDENTS Deputy Premier James Merlino announced all final year students would be given priority to get vaccinated before sitting their exams, which begin on October 4.
Speaking in his capacity as Education Minister, he said he wanted to give final- year students the confidence they deserved for their last few months of school.
“The priority for us is to make sure that all final-year students have received their vaccination before they start sitting their exams on October 4,” Mr Merlino said.
“We do have a priority to make sure that all year 12 students are vaccinated by the time we start exams.”
Mr Merlino said the quickest path to reach 70 per cent vaccination rates was to expand eligibility.
He said the state government would be asking the commonwealth for extra supply.
“We want our year 12s vaccinated, we want students aged over 12 to have at least one dose, but that is going to be subject to supply,” he said.
“We need that supply. As soon as we get it, we will be putting it into arms.
“This is about sending a very strong message to year 12 students, particularly in their final months, giving them confidence and clarity that they can, you know, really tackle their last few months of study and give it their best shot.”
Despite the vaccine announcement, Mr Merlino said he still couldn’t provide a definitive answer as to when schools would reopen.
“It is always, and has to be, subjected to public health advice,” he said. “I want kids back at schools as soon as possible.”
Mr Merlino also confirmed there would be no penalties for students that choose to not get vaccinated.

SINGLE-DIGIT CASES MAY NOT BE NEEDED Victoria’s lockdown could be lifted with double-digit daily cases if authorities believe contact tracers have “got their arms around” the outbreak.
Fears are mounting the state could face strict restrictions until 70 per cent of the adult population is fully vaccinated – the target agreed by national cabinet as the trigger to end to broad shutdowns.
But while Victoria’s lockdown is not expected to end on schedule by September 2, authorities still hope they can control the latest outbreak, and daily cases may not need to be in single digits for that to happen.
A Health Department source said: “It will be more about how many mystery cases are there? Do the contact tracers believe they have their arms around it?”
New South Wales will soon unveil the restrictions it will ease for fully vaccinated residents next month, having ­already delivered first doses to more than 60 per cent of eligible adults.
How Covid spreads
According to Doherty Institute modelling, if an outbreak started when 60 per cent of the population was fully vaccinated and there were minimal ­restrictions, deaths across Australia throughout a six-month period could still be limited to 30 – provided testing, tracing, isolation and quarantine measures were working at an optimal level.
But as many as 3591 lives would be lost – about 20 a day – if the public health response faltered.
In that scenario, the institute’s modelling – which underpins the national cabinet’s plan – forecast more than 100,000 cases a month, leading to more than 1000 deaths among fully vaccinated people, likely those who were elderly or were suffering other medical conditions.
If Victoria maintains its present rate of vaccination, 60 per cent of over-16s will be fully immunised by October 13, 70 per cent by October 30 and 80 per cent by November 16.
Daniel Andrews would not comment on the NSW plan to begin easing restrictions, but said he was confident Victoria would “have options that Sydney won’t have” in coming weeks.
“We’ve got a chance of having some options and some choices to make between now and 70 per cent,” the Premier said.
“That’s what we’re working towards.”
Doherty director Professor Sharon Lewin said: “As you get higher levels of vaccination, then the strain … on the public health system reduces, because vaccination not only reduces hospitalisation and deaths, it also reduces transmission”.
The institute said testing, tracing, isolation and quarantine measures were working in NSW and Victoria to reduce the spread of the virus, and that “these measures will become more effective with more people vaccinated”.
University of Melbourne epidemiologist Professor Tony Blakely argued this week ­Victoria could switch to a looser lockdown – enabling some ­industries to restart and people to spend more time outside – to control numbers before the vaccination thresholds were met.
Vic Locally-acquired Covid-19
The Herald Sun understands the federal government will not push the states to ease restrictions before that point.
But while Mr Andrews dodged questions about Prof Blakely’s suggestions on Monday, he said on Tuesday the state’s settings were “constantly reviewed”, based on the number of mystery cases and cases not in isolation.
Scott Morrison said the lower death rate during the current NSW outbreak compared to Victoria’s second wave last year showed “you can live with this virus when you reach those levels of vaccination”.
“At 70 and 80 per cent you can reopen safely,” the Prime Minister said.
Further work from the institute is expected to be presented to national cabinet this Friday.

QLD PAUSES INTERSTATE RELOCATIONS Premier Annastacia Palaszczuk has announced a two-week pause on relocations to Queensland as the state’s quarantine hotels reached capacity.
It comes as the state records no new Covid cases and two truck drivers who tested positive on Tuesday being classified as false positives.
Starting from 12pm Wednesday, Queensland is pausing allowing people to relocate for two weeks.
The pause will not affect people accessing medical treatment or other special circumstances including bereavement.
The Premier said Queensland had been overwhelmed by new arrivals from interstate hot spots Victoria, NSW and the ACT.
“While we have allowed genuine relocations for work and other purposes, it has overwhelmed our hotels and it has to be stopped for at least the next fortnight,” Ms Palaszczuk said.
CITY LINKED TO SHEPP OUTBREAK Genomic sequencing has strongly linked the worsening Shepparton outbreak to a previous cluster in Glenroy.
When asked about the worsening outbreak in the Goulburn Valley city, which is facing a mass shortage of staff, Mr Foley said the government was looking at a number of measures to provide support.
The minister said a “substantial” number of healthcare staff would be deployed to Shepparton to assist Goulburn Valley health, in response to a significant number of local staff being furloughed after being identified as close contacts, or having visited an exposure site.
Mr Foley said as of Tuesday night, there were no confirmed cases within Shepparton’s Indigenous population.
Despite authorities revealing case numbers would rise in coming days, Premier Daniel Andrews said it was “absolutely doable” for Victoria to get to zero or limited cases.
Seven of the new cases are linked to the Shepparton outbreak, while a further four are linked to the Royal Melbourne Hospital, where 450 staff have been furloughed.
Covid-19 commander Jeroen Weimar said the hospital cluster had been epidemiologically linked to Shepparton, with genomic sequencing also revealing a link between the regional hub and Glenroy.
Mr Weimar said that link had given contact tracers a good steer on finding an acquisition source.

MORE RENT RELIEF FOR BUSINESSES More Victorian businesses will now be eligible for rent relief under changes that allow tenants to choose which period of time they are reporting their losses from coronavirus restrictions.
Under the original design of for Commercial Tenant Rent Relief scheme, businesses had to prove they had lost significant revenue by comparing the final quarter of the 2020/21 financial year to the final quarter of 2018/19.
But new flexible laws will allow tenants to choose any three consecutive months between April 1 and September 30 this year.
These would then be measured against their income for the same period in 2019.
Under the scheme, signed off by the Victorian governor on Tuesday, rent relief will kick in for struggling businesses who have lost more than 30 per cent of their trade.
The discount will depend on how much money they have missed out on, with a tenant who has lost 50 per cent turnover able to negotiate for half their rent to be reduced.
Out of the money discounted, half must be waived while the rest can be deferred.
Landlords and tenants are encouraged to negotiate agreements between themselves but the Victorian Small Business Commission is available assist with mediation.
Any new businesses that have open since April 19, 2019 are eligible.
Commercial rent relief fact box Vic
“We know businesses are doing it tough – that’s why it’s important that we continue to back them with practical measures, including rent relief,” Small Business Minister Jaala Pulford said.
“We want everyone to get a fair outcome – the VSBC will provide free support to businesses to help them negotiate an agreement with landlords, if they’re unable to reach agreement themselves.”
The new rent relief program applies from when it was announced, July 28, and will continue until January 15, 2022.
Landlords who provide discounts can apply for land tax relief up to 25 per cent and smaller landlords who are struggling can apply for hardship payments from a $20m fund.
Australian Hotels Association president David Canny welcomed the government’s scheme.
He said business support, payments for staff and rent were the three biggest issues keeping his members awake at night.
“This is a lifeline for many operators who operator under a leasehold,” he said.
“There are other costs (of business) while you close but rent is a massive.
“On the early reading of those regulations, the government have listened … A lot of operators will sleep a bit easier tonight with that detail.”

Full text: Dozens of defence force troops will begin manning the Queensland/NSW border on Wednesday, in an attempt to keep the Delta strain out of the Sunshine State, where just two “low risk” cases were recorded on Tuesday.
Throughout the pandemic, Queensland has kept its total case numbers below 2000 and has routinely implemented elimination strategies whenever there has been an outbreak.
However, on Wednesday infectious disease specialist Dr Paul Griffin told Today there will eventually be another outbreak in the state, either by domestic borders or a hotel quarantine breach.
He said vaccination is the best and only tool available to control it.
“There is so much Covid around it is unrealistic for us to expect to keep it out altogether,” he said.
“We need to do everything that we can to get on top of it in terms of controlling it in Queensland.
“We have excellent rates of testing and we need to keep that up, and the use of masks is great. But … getting as many people vaccinated, that is the key.”
Dr Griffin said it was “unrealistic” for Queensland to think it could keep Covid-19 out.
“I think it will get in,” he said.
His sentiment has been echoed by the Director of the Doherty Institute, Professor Sharon Lewin, who said despite zero cases being the ideal outcome, it is not sustainable.
“I’m sure they (Queenslanders and Western Australians) want to have open borders and return to some normality of how we will live, movement around the country and international travel,” she told Sunrise.
“I’m sure every Australian wants that.
“To achieve that, the prediction is that we can safely move from phase A to phase B with high vaccination rates and good test, trace and isolate measures.
“We will still make every effort to stop transmission, but we don’t need to get to that very difficult spot of zero.
“If we can keep it under control, we won’t see escalating outbreaks, and that should well be achieved in those states enjoying zero Covid-19. They can live with low levels of Covid.”
Pressure is mounting on the Queensland and WA Premiers to make a commitment to national cabinet’s staged reopening road map, built on the Doherty Institute’s modelling.
In modelling presented to national cabinet last month, when 70 per cent of the eligible population is double jabbed, the country can move to Phase B, where restrictions and lockdowns are possible, but less likely.
At 80 per cent, Phase C will begin, with lockdowns only being “highly targeted”.
However, because the initial modelling was based on a seeding event of 30 cases, some state leaders are concerned about the impact thousands of cases a day could have.
In a statement on Monday, the Doherty Institute said it would be impossible to “maintain a situation where there are no cases at all”.
“The focus will shift to keeping the number of people going into hospital and dying at a minimum,” the Institute said.
“We’ve learned … that there is no ‘freedom day’.”
Keeping case numbers relatively stable will not only rely on high rates of vaccination, but also strong public health measures, namely testing, contact tracing, isolating and quarantining.
As of Wednesday morning, 30.88 per cent of Australians over the age of 16 have been fully vaccinated, and 53.56 per cent have received their first dose.
In the past seven days, an average of 118,000 people per day were vaccinated.
If the current rate of vaccination continues, Australia could move to the transition phase (70 per cent) by late October, while the consolidation phase (80 per cent) could be reached by mid-November.

Full text: Victoria has recorded 45 Covid cases overnight after a bumper day of testing.
Those infections include nine mystery cases and 28 who were in the community while infectious.
There are currently 56 mystery cases still under investigation in Victoria, with a total of 538 active cases.
It comes on a day where more than 53,000 Victorians turned out to get tested, and more than 31,600 vaccine doses were administered.
It comes as the health department’s online vaccination booking service has been crushed by high demand, leaving people stuck waiting in an online queue to claim an appointment.
The booking system on Wednesday also left people unable to schedule appointments over the phone, forcing them to abandon their call and ring back.
Visitors to the booking site are also met with slowed loading times before the landing page times out.
Almost half a million Victorians aged over 16 will finally be able to get a Pfizer jab from today.
The Victorian government at 7am threw open more than 830,000 new first-dose appointments at state-run facilities over the next month – including 450,000 Pfizer shots.
It means anyone aged between 16 and 39, not part of a priority group, will be given their first shot at securing a Pfizer vaccine.

NED-4292-Percentage-of-eligible-population-fully-vaccinated-by-state

SINGLE-DIGIT CASES MAY NOT BE NEEDED Victoria’s lockdown could be lifted with double-digit daily cases if authorities believe contact tracers have “got their arms around” the outbreak.
Fears are mounting the state could face strict restrictions until 70 per cent of the adult population is fully vaccinated – the target agreed by national cabinet as the trigger to end to broad shutdowns.
But while Victoria’s lockdown is not expected to end on schedule by September 2, authorities still hope they can control the latest outbreak, and daily cases may not need to be in single digits for that to happen.
A Health Department source said: “It will be more about how many mystery cases are there? Do the contact tracers believe they have their arms around it?”
New South Wales will soon unveil the restrictions it will ease for fully vaccinated residents next month, having ­already delivered first doses to more than 60 per cent of eligible adults.
How covid spreads
According to Doherty Institute modelling, if an outbreak started when 60 per cent of the population was fully vaccinated and there were minimal ­restrictions, deaths across Australia throughout a six-month period could still be limited to 30 – provided testing, tracing, isolation and quarantine measures were working at an optimal level.
But as many as 3591 lives would be lost – about 20 a day – if the public health response faltered.
In that scenario, the institute’s modelling – which underpins the national cabinet’s plan – forecast more than 100,000 cases a month, leading to more than 1000 deaths among fully vaccinated people, likely those who were elderly or were suffering other medical conditions.
If Victoria maintains its present rate of vaccination, 60 per cent of over-16s will be fully immunised by October 13, 70 per cent by October 30 and 80 per cent by November 16.
Daniel Andrews would not comment on the NSW plan to begin easing restrictions, but said he was confident Victoria would “have options that Sydney won’t have” in coming weeks.
“We’ve got a chance of having some options and some choices to make between now and 70 per cent,” the Premier said.
“That’s what we’re working towards.”
Doherty director Professor Sharon Lewin said: “As you get higher levels of vaccination, then the strain … on the public health system reduces, because vaccination not only reduces hospitalisation and deaths, it also reduces transmission.”
The institute said testing, tracing, isolation and quarantine measures were working in NSW and Victoria to reduce the spread of the virus, and that “these measures will become more effective with more people vaccinated”.
University of Melbourne epidemiologist Professor Tony Blakely argued this week ­Victoria could switch to a looser lockdown – enabling some ­industries to restart and people to spend more time outside – to control numbers before the vaccination thresholds were met.
Vic Locally-acquired Covid-19
The Herald Sun understands the federal government will not push the states to ease restrictions before that point.
But while Mr Andrews dodged questions about Prof Blakely’s suggestions on Monday, he said on Tuesday the state’s settings were “constantly reviewed”, based on the number of mystery cases and cases not in isolation.
Scott Morrison said the lower death rate during the current NSW outbreak compared to Victoria’s second wave last year showed “you can live with this virus when you reach those levels of vaccination”.
“At 70 and 80 per cent you can reopen safely,” the Prime Minister said.
Further work from the institute is expected to be presented to national cabinet this Friday.
NED-4150-Pathway-out-of-pandemic

CITY LINKED TO SHEPP OUTBREAK Genomic sequencing has strongly linked the worsening Shepparton outbreak to a previous cluster in Glenroy.
Victoria on Tuesday recorded 50 new locally acquired cases, with just 11 – recorded from 48,424 tests – in isolation for their infectious period.
Forty were linked to known outbreaks, while the source of acquisition for 10 infections is still under investigation, but some clear linkages to hot spot areas have been made.
Despite authorities revealing case numbers would rise in coming days, Premier Daniel Andrews said it was “absolutely doable” for Victoria to get to zero or limited cases.
Seven of the new cases are linked to the Shepparton outbreak, while a further four are linked to the Royal Melbourne Hospital, where 450 staff have been furloughed.
Covid-19 commander Jeroen Weimar said the hospital cluster had been epidemiologically linked to Shepparton, with genomic sequencing also revealing a link between the regional hub and Glenroy.
Mr Weimar said that link had given contact tracers a good steer on finding an acquisition source.

MORE RENT RELIEF FOR BUSINESSES More Victorian businesses will now be eligible for rent relief under changes that let tenants choose which period of time they are reporting their losses from coronavirus restrictions.
Under the original design of for Commercial Tenant Rent Relief scheme, businesses had to prove they had lost significant revenue by comparing the final quarter of the 2020/21 financial year to the final quarter of 2018/19.
But new flexible laws will allow tenants to choose any three consecutive months between April 1 and September 30 this year.
These would then be measured against their income for the same period in 2019.
Under the scheme, signed off by the Victorian Governor on Tuesday, rent relief will kick in for struggling businesses who have lost more than 30 per cent of their trade.
The discount will depend on how much money they have missed out on, with a tenant who has lost 50 per cent turnover able to negotiate for half their rent to be reduced.
Out of the money discounted, half must be waived while the rest can be deferred.
Landlords and tenants are encouraged to negotiate agreements between themselves but the Victorian Small Business Commission is available assist with mediation.
Any new businesses that have open since April 19, 2019 are eligible.
“We know businesses are doing it tough – that’s why it’s important that we continue to back them with practical measures, including rent relief,” Small Business Minister Jaala Pulford said.
“We want everyone to get a fair outcome – the VSBC will provide free support to businesses to help them negotiate an agreement with landlords, if they’re unable to reach agreement themselves.”
Commercial rent relief fact box VicThe new rent relief program applies from when it was announced, July 28, and will continue until January 15, 2022.
Landlords who provide discounts can apply for land tax relief up to 25 per cent and smaller landlords who are struggling can apply for hardship payments from a $20 million fund.
Australian Hotels Association president David Canny welcomed the government’s scheme.
He said business support, payments for staff and rent were the three biggest issues keeping his members awake at night.
“This is a lifeline for many operators who operator under a leasehold,” he said.
“There are other costs (of business) while you close but rent is a massive.
“On the early reading of those regulations, the government have listened … A lot of operators will sleep a bit easier tonight with that detail.”

Full text: A woman in her 30s died in her home and a man in his 80s died in hospital. The male caught the disease at the Greenwood Aged Care in Normanhurst and takes the death toll linked to the facility to three.
“There is no doubt people would be alarmed by rising case numbers but (it shows) vaccines work because our hospitalisation rate is relatively low,” Ms Berejiklian said.
“A measure of how we are doing is keeping people out of hospital and stopping people from dying. That is the most important measure.”
The state’s chief health officer Dr Kerry Chant said there are 645 people in NSW hospitals, with 113 of these cases in intensive care, of which 40 are on a ventilator.
She noted 98 of the hospital patients have not been vaccinated.
Health Minister Brad Hazzard said there was “no doubt” the health system was under pressure.
Dr Chant also echoed those comments.
“We have to be very honest that the surge in cases has put stress on the health system,” she said, noting there had been a delay in turnaround times after testing.
She urged people who don’t have symptoms, haven’t knowingly been exposed to the virus and aren’t living in areas of concern not to get tested and leave those resources to those who are sick or have been knowingly exposed.
“Don’t use those scarce testing resources because we need to get the turnaround times for tests down as soon as possible,” she said.
Dr Chant also issued a desperate plea to young people in areas of concern to go and get jabbed with one of the priority Pfizer vaccines.
“The modelling suggests if we can get that group vaccinated, we will break the transmission chain,” she said.
“It will take a while … but the solution is in our hands.”
The news comes after crisis talks were held about whether or not to extend the regional NSW lockdown beyond August 28 as Covid spot fires continued to take hold.
More than 125,000 people got vaccinated against Covid-19 in the last 24 hours meaning a third of the population is fully vaccinated.

ALARMING TREND IN VICTORIA
Victoria recorded 45 new locally acquired Covid-19 cases on Wednesday as the Pfizer vaccine was opened up to those aged under 40.
The state’s health department announced the new local cases about 8.45am, which included another nine mystery infections.
The department said 36 of the 45 new cases could be linked to existing outbreaks.
But alarmingly, only 17 cases were in isolation throughout their infectious period, meaning 19 were out in the community.
Hopes of the lockdown being eased on September 2 are fading fast after the state recorded five straight days of 50 local cases and above before Wednesday’s figure.
It comes as the Pfizer vaccine was made available to Victorians aged 16 to 39 years old from 7am on Wednesday.
Premier Daniel Andrews revealed Victorians in that age bracket would be able to book a Pfizer jab from 7am on Wednesday at the state-run vaccination centres.
He also announced an extra 830,000 first dose vaccination appointments would be made available, 450,000 of which would be Pfizer.
But in their rush to get vaccinated, young Victorians again crashed the state government’s booking website on Wednesday morning.
The website said they were currently experiencing a high demand for registrations and bookings and those wanting to make an appointment had been placed in a queue.
“I don’t know if you can build a website big enough for over 1.2 million people who want to get vaccinated,” the Premier said of the website crash on Tuesday.
There are now more than 760 exposure sites in multiple suburbs across metropolitan Melbourne and more than 14,700 people remain in isolation across the state.
There are now 538 active cases across the state, up from 522 on Tuesday.
Covid-19 commander Jeroen Weimar said 113 of the 522 active cases were aged 9 and under, 101 were aged between 10 and 19 years old, and 92 were aged in their 20s.
No new cases were recorded in hotel quarantine on Wednesday.

48,000 LIVES SAVED BY TRAVEL BANS
Travel bans imposed at the beginning of 2020 prevented 48,000 Covid cases coming to Australia, new modelling by the CSIRO shows.
The modelling shows the February 1 travel ban from China, which was the first to be implemented, was the most effective at stopping the virus, with 94.5 per cent efficacy.
The March 1 ban on travellers from Iran was much less effective, with a 32 per cent success rate, but the South Korea travel ban implemented on March 5 was almost as successful as the China ban, with 94 per cent efficacy.
The ban on travellers from Italy implemented on March 11 after it became the first country in Europe seriously impacted by Covid-19 was 77 per cent effective, according to the CSIRO model.
“Our modelling shows that without travel restrictions, over 48,000 Covid-19 cases were likely to have been imported to Australia from January to May 2020,” lead researcher Dr Jess Liebig said.
“However all of Australia’s travel bans successfully lowered imported cases into Australia by 88 per cent, to an estimated 6000 cases over the studied period.”
The research team said their model provided a flexible framework that could be used in determining border openings and international travel restrictions in future.
CANBERRA OUTBREAK GROWS TO 176
The ACT has reported nine new COVID-19 infections on Wednesday as Chief Minister Andrew Barr confirmed Canberra would not receive an early mark from lockdown.
The total number of active cases in the community is 176.
Of the cases, eight are linked to known cases and one case is under investigation.
Mr Barr confirmed a person was in a critical condition in hospital.
In total seven people are receiving treatment for the virus in hospital.
There are currently more than 400 exposure locations identified across the territory.
Household transmission was responsible for more than two in three of the new cases reported on Tuesday.

QLD REVEALS NEAR MISS WITH NSW OUTBREAK
The two truck drivers who were recorded as new Covid-19 cases on Tuesday have been reclassified, the Queensland premier confirmed.
As the state recorded no new cases on Wednesday, Annastacia Palaszczuk said the two drivers who had travelled into Queensland from NSW and had initially tested positive in the southern state, had now been deemed negative.
Chief health officer Jeannette Young thanked the two drivers, one from the Somerset region and the other from Sunshine Coast, who she said “did everything correctly”.
“Even if they had been cases, they would have been very low risk because of what they’ve been doing,” Dr Young said,
“So a big thank you to them and to all truck drivers.”
Dr Young said on Tuesday that the drivers had not been of great concern because they had been doing their routine testing as required for all freight workers.
Queensland is on tenterhooks as it tries to keep the Delta outbreak ripping through NSW, Victoria and ACT out.
As of Wednesday morning, there are 13,765 cases linked to NSW’s outbreak, 522 in Victoria, and 167 in the ACT.
No new cases were recorded in hotel quarantine either on Wednesday, but Ms Palaszczuk announced a major shake up to the system which will block people seeking to relocate to the state for two weeks.
Southeast Queenslanders are tipped to enjoy more restrictions easing from this weekend, with an announcement on what rules will continue despite last months Indooroopilly cluster being contained.
Masks are expected to continue to be required as the vaccination program continues.
As of Wednesday morning, 47 per cent of Queenslanders have had their first dose of Covid-19.

WOMAN, 30, DIES IN NSW
Ianeta Isaako, a 30-year-old mother of three, on Monday became the youngest woman in NSW to die with the virus.
Friends and family have written on social media with tributes to Mrs Isaako and well wishes to her husband Sako, who is also fighting Covid-19.
“I know there is nothing in this world matters anymore, when death takes the most beautiful part of your heart. I want you to think of what she would've wanted you to do,” one person wrote.
“My heart is broken,” said another.
Health officials on Tuesday afternoon confirmed Mrs Isaako’s death, the 75th since NSW’s latest outbreak began on June 16.
“NSW Health extends its deepest sympathies to her loved ones,” the department said.
“This tragic death is being investigated by the Western Sydney Local Health District.”
Her death has been referred to the coroner.
Earlier on Tuesday, NSW chief health officer Kerry Chant said authorities were aware of the media reports but were unable to determine the cause of her death.
It is not yet known if the woman had any underlying health conditions or whether or not she was vaccinated against Covid-19.
NSW Premier Gladys Berejiklian praised Blacktown, the local government area the woman lived in, for dramatically ramping up its vaccine rollout.
“We've seen Blacktown go from one of the lowest rates of vaccination to the highest in the state. Thank you to the people from Blacktown for coming forward and getting the jab,”.
Six million people have now received their first vaccine dose in NSW, which recorded 753 new locally acquired cases of Covid-19 on Tuesday.
QLD’S DIG AT NSW
Annastacia Palaszczuk criticised the NSW approach to containing its Covid-19 crisis after Gladys Berejiklian said driving infections down to zero was “completely unrealistic”.
The Queensland Premier said she reserved the right to impose lockdowns on her constituents to control future outbreaks, even if 80 per cent of the state’s population was fully vaccinated.
Ms Palaszczuk also defended the approach to go hard and early to suppress virus threats in response to a swipe from the Prime Minister, where he declared “we can’t stay in the cave forever”.
“Have a look out in Queensland at the moment,” the state premier told reporters on Tuesday morning.
“You can go to work, you can go school, you can go and watch sport, you can play community sport, you can go to a restaurant, you can go out.
“We haven’t given up.
“We come out here every day and Queenslanders are doing such a good job in making sure that when we go hard and go fast, people abide by what we’re asking them to do.
“And look where we’re living.”
Ms Berejiklian told ABC’s 7.30 on Monday she would forge ahead with her plan to lift restrictions when NSW reaches 70 per cent of eligible vaccinations, regardless of the number of active cases in the community.
“You do need to see if you can suppress the virus, if you can, and reduce the case numbers but you have to be realistic about it,” she said.
“To have zero cases, no deaths and get to complete vaccination, that is not the real world.”
But Ms Palaszczuk bluntly declared her approach would differ, suggesting her counterpart in the neighbouring state had given up attempting to control soaring case numbers and deaths.
“I don’t think the people in NSW want to give up on trying to get on top of their current outbreak,” she said.
“Look at the number of cases in NSW, Queenslanders don’t want to see those cases.”
PM’S CHRISTMAS PLAN
Prime Minister Scott Morrison says there is no reason families can’t be reunited for Christmas, but only if the states stick to the agreed national vaccination plan.
Australia’s road map to a Covid normal life has been under threat in recent days as Western Australia and Queensland indicated they want to keep their borders closed to stop the virus creeping in from NSW.
But Mr Morrison on Tuesday urged state premiers not to waiver from the national plan to ease restrictions when vaccination rates hit 70 and 80 per cent.
“Let me be clear, there is nothing more powerful to deal with Covid-19 than the vaccine,” he told Sunrise.
“There is no government, no individual, no set of border protections that is more powerful than the vaccine.
“Once the vaccine is there at 70 and 80 per cent, you do more harm than good to your people by locking them down and locking them up and keeping them in the cave.”
Mr Morrison said if the plan was followed then there was “no reason” why Australians couldn’t be reunited for Christmas.
“I believe we will be able to be in that position if we had those marks of 70 per cent and 80 per cent because there is no reason why you shouldn't be,” he said.
The prime minister has sought to ramp up the pressure on the states to fall into line and to prepare Australians for more cases and deaths as restrictions ease.
Queensland Premier Annastacia Palaszczuk on Monday said “the goalposts have changed” since she agreed to the plan.
The plan, Ms Palaszczuk argued, was modelled on an initial outbreak of 30 cases, noting there are now “thousands” of cases across Australia.
“This is a book that hasn’t been written, folks. This is uncharted territory,” she said.
But late Monday evening, the Doherty Institute – which mapped Australia’s way out of the pandemic – said reopening the country was still safe despite higher case numbers.
“There is light at the end of the tunnel – once we achieve 70 per cent -80 per cent vaccination we will see less transmission of Covid-19 and fewer people with severe illness, and therefore fewer hospitalisations and deaths,” a statement read.
“Covid-19 won’t go away but it will be easier to control in the future.”
“This level of vaccination will make it easier to live with the virus, as we do with other viruses such as the flu.
“However, it won’t be possible to maintain a situation where there are no cases at all.”
The Doherty Institute estimated at phase B – or 70 per cent – Australia could see 385,983 symptomatic cases of Covid-19 and 1457 deaths over six months.
Testing and tracing cases as well as isolating and quarantining those who test positive, will assist in keeping the numbers down.
Mr Morrison said the restrictions in this phase is just “common sense”.
“There is not zero restrictions, there are common sense baseline level restrictions and I wouldn't even call them restrictions, it’s just common sense behaviour,” he said.
“Washing your hands and maintaining good hygiene and doing all that sort of common sense stuff.”
PM BLASTS LOW JAB STATES
Low vaccination rates in Queensland and Western Australia could hinder the easing of Covid-19 restrictions and lockdowns as Prime Minister Scott Morrison says Australia must adapt its attitude to living with the virus.
Mr Morrison challenged state leaders vacillating on the four-phase ­reopening strategy agreed by ­national cabinet, warning that Australians would remain stuck “in the cave forever” if the plan to progressively ease restrictions at 70 per cent and 80 per cent full vaccination rates was abandoned, according to a report in The Australian.
With Queensland and WA ­suggesting they may not adhere to the plan because of high case numbers in NSW and a growing outbreak in Victoria, Mr Morrison said: “If not at 70 per cent and 80 per cent, then when? We must make that move and we must prepare to make that move and we must prepare the country to make that move.
“We have to break this cycle. The national plan is the way to cut through and for us to emerge from that. This groundhog day has to end, and it will end when we start getting to 70 per cent and 80 per cent.”
It comes as Victorian Premier Daniel Andrews – unlike other leaders – backed Mr Morrison, saying lockdowns would be “highly, highly unlikely” once 80 per cent of the eligible population was fully vaccinated.
Mr Andrews also suggested Victoria’s latest lockdown could not be strengthened further, days after suggesting tougher rules were on the table.
“There are not too many more restrictions we can put on. The thing that will make the difference in bringing these numbers down further is compliance with these current rules,” Mr Andrews said.
Mr Andrews said that once 80 per cent of those over 16 were vaccinated, there would not be a statewide lockdown “unless it was advised”.
“If the community was under-vaccinated or at higher risk you might have a localised set of the rules,” he said.

Full text: Victorians aged 16 and above will be eligible for a Covid jab at state-run vaccine centres from Wednesday amid a slew of changes to the state’s vaccination program.
It comes after the state recorded 50 new cases in the past 24 hours.
The new infections include 10 mystery cases.
Concerningly, just 11 were in quarantine for their entire infectious period — meaning 39 were out in the community while infectious.

SOME AMBULANCES FORCED TO BYPASS RMH The Royal Melbourne Hospital has been placed onto “ambulance bypass”, after 450 staff were forced to isolate because they were exposed to the virus by a Covid-infected patient.
The emergency department has been instructing ambulances to divert to other hospitals since Saturday, in order to safely manage the outbreak within the Parkville facility.
However, the hospital has continued to accept walk-ins, “time critical” patients and those apprehended for mental illness.
“We continue to be open for trauma and all urgent care arriving via ambulance, our outpatient clinics are operating as usual and we are still conducting emergency and category 1 surgeries,” a statement read.
“We would like to once again thank our colleagues across the health system for their continued support during the challenging time.”
All wards, except for one, are fully operational, with the hospital hoping to have its services operating at “near full capacity” by Wednesday.
The outbreak at the Royal Melbourne Hospital grew by four on Tuesday to 13 cases.

DAN’S FIREY SHOT AT NSW Victorian Premier Daniel Andrews has urged the state to follow lockdown rules to suppress the Delta strain, saying “if we could send it back to Sydney where it came from, we would”.
In an apparent criticism of NSW Premier Gladys Berejiklian’s attempt to keep Sydney as open as long as possible, Mr Andrews said opening up early would see case numbers soar.
“You don’t get to have the Delta variant kind of bubble along – ‘Oh we can just keep it at 20 a day’ – No you can’t,” he said.
“It’s 50 a day now. If we opened up tomorrow it won’t be 50, it’ll be much, much higher.”
Mr Andrews said not enough people were vaccinated and to open up before vaccination rates hit 80 per cent would see hospitals overwhelmed with Covid patients.
“I’m not pleased to be in this position, you know if we could send it back to Sydney we would,” he said.
“But we can’t do that, that’s not the way this works.
“We all have to work together, we all have to find a way to get through this while we as fast as possible vaccinate everybody and get to that rate of 80 per cent and then we’ve got lots of options.”

VICTORIA’S LATEST CASES
• 12 linked to the Newport/Altona North/Wyndham outbreak
• 7 linked to Shepparton cluster
• 6 linked to MyCentre Childcare in Broadmeadows
• 6 are primary close contacts in Hobsons Bay who tested positive on their day 13 tests
• 4 linked to Royal Melbourne Hospital
• 2 are primary close contacts of a Royal Children’s Hospital worker
• 3 are known household contacts of earlier positive cases that have been linked
Ten mystery cases are still under investigation but they have some clear linkages to hotspot areas, including:
• 4 linked to Altona North/Wyndham cluster
• 3 linked to Carlton/Fitzroy North outbreak
• 2 linked to Thomastown
• 1 linked to Southbank
The Royal Melbourne Hospital cluster has been epidemiologically linked to the wider Shepparton cluster, which has also since been linked to the Glenroy cluster.
Victoria’s active caseload is now 522, including a new case in hotel quarantine.
It comes on a day where more than 48,000 Victorians turned out for a swab, and a further 29,810 received a Covid vaccination.
Mr Andrews said it was absolutely doable for Victoria to still get to zero or limited cases in the community.
But he said maintaining that zero figure in the long term for sustained periods of time was going to be “incredibly difficult”.
From 7am on Wednesday, August 25, anyone aged 16-59 can get the Pfizer vaccine. Those aged over 60 can continue to get AstraZeneca.
Over the coming month, there will be more than 830,000 appointments for Covid-19 vaccines available at 55 state-run centres across Victoria. This includes 450,000 first doses for the Pfizer vaccine.
With this new expansion, the number of Victorians eligible for Pfizer has increased by two million.
Approximately 1.7 million Victorians aged 16 to 59 have already been vaccinated at GPs.
Premier Daniel Andrews also said anyone aged between 18 and 39 with an AstraZeneca booking would be eligible to instead receive Pfizer.
He said they would not be required to change or cancel their booking.
The change in eligibility will not take place until Wednesday, with the additional bookings set to be available from 7am.
However, the state’s online booking system for the coronavirus vaccine appeared to crash immediately following the Premier’s announcement.
With the number of Victorians aged 18 to 59 still far outweighing the Pfizer doses available from the Commonwealth, the AstraZeneca vaccine will still be available for those who choose to provide informed consent and discuss their vaccination with a medical professional.
“The best vaccine you can get is the one that you can get today,” the Premier said.
“We’ve already delivered more than 230,000 doses towards our one million have target which is a mammoth effort.
“But please, if you haven’t had your vaccination yet, just book it in today to protect yourself and your loved ones.”
Premier Daniel Andrews said the expansion of Pfizer was due to certainty of supply from Poland.
Vic Locally-acquired Covid-19

TRAGEDY AS WOMAN FOUND DEAD A 30-year-old woman who had tested positive to Covid-19 has become the 75th fatality of the Delta-strain outbreak in NSW.
Police and paramedics wearing personal protective equipment discovered the woman’s body at a home on Helena Ave in Emerton, in Western Sydney about 3pm on Monday.
Emergency services had been called out to the home after reports the woman was unresponsive and she could not be resuscitated.
On Tuesday afternoon NSW Health confirmed the woman had tested positive to Covid and an investigation was now underway into her death.
Read the full version of this story, here.

ENGAGEMENT PARTY FINES TOP $300K Police have wrapped up their investigation into an illegal engagement party after dishing out more than $300,000 worth of fines.
A Victoria Police spokeswoman said 56 guests who attended the Caulfield North party were each fined $5452, totalling $305,312.
The spokeswoman said a number of the guests were children who would not be fined.
It is believed all party attendees have been accounted for.
The notices come after the family was lashed on social media with a barrage of anti-Semitic abuse for hosting and filming the party.
Jewish community leaders said the bride, groom and their relatives had “gone to ground” after the video surfaced.

UPDATE ON NSW VACCINE GOAL NSW has reached its first vaccine milestone of six million jabs delivered as the state recorded 753 new Covid cases and no further deaths.
Premier Gladys Berejiklian said she would announce on “Thursday or Friday” what extra freedom NSW residents would be given as a result.
On Monday night, she revealed there would at least be one small change.
“I have never suggested that life will be free once we get to six million jabs, but what I have said and will honour is that if you are fully vaccinated there will be at least one thing you can do that you cannot do now, just to give people a bit of relief,” the Premier told the ABC.
She said health experts were working on what that one thing would be.
“Obviously, public health and safety come first, and mental wellbeing, so we will have that advice to the community as soon as we can.”

FEARS AMID NEW QUEENSLAND CASES Queensland has recorded six new cases of Covid-19 in the past 24 hours, including two community cases linked to the NSW outbreak, Premier Annastacia Palaszczuk has announced.
One was acquired overseas and detected in hotel quarantine, three were on a marine vessel and two were truck drivers and acquired in the community.
Those two cases are under investigation but Ms Palaszczuk said authorities weren’t overly concerned about them.
New contact tracing locations for the truck drivers will be uploaded later.
Both cases were detected by NSW authorities.
Read the full story here.
SHEPPARTON SCHOOL LINKED TO OUTBREAK A Shepparton Primary School is the latest school linked to a positive Covid case, after it was listed as an exposure site by the Health Department on Tuesday morning.
A positive case attended St Brendan’s Primary School between 8.45am and 3.30pm on August 17, 18 and 20.
The school has been declared a Tier 1 site, forcing students and teachers into quarantine.
It comes after Mooroopna Primary School revealed they had a confirmed case in a statement released by their acting principal Carla May on Monday night.
“A confirmed case of Covid-19 has been reported in our community,” she said.
“While the Department of Health (DH) conducts its investigation, staff and students and their household members must isolate at home until further notice.”
Other exposure sites listed on Tuesday morning by the Health Department included the public toilets at a Covid drive-through testing site, a Corio supermarket and a Shepparton restaurant.

SCOMO DEFENDS DOHERTY MODELLING Scott Morrison says there’s more places Aussies can get a vaccine across the country than get a Big Mac.
Speaking on 3AW, the Prime Minister said people could get a jab through their GP or pharmacy and commended uptake of AstraZeneca in Victoria.
“I don’t think anyone is going to want to be left behind,” Mr Morrison said.
Premier Daniel Andrews on Monday raised concerns about vaccine supply.
“There’s certainly more AstraZeneca and we’re maximising every dose of Pfizer to get it out there,” Mr Morrison said.
He also fired a warning shot at Western Australia, which boasts a tough stance on borders but has low vaccination rates.
NED-4150-Pathway-out-of-pandemic
“People think that ‘Oh, I don’t need to get the vaccine because it’s not here’,” Mr Morrison said.
“Well Covid will have a second view about that. Borders and those other things that states might want to do are not as powerful as the vaccine.”
The Prime Minister again defended the Doherty Institute modelling that says Australia can move to phase B of its reopening plan when 70 per cent of Australia’s population is fully vaccinated, and phase C at 80 per cent.
He said Mr Andrews was a strong supporter of the plan.
“It is not a Freedom Day, it’s a science day … it’s telling us that we can do this safely, and we can move ahead,” Mr Morrison said.
“Once you hit 70 (per cent) and once you hit 80 (per cent) the first those rates are even higher.”NED-4292-Percentage-of-eligible-population-fully-vaccinated-by-state

HOW WE COULD REOPEN The Doherty Institute has stood by its modelling – underpinning the federal government’s road map out of Covid – after questions were raised of its relevance in the wake of rising infections across the country.
In a statement released on Monday night, the institute for infection and immunity said once 70 per cent vaccine coverage is reached, opening up at tens or hundreds of cases nationally per day is “possible”.
“However, we will need vigilant public health interventions with higher case loads,” the statement read.
“We will need to keep some public health measures in place — test, trace, isolate and quarantine — to keep the reproduction number below 1, but as vaccination rates increase, we’ll be able to ease up further and it is unlikely that we will need generalised lockdowns.”
“It might seem that these ‘test, trace, isolate and quarantine’ measures aren’t currently working – in New South Wales or Victoria. But they are.”
The institute said there is “light at the end of the tunnel”, with the country to see “less transmission of Covid and fewer people with severe illness” once 70 to 80 per cent vaccination was achieved.
This estimate comes from the modelling work “completed to date”, with the modelling report last revised on August 10.
“The team of modellers from across Australia led by the Doherty Institute is now working through the implementation issues specific to the states and territories, specific populations and high risk settings.”
The Doherty Institute’s modelling was released on August 3 and was commissioned by the federal government.

MORE JABS UP FOR GRABS Tens of thousands of vaccine appointments are up for grabs across Victoria this week as the biggest community vaccine centre opens in Melbourne’s northwest.
Prime Minister Scott Morrison has said people aged 16-39 can get Pfizer from August 30, which is expected to flow through to GPs from this date.
Premier Daniel Andrews said the number of cancelled bookings or no-shows had doubled to more than 10,000 since Prime Minister Scott Morrison announced the change last week.
NED-4409-How-to-get-proof-of-vaccination
“People have to turn up,” Mr Andrews said. “You have an appointment, use it today because there is an actual shot in your arm today and it is far preferable than a booking in a few weeks’ time.”.
It comes as a vaccination hub at Broadmeadows Town Hall, run by DPV Health, is expanded to provide up to 22 vaccination booths.
DVP Health chief Don Tidbury said the hub would benefit the Hume area – which has hit badly by Covid in the past 18 months.
Fifty active cases have been linked to an outbreak at MyCentre Childcare in Broadmeadows, with two infections connected to the nearby Dallas Brooks Community Primary School.
The Broadmeadows Town Hall hub is open seven days, initially from 9.30am-5.30pm, with opening hours expected to expand in coming weeks.

BUSINESSES ‘HANGING BY A THREAD’ The Eastern Indoor Sports Centre is “hanging by a thread”, and its frustrated owners say lockdowns have crippled their business.
Owners Julian and Trent Balthazaar said the Knoxfield sports and children’s party venue usually raked in about $10,000 on weekends, but had suffered from the more than 200 days in lockdown.
“Every time we gain a bit of momentum and we think we’re ready to open we have to close again,” Julian Balthazaar said.
Brother Trent said: “We had to cancel 24 parties in one weekend … we’re falling further and further into debt”.
The indoor sports centre is in desperate need of revenue to recoup last year’s losses.
“This is how we make a living, so to be forced to close our doors and still come up with money for rent and expenses is really tough,” Julian said.
“We’re grateful for any government support, but it’s kind of like putting a Band-Aid on a bigger wound.”
The brothers, who rent a large warehouse with high expenses and are unable to operate as a takeaway-only venture, in the same way as hospitality businesses, said the blanket approach of helping businesses through lockdowns “doesn’t work”.
“We receive the same grants as any other business … the support isn’t proportionate,” Trent said.
While they are determined to bounce back, the brothers know the struggle won’t end when the lockdowns do.
“Restrictions kill us as much as the lockdowns do … we are the last to open up and have to enforce capacity limits,” Julian said.

Full text: Lockdown 5 in Victoria was textbook. An outbreak occurred, contact tracing swung into action, cases were found, and over time the number of daily cases infectious in the community diminished to zero for three days, and we came out of lockdown.
Lockdown 6 is not going well. Victoria cannot seem to tip the balance, despite even stricter restrictions. In fact, the majority of cases found have been infectious while out in the community, and the numbers are going up rather than down. Even worse – and the reason for this bad trend – is the constant stream of mystery cases.
When there are mystery cases, there will, by definition, be future cases in the community.
I strongly support the Victorian government’s decision to go “really hard” with curfews, by closing playgrounds and childcare, and further reducing essential workplaces. It would be so much better to re-eliminate the virus, and wish for a near-normal life until the end of the year. But we need to be realistic. The elimination strategy always had, and continues to have, a planned shift to living with the virus once we are ready. Ideally at something like 80 per cent adult vaccination coverage (although personally I would prefer that to include children, as well).
The virus may be forcing our hand earlier than we planned. If the hard restrictions in Victoria do not lead to a dramatic improvement by September 2, such as fewer than five cases a day (which seems very unlikely), what should we do?
We could hang tough, and keep the number of infections as low as possible by staying in hard lockdown longer. But for how long? Victoria has been in lockdowns for more than 200 days now. The citizens are pretty sick of it, with growing concerns about the mental health effects, and the economic damage.
This is wickedly difficult decision-making for governments. It is about picking the least harmful course of action.
The Covid-19 Pandemic Trade-offs group I lead at the Melbourne School of Population and Global Health has done a lot of modelling of this pandemic, but not exactly the Victorian scenario leading up to September 2. Nor have the Doherty Institute and my collaborators in the Australian Covid-19 Modelling Initiative.
What I present here is not a model per se, but a framework to help us think our options through.
The first figure shows three scenarios, assuming we make some progress by September 2.
In the first scenario, we have hit 40 cases a day a week before September 2, then five cases a day by September 2 – so we come out of lockdown. And we get lucky with no further incursions and outbreaks from hotel quarantine or across the NSW border before the end of November, when 80 per cent of adults will be at least 10 days post their second dose, and we shift into phase C of the national plan. We all hope this will happen, but it does seem unlikely.
The second, orange, scenario starts out the same as the green scenario, but we have repeated monthly incursions requiring repeated fortnightly lockdowns (each of which works, so still an optimistic assumption in that regard – although it will get easier to stamp out outbreaks as vaccine coverage increases). Here we oscillate our way to the end of November with a total of about two months in hard lockdown.
The third scenario is where some progress has been made by September 2 – but only to the point of 30 cases a day, requiring another four weeks of hard lockdown to drive the case numbers down to five a day before stepping out of lockdown. Not great, but a return to zero transmission.
But what if we have not made any progress by September 2, and the case numbers are still around 50 a day (or worse)? What should we do then?
We could stay in hard lockdown and wait until the vaccine coverage tips the balance our way, and we tip to numbers going down. A scenario similar to the blue line in the first figure, but longer in lockdown.
There are other options, though.
We could let go of hard lockdown and shift to a soft lockdown. A world where more time is allowed outside, no curfews, you can travel 10km or more from your home, some retail is reopened, and construction and other industries on the “essential” threshold are started up.
Using a Victorian-style stage 3 lockdown as an approximation for a soft lockdown, and using the apparent tipping point in terms of vaccine coverage when it is enough to cause numbers in our NSW modelling to start going down, I constructed the second figure. In this fourth “moonshot” scenario the numbers go up as expected, but then turn and decrease with increasing vaccine coverage.
This moonshot appears to work if the criterion for success is restricting daily case numbers to fewer than 500 on the way to the end of November. The flip side, though, is we are in a soft lockdown the whole time (or until early November). And it is – of course – risky and uncertain.
The fifth scenario is for a 2 percentage point higher daily change in cases at each point in time (that is, where I got the maths slightly wrong, or we got unlucky). It is enough to quickly see the case numbers hit 500 by virtue of exponential maths.
We hope that the numbers dramatically turn down in the next week, but we need to also start discussing what our options are come September 2, if the numbers have not dramatically decreased.

Full text: The medical research institute forecasts that, with 70% vaccine coverage of the adult population and partial public health measures, there will be 385,983 symptomatic cases and 1457 deaths over six months.
Howver, with “optimal public health measures” — and no lockdowns, this can be significantly reduced to 2737 infections and 13 deaths, the institute said.
As contention over the Doherty Institute’s modelling and Australia’s path out of lockdowns ramps up, the experts behind the plan have revealed there will never be a “freedom day” because there will never be “Covid zero”.
Instead, with enough vaccination, Covid-19 will become less of a burden on the health system and citizens will learn to live with it like they do influenza.
In a statement released by the Doherty Institute ahead of new modelling expected to be presented to national cabinet on Friday, a spokesperson said it was important to note Covid-19 “won’t go away”, but it will be “easier to control”.
Last month, National Cabinet agreed on a four-phase “road map” out of Covid-19, based on modelling by the Doherty Institute.
When 70 per cent of the eligible population (currently adults aged over 16) is double-jabbed, the country will enter Phase B – “Vaccination transition phase” – where Covid-19 restrictions and lockdowns are still possible but less likely.
At 80 per cent, Phase C – “Consolidation” – will begin, with lockdowns only being “highly targeted” and vaccinated residents will be exempt from domestic restrictions.
But, even after 80 per cent of the eligible population is vaccinated, Covid-19 will still need to be managed with some public health measures – test, trace, isolate and quarantine.
Restrictions will just ease further and lockdowns will become more generalised so that Phase D – “Normal” – can be reached, where Covid-19 is managed like the flu.
The UK removed the majority of restrictions last month, with July 19 labelled “freedom day”. It resulted in a spike of Covid-19 cases, with the country currently recording an average of 32,210 new cases and 98 deaths a day.
Prime Minister Boris Johnson said the move was “irreversible” and no further lockdowns would be imposed.
Back home, some state leaders are now arguing they won’t abide by the road map, because initial modelling was based on outbreaks with daily numbers of 30 and did not account for cases in excess of 800 currently being experienced in NSW.
The institute said the 70-80 per cent level of vaccination will “make it easier to live with the virus,” as we do with other viruses such as the flu.
“However, it won’t be possible to maintain a situation where there are no cases at all. The focus will shift to keeping the number of people going into hospital and dying at a minimum,” the institute said.
“In an average year of influenza, we would roughly have 600 deaths and 200,000 cases in Australia. Any death is a tragedy but our health system can cope with this.”
In the Covid-19 modelling from the Doherty Institute, opening the country up at 70 per cent vaccine coverage with partial public health measures would result in a predicted 385,983 cases and 1457 deaths over six months.
But, the Institute’s modelling recommends with “optimal” public health measures and no lockdowns, this could be significantly reduced to 2737 infections and 13 deaths.
“We’ve learned from watching countries that have removed all restrictions that there is no ‘freedom day’. We will need to keep some public health measures in place to keep the reproduction number below 1. But, as vaccination rates increase, we’ll be able to ease up further,” the Institute said.
“Once we reach 70 per cent vaccine coverage, opening up at tens or hundreds of cases national per day is possible, however we will need vigilant public health interventions with higher case loads.”
NSW Premier Gladys Berejiklian has said throughout her state’s worsening outbreak that Covid-19 will not disappear, but that the state needs to “learn to live” with it.
“We appreciate that vaccination is our best bet when … living with Delta. We need to learn from what’s happened overseas,” she said on Monday.
“Every state is going to have to go through this … because eventually borders are going to have to come down … and Delta is going to be a part of the community.”
Making a nod to the situation in NSW, where 818 cases were recorded on Monday, the Doherty Institute said the public health measures – test, trace, isolate and quarantine – were working.
“They are stopping transmissions and reducing the effective reproduction rate from 5 to close to 1.3 in NSW. These measures will become more effective with more people vaccinated,” the Institute said.
“We need to keep suppressing Covid-19 through public health measures while we work towards 70-80 per cent vaccination across the country.
“We are working towards better control of Covid-19 and a more stable future.”
As of Tuesday, 30.3 per cent of Australians aged over 16 are fully vaccinated.

Explained: New data modelling and why the states are freaking out

Author: McCormack, Madura

Full text: ● What the states and federal government is fighting about:
National cabinet agreed on a road map out of Covid-19. In that road map, restrictions and lockdowns would ease when 80 per cent of people are fully vaccinated, but some state leaders are now arguing they won’t do that.
● Australia’s road map out of Covid-19, a refresher:
Four phases. We are now in Phase A , or “vaccinate, prepare, pilot”, where the goal is to suppress Covid-19 and reduce transmission while ramping up the vaccine rollout.
Phase B hits when 70 per cent of people aged 16 and older are fully vaccinated. At this point, there will still be Covid-19 restrictions and lockdowns, but at “lower levels” then there are now.
Phase C hits when 80 per cent of people aged 16 and older are fully vaccinated. Only highly targeted lockdowns, such as closing off a specific suburb, will be used and only as a last resort. Measures such as mask-wearing, social distancing, and QR code check-ins will remain.
Phase D is “post-vaccination”, when international borders will completely reopen and Covid-19 vaccine booster shot programs start. This is still far off.
NED-4150-Pathway-out-of-pandemic
● What the Doherty Institute modelling says about Phase C:
At 80 per cent vaccine coverage, assuming measures such as Covid-19 testing, tracing, and isolating cases are working well, there would be seven deaths from the virus over a six-month period in an outbreak and 1160 infections. But if the containment measures were struggling, even at 80 per cent vaccine coverage, about 996 people would die and 230,164 Covid-19 cases would be recorded in an outbreak over six months. Remember, national cabinet were aware of this when they agreed to the road map.
● Why the state leaders are freaking out:
The Doherty Institute’s numbers were based on an outbreak kicking off at 30 cases in the community, not hundreds as is currently being experienced in NSW.
State leaders say they need updated modelling to understand the impacts of opening up at 80 per cent if there are hundreds of cases and whether our health measures can keep up. Federal boffins says this is a misunderstanding of math, and really the modelling will not change very much.
● What’s happening now:
National cabinet has ordered updated modelling which they will receive on Friday. Basically the Doherty Institute boffins will go back and figure out what Phase C would look like if we go in at a higher rate of transmission, depending on whether the test, trace, isolate measures hold up.

Full text: Police were forced to deploy the most powerful nonlethal force available to dispel protesters, with officers firing pepper ball rounds into crowds. The pepper balls, described as the “leader in nonlethal solutions”, are filled with a chemical that irritates the eyes much like pepper spray, and can be fired by a munition launcher that looks like a pistol. Police also used OC foam to clear crowds out of the city.
Dozens of police officers marched through the streets of Melbourne, Victoria, as anti-lockdown protesters clashed with officers on Saturday, August 21. According to local media reports, a large number of protesters gathered in Melbourne’s CBD, prompting police to arrest a number of attendees and deploy pepper spray.

Seven officers sustained injuries including two with suspected broken noses, one with a broken thumb and others with concussions, with six requiring hospitalisation.
Three people out of those arrested were charged with assaulting a police officer.
“While there were some peaceful protestors in attendance, the majority of those who attended came with violence in mind,” a police spokesperson said.
“The behaviour seen by police was so hostile and aggressive that they were left with no choice but to use all tactics available to them.”
Police said investigations will continue into who was responsible for several flares being ignited on city streets.
Each protester issued with an infringement notice will be fined $5452 for breaching health directions.
In Sydney, NSW Police say they stopped about 250 people from protesting in Sydney’s CBD, laying scores of charges and fining more than 260 people.
NSW Police Minister David Elliot said the crackdown on the planned anti-lockdown ‘freedom’ rally had “worked to perfection”.
About 1400 officers set up checkpoints and stopped 38,000 vehicles in the city and surrounds from 9am.
“This is not about stopping freedom of speech, it’s about a temporary stop to the freedom of movement,” Mr Elliot said.
“We saw the community backlash after the last protest and that was a genuine reflection of how they saw the actions of a small minority.
“That small minority has again chosen to blatantly ignore the very clear, repeated warnings of NSW Police, which is disappointing, frustrating and – frankly – disgraceful.
“The actions they have taken are likely to prolong the very lockdown they were protesting about.
Forty-seven people will be charged.
The protests came as NSW recorded 825 new cases and three deaths, and regional Victoria was plunged into lockdown after 16 new cases were added to today’s case numbers, bringing the new case total to 77.

Greg Bearup 8.15am: Fearing death but living in denial
As this pandemic presses a boot to the throat of Dubbo, some tough conversations are taking place in the city’s overcrowded government houses.
“I was on the fence,” says 28-year-old mother of three Amy Stanley. “And then I thought, ‘Yeah-nah, I gotta jump that fence, I gotta get it done. I gotta get vaccinated’.” She’s now desperately trying to convince her ­reluctant father Peter to do the same.
Amy is a disability support worker and her employer had been at her for months to get the vaccine. She resisted even as the three other Aboriginal women who work with her got the jab.
Her fears are founded in her family’s long history of poor health. She’s grown up watching uncles, aunts and cousins be buried at an early age – many succumbing to heart-related illnesses.

Victoria Police have made 218 arrests and issued 236 fines after an estimated 4000 protesters stormed the Melbourne CBD, with police deploying levels of force not seen before during a “freedom” protest.
Police deployed “a range of non-lethal options” including OC foam and pepper ball rounds to clear crowds out of the city.

Rhiannon Down 4.36pm: Shepparton cluster grows to 21 cases as lockdown bites
Health authorities say that the number of cases linked to the Shepparton outbreak has now grown to include 21 cases.
Goulburn Valley Health chief executive Matt Sharp said that several more cases had been detected this morning, bringing the tally higher than the 17 reported this morning.
“Today we’ve had a further small number of people test positive in the early hours of this morning,” he said, addressing local reporters this morning.
“At the moment in the outbreak here in Shepparton we’ve had a total of 21 active cases which are being closely monitored and contacted by our contact tracing team.”
The discovery that the virus had reached Shepparton has plunged the entirety of regional Victoria into lockdown from 1pm today.
Victorian Premier Daniel Andrews has announced that from 1pm today, regional Victoria will go into the same lockdown conditions as Melbourne with the exception of a curfew.
Covid-19 Testing Commander Jeroen Weimar confirmed this morning that 16 additional cases had been recorded this morning and would be recorded in tomorrow’s case numbers. It remains unclear if the four cases recorded in Shepparton are part of 16 cases.

Rhiannon Down 4.26pm: CMO spruiks another day of record jab numbers
The nation’s vaccine rollout has surpassed 16.8 million Covid-19 vaccine doses, as the number of fully vaccinated Australians edges past the 6 million mark.
Deputy Chief Medical Officer Michael Kidd said that 51.8 per cent of Australians have now received at least one jab, after 1.7 million shots were administered this week.
“Yesterday was another record day for vaccinations,” Professor Kidd said.
“With over 310,000 vaccinations administered to people across Australia. 310,524, to be precise.

Thousands of protesters have marched through the streets of Brisbane's CBD as part of the nationwide 'Freedom Rally'.
“As we all know, it’s critical that older people receive vaccination against Covid-19 because older people are at greatest risk of serious disease and death, if infected with COVID-19.”
Professor Kidd added that nationally there were 554 people being treated in hospital, 94 in intensive care with 36 on ventilators.

Rhiannon Down 4pm: Man charged with initmidating NSW Police Minister
A man has been charged with intimidation after he allegedly followed NSW Police Minister David Elliot down a Baulkham Hills street, questioning the legitimacy of the lockdown.
Police allege the 35-year-old man intercepted Mr Elliot on Old Northern Road at about 3pm on Friday, before pursuing him while hurling verbal insults at him and another passer-by who intervened.
“The man questioned the MP, recording the interaction on his mobile phone and allegedly continued to verbally abuse and intimate him as he followed him to a nearby shopping centre,” a NSW Police spokesperson said.
The video, which has been circulated on social media, shows Mr Elliot at first beginning to engage with the man before walking away saying he wasn’t being listened to.
“I’m feeling intimidated by you,” Mr Elliot said, before crossing the street and walking into a shopping centre with the man in hot pursuit.

Megan Goldin 3.30pm: Fun police close playgrounds without evidence
A police car pulls up at a Melbourne park and, like a chase scene in a RoboCop movie, teenagers kicking a footy take fright and flee.
The dystopian nightmare has returned in a grim rerun of the darkest days of last year’s lockdown when barriers surrounded playgrounds and sports areas were cordoned off under public health orders.
Victorians are told these are necessary sacrifices to beat the virus. Yet the virus pops up again and again like an unwinnable game of whack-a-mole. Premier Daniel Andrews provides no evidence to support his latest tough restrictions. The health advice remains unpublished. There’s no science, no studies and no empirical data to back up the decision to impose a curfew and shut playgrounds.
“It is not for me to prove the efficacy of any one measure,” Andrews said when asked for evidence to support a curfew. “It is not for me to provide hard data.”
Chief health officer Brett Sutton echoed that sentiment.
As opposed to last year’s lockdown, there is now plenty of robust research based on millions of cases abroad to guide decision-making. It simply doesn’t cut it to say that we’re replicating last year’s stab-in-the-dark strategy when experts were still learning about the newly emerged virus.
It may come as a shock to Victorians that global experts who’ve been at the coalface of the pandemic say a preponderance of evidence shows that closing play­grounds and even wearing masks outdoors have no impact on the virus’s spread.

Helena Burke 2.52pm: Covid zero now an impossible task: Berejiklian
NSW Premier Gladys Berejiklian has warned zero cases in the community is an “impossible task”, as the state records its worst ever day of the pandemic, with 825 new cases today.
Just 149 of the new cases were linked to known clusters, with the origin of 676 infections under investigation.
There are currently 516 people in hospital with the virus, including 85 in intensive care and 29 on ventilators.
The three deaths announced on Saturday include a man in his 80s, a woman in her 90s, and a man in his 90s, who was fully vaccinated but had a number of pre-existing health conditions.
Ms Berejiklian said she had noticed a “change of attitude” in her conversations with other state premiers and in the community at large.
NSW Premier Gladys Berejiklian says the state has 825 new local cases of COVID-19 and three deaths were recorded overnight.
“We accept that Delta is here. We accept that heading to zero across the nation — especially once you open up and live freely — will be an impossible task,” she said.
“No matter how hard we work, no matter if 99 per cent of people are doing the right thing, there is an element of Delta that nobody can control.”
Ms Berejiklian urged NSW residents to get vaccinated, applauding the 124,000 people that came forward to get the jab in the past 24 hours.
“The best way we can look forward to freedom is by making sure that we get vaccinated,” she said.
NSW is now at 55 per cent with a first dose and nearly 30 per cent fully vaccinated.
“At this stage, if current rates of vaccination continue, NSW will get to 70 per cent double doses by the end of October and 80 per cent double doses by mid-November,” Ms Berejiklian said.

Rhiannon Down 12.17pm: Victorian fined for brawling with officer over mask
Victoria Police have issued 70 infringements for public health breaches in the past 24 hours, including to a man who allegedly fought with a protective services officer after being ordered to wear a mask.
Chief Commissioner Shane Patton said the altercation which took place at Southland shopping centre in Melbourne’s southeast was one of a number of instances of “unacceptable conduct” discovered by police on Friday.
A group caught playing pool and “drinking and parting without any masks” in Ballarat in regional Victoria at 2.30am had also been fined $1000 for breaching the health orders. Chief Commissioner Patton said police had already issued six fines to potential anti-lockdown protesters in the Melbourne CBD this morning.
“It’s tagged as a freedom demonstration, it’s anything but it’s just selfish,” he said.
“The reality is, we don’t know how many people are going to turn up. There’s between 200 to 5000 people who could turn up, we’re trying to do what we can in terms of identifying how many people got there through encrypted applications that makes it difficult for police.

Christine Kellett 11.57am: ACT records eight new cases, all linked
The ACT has recorded eight new local cases of coronavirus, all of them linked to known outbreaks.
The territory now has 102 active cases, with the source of two of them not yet identified.
Authorities say none of the eight new cases today were infectious in the community.
“This lockdown is working,” Chief Minister Andrew Barr has told a press conference.
“But we are however starting to see (more) exposure sites post the start of the lockdown. This is a general warning to the community to please be careful when you are outside your home. The lockdown has significantly reduced the risk around new exposure sites but there will still be some.”

Rhiannon Down 11.42am: Where are all of Victoria’s new cases coming from?
Victorian contact tracers are racing to contain the spread of the Delta variant as the number of primary close contacts skyrockets to 8855 with 10,006 secondary contacts.
Covid-19 Testing Commander Jeroen Weimar said 31 of the cases are from two major clusters, with 11 mystery cases under investigation from authorities.
“Of the 77 cases today 31 are in two large and rapidly growing clusters,” he said.
“One 14 cases are in the Broadmeadows My Centre child care center.
“That’s in addition to the 30 we identified yesterday, that’s 27 cases, just in the last two days, and 17 are in Shepperton.”
Mr Weimar said 35 of today’s case numbers were linked to existing case numbers, with 22 of those cases already in isolation.
“Those existing clusters includes Al Taqwa College, which is on their day 13 testing, Glenroy West Primary School, the Newport footy club, all those kinds of exposure sites we’ve been talking about for a while.
“Again 66 cases in total for today. We then have 11 separate unlinked cases that covers a wide geography of Melbourne, including Airport West, Frankston, Keysborough, Docklands, Yarraville; we are still working to link those cases and identify any downstream exposures.”
It comes as 80 Victorians are being treated in hospital with Covid-19 with eight in ICU and two on ventilators.

Christine Kellett 11.20am: Maroubra party ends in 16 positive cases
NSW authorities have blasted up to 60 people who attended a party in beachside Maroubra, which has resulted in 16 positive cases overnight.
NSW Police Deputy Commissioner Gary Worboys said 681 fines had been handed out in 24 hours, as well as 50 court attendance notices. Four hundred of the fines were for people being outside their home without a reasonable excuse, he said.
“They are being dobbed in by neighbours and people who know these events are occurring so one of the events was at St George, another at Sutherland, another in the Hills district and one at Golden Beach at Tweed Heads.”
NSW Health Minister Brad Hazzard said: “There are those amongst us who don’t seem to give a damn.”
“They are out attending parties, they are out doing what they have been told not to do, facilitating the spread of the virus. I would just say to them, you are ransoming our future, you are making sure that none of us can get back to a normal life. We are in a very serious situation here in New South Wales.”
Despite the infringements, NSW Premier Gladys Berejiklian would not be drawn on wether a nightly curfew currently in place in Sydney’s south west would be extended to all local government areas.

Rhiannon Down 11.15am: Victorian authorities recommend masks for kids
In a national first, Victorian health authorities have recommended young children wear masks to prevent the spread of the Delta variant.
Victorian chief health officer Brett Sutton said the advice will apply to primary school-age children, and was in line with health recommendations in the US.
“I’m reflecting on how challenging it will be for very young children,” Professor Sutton said.
“It is for that reason a recommendation, some kids will do it.
“Some will do it well, some kids will absolutely not be able to do it as a recommendation and if your child is able to do that, that will help protect them.
“It’ll help protect those settings where transmission between kids occurs.”
Premier Daniel Andrews has also announced tough new restrictions on certain high-infection risk industries including construction and childcare sector, which will no longer be able to operate at “100 per cent”.
“They will have to reduce just as the construction sector has done, construction will be reduced to 25 per cent across the whole state, so that will happen in regional Victoria,” he said.
“There will be a little bit of time for that to occur.
“We will work with industry to deliver that outcome, but things like abattoirs, meat processing centres, very large supermarket distribution centres, cool stores,
things of that nature, exactly the same settings as were changed last year, they will be under new arrangements to limit movement and to limit the risk of widespread infection.”

Rhiannon Down 10.54am: Andrews extends lockdown to regional Victoria
Regional Victoria has been plunged into lockdown after 16 new cases were added to today’s case numbers, bringing the new case total to 77.
Victorian Premier Daniel Andrews said the whole of regional Victoria would operate under the same restrictions as Metropolitan Melbouren from 1pm today, except for the curfew.
“Sadly the public health team have advised that given the Shepparton outbreak and the fact that at least one person travelled to Bendigo and potentially others travelled beyond, that is to say there is a very significant risk of transmission right across regional Victoria and not just in that Goulburn Valley area,” Mr Andrews said.
“From 1pm today, all of regional Victoria will move to the same lockdown conditions as exist in Melbourne right now.

Rhiannon Down 9.44am: Taxis, rideshare banned as exclusion zone takes effect
Authorities have created an exclusion zone around the Sydney CBD in an effort to stifle a planned anti-lockdown protest in the city today.
The prohibition notice will prevent anyone from entering the city via taxi, rideshare and passenger services between 9am and 3pm today.
The zone stretches from the West Link Road and The Crescent at Lilyfield to New South Head Road and Ocean Avenue at Edgecliff in the east, north to the Bradfield Highway at Milsons Point with South Dowling Street and Todman Avenue in Zetland making up the southern boundary.
Central Metropolitan Region Commander Assistant Commissioner Peter Thurtell said that any companies that fail to comply could be fined up to $500,000 or up to $100,000 for individuals.
“The transmission of the delta strain of COVID-19 presents a clear and present threat to the community. Now is not the time to gather in groups in protest,” Assistant Commissioner Thurtell said.
“This prohibition notice is just one of our strategies to prevent any unlawful mass gathering and keep our community safe.
“Essential workers, or anyone that requires medical treatment, will be able to make their way to their destinations.”

James Hall 8.25am: Covid-positive man on the run: police
NSW Police have pleaded for help to locate a man infected with Covid-19 who has allegedly refused to follow public health orders.
Anthony Karam, 27, tested positive to the virus and is wanted over “multiple alleged breaches” of public health directions, police said on Saturday, with the state’s top doctor releasing a warning and asking for assistance to track the man down.
Chief health officer Kerry Chant said Mr Karam was infectious, pleaded with Sydney residents to “not approach him” and told anyone with information on his whereabouts to call Crime Stoppers.
“Anthony has failed to isolate as directed by the Public Health Order and despite numerous attempts by police to find him; he has not been located,” NSW Police said in a statement.
A warrant has been issued for his arrest.
Mr Karam is described as being of an olive complexion, about 170cm tall and of a thin build, has short dark hair, brown eyes, a beard and moustache.
He is known to frequent the areas of Greenacre, Wentworth Point and Parramatta.
The plea comes after Premier Gladys Berejiklian ramped up restrictions on concerning Local Government Areas in Sydney’s west amid soaring case numbers and rampant failures to comply with health orders.

Natalie Brown 7.30am: Fears lockdown will drag into 2022, Kennett says
Former Victorian premier Jeff Kennett has revealed concerns among Australia’s food distribution sector that Victoria’s lockdown will drag into 2022, with residents forced to live with tightened restrictions until the new year.
Mr Kennett told the Herald Sun that food industry executives briefed by the Victorian Government had told him that food supply would become a “big issue” in an extended lockdown.
Mr Kennett also said regional areas including those “around Shepparton” would be forced into lockdown after he was provided a document that reportedly canvassed options for new restrictions during the state’s Delta outbreak – including length of time out of the house, access to shopping, a halt on construction and a ban on takeaway coffee and food, though the latter is unlikely to come to fruition.
Victorian Premier Daniel Andrews is expected to announce the toughening of measures today, off the back of urgent meetings held by senior ministers last night.

Paige Taylor 6.55am: Contact tracers hunt for Wilcannia funeral mourners
A Covid-19 outbreak at the ­funeral of a young Aboriginal man in the western NSW town of Wilcannia eight days ago has spread within 20km of the Queensland border to the tiny Aboriginal community of Goodooga.
Contact tracers were continuing to track down and isolate up to 300 mourners from across the state on Friday as the number of confirmed cases in the western NSW outbreak reached 194.
Among 27 new cases on Friday were two Aboriginal people who tested positive at their home in Goodooga – a town of 247 ­people, 183 of them Indigenous – after making an almost 1600km round trip to the funeral at Wilcannia on August 13. Other mourners came from Dubbo, including at least one person now known to have been infectious at the time.
Wilcannia, population 745, was locked down and in crisis on Friday night as cases climbed among residents who attended the funeral or had contact with someone who did. NSW Health confirmed six cases of Covid-19 in Wilcannia on Friday but The Weekend Australian has been told several more are likely to be confirmed today.

Remy Varga 5.30am: Outbreak spreads in regional Vic; tighter lockdown fears
Premier Daniel Andrews has flagged strengthening Melbourne’s already hard lockdown and tightening restrictions in regional Victoria as the Delta variant spreads across the city and a cluster emerges in the state’s north.
Ministers and public health officials are considering if more steps can be taken to curb the spread after more than half the 55 cases recorded on Friday were infectious in the community and 17 cases were detected in Shepparton, around 190km north of Melbourne.
Victorian Premier Daniel Andrews says the state has recorded 55 new COVID-19 cases overnight with six of those being mystery cases.
The Weekend Australian understands a statewide lockdown, further limits on exercise and time allowed outdoors, restrictions on childcare and the full standing down of the construction industry are being discussed.
On Friday night a Victorian government spokeswoman said “all options are on the table” and said all community sporting leagues in the regions had been asked to cancel weekend activities.
Mr Andrews urged people to follow lockdown rules over the weekend, warning case numbers would explode, hospitals would be overrun and that Melbourne could go the way of Sydney if compliance with restrictions did not improve.
Premier Daniel Andrews has announced precautionary Covid restrictions will remain in the greater Shepparton area as health services seek to contain and control the outbreak.
In a statement published late on Friday night, Goulburn Valley Health chief executive Matt Sharp said the family and extended networks of a man in his 30s had tested positive for Covid-19.
“Earlier today there was a new case of Covid-19 in Shepparton reported being a male in his 30s.
“There are now an additional 16 people that have tested positive for Covid-19 today bringing the total of the outbreak in Shepparton to 17 Covid-19 positive people at this time.
“All people that have tested positive are now isolating. It is likely there will be further people testing positive for Covid-19 in the coming days.”

Nicholas Jensen 5.15am: Desperate Berejiklian’s ‘final list’ of NSW restrictions
NSW Premier Gladys Berejiklian has unveiled a ‘final list’ of new restrictions for parts of Sydney, after 644 new Covid-19 cases were announced, along with four more deaths.
At least 41 people infectious in the community, and the south west and western Sydney remain the key areas of concern.
Ms Berejiklian said rising case numbers had given her no choice but to extend the Greater Sydney lockdown until the end of September and introduce a curfew in the 12 LGAs of concern.
Australia is now witnessing a “whole new stage of desperation” in this coronavirus pandemic, according to Sky News host Chris Smith.
Ms Berejiklian announced there would also be a curfew introduced in the LGAs of concern which will run from 9pm until 5am.
Additional rules for 12 LGAs from 12.01am Monday :

- A curfew will be imposed from 9pm to 5am which authorities said would “help reduce the movement of young people”.
- Outdoor exercise will be reduced to one hour per day.
- All school exams or professional development related activities will be moved to online, except for those doing their HSC.
- The following retail venues must close except for click and collect: garden centres and plant nurseries, office supplies, hardware and building supplies, landscaping material supplies, rural supplies, and pet supplies.


NSW Police will also be given special powers to lockdown entire apartment complexes amid threats of Covid-19 infections.

Natasha Robinson 5.am: How to stop Delta spread: jab all teenagers
Vaccinating more than three million children and teenagers under the age of 15 would likely halve the long-term spread of Covid-19.
New University of Melbourne modelling – which comes as Scott Morrison awaits advice on ­extending the national vaccination ­program to those aged as young as 12 – predicts that the move could make lockdowns one-third less likely.
The new modelling, led by ­epidemiologist Tony Blakely , estimates that vaccinating children from the age of five and up would halve the infection rate that Australia is likely to see once interstate borders are opened.
The nation’s vaccine coverage targets should no longer assume children were significantly less likely to be infected with Covid-19, Professor Blakely said.
Liberal MP Dr Katie Allen says the Delta COVID-19 variant has “changed the game” for everyone.

Anne Barrowclough 7.00am: NRL star probed over public health order breach
The NRL is investigating claims Josh Dugan breached NSW public health orders after he was reportedly pulled over in Lithgow on Friday.

Rhiannon Down 5.40pm: 218 arrests, 236 fines in violent Melbourne protests
Victoria Police have made 218 arrests and issued 236 fines after an estimated 4000 protesters stormed the Melbourne CBD, with police deploying levels of force not seen before during a “freedom” protest.
Police deployed “a range of non-lethal options” including OC foam and pepper ball rounds to clear crowds out of the city.
Dozens of police officers marched through the streets of Melbourne, Victoria, as anti-lockdown protesters clashed with officers on Saturday, August 21. According to local media reports, a large number of protesters gathered in Melbourne’s CBD, prompting police to arrest a number of attendees and deploy pepper spray.

Seven officers sustained injuries including two with suspected broken noses, one with a broken thumb and others with concussions, with six requiring hospitalisation.
Three people out of those arrested were charged with assaulting a police officer.
“While there were some peaceful protestors in attendance, the majority of those who attended came with violence in mind,” a police spokesperson said.
“The behaviour seen by police was so hostile and aggressive that they were left with no choice but to use all tactics available to them.”
Police said investigations will continue into who was responsible for several flares being ignited on city streets.
Each protester issued with an infringement notice will be fined $5452 for breaching health directions.

Rhiannon Down 4.52pm: 260 people fined, 47 charged over foiled Sydney rally
NSW Police say they stopped about 250 people from protesting in Sydney’s CBD today, laying scores of charges and fining more than 260 people.
NSW Police Minister David Elliot said the crackdown on the planned anti-lockdown ‘freedom’ rally had “worked to perfection”.
About 1400 officers set up checkpoints and stopped 38,000 vehicles in the city and surrounds from 9am.
“This is not about stopping freedom of speech, it’s about a temporary stop to the freedom of movement,” Mr Elliot said.
“We saw the community backlash after the last protest and that was a genuine reflection of how they saw the actions of a small minority.
“That small minority has again chosen to blatantly ignore the very clear, repeated warnings of NSW Police, which is disappointing, frustrating and – frankly – disgraceful.
“The actions they have taken are likely to prolong the very lockdown they were protesting about.
Deputy Commissioner Mal Lanyon said one officer was injured when he was dragged onto the road during a scuffle, resulting in assault charges.
Forty-seven people will be charged.

Rhiannon Down 4.36pm: Shepparton cluster grows to 21 cases as lockdown bites
Health authorities say that the number of cases linked to the Shepparton outbreak has now grown to include 21 cases.
Goulburn Valley Health chief executive Matt Sharp said that several more cases had been detected this morning, bringing the tally higher than the 17 reported this morning.
“Today we’ve had a further small number of people test positive in the early hours of this morning,” he said, addressing local reporters this morning.
“At the moment in the outbreak here in Shepparton we’ve had a total of 21 active cases which are being closely monitored and contacted by our contact tracing team.”
The discovery that the virus had reached Shepparton has plunged the entirety of regional Victoria into lockdown from 1pm today.
Victorian Premier Daniel Andrews has announced that from 1pm today, regional Victoria will go into the same lockdown conditions as Melbourne with the exception of a curfew.
Covid-19 Testing Commander Jeroen Weimar confirmed this morning that 16 additional cases had been recorded this morning and would be recorded in tomorrow’s case numbers. It remains unclear if the four cases recorded in Shepparton are part of 16 cases.

Rhiannon Down 4.26pm: CMO spruiks another day of record jab numbers
The nation’s vaccine rollout has surpassed 16.8 million Covid-19 vaccine doses, as the number of fully vaccinated Australians edges past the 6 million mark.
Deputy Chief Medical Officer Michael Kidd said that 51.8 per cent of Australians have now received at least one jab, after 1.7 million shots were administered this week.
“Yesterday was another record day for vaccinations,” Professor Kidd said.
“With over 310,000 vaccinations administered to people across Australia. 310,524, to be precise.
“Thank you to everyone who rolled up their sleeves yesterday.
“You’re protecting yourself, you’re protecting your family, and you’re protecting other people.
“Second, we now have over 80 per cent of people in Australia aged over 60 who have received at least a first dose of a COVID-19 vaccine.
Thousands of protesters have marched through the streets of Brisbane's CBD as part of the nationwide 'Freedom Rally'.
“As we all know, it’s critical that older people receive vaccination against Covid-19 because older people are at greatest risk of serious disease and death, if infected with COVID-19.”
Professor Kidd added that nationally there were 554 people being treated in hospital, 94 in intensive care with 36 on ventilators.

Rhiannon Down 4pm: Man charged with initmidating NSW Police Minister
A man has been charged with intimidation after he allegedly followed NSW Police Minister David Elliot down a Baulkham Hills street, questioning the legitimacy of the lockdown.
Police allege the 35-year-old man intercepted Mr Elliot on Old Northern Road at about 3pm on Friday, before pursuing him while hurling verbal insults at him and another passer-by who intervened.
“The man questioned the MP, recording the interaction on his mobile phone and allegedly continued to verbally abuse and intimate him as he followed him to a nearby shopping centre,” a NSW Police spokesperson said.
The video, which has been circulated on social media, shows Mr Elliot at first beginning to engage with the man before walking away saying he wasn’t being listened to.
“I’m feeling intimidated by you,” Mr Elliot said, before crossing the street and walking into a shopping centre with the man in hot pursuit.

Megan Goldin 3.30pm: Fun police close playgrounds without evidence
A police car pulls up at a Melbourne park and, like a chase scene in a RoboCop movie, teenagers kicking a footy take fright and flee.
The dystopian nightmare has returned in a grim rerun of the darkest days of last year’s lockdown when barriers surrounded playgrounds and sports areas were cordoned off under public health orders.
Victorians are told these are necessary sacrifices to beat the virus. Yet the virus pops up again and again like an unwinnable game of whack-a-mole. Premier Daniel Andrews provides no evidence to support his latest tough restrictions. The health advice remains unpublished. There’s no science, no studies and no empirical data to back up the decision to impose a curfew and shut playgrounds.
“It is not for me to prove the efficacy of any one measure,” Andrews said when asked for evidence to support a curfew. “It is not for me to provide hard data.”
Chief health officer Brett Sutton echoed that sentiment.
As opposed to last year’s lockdown, there is now plenty of robust research based on millions of cases abroad to guide decision-making. It simply doesn’t cut it to say that we’re replicating last year’s stab-in-the-dark strategy when experts were still learning about the newly emerged virus.
It may come as a shock to Victorians that global experts who’ve been at the coalface of the pandemic say a preponderance of evidence shows that closing play­grounds and even wearing masks outdoors have no impact on the virus’s spread.

Helena Burke 2.52pm: Covid zero now an impossible task: Berejiklian
NSW Premier Gladys Berejiklian has warned zero cases in the community is an “impossible task”, as the state records its worst ever day of the pandemic, with 825 new cases today.
Just 149 of the new cases were linked to known clusters, with the origin of 676 infections under investigation.
There are currently 516 people in hospital with the virus, including 85 in intensive care and 29 on ventilators.
The three deaths announced on Saturday include a man in his 80s, a woman in her 90s, and a man in his 90s, who was fully vaccinated but had a number of pre-existing health conditions.
Ms Berejiklian said she had noticed a “change of attitude” in her conversations with other state premiers and in the community at large.
NSW Premier Gladys Berejiklian says the state has 825 new local cases of COVID-19 and three deaths were recorded overnight.
“We accept that Delta is here. We accept that heading to zero across the nation — especially once you open up and live freely — will be an impossible task,” she said.
“No matter how hard we work, no matter if 99 per cent of people are doing the right thing, there is an element of Delta that nobody can control.”
Ms Berejiklian urged NSW residents to get vaccinated, applauding the 124,000 people that came forward to get the jab in the past 24 hours.
“The best way we can look forward to freedom is by making sure that we get vaccinated,” she said.
NSW is now at 55 per cent with a first dose and nearly 30 per cent fully vaccinated.
“At this stage, if current rates of vaccination continue, NSW will get to 70 per cent double doses by the end of October and 80 per cent double doses by mid-November,” Ms Berejiklian said.

Rhiannon Down 12.17pm: Victorian fined for brawling with officer over mask
Victoria Police have issued 70 infringements for public health breaches in the past 24 hours, including to a man who allegedly fought with a protective services officer after being ordered to wear a mask.
Chief Commissioner Shane Patton said the altercation which took place at Southland shopping centre in Melbourne’s southeast was one of a number of instances of “unacceptable conduct” discovered by police on Friday.
A group caught playing pool and “drinking and parting without any masks” in Ballarat in regional Victoria at 2.30am had also been fined $1000 for breaching the health orders. Chief Commissioner Patton said police had already issued six fines to potential anti-lockdown protesters in the Melbourne CBD this morning.
“It’s tagged as a freedom demonstration, it’s anything but it’s just selfish,” he said.
“The reality is, we don’t know how many people are going to turn up. There’s between 200 to 5000 people who could turn up, we’re trying to do what we can in terms of identifying how many people got there through encrypted applications that makes it difficult for police.
“I have over 700 Police on top of the other police who are already seen in the community, another 700 Who is specifically tasked with this demonstration, they’ve been out there this morning already.”

Christine Kellett 11.57am: ACT records eight new cases, all linked
The ACT has recorded eight new local cases of coronavirus, all of them linked to known outbreaks.
The territory now has 102 active cases, with the source of two of them not yet identified.
Authorities say none of the eight new cases today were infectious in the community.
“This lockdown is working,” Chief Minister Andrew Barr has told a press conference.
“But we are however starting to see (more) exposure sites post the start of the lockdown. This is a general warning to the community to please be careful when you are outside your home. The lockdown has significantly reduced the risk around new exposure sites but there will still be some.”

Rhiannon Down 11.42am: Where are all of Victoria’s new cases coming from?
Victorian contact tracers are racing to contain the spread of the Delta variant as the number of primary close contacts skyrockets to 8855 with 10,006 secondary contacts.
Covid-19 Testing Commander Jeroen Weimar said 31 of the cases are from two major clusters, with 11 mystery cases under investigation from authorities.
“Of the 77 cases today 31 are in two large and rapidly growing clusters,” he said.
“One 14 cases are in the Broadmeadows My Centre child care center.
“That’s in addition to the 30 we identified yesterday, that’s 27 cases, just in the last two days, and 17 are in Shepperton.”
Mr Weimar said 35 of today’s case numbers were linked to existing case numbers, with 22 of those cases already in isolation.
“Those existing clusters includes Al Taqwa College, which is on their day 13 testing, Glenroy West Primary School, the Newport footy club, all those kinds of exposure sites we’ve been talking about for a while.
“Again 66 cases in total for today. We then have 11 separate unlinked cases that covers a wide geography of Melbourne, including Airport West, Frankston, Keysborough, Docklands, Yarraville; we are still working to link those cases and identify any downstream exposures.”
It comes as 80 Victorians are being treated in hospital with Covid-19 with eight in ICU and two on ventilators.

Christine Kellett 11.20am: Maroubra party ends in 16 positive cases
NSW authorities have blasted up to 60 people who attended a party in beachside Maroubra, which has resulted in 16 positive cases overnight.
NSW Police Deputy Commissioner Gary Worboys said 681 fines had been handed out in 24 hours, as well as 50 court attendance notices. Four hundred of the fines were for people being outside their home without a reasonable excuse, he said.
“They are being dobbed in by neighbours and people who know these events are occurring so one of the events was at St George, another at Sutherland, another in the Hills district and one at Golden Beach at Tweed Heads.”
NSW Health Minister Brad Hazzard said: “There are those amongst us who don’t seem to give a damn.”
“They are out attending parties, they are out doing what they have been told not to do, facilitating the spread of the virus. I would just say to them, you are ransoming our future, you are making sure that none of us can get back to a normal life. We are in a very serious situation here in New South Wales.”
Despite the infringements, NSW Premier Gladys Berejiklian would not be drawn on wether a nightly curfew currently in place in Sydney’s south west would be extended to all local government areas.

Rhiannon Down 11.15am: Victorian authorities recommend masks for kids
In a national first, Victorian health authorities have recommended young children wear masks to prevent the spread of the Delta variant.
Victorian chief health officer Brett Sutton said the advice will apply to primary school-age children, and was in line with health recommendations in the US.
“I’m reflecting on how challenging it will be for very young children,” Professor Sutton said.
“It is for that reason a recommendation, some kids will do it.
“Some will do it well, some kids will absolutely not be able to do it as a recommendation and if your child is able to do that, that will help protect them.
“It’ll help protect those settings where transmission between kids occurs.”
Premier Daniel Andrews has also announced tough new restrictions on certain high-infection risk industries including construction and childcare sector, which will no longer be able to operate at “100 per cent”.
“They will have to reduce just as the construction sector has done, construction will be reduced to 25 per cent across the whole state, so that will happen in regional Victoria,” he said.
“There will be a little bit of time for that to occur.
“We will work with industry to deliver that outcome, but things like abattoirs, meat processing centres, very large supermarket distribution centres, cool stores,
things of that nature, exactly the same settings as were changed last year, they will be under new arrangements to limit movement and to limit the risk of widespread infection.”

Rhiannon Down 10.54am: Andrews extends lockdown to regional Victoria
Regional Victoria has been plunged into lockdown after 16 new cases were added to today’s case numbers, bringing the new case total to 77.
Victorian Premier Daniel Andrews said the whole of regional Victoria would operate under the same restrictions as Metropolitan Melbouren from 1pm today, except for the curfew.
“Sadly the public health team have advised that given the Shepparton outbreak and the fact that at least one person travelled to Bendigo and potentially others travelled beyond, that is to say there is a very significant risk of transmission right across regional Victoria and not just in that Goulburn Valley area,” Mr Andrews said.
“From 1pm today, all of regional Victoria will move to the same lockdown conditions as exist in Melbourne right now.
Mr Andrews said the additional 16 local cases of Covid-19 recorded this morning through rapid testing will be officially included in tomorrow’s case numbers.

Rhiannon Down 9.44am: Taxis, rideshare banned as exclusion zone takes effect
Authorities have created an exclusion zone around the Sydney CBD in an effort to stifle a planned anti-lockdown protest in the city today.
The prohibition notice will prevent anyone from entering the city via taxi, rideshare and passenger services between 9am and 3pm today.
The zone stretches from the West Link Road and The Crescent at Lilyfield to New South Head Road and Ocean Avenue at Edgecliff in the east, north to the Bradfield Highway at Milsons Point with South Dowling Street and Todman Avenue in Zetland making up the southern boundary.
Central Metropolitan Region Commander Assistant Commissioner Peter Thurtell said that any companies that fail to comply could be fined up to $500,000 or up to $100,000 for individuals.
“The transmission of the delta strain of COVID-19 presents a clear and present threat to the community. Now is not the time to gather in groups in protest,” Assistant Commissioner Thurtell said.
“This prohibition notice is just one of our strategies to prevent any unlawful mass gathering and keep our community safe.
“Essential workers, or anyone that requires medical treatment, will be able to make their way to their destinations.”

“If you are considering coming to the city for that purpose I urge you to rethink, significant penalties will apply through infringement notices or you will be out before the court.

James Hall 8.25am: Covid-positive man on the run: police
NSW Police have pleaded for help to locate a man infected with Covid-19 who has allegedly refused to follow public health orders.
Anthony Karam, 27, tested positive to the virus and is wanted over “multiple alleged breaches” of public health directions, police said on Saturday, with the state’s top doctor releasing a warning and asking for assistance to track the man down.
Chief health officer Kerry Chant said Mr Karam was infectious, pleaded with Sydney residents to “not approach him” and told anyone with information on his whereabouts to call Crime Stoppers.
“Anthony has failed to isolate as directed by the Public Health Order and despite numerous attempts by police to find him; he has not been located,” NSW Police said in a statement.
A warrant has been issued for his arrest.
Mr Karam is described as being of an olive complexion, about 170cm tall and of a thin build, has short dark hair, brown eyes, a beard and moustache.
He is known to frequent the areas of Greenacre, Wentworth Point and Parramatta.
The plea comes after Premier Gladys Berejiklian ramped up restrictions on concerning Local Government Areas in Sydney’s west amid soaring case numbers and rampant failures to comply with health orders.

Mr Kennett told the Herald Sun that food industry executives briefed by the Victorian Government had told him that food supply would become a “big issue” in an extended lockdown.
Mr Kennett also said regional areas including those “around Shepparton” would be forced into lockdown after he was provided a document that reportedly canvassed options for new restrictions during the state’s Delta outbreak – including length of time out of the house, access to shopping, a halt on construction and a ban on takeaway coffee and food, though the latter is unlikely to come to fruition.
Victorian Premier Daniel Andrews is expected to announce the toughening of measures today, off the back of urgent meetings held by senior ministers last night.

Paige Taylor 6.55am: Contact tracers hunt for Wilcannia funeral mourners
A Covid-19 outbreak at the ­funeral of a young Aboriginal man in the western NSW town of Wilcannia eight days ago has spread within 20km of the Queensland border to the tiny Aboriginal community of Goodooga.
Contact tracers were continuing to track down and isolate up to 300 mourners from across the state on Friday as the number of confirmed cases in the western NSW outbreak reached 194.
Among 27 new cases on Friday were two Aboriginal people who tested positive at their home in Goodooga – a town of 247 ­people, 183 of them Indigenous – after making an almost 1600km round trip to the funeral at Wilcannia on August 13. Other mourners came from Dubbo, including at least one person now known to have been infectious at the time.
Wilcannia, population 745, was locked down and in crisis on Friday night as cases climbed among residents who attended the funeral or had contact with someone who did. NSW Health confirmed six cases of Covid-19 in Wilcannia on Friday but The Weekend Australian has been told several more are likely to be confirmed today.

Liam Mendes 6.15am: Lockdown activist in tears as he’s locked up for months
An anti-lockdown activist who drove from Queensland to Sydney to help organise an ­unauthorised protest scheduled for Saturday has wiped away tears as he was sentenced to eight months’ jail for multiple breaches of public health orders and other offences.
Anthony Khallouf , one of the organisers behind last month’s violent anti-lockdown rally, was arrested on Thursday after The Australian revealed he had travelled to Sydney and checked into a luxury hotel.
Hornsby Local Court heard on Friday that Khallouf travelled extensively throughout Sydney after arriving on Sunday, including visiting a relative in the Covid-ravaged west of the city, before being tracked down at a train station in Sydney’s north.
The 29-year-old was also convicted of “false representation resulting in police investigation” after telling followers on Instagram on Wednesday to call police because his life was in ­danger.

Remy Varga 5.30am: Outbreak spreads in regional Vic; tighter lockdown fears
Premier Daniel Andrews has flagged strengthening Melbourne’s already hard lockdown and tightening restrictions in regional Victoria as the Delta variant spreads across the city and a cluster emerges in the state’s north.
Ministers and public health officials are considering if more steps can be taken to curb the spread after more than half the 55 cases recorded on Friday were infectious in the community and 17 cases were detected in Shepparton, around 190km north of Melbourne.
Victorian Premier Daniel Andrews says the state has recorded 55 new COVID-19 cases overnight with six of those being mystery cases.
The Weekend Australian understands a statewide lockdown, further limits on exercise and time allowed outdoors, restrictions on childcare and the full standing down of the construction industry are being discussed.
On Friday night a Victorian government spokeswoman said “all options are on the table” and said all community sporting leagues in the regions had been asked to cancel weekend activities.
Mr Andrews urged people to follow lockdown rules over the weekend, warning case numbers would explode, hospitals would be overrun and that Melbourne could go the way of Sydney if compliance with restrictions did not improve.
Premier Daniel Andrews has announced precautionary Covid restrictions will remain in the greater Shepparton area as health services seek to contain and control the outbreak.
In a statement published late on Friday night, Goulburn Valley Health chief executive Matt Sharp said the family and extended networks of a man in his 30s had tested positive for Covid-19.
“Earlier today there was a new case of Covid-19 in Shepparton reported being a male in his 30s.
“There are now an additional 16 people that have tested positive for Covid-19 today bringing the total of the outbreak in Shepparton to 17 Covid-19 positive people at this time.
“All people that have tested positive are now isolating. It is likely there will be further people testing positive for Covid-19 in the coming days.”

Nicholas Jensen 5.15am: Desperate Berejiklian’s ‘final list’ of NSW restrictions
NSW Premier Gladys Berejiklian has unveiled a ‘final list’ of new restrictions for parts of Sydney, after 644 new Covid-19 cases were announced, along with four more deaths.
At least 41 people infectious in the community, and the south west and western Sydney remain the key areas of concern.
Ms Berejiklian said rising case numbers had given her no choice but to extend the Greater Sydney lockdown until the end of September and introduce a curfew in the 12 LGAs of concern.
Australia is now witnessing a “whole new stage of desperation” in this coronavirus pandemic, according to Sky News host Chris Smith.
Ms Berejiklian announced there would also be a curfew introduced in the LGAs of concern which will run from 9pm until 5am.
Additional rules for 12 LGAs from 12.01am Monday :

- A curfew will be imposed from 9pm to 5am which authorities said would “help reduce the movement of young people”.
- Outdoor exercise will be reduced to one hour per day.
- All school exams or professional development related activities will be moved to online, except for those doing their HSC.
- The following retail venues must close except for click and collect: garden centres and plant nurseries, office supplies, hardware and building supplies, landscaping material supplies, rural supplies, and pet supplies.


NSW Police will also be given special powers to lockdown entire apartment complexes amid threats of Covid-19 infections.

Natasha Robinson 5.am: How to stop Delta spread: jab all teenagers
Vaccinating more than three million children and teenagers under the age of 15 would likely halve the long-term spread of Covid-19.
New University of Melbourne modelling – which comes as Scott Morrison awaits advice on ­extending the national vaccination ­program to those aged as young as 12 – predicts that the move could make lockdowns one-third less likely.
The new modelling, led by ­epidemiologist Tony Blakely , estimates that vaccinating children from the age of five and up would halve the infection rate that Australia is likely to see once interstate borders are opened.
The nation’s vaccine coverage targets should no longer assume children were significantly less likely to be infected with Covid-19, Professor Blakely said.
Liberal MP Dr Katie Allen says the Delta COVID-19 variant has “changed the game” for everyone.

Full text: New University of Melbourne modelling – which comes as Scott Morrison awaits advice on ­extending the national vaccination ­program to those aged as young as 12 – predicts that the move could make lockdowns one-third less likely.
The new modelling, led by ­epidemiologist Tony Blakely, estimates that vaccinating children from the age of five and up would halve the infection rate that Australia is likely to see once interstate borders are opened.
The nation’s vaccine coverage targets should no longer assume children were significantly less likely to be infected with Covid-19, Professor Blakely said.
NSW Premier Gladys Berejiklian said on Friday her government would introduce harsher restrictions across Greater Sydney, with masks required to be worn outdoors.
But it will be the millions of residents across 12 local government areas in the city’s west and southwest who will face the strictest measures. From Monday, there will be a 9pm curfew with only one hour of exercise permitted, officials said.
Victoria is also on the brink of stricter restrictions after Premier Daniel Andrews warned that the state’s outbreak was close to ­“spiralling out of control”. In a late-night statement, a government spokesman said: “All options are on the table.”
There were 644 Covid-19 cases recorded in NSW and 55 in Victoria on Friday, with both states ­bracing for higher infections.
The rate of vaccinations has risen sharply since the start of ­August. Under the national road map out of the pandemic, lockdowns and border closures would be used rarely once vaccine coverage hit 80 per cent. Restrictions would begin to be eased, however, as coverage reached 70 per cent.
Australia is now witnessing a “whole new stage of desperation” in this coronavirus pandemic, according to Sky News host Chris Smith.“Today I think we hit a definitive mark,” he said.It comes after NSW Premier Gladys Berejiklian announced a number of new measures to stem the spread of the Delta variant.Greater Sydney’s lockdown will continue until the end of September, and from Monday a curfew between 9 pm and 5 am has been ordered for the 12 hotspot areas in Sydney’s west and southwest.According to Mr Smith, the tough curfew measure has been imposed “for the sake of having a tough measure”.“They’ve lost the plot,” he said.“Vaccines are emerging as our final hope.”
Data analysts have estimated that – if the current pace is maintained – 70 per cent of those aged 16 and over could be fully vaccinated by November 3 and 80 per cent by November 21.
If children were included in the targets, 80 of the population aged over 12 could be fully vaccinated by November 29.
“Our seven-day average daily doses is a whopping 251,050,” said data analyst Juliette O’Brien.
“Assuming this warp speed continues, we would easily hit the target of having 80 per cent of over 16s fully vaccinated by November 21.”
The Prime Minister, who is ­expected to receive advice from the Australian Technical Advisory Group on Immunisation about ­extending the program this week, suggested that the 80 per cent coverage target would not be changed to include those aged ­between 12 and 15, even if they were made eligible for the vaccine.
“The recommendation from the Doherty Institute did not ­include and actually specifically did not include 12 to 15s and did not consider it necessary (that they) be included in those overall vaccination rates to trigger when you can move to the next phases,” Mr Morrison said.
“So when we continue to report figures, it’ll be based on the population 16 and above.”
State governments are ­increasingly concerned about the spread of the Delta variant among young people , with one-third of cases in NSW in those aged under 19 and a quarter of cases in Victoria in children aged under nine.
NSW health department figures show that 32 per cent of the Covid-19 cases diagnosed in the state in the past two weeks have been in those aged under 19, with 778 cases in children nine and under and 1111 cases in those aged between 10 and 19.
In Victoria, one-quarter of ­active cases of Covid-19 are in children aged under nine years old.
Victoria’s deputy chief health officer Ben Cowie said: “This is a completely different epidemiological pattern than what we’ve seen previously.”
Despite his modelling taking in children as young as 5, Professor Blakely said it was more than achievable to have everyone aged over 12 vaccinated by the end of the year.
“I think the adult vaccination is going extremely well and I don’t see why, if we really wanted to, we couldn’t double vaccinate all school kids by Christmas,” Professor Blakely said.
“We might even be able to get a single shot into all primary school kids as well.”
NSW’s chief health officer, Kerry Chant, said this week parents should not to send children to school or childcare centres ­unless they had no other choice, citing concerns over the rapid spread of the coronavirus in the younger age groups.
Covid: Demographic divide (cases v population)
Despite the concerns, health experts say it is rare for children to become seriously ill from Covid-19 and a recent study published in prestigious academic journal The Lancet put the risk of children suffering long-term ­effects of the virus at 1.7 per cent.
The rate of a child under four years of age being hospitalised was 1.7 per cent, NSW health figures show, and 0.9 per cent for those aged between 5 and 11.
University of Sydney infectious diseases paediatrician Robert Booy said the key reason children made up such large proportions of diagnosed cases of Covid-19 during the Delta wave was because they were unvaccinated, rather than there being anything in particular about the strain that made it more transmissible in children.
“It’s not a question of Delta honing in on children, it’s a question of Delta honing in on people who are unvaccinated,” Professor Booy said.
“Covid is much milder in children and although a small percentage might be hospitalised, the risk of severe disease even without vaccinating children remains very low.”
The New Zealand government announced on Friday it would begin to vaccinate children aged 12 to 16.
In Australia, 11.5 per cent of teenagers aged between 16 and 19 have received a first dose of vaccine and 3.9 per cent are fully vaccinated.
Mr Morrison said a youth vaccination program was already being developed with the assistance of state and territory governments. Extending the vaccination program to children aged 12 would add about 1.25 million children to the 20.6 million currently eligible to receive a vaccine.
“We need to run that in parallel, of course, with the national vaccination program, of which it will form a part,” Mr Morrison said on Friday.

Full text: The survey of 999 Australian employees by global HR software firm Employment Hero found overwhelming support for providing greater freedoms for fully vaccinated citizens, including almost 77 per cent in NSW.
A range of business groups has called for the use of vaccine certificates in Australia, but several ­Coalition MPs have voiced concerns about their requirement for interstate travel and attending venues and events.
The Employee Covid-19 Vaccination Sentiment Report found 71 per cent of employees surveyed support the use of green cards – already used in Israel and the EU. More than two-thirds felt vaccine passports were necessary to protect family health and get businesses operating again.
Only 16 per cent of surveyed workers said they were against the concept. Victoria, Tasmania and the Northern Territory are currently working on vaccine passport pilot programs and will deliver recommendations to nat­ional cabinet.
Under national cabinet’s vaccination road map – based on modelling conducted by the Doherty Institute – a 70 per cent threshold will see the use of lockdowns and hard border closures curtailed, with draconian restrictions almost disappearing once 80 per cent of the population is vaccinated.
West Australian Premier Mark McGowan has already announced that travellers from Covid hotspots – a new “extreme high risk” category – will be required to show proof they have had at least one jab.
Six per cent of surveyed workers said they had been actively discouraged from getting the ­vaccine by their workplace. Employees in microbusinesses (two-nine staff) were 198 per cent more likely to report employers were pushing them not to get the jab.
More than half of Australian workers in the survey believed the federal government had mismanaged the vaccine rollout; 57 per cent of workers agreed the federal government vaccine messaging was confusing.
Moreover, more than 60 per cent of workers surveyed said their workplace had little influence on their decision to be vaccinated, with more than half saying their employer had never spoken to them about getting the vaccine. Only 22 per cent of those surveyed said employers should mandate vaccinations for staff.
Employment Hero chief executive Ben Thompson said ongoing uncertainty about staff vaccination meant employers were “terrified of doing the wrong thing”.
Of those who said they wouldn’t get vaccinated, 12 per cent said they were against the vaccine. More than a quarter were waiting for mRNA vaccines and 24 per cent said they were waiting until vaccines had been available for longer.

Full text: NSW has recorded a grim new peak of 633 cases with 62 infectious in the community.
As cases in her country grow to ten, New Zealand Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern says NZ’s snap lockdown was triggered by a positive case who travelled from NSW to Auckland in July.
The ACT has 22 new cases, all linked.
Victoria has recorded 24 new local cases, including four mystery cases. Labor senator Katy Gallagher is in mandatory isolation after her daughter tested positive to Covid-19. In Victoria, Premier Daniel Andrews said he ‘did not have to prove curfews work’, despite strong opposition to his latest restrictions.
New daily cases in New South Wales
Jess Malcolm 11.30pm: Vic and Tas toughen restrictions on NZ
Victoria and Tasmania have moved to strengthen border restrictions with New Zealand.
Since 8pm on Wednesday Victoria has designated New Zealand a red zone under its traffic light permit system, requiring any returning Victorians to register for a permit and quarantine at home upon arrival. Non-Victorians will not be permitted to enter.
Jess Malcolm 10.45pm: New alert for Dubbo shop
A Dubbo minimart has been listed as a close contact venue by NSW Health late on Wednesday evening.
Anyone who visited the Myall Street Minimart on Friday August 13 from 2.15pm to 2.30pm is now considered a close contact and must self isolate for 14 days since exposure.
Several new casual contact venues have been added in Albion Park, Bourke, Broken Hill and Dubbo.
NSW Health is urging all residents to check the government website regularly as new venues arise.
Jess Malcolm 10pm: Vic to record 40 new locally acquired infections
Victoria is likely to record at least 40 new locally acquired infections on Thursday, the highest number since its deadly second wave.
The Herald Sun has reported at least 40 cases had been confirmed as of 7pm on Wednesday night.
The numbers are likely to spike after day 13 testing of people in connection to the Al-Taqwa College outbreak.
There are also fears the virus has circulated among the city’s homeless community.
The surge will come on Melbourne’s 200th day of lockdown since the pandemic began, and is likely to quash any hopes the city would be freed soon.
Ewin Hannan 9.45pm: Business slams PM for lack of leadership
Employers have accused the Morrison government for failing to show “any leadership at all” over workplace vaccinations, criticising the Coalition for rebuffing their bid for new laws that would clarify their ability to enforce compulsory Covid jabs and stand down vaccine refusers.
Employer groups said a meeting with unions convened by ­Industrial Relations Minister Michaelia Cash on Wednesday had done nothing to address their concerns about the potential legal consequences for business from the vaccine rollout.
“We got absolutely nothing from the federal government today,” Australian Mines and Metals Association chief executive Steve Knott said.
“All we’re getting at the moment is ‘run around the park, look over there, have a go yourself, maybe you might be able to get a state health order’. When you operate across multiple states that’s not very helpful. So we’re not getting any leadership at all from the federal government on this issue which is really disappointing.”
Mr Knott said employers, once they have consulted with workers, should have the right to not employ workers in customer-facing roles if they chose not to be vaccinated. “The issue of what you do with the vaccine hesitant, those who refuse to get vaccinated and the implications that has for business, that issue just gets sidestepped,” he said.
Australian Chamber of Commerce and Industry chief executive Andrew McKellar said the Morrison government needed to implement new legislation clarifying the ability of employers to implement mandatory vaccinations without being exposed to the risk of legal action.

Yoni Bashan 9pm: Private hospital staff join jab force
NSW Health has asked private hospitals to pause non-urgent elective surgery to bolster the state’s Covid-19 response, after daily infection numbers spiked on Wednesday and officials warned of further increases in coming days.
Health staff from 40 private hospitals are expected to be re­deployed as part of a “large-scale vaccination effort” that is continuing across the state, but also to support what officials described as increasing demand that was being experienced across the public health system.
Non-urgent surgery has already been placed on hold in public hospitals across Greater Sydney and regional NSW.
The move to do so in the private system indicates the heightened level of urgency and strain on resources.
Official said urgent elective and emergency surgeries would continue. “This decision has the full support of the commonwealth government through the commonwealth Department of Health, which has agreed the temporary suspension of non-­urgent elective surgery to free up staff to support the pandemic response,” NSW Health said in a statement.
Wednesday marked a rise in daily infections, with 633 cases announced and 92 known to be active in the community; another 475 cases are under investigation for their isolation status.

AFP 8.20pm: Israel tightens restrictions as cases leap
New restrictions aimed at curbing the spread of Covid-19 took effect in Israel on Wednesday, after the largely vaccinated country saw the highest daily infection rate since January.
The measures, announced on Sunday, require vaccination certificates or negative coronavirus tests to enter a range of public spaces, including restaurants and bars, cultural and sports venues, hotels and gyms, the health ministry said.
The same applies to worshippers wishing to enter synagogues, mosques or churches with more than 50 people in attendance.
In addition, the capacity of stores, shopping malls and industrial parks will be limited to one person per seven square metres.
After its launch last December, Israel’s widely praised vaccination drive helped to drastically bring down infections.
But that trend has since reversed, driven by the spread of the more contagious Delta variant of the virus, with restrictions that were lifted in June reimposed since July.
In recent weeks, the state has begun administering booster shots to Israelis aged 50 and over, while urging anyone aged 12 and older to get vaccinated.
About one million Israelis have not been vaccinated even though they are eligible.
According to the health ministry, more than 8700 people tested positive for coronavirus on Tuesday, the highest number for a single day since January.
Prime Minister Naftali Bennett has been imploring Israelis to get vaccinated, warning of a possible lockdown that could affect the Jewish high holidays next month unless inoculation numbers rise.
Jess Malcolm 7.40pm: Dubbo venues trigger alert
Two new Dubbo venues have become close contact sites.
Snap Fitness on 113 Darling Street was exposed to Covid-19 on Tuesday, August 10, from 5.30pm to 6.30pm.
Itty Bitty Spa on 69-79 Macquarie Street was also exposed on August 10, from 9.30am to 5.30pm.
Anyone who was at these venues at these times must get tested and isolate for 14 days.
Jess Malcolm 7pm: ACT exposure list grows
The ACT has added several new close and casual exposure venues including a Subway restaurant, an athletics club and a rehabilitation health clinic.
Iskia Athletic Club Campbell in Campbell was closely exposed on Thursday, August 12, from 12.15 to 2pm.
The Rehabilitation Specialists in Fyshwick and The Bucket Warehouse have both been listed on Wednesday, August 11, as well as the Grand Central Towers communal pool area, which was exposed on Thursday.
A positive Covid-19 case also visited the Dickson Subway on August 11 from 7pm to 7.50pm.
Other sites on the list include the Spence Grocer across a number of days last week, the Braddon McDonalds and the Belconnen Westfield.
ACT residents are urged to check the list of exposure sites and follow the appropriate public health advice.
Jess Malcolm 6.31pm: ACT health system under strain
Over 500 nurses in the ACT are now isolating after coming into contact with a positive Covid-19 case, with its healthcare system starting to show the first signs of strain under the weight of a Delta outbreak.
The spike in cases has triggered public health authorities to call on retired nurses to come back to work to offer care or help with testing.
ACT Health Minister Rachel Stephen-Smith told the ABC on Wednesday that the outbreak was having a “huge impact” on its healthcare system.
“People might have heard yesterday that we are calling on nurses in the ACT community who aren’t already working in our health system to come and help us,” she told ABC Radio Canberra.
“If they meet the criteria, any recently retired nurse or a nurse who’s taking a career break who has the capacity to return will make a real difference in our outbreak.”
ACT Chief Minister Andrew Barr says the Territory has recorded 22 new local COVID cases and reveals a number of support measures for businesses will be announced in the coming days.
Jess Malcolm 5.48pm: Elective surgery cancelled in private NSW hospitals
Elective surgery will be postponed in a number of private hospitals in NSW from Monday August 23 in a bid to free up medical staff needed to support the state’s Covid-19 pandemic response.
Private healthcare workers will be used to support large-scale vaccination efforts already underway and help meet workforce demands in the public health system.
Staff from hospitals across greater Sydney have already been deployed to help boost vaccination rates and have supplied supplementary resources to regional areas.
Patients due to receive non-urgent elective surgery who are impacted by these changes have been contacted and are encouraged to seek medical attention if their condition changes.
Emergency surgery will continue.
The affected private hospitals are as follows:
Macquarie University Hospital
Castlecrag Private Hospital
Hunters Hill Private Hospital
Kareena Private Hospital
North Shore Private Hospital
St George Private Hospital

Vaccine doses rollout across age groups
Remy Varga 4.50pm: Alert after kindergarten exposed for a week
A Glenroy Kindergarten has been listed by Victorian public health authorities as a Tier 1 exposure site for seven consecutive days, stoking fears children could have been infected with Covid-19.
The York St Kindergarten was exposed from August 6 to 12 between 9am to 5pm, after an employee presumably worked while infectious.
Anyone who attended this venue during this period must immediately get tested and quarantine for 14 days from exposure.
The Spencer Street Coles in Melbourne CBD has also been listed as a Tier 2 site, along with Rex Espresso in Barkly Square in Melbourne’s north.
The Women’s House Sacred Heart Mission in St Kilda was also listed as a Tier 2 site on Wednesday afternoon.
Anyone who visits a Tier 2 site is required to get tested urgently and isolate until receiving a negative result.
Remy Varga 4.20pm: Playground, park, court lockdown closures begin
Melbourne councils have begun closing playgrounds, basketball courts, public gym equipment and skate and BMX parks to enforce the Chief Health Officer’s latest restrictions.
Port Philip Mayor Louise Crawford said the council had taped off playgrounds, skateparks and outdoor exercise equipment in the local government area that covers Port Melbourne, St Kilda and Elwood.
“We are installing temporary closed signs around the basketball hoop posts,” she said.
A spokeswoman for the northeast Melbourne Boroondara council, which includes Hawthorn and Kew, said all outdoor playgrounds and exercises spaces had been closed while basketballs hoops had been removed or had access restricted to prevent public use.
“In line with current Victorian Government COVID-19 directions, Council has closed all outdoor public playgrounds, gym equipment, basketball courts, and outdoor skate and BMX parks,” she said.
“Council has installed signage at all of our open space areas advising of the closures.”
A City of Melbourne spokeswoman said playgrounds within the LGA had been roped off while basketball hoops would start to be removed from Thursday.
“In line with the Chief Health Officer’s directions, and to protect public health, playgrounds have been roped off and signage displayed indicating they are closed,” she said.
“Basketball hoops will start being removed tomorrow.”
The spokeswoman said the facilities would be reopened as soon as restrictions eased.
Max Maddison 4.10pm: ‘Never too late’: Kidd defends Indigenous vaccine effort
Deputy Chief Medical Officer Michael Kidd says 1.7 million vaccines have been administered across the past seven days, as he defends the Morrison government’s efforts to vaccinate vulnerable populations in western NSW.
Professor Kidd said the figure was more than the population of “Adelaide and Darwin combined”, as he pointed to the rising vaccination rate among the total eligible population, which had reached 27.5 per cent, and workers in essential industries, with 46 per cent of aged care workers receiving both doses.
Amid criticism that efforts to vaccinate remote Indigenous communities had come far too late, given the virus was already circulating, Professor Kidd said it was “never too late” for people to get vaccinated, but pointed to the vaccine hesitancy in some of the affected areas.
“What we’ve seen of course is that vaccine hesitancy is markedly reduced when outbreaks do occur. We saw that happening in Victoria earlier in the year. We have certainly seen this happening across New South Wales as well,” Professor Kidd told reporters on Wednesday afternoon.
“Of course we have had vaccines rolling out in many of these centres but what we’ve done over recent days is to ramp up even further the opportunities for people to be vaccinated against Covid-19.”

Jess Malcolm 3.55pm: Three news cases bring NZ outbreak to 10
A further three new Covid-19 cases have been detected in New Zealand on Wednesday afternoon, bringing the total outbreak to 10.
The new cases were announced by Covid-19 response minister Chris Hipkins on local station Radio NZ.
No further details were given about the nature of these cases, with further information expected in its daily update tomorrow.
Mr Hipkins said he expected there would be more cases to come.
“We’re seeing more cases coming through, I don’t have details of those cases,” he said. “But yes, I can confirm that we have further positive test results since the press conference today.”

Max Maddison 3.45pm: Morrison, Thai PM discuss ‘common’ Covid-19 challenges
Scott Morrison and Thai Prime Minister Prayut Chan-o-cha have discussed the countries’ “common challenges” in combating the spread of Covid-19, in their first call since November last year.
With case numbers soaring in the southeast Asian country, surpassing 20,000 new infections daily, the Prime Minister and his Thai counterpart discussed Australia’s support for access to safe and effective vaccines, including through bilateral, Quad and G7 initiatives.
The hook up was the first since talks for the Australia-Thailand Strategic Partnership concluded last November.
Jess Malcolm 3.30pm: Covid-19 case in Goulburn, not active in community
A new Covid-19 case has been detected in the regional city of Goulburn, NSW.
The person works in the ACT but lives in the Goulburn area, and is suspected to have caught the virus in Canberra.
The Southern NSW Local Health District has confirmed the case was not active in the community while infectious, and there are no exposure sites.
A small number of close contacts have been identified and are being tested and isolating.
Additional testing capacity has been set up in Goulburn at the Hospital.
Jess Malcolm 3.15pm: Police warn of swift action on any anti-lockdown protest
NSW Police have issued a stern warning to anyone planning to attend an unauthorised anti-lockdown protest this weekend, saying they will face “the full force of the law”.
Preparations are already underway for a highly visible and mobile police operation to disrupt mass gatherings anywhere in the state.
Anyone planning to attend has been threatened with severe and harsh penalties, and legal action.
Minister for Police David Elliott said illegal protests could have long-lasting and detrimental impacts to all Sydneysiders.
“The overwhelming majority of people in NSW are doing their bit to turn the Covid-19 case numbers in the right direction and this proposed protest would undermine all that work,” Mr Elliott said.
“We’re temporarily living with restrictions that we all want to see lifted, but the mass gathering of a group of idiots could mean that day moves further into the future.
“I have complete confidence in the work police are doing within Operation Stay at Home and the operational plans for the weekend should reassure the wider community that officers are at the ready to take swift action against anyone not complying with the public health orders.”

Eli Greenblat 2.54pm: ‘Pantry eating’ slows Domino’s Pizza sales
Domino’s Pizza chief executive Don Meij believes once households have eaten their way through much of their bloated pantries in preparation for extended lockdowns they will soon get bored and crave for takeaway meals such as pizza.
Labelling it “pantry eating”, Mr Meij said the pizza chain’s experience across its regions in Australia, Asia and Europe through the first wave of Covid-19 last year showed a short dip in sales for his pizzas was soon followed by a return to historic growth patterns.
Mr Meij said Domino’s flagship outlets in Australia were experiencing this phenomenon at the moment as NSW, Canberra and Victoria faced lockdowns and curfews with same-store sales up just 2.7 per cent in the first seven weeks of the current financial year. That well below Domino’s long-term aspirations for like for like sales growth of 3 to 6 per cent.

Nicholas Jensen 2.05pm: NT ‘confident’ lockdowns will lift with zero new cases
NT Chief Minister Michael Gunner says he is confident the snap lockdown of Greater Darwin and Katherine will end on Thursday as health authorities await further testing results from close contacts.
After recording zero community cases earlier today, Mr Gunner said he was confident but not “completely certain” that the lockdown would lift at midday tomorrow.
“We are confident we have caught this thing in time. We are confident we have trapped the risk and we are confident that our tracing efforts have been successful.”
The number of close contacts from this outbreak has now reached 93 residents, with 2128 tests recorded across the NT on Tuesday.
Health officials have established two vaccine hubs in central Katherine and at the Katherine District Hospital in a bid to accelerate the region’s rollout using an additional 1000 doses.
Mr Gunner said all close contacts had been reached and were isolating, except one case of a man currently on a ship in international waters.
Fifty-seven per cent of the NT population has now received a first dose of vaccination.

Adeshola Ore 2.05pm: Federal parliament to sit next week despite ACT lockdown
Federal parliament will sit as scheduled next week, despite the ACT being in an extended Covid-19 lockdown.
The Australian understands the decision has been made in consultation with Chief Medical Officer Paul Kelly and the presiding officers. Scott Morrison has informed ACT Chief Minister Andrew Barr about the sitting schedule.
Mr Barr had previously said it was his preference for parliament not to sit.
The ACT recorded 22 new cases of the virus today.

Greg Brown 1.51pm: Frydenberg urges Indigenous voice supporters be flexible
Josh Frydenberg has urged supporters of an Indigenous voice to parliament against using a “take it or leave it” approach in pushing the reform, declaring the formation of the Aboriginal advisory body needed to be bipartisan and subject to negotiation.
The Treasurer would not endorse enshrining the voice in the constitution, as called for by Indigenous leaders in the Uluru Statement from the Heart and backed by Liberal senator Andrew Bragg, NSW Premier Gladys Berejiklian and South Australian Premier Steven Marshall.
“We know how difficult it is to get constitutional change through in our parliament and our country,” Mr Frydenberg said at the virtual Melbourne book launch of Senator Bragg’s book, Buraadja. “Where we need that double majority of voters and states.”
Scott Morrison is pursuing a “voice to government” that would be created through legislation, but has rejected holding a referendum to enshrine it in the constitution.
Noel Pearson is among Indigenous leaders who has flagged opposition to a legislated version of the voice that is not protected by constitutional enshrinement.
However, Mr Frydenberg warned supporters of the voice against being inflexible, arguing it would be no easy task creating the body through legislation.
“Legislative change is difficult too,” Mr Frydenberg said.
“We’ve really got to focus on what unites us here and not what divides us,” Mr Frydenberg said.
“And what we need to do is ensure that the change whatever form it takes, is bipartisan.
“You don’t get many chances of this and you need to take the public with you. “And that’s why it needs to be subject to negotiation, consultation, there needs to be flexibility, because if this proposition in the voice is a take it or leave it, I don’t think it necessarily advances in the way that some people would like it to do.
“And this is the reality that we have to shake. And this is where we have to work through the issue.”

Paige Taylor 1.45pm: Powerful vaccination message to Indigenous people | WATCH
The New South Wales Aboriginal Land Council has begun circulating a confronting video warning Indigenous people they could be responsible for putting their relatives in hospital if they do not get vaccinated against Covid-19.
The 30-second clip is being used to encourage Aboriginal people in western NSW to take advantage of a massive vaccination drive as Covid-19 cases hit 142 in the region. About 60 per cent of infected people in the western NSW outbreak are Indigenous.
The video shows an Aboriginal woman playing with and looking after her daughter as she grows from a baby to an adult and leaves home. The narrator says: “Mum has always been there to take care of you, to hold you, to love you. She’s given you so much”. In the next scene, the worried daughter is behind a glass wall looking at her mother who is in a hospital bed on a respirator. The narrator says: “And this is what you could give her in return. Get vaccinated against Covid-19 now. Do it for your mum, your dad, your family and your community”.
The Kimberley Aboriginal Medical Service commissioned the video to promote Covid-19 vaccinations in the far north of Western Australia, where an outbreak of the virus among hospital workers in 2020 caused panic. That region’s more than 100 Indigenous communities are considered especially vulnerable because of overcrowded housing and because of the high proportion of the Kimberley’s approximately 15,000 Indigenous residents with co-morbidities such as diabetes.
The risk to Aboriginal communities in western NSW is acknowledged to be extremely serious.
On Wednesday, the Australian Defence Force, the emergency health crisis team AUSMAT and the Royal Flying Doctor Service were in NSW’s west running mobile vaccination teams to try to get ahead of the virus, which has now reached Wilcannia and Broken Hill.

Nicholas Jensen 1.31pm: Ardern says NZ lockdown linked to NSW outbreak
Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern says New Zealand’s snap lockdown was triggered by a positive case who travelled from NSW to Auckland in July.
New Zealand health authorities said genome sequencing had traced the spread of the virus back to a positive case in quarantine, with Ms Ardern telling reporters today that “our case has originated in Australia”.
However the precise link to the NSW outbreak remains unclear, as health officials are reportedly still trying to understand how and exactly when the virus arrived.
Ms Ardern did not clarify how officials established the case originated in Australia.
Health director general Ashley Bloomfield confirmed there were now seven cases linked to the original patient, including a teacher and a fully vaccinated nurse at Auckland Hospital.
Sixteen close contacts have since been identified.

Max Maddison 1.00pm: Vaccine approval for teens ‘not too far away’: PM
Regulatory approval for vaccinating 12-15-year-olds is “not too far away”, Scott Morrison has revealed, but says the government wants to be “very sure” about the medical advice.
Labor senator Katy Gallagher’s daughter Evie, 14, contracted the virus on Tuesday at Lyneham High School. She criticised the Morrison government for the sluggish vaccination rollout, saying there was a “fair dose of anger” for the lack of supply in the country.
The Australian Technical Advisory Group on Immunisation is currently considering expanding the vaccination rollout to teenagers, and the Prime Minister flagged it could be approved imminently.
“And it’s not too far away, is my understanding. But equally we’re talking about the vaccination of our kids and I want to be very sure about the medical advice we’re getting about that,” Mr Morrison told reporters on Wednesday.
He said national cabinet was considering a state-based system for vaccinations programs run out of schools, with planning already underway.

Max Maddison 12.50pm: PM ‘optimistic’ of avoiding recession, despite NSW crisis
Scott Morrison says he “remains optimistic” the country can avoid falling into another recession on the back of record cases numbers in NSW.
The Prime Minister said the economic advice he had been given showed the economy bouncing back “strongly” once the country hit the sufficient vaccination thresholds to reopen, citing current modelling which showed the swift pace of vaccination uptake.
“I do remain confident in the Australian economy because there is no issue with the Australian economy. There is an issue of the impact of COVID-19 and restrictions that are holding that economy back,” Mr Morrison told reporters on Wednesday.
Two consecutive quarters of negative growth are considered to be a technical recession. With prolonged and widespread lockdowns across the country, economists have already written off the third quarter of this year.

Nicholas Jensen 12.10pm: ACT records 22 new cases, all linked
The ACT has recorded 22 locally acquired cases of Covid-19, bringing the territory’s total active cases to 67.
All new infections have been linked to known cases, while the list of “self-identified contacts” has grown to more than 10,000 residents.
Despite all cases being linked Chief Minister Andrew Barr said: “Anyone who looks at the NSW numbers today, and what has been occurring there, would be very clear that now is not the time at this stage of our outbreak to be easing restrictions.”
ACT has also tightened its border with NSW, placing additional facilities on the Queanbeyan side of the ACT border.
“We have been able to direct some Canberrans (on the border) to those testing facilities when demand has peaked inside the ACT.”
In the last 24 hours, 8417 tests were conducted, with almost 25,000 tests taken since the lockdown commenced. Health officials said this meant 6 per cent of the ACT population had accessed a Covid test.
Mr Barr said the ACT government is working with the commonwealth to make sure support is available for businesses struggling under lockdown.
Remy Varga 12.01pm: Clients urged to get tested after sex worker tests positive
Victorian Health Minister Martin Foley has confirmed a St Kilda sex worker has tested positive for Covid-19 and is quarantine under government care.
Mr Foley said there was no evidence of transmission occurring because of the woman’s occupation but said out of caution anyone who had employed the services of a sex worker in St Kilda to come forward for testing.
“No matter where you are, you need to come forward and get tested,” he said.
Mr Foley said the woman lived in a boarding house in St Kilda and a number of their primary close contacts had tested negative.
“We want to make sure issues of what faith you follow, what profession you’re involved with, what your arrangements are, what your form of housing is … the issue here is that this virus does not discriminate,” he said.
Paul Garvey 11.57am: ‘Extreme’ risk: WA poised to completely close to NSW
Western Australia could completely shut its border to NSW within days after case numbers soared to a new record level.
The 633 new cases announced by NSW on Wednesday means it is at risk of becoming the first state to be classed as an “extreme” risk under WA’s border controls. Such a rating would mean WA would stop allowing people from NSW into WA on compassionate grounds, with only those public officials exempt from border controls under the Australian constitution – namely Commonwealth parliamentarians, defence officials, and Federal bureaucrats – allowed to enter from NSW.
The “extreme” rating applies to any state that records a rolling five-day or 14-day average of more than 500 new Covid cases a day, with NSW on track to reach that mark as early as this weekend.
WA premier Mark McGowan last week said Western Australians who wanted to return home from NSW on compassionate ground would be allowed to do so if they had received at least one vaccination.
But the premier warned on Wednesday morning that anyone in NSW wanting to get back to WA needed to “get on a plane now”.
“We created a window for Western Australians on compassionate grounds to come home, provided they are vaccinated and provided they are tested, and we urge people to do so.
If they choose not to, and the window closes, that would have been their choice,” he said.
The refusal of even compassionate cases would constitute the most comprehensive form of domestic border closure introduced in Australia during the pandemic.
Mr McGowan also announced that travel restrictions from New Zealand would be tightened from midday today. Anyone arriving in Perth from New Zealand will now be required to quarantine for two weeks.
New Zealand’s latest lockdown also means that the upcoming Bledisloe Cup rugby match scheduled for Perth on September 28 could be in doubt.
“It’s a moving situation and we’re trying to work out exactly what can be done about that,” Mr McGowan said.
“It would be very disappointing for rugby fans if we’re forced to cancel the game but that’s the nature of the world we’re in.”

Nicholas Jensen 11.55am: Berejiklian defends current NSW lockdown settings
Amid mounting pressure, NSW Premier Gladys Berejiklian has defended the state’s current lockdown settings, adding that too many people “continue to do the wrong thing”.
“Unfortunately, it only takes a small number of people to do the wrong thing, to cause this amount of spread … we know that there is the light at the end of the tunnel,” she said.
Chief health officer Kerry Chant rebuffed claims she is at loggerheads with the Premier regarding the introduction of stricter lockdown.
“The Premier is very committed to achieving the same outcomes (as me). We have a shared vision, a shared vision which is high vaccination coverage and very low levels of community transmission,” she said
“I can’t comment any further than to say that the Premier, in all my discussions with her, is absolutely committed (to this goal).”
Lydia Lynch 11.45am: Less essential workers: Qld to get tougher on NSW border
As Queensland relaxes its internal gathering restrictions, Premier Annastacia Palaszczuk said it is necessary to toughen border restrictions with NSW.
NSW reported 633 new local cases on Wednesday while Queensland recorded zero.
“It only takes one person crossing the border with Delta and there is another lockdown,” Ms Palaszczuk said.
She said the state would reduce the number of essential workers from NSW who can come to Queensland.
Chief health officer Jeannette Young said the cases were moving “closer and closer to our border”.
“We have the next few days to really get that tightened up and sorted so we can minimise that movement,” she said.
From Friday, all essential travellers from NSW must prove they have had at least one dose of Covid-19 vaccine.
Queensland police estimate 4000 people are crossing the border from NSW for work each day.
Authorities are now working to slash eligibility requirements for workers travelling to Queensland in a bid to reduce the risk of Delta spread.
Teachers were already cut from the essential worker list last week.
Chief health officer Jeannette Young has asked the heads of all government departments to work out which workers are “absolutely essential”.
Nicholas Jensen 11.39am: People not staying home: Police issue 730 penalty notices
More than 730 penalty notices were issued by NSW Police in the last 24 hours, of which 448 were given to residents moving outside of their house “without a good reason”.
Deputy Commissioner Gary Worboys said today’s cases “show us that people clearly want to step outside of the rules and put the safety of theirs and the community at risk”.
Mr Worboys said some residents continue to flagrantly ignore public orders, citing a case from Dubbo:
“Yesterday police were called to Mendoran, near Dubbo, where they spoke to a fellow who had an accident in his car which was struck by a kangaroo.
That person told police quite willingly he arrived ten days ago from Queensland. He went to the airport, he hired a car and he decided that he would travel around country NSW on back roads because he was sick of Covid.”

Lydia Lynch 11.37am: Qld to relax restrictions tomorrow; zero new cases
Queensland will relax its Covid restrictions on Friday afternoon after zero local cases were reported today.
Queensland Premier Annastacia Palaszczuk said from 4pm Friday, 30 people can gather in homes.
Masks will not be required outdoors, but must still be worn indoors.
Funerals and weddings can have 100 people attend.
Community sport will also return at the weekend.
The decision to ease restrictions comes less than a month after a cluster spread through a number of Brisbane schools. There were 144 cases linked to the outbreak.
Queensland will have a second wave of restrictions eased on August 27 after it further tightens travel from northern NSW.
Deputy Premier Steven Miles said a second tranche of rules would be eased in another week.
“We have to prove over that week that we can keep our border strong,” he said.
Masks remain mandatory indoors and school students must wear them in classrooms for another week.
Nicholas Jensen 11.25am: ‘Concern’ over 23 cases in western NSW
Deputy Premier John Barilaro said the outbreak in western NSW remains deeply concerning.
Twenty three cases were recorded in the region overnight, with 17 infections detected in Dubbo, as well as further cases in Mudgee, Narromine and Gilgandra.
In the far west, Wilcannia recorded three cases, while Bourke and Broken Hill each recorded one case.
“It is clear there is an issue in western NSW, where our focus and our priority is, and the message for everybody is to follow the state at home orders and cut down mobility,” he said.
NSW says it is continuing to conduct sewage surveillance in the areas, after detecting fragments in Bathurst and Orange. Overnight viral fragments were detected in the Yamba sewage plant.
Nicholas Jensen 11.20am: Biz support system ‘not up to standard’
Minister for Customer Service Victor Dominello has apologised for extended delays in business support grants, saying “the quality of service we provided over the last month is not up to standard”.
“Can I first begin by apologising to all the businesses that did not receive their grants on time or did not receive phone calls when they should have expected phone calls,” Mr Dominello said.
“In relation to wait times, they have not been great. You would expect that with 260,000 applications. We had an increase of 4000 calls during the peak time.
“We have never had this level of demand before and when we were setting up this grant program, in many ways we were flying and building the plane at the same time,” he said.
Nicholas Jensen 11.15am: Each infected case ‘passes virus to more than 1 other’
Gladys Berejiklian has warned every person is passing on the virus to more than one person which is driving case numbers upwards.
Of the new cases, 158 are linked to a known case or cluster – 145 are household contacts and 13 are close contacts – and the source of infection for 475 cases remains under investigation.
chief health officer Kerry Chat confirmed there are 462 cases in hospital, with 77 people in ICU. Twenty-five of those patients require ventilation.
“We have people in their teens, in their 20s, in their 30s, in their 40s, in their 50s, in their 60s, in their 70s and 80s … We know that for every one of those individuals in ICU, particularly those in the older age groups, they have a real and material risk of death,” said Ms Berejiklian.
In western NSW, 23 new cases were reported to 8pm last night, bringing the total case numbers in the region to 139.
Nicholas Jensen 11.00am: NSW records 633 new cases
NSW has recorded 633 new local cases of coronavirus, of which at least 62 were infectious in the community. The vast majority – 550 cases – are from southwest and west Sydney.
The state recorded three deaths, including a male in his late 60s, who was not vaccinated and two males in their late 70s who both died at Nepean Hospital.
Gladys Berejiklian said: “According to the data we have, every person who has the virus is spreading it to at least more than one person. Now, for us to know that we have reached our peak, that can’t continue. So what the data is telling us in the last few days is that we haven’t seen the worst of it.”
Nicholas Jensen 10.20am: SA quarantined man escapes to pub
SA Police Commissioner Grant Stevens has admitted to failures in the state’s medi-hotel security protocols, after authorities allowed an international traveller to leave hotel quarantine for eight hours to go to the pub.
A NSW man in his 30s, who arrived on a repatriation flight on August 3, has been charged after SA Police found he left his room.
The man used a fire escape to access the hotel’s basement car park, where he was questioned by police. He was permitted to leave the property after he allegedly told them he had gotten lost after leaving a nearby pub.
The investigation has identified nine recommendations for improving hotel quarantine, including reviewing how CCTV and fire escapes are monitored.
The man has since returned four negative tests.
Nicholas Jensen 10.00am: ADF set for Dubbo, Newcastle
ADF personnel are preparing to join NSW Police in Dubbo and Newcastle today in a bid to enforce public health compliance, self-isolation orders and reduce local transmission.
Fifty ADF personnel will assist with compliance in Dubbo and the surrounding areas, with a further 50 troops assisting with compliance in the Hunter Region.
Deputy Commissioner Mick Willing has welcomed the arrival of troops in regional towns, saying the troops are there to support the community alongside police.
“Among other tasks, you will see them delivering hampers and checking on the welfare of our most vulnerable people.”
NSW Police said further deployments are expected by the end of the week.
Rachel Baxendale 9.45am: Alert over second Vic public housing tower
There have been 15 coronavirus exposure sites added to the Victorian health department’s list in the 24 hours to Wednesday, including a second public housing tower in Carlton, in Melbourne’s inner north, and a skate park.
The skate park listing comes after the Andrews government on Monday banned the use of playgrounds, skate parks and basketball courts until at least September 2.
The public housing tower at 510 Lygon St, Carlton, has been listed for four consecutive days between August 14 and 17, after the neighbouring tower at 408 Lygon St was listed for dates extending back to August 8.
A nearby Woolworths at Lygon Court was initially erroneously listed by the health department as a Coles, and was a Tier 2 site for a period on August 10.
Other new sites include a skate park in Jacana in Melbourne’s outer north, a 7-11 in Flemington in the inner northwest, and a Bakers Delight in Ashburton in the southeast.
There are also new sites in Altona and Altona North in the southwest, Malvern East in the southeast, and Carrum Downs in the outer southeast.
There are 524 exposure sites listed statewide for the past fortnight, down from 541 after some older ones expired on Tuesday.
Nicholas Jensen 9.40am: Canberra, WA agree Perth quarantine facility
The commonwealth and West Australian government have finalised a deal to construct a purpose-built quarantine facility near Perth after months of negotiation.
Under the arrangement, the federal government will pay for the construction of a 1000 bed facility that is expected to be completed by March 2022.
In a statement, Premier Mark McGowan said the commonwealth will fund the construction of the facility, while the WA government will control and operate it after completion. The state will also meet operational costs during the pandemic.
“WA has always stood ready to support the commonwealth to deliver on its proposal for a dedicated quarantine facility to ensure more Australians can safely return to our shores following the devastating impacts of the global Covid-19 pandemic.”
Construction is due to commence in October.
Rachel Baxendale 9.30am: Vic has 11 mystery clusters, 4 mystery cases
Victoria currently has at least 11 separate clusters since August 4 with no identified source of acquisition.
A further four of Wednesday’s cases are yet to be linked to previously known outbreaks.
The mystery cases include:
– An Al-Taqwa College teacher in her 20s and her optometrist partner, who live in Newport in Hobson’s Bay in Melbourne’s inner southwest. The partner worked at Caroline Springs Square shopping centre and played football at the Newport Football Club;
– A Maribyrnong man in his 20s who works at a warehouse in Derrimut;
– A City of Melbourne father who works at the Royal Children’s Hospital, and his son who is in Grade One at St Michael’s Primary School in North Melbourne;
– A Glenroy family linked to Glenroy West Primary School;
– A delivery truck driver who lives in Wyndham Vale in Melbourne’s outer southwest, and does not drive interstate;
– A person who lives in Middle Park and visited the South Melbourne Market and a string of sites in Melbourne’s inner south and southeast. This case is believed to be linked to a case in a cleaner who lives in the City of Greater Dandenong, in Melbourne’s outer southeast, and works in Fitzroy Street;
– A mother and her adult son from East St Kilda who attended an illegal engagement party last week;
– Two cases from a household in the public housing tower at 480 Lygon Street, Carlton. As of Tuesday, a total of four cases were linked to this cluster, with neighbouring tower 510 Lygon St also named as an exposure site late on Tuesday.
– One case in a St Kilda resident without clear links to other cases;
– Two cases linked to each other through social contact, who respectively reside in St Kilda and the City of Melbourne;
– Four cases in Wednesday’s numbers which are yet to be linked to a source of acquisition.
Nicholas Jensen 9.15am: More than 500 in iso in NT
More than 500 residents are isolating in the Northern Territory after a positive case triggered the lockdown of Darwin and Katherine on Monday.
NT contact tracers are scrambling to reach hundreds of potential casual contacts, after identifying 84 close contacts in Greater Darwin and Katherine.
More than 480 casual contacts have been linked to a Woolworths in Katherine, causing health officials to surge testing capacity in the area.
The NT government said additional vaccines clinics will be established in the coming days to help administer thousands of vaccines.
The territory’s lockdown was triggered after a man in his 30s arrived at Darwin Airport on a Qantas flight on Thursday and travelled to the Hilton Hotel by taxi.
The man spent three days in Darwin before travelling to Katherine on Sunday, where he met friends and attended a Woolworths.
On Tuesday, Chief Minister Michael Gunner said it was too early to tell if the lockdown could end on Thursday.
“I need to have confidence that we have the virus trapped, and if we have that confidence then we can lift the lockdown,” he said.
Max Maddison 9.00am: Gallagher's ‘anger’ over infected daughter
Opposition finance spokeswoman Katy Gallagher says she’s battling a mixture of the emotional response of a mother and a “fair dose of anger”, after her daughter contracted Covid-19 in Canberra.
Senator Gallagher announced her daughter, Evie, 14, tested positive to the virus on Tuesday, one of the 17 cases reported in the ACT. One of the key opposition interrogators of the Morrison government’s lethargic vaccination rollout, she said the country had let young people down.
“It’s a mix of your normal emotional responses as a mother wanting to care for and protect the children, and a fair dose of anger, to be honest, that it’s come to this,” Senator Gallagher told Sky News on
“We did so well last year, and yet we’ve got millions in lockdown today and for me, my little girl’s lying in bed trying to fight off a really nasty virus and my son’s in the next room and I’m desperately hoping he’s not going to catch it.”

Rachel Baxendale 8.50am: Victoria records 24 new local cases
Victoria has recorded 24 new local cases in the 24 hours to midnight on Tuesday, with 20 linked to known outbreaks. Eighteen have been in isolation for the entirety of their infectious period.
The 24 include four cases which are yet to be linked to a source of infection, and six cases in people who spent time in the community while infectious.
Wednesday’s 24 new cases follow the Andrews government’s imposition on Monday of a 9pm-5am curfew on Melburnians and an extension of the city’s lockdown for 14 days to September 2nd, as well as other tougher measures including bans on the use of playgrounds and on drinking ­alcohol in public.
The latest cases come after 24 cases on Tuesday, 22 cases on Monday, 25 on Sunday, 21 on Saturday, 15 on Friday, 21 locally acquired and two interstate acquired cases on Thursday, and 20 last Wednesday.
The outbreak peak so far was 29 on August 7, just three days after short-lived celebrations of zero on August 4 – the day before the state’s sixth lockdown was announced.
Of 252 cases linked to Victorian outbreaks which have emerged since August 4, 112, or 44 per cent, have been in quarantine for the duration of their infectious period, including 18 in Wednesday’s numbers, 14 in each of Tuesday and Monday’s numbers, 12 in Sunday’s, 11 in Saturday’s, eight in Friday’s, 15 in Thursday’s and 14 in last Wednesday’s.
There are currently 246 active cases, including up to two active cases acquired overseas.
As of Tuesday, there were 12 people in Victorian hospitals with coronavirus, two of whom were in intensive care – representing double the number in hospital and ICU just a day earlier.
The latest cases come after 39,832 tests were processed on Tuesday, compared with 31,519 on Monday, 29,986 on Sunday, 32,286 on Saturday, 33,675 on Friday, 40,737 on Thursday, 45,408 on Wednesday, and 41,571 last Tuesday.
Victoria’s testing record is 59,355 tests on July 20.
Nicholas Jensen 8.30am: NSW to open 5th quarantine hotel
The NSW government is urgently seeking to increase accommodation for residents who need to isolate, as household transmission continues to rise across the state.
NSW Health is due to open a fifth Special Health Accommodation facility to cope with the increase in residents who cannot safely isolate at home.
In the last two weeks, more than 70 per cent of infections had occurred within households, forcing health officials to reconsider NSW’s isolation capacity.
Deputy chief health officer Jeremy McAnulty said Canterbury-Bankstown, Cumberland and Blacktown LGAs continue to record the highest number of cases, totalling more than 1300 infections in the last week, with hundreds of residents requiring isolation facilities.
Dr McAnulty said accommodation facilities were also being established in the state’s west in light of the region’s ongoing outbreak.
Max Maddison 8.15am: Clare: Send in army to boost vaccination
Opposition spokesman for housing Jason Clare has called on the Morrison government to bring the army into southwestern Sydney to boost vaccination rates in the “epicentre” of the outbreak.
The Blaxland MP’s electorate has seen soaring infections as health authorities grapple with the spread of the virus among family households.
It was clear the extended and increasingly restrictive lockdown wasn’t working as well as it should, Mr Clare said, as he called on the federal government to use all the tools at their disposal to boost vaccination rates.
“Get the army in to help … I think that’s a practical, common sense idea that the Prime Minister could pick up today to help make sure that we’ve got more people to vaccinate Australians in my community,” Mr Clare told Sky News on Wednesday morning.
“We had 120 people turned away from the vaccination clinic last week here about STEM, just because there weren’t enough doctors to vaccinate. That’s crazy.”
Nicholas Jensen 8.00am: Cemeteries stay open, funerals allowed
NSW Health says cemeteries will remain open and continue to allow funerals and memorial services of up to ten people.
In a statement on Tuesday morning, NSW Health said “people are also permitted to leave home for compassionate reasons”.
“In certain circumstances, such as an anniversary of a deceased child, or where a close family member has recently died, visiting a gravesite would be considered compassionate.”
“A group of people who live in the same house may gather outdoors. Otherwise, outdoor gatherings are limited to two people. Masks must be worn outdoors in declared areas.”
The statement comes after security guards at Rookwood Cemetery reportedly turned away families wanting to pay their respects at the graves of loved ones.
NSW Health insists the restrictions are designed to limit interaction between people from different households and reduce transmission of the virus.
Nicholas Jensen 7.40am: Frewen: We’ll keep breaking vax records
Lieutenant General John Frewen has welcomed the arrival of additional Pfizer doses to Australia in the last 24 hours, saying the country will continue to break vaccination records as long as supply continues to increase.
“We have been getting record days just about every day consistently,” Lieutenant General Frewen told Channel’s 7 Sunrise program. “This is all about people in Australia being prepared to turn up and get jabbed.”
With more than half a million Pfizer vaccines set to be administered in NSW’s 12 LGAs of concern, Lieutenant General Frewen said the additional doses were designed to “make a difference” in areas recording high levels of transmission.
“It will take a couple of weeks for the vaccine to kick in but it is going to take weeks now to try and get that situation back under control.”
Pharmacists will also play a greater role in administering doses, he said, with the federal government looking to expand its “rollout network” and strategy.
“The pharmacists are playing an important role now. We have brought almost 2500 pharmacies into play in the last fortnight. This is another contributing factor to how we are managing to accelerate these numbers, but pharmacies are ready now.”

Nicholas Jensen 7.30am: 75 per cent of NSW cases in under-40s
After receiving a second delivery of Pfizer vaccines from Poland on Tuesday afternoon, Prime Minister Scott Morrison said Australia had set a new daily vaccination record, with more than 279,000 doses administered across the country on Monday.
“We believe that is the highest number, not just during the Covid vaccination program, but at any point in Australia’s history for vaccinations in a single day.”
In daily case numbers, NSW recorded 452 new infections on Tuesday, as well as the death of a woman in her 70s.
Premier Gladys Berejiklian warned that 75 per cent of the state’s active cases are in people aged under 40, urging young people to come forward to be vaccinated, especially if they live in an LGA of concern.
Deputy chief health officer Jeremy McAnulty said the spread of the virus into regional NSW was “very concerning” for the state’s Indigenous population.
“The majority of those (116 cases) have been in people who are Aboriginal,” he said.
After recording 24 new cases, Premier Daniel Andrews has urged Victorians to abide by its new raft of lockdown restrictions, including the state’s controversial 9pm-5am curfew.
Of the new infections, 21 are linked to known outbreaks, while 14 have been in isolation throughout their infectious period.
With new cases in the Port Phillip, Glen Eira, Bayside and St Kilda areas, Victorian health officials have called upon local residents to help lift the state’s testing rates.
Meanwhile, ACT health officials recorded a further 17 cases on Tuesday.
Eight of the ACT’s cases are currently unlinked and remain under investigation. chief health officer Kerryn Coleman confirmed six cases had been linked to a nightclub, four cases to a high school, three cases to a primary school, three cases to a community centre and three further cases linked to other exposure sites.
In the Northern Territory, despite recording zero local infections in its first day of lockdown, health officials are awaiting test results for 25 people who were on the same flight as the man who tested positive for the virus on Monday.
Chief Minister Michael Gunner said the man in his 30s was “more infectious” following his second Covid-19 test today, suggesting his case was “detected early”.
Mr Gunner said the NT health officials were locked in a “waiting game” until all close contact test results were returned.
The Aboriginal Medical Services Alliance said the current situation in the NT poses a “very serious” threat for the Indigenous population.
At least 30 per cent of Indigenous Australians have received their first dose, with 15 per cent fully vaccinated.
Melissa Iaria 7.00am: Jabs on track for November target: new study
A comparison of Australia and Canada’s Covid-19 vaccination approach reveals there is “good reason” to be confident we will achieve our 80 per cent target by mid-November, a new paper suggests.
More than one-fifth of eligible Aussies (those aged 16 and over) have been fully vaccinated and Doherty Institute modelling for national cabinet predicts 70 per cent will be fully vaccinated by November 1, climbing to 80 per cent on November 22.
The vaccine passport has already appeared “without a single vote in parliament,” according to Sky News host Paul Murray. “Right now, that is the rule to cross a boarder if you are allowed to cross a border in Western Australia, where guess what, you need a vaccine to get a passport to travel to Western Australia,” Mr Murray said. “No debate, no meeting of national cabinet … instead, stroke of a pen, vaccine passport now exists, and it ain’t going anywhere.”
In a new paper, The Centre of Independent Studies (CIS) says many doubts expressed about Australia’s ability to achieve the predictions are unwarranted, when considering the experience of other countries, particularly Canada.
The think tank compared the rollout in the two countries, given their similarities in area, population size, spread and systems of government in its paper entitled ‘90 days to freedom? Why Australia can learn from Canada’s vaccination success’, released on Wednesday.
The Canadian rollout did not gain strong momentum until May, affected by missteps and supply problems similar to those that have slowed Australia’s rollout, study author, CIS senior fellow and economist Robert Carling suggests.
However, by mid-August, 64 per cent of the total population was fully vaccinated.

Nicholas Jensen 6.30am: NZ’s new cases include vaccinated nurse
New Zealand has recorded four new cases of community transmission, after entering a nationwide lockdown on Tuesday for at least three days.
The new cases include a fully vaccinated nurse at the Auckland City Hospital and three household cases. All infections have now been identified as the Delta variant.
Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern said Tuesday’s case in Davenport was a tradesperson who visited more than 20 locations while infectious.
New Zealand Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern has announced the country will go into a three-day lockdown and Auckland will be in a seven-day lockdown.
“While we know that Delta is a more dangerous enemy to combat, the same actions that overcame the virus last year can be applied to beat it again.”
“We have made decisions on the basis that it is better to start high and go down levels rather than start too low, not contain the virus and see it move quickly.”
Vaccinations have also been suspended during the lockdown, authorities have said, “to ensure vaccines can be administered in a safe environment”.
New Zealand’s new infections break its six month record of zero community cases.
Sydney has "yet again" been used as an excuse to put the whole of New Zealand into lockdown, according to Sky News host Paul Murray.

Jess Malcolm 5.15am: Senator isolated after daughter’s Covid-19 infection
Labor senator Katy Gallagher is in mandatory isolation after her daughter tested positive to Covid-19 on Tuesday morning.
In a statement posted to her Facebook page, Ms Gallagher said her daughter was feeling “pretty unwell”. The rest of her family recorded negative tests but will remain in strict isolation until advised otherwise.
“This morning we were advised that my gorgeous daughter Evie has tested positive for Covid-19,” she wrote.
“She is at home with us but is feeling pretty unwell and understandably worried about what this means for her and for the rest of her family. We are really grateful for the medical and personal support we are receiving.
“I am lucky as I am fully vaccinated. Unfortunately too many Australians have not had that opportunity.
“My focus right now is on my little girl and getting her through this — but these events bring a sharp personal focus to the consequences of our government’s failure to ensure a prompt, efficient national rollout of vaccines.
“Here I sit tonight, where after doing everything right for 18 months, like millions of other families right around Australia — I am left with my children completely vulnerable to Covid-19.”
It is unclear where her daughter contracted the virus, but it comes as the ACT recorded 17 new cases yesterday, with several schools declared close-contact venues.
Harrison School (primary and secondary campuses) was exposed last Wednesday and Thursday — August 11 and 12 — from 8.30am to 3.30pm, potentially sending hundreds of children and staff into isolation.
St Thomas Aquinas Primary School in Charnwood has also been listed as a close contact venue on Thursday from 8.30am to 4pm.
UCSSC Lake Ginninderra in the gymnasium and cafeteria/canteen area in Belconnen was also exposed, on Monday, August 9, from 10am to 1.30pm.
A Lyneham chemist, Kaleen supermarket, Evatt IGA and Farrer flower shop were also listed.
All close and casual contacts are advised to get tested and follow the appropriate public health advice.
A full list of exposure locations can be found on the ACT government website.

Rachel Baxendale 5am: Andrews: ‘I don’t have to prove that curfews work’
Victorian Premier Daniel Andrews says he does not need to prove the efficacy of a curfew in bringing down coronavirus case numbers, despite having chosen to impose one on five million Melburnians.
Until at least September 2, Melburnians can be fined $1817 on the spot for leaving home between 9pm and 5am, unless they have an essential worker permit or require urgent medical care.
Asked to justify the curfew in light of comments from epidemiologists, including the Doherty Institute’s Jodie McVernon and ANU’s Peter Collignon , that they had not seen evidence proving such rules curbed the spread of coronavirus, Mr Andrews said: “It is not for me to prove the efficacy of any one measure.”
“No one has ever maintained that any one measure is the way out of this, so therefore it is not for me to provide hard data that establishes that,” he said on Tuesday. “I have never made that claim. We have never made that claim. If one thing alone was all we needed to do, then we would just do that one thing.
“We have a suite of measures and we have an experience — a tragic, terrible experience from last year where we went from more than 700 cases a day to zero.
“Each of those measures played a part in that, and that’s why the chief health officer has provided his advice to reinstitute the curfew.”
Mr Andrews was unable to say whether any of the 228 cases so far linked to the current outbreaks had been acquired outdoors after 9pm, but said the new rules were not related to cases already transmitted. “This is about stopping further cases. We can’t reverse those positives that are ­already there,” he said.
“But let me just be clear about, you know, the shocking impingement on people’s human rights. Like, it means you can’t go shopping in the middle of the night. It means you can’t go and do your exercise in the middle of the night – and for anyone inconvenienced by that, of course I apologise.”
Sky News host Peta Credlin says the implementation of a 9pm curfew in Melbourne is a “political tactic” from Victorian Premier Daniel Andrews.

Natasha Robinson 4.45am: New fears emerge for ICU bed shortages
Almost three-quarters of NSW’s available staffed intensive care beds are full, with Covid-19 ­patients making up 10 per cent of total ICU admissions.
Intensive care doctors are increasingly concerned at the pressure on the state hospital system as rising case numbers lead to a significant spike in hospitalis­ations. There are currently 69 patients in ICU in NSW with Covid-19, with 25 on ventilators.
The state has 844 staffed ICU beds available, and 608 of them were occupied on Monday.
The pressure of Covid-19 cases on the ICU system is intense, with one-on-one care necessary and onerous PPE requirements. The average Covid-19 patient who enters ICU stays much longer than most patients who enter intensive care. The median length of stay for patients who are ventilated is 16 days and one in five dies. Of all ­patients who are hospitalised with Covid-19, about 10 per cent end up in ICU.
Burnet Institute epidemiologist Professor Michael Toole says the doubling time as well as the high number of cases under investigation is creating a “trend of concern” in New South Wales.

Full text: A night curfew will again be imposed on Melbourne and playgrounds will be shut as health authorities further harden the city’s lockdown.
It comes as Victoria recorded 22 new Covid cases overnight, including five new mystery infections.
The city lockdown has also been extended by a further two weeks, until 11.59pm on Thursday, September 2.
A curfew will also be implemented from 9pm to 5am, beginning at 11.59pm on Monday, although Premier Daniel Andrews pleaded with Melburnians to begin following the measure from 9pm.
The premier said there was no other option but to tighten rules as Covid was now spreading “undetected” across Melbourne.
He lashed Victorians who were bending the rules in the midst of an outbreak.
NED-3889-Melbourne-lockdown-restrictions
“How many weddings and funerals have happened with handful of people? It is selfish, they are shitty choices and they will keep us all locked down for longer than we should be,” Mr Andrews said.
“I am angry and we are all angry, most of all because it takes away from the brilliant work, that millions of Victorians are doing every single day.”
Chief health officer Brett Sutton said Victoria was “right on the cliff edge” as cases threatened to spiral out of control.
“But if we can pull back from it, we can absolutely get to the finish line that we know we want to get to … But let’s not kid ourselves. There have been breaches, there have been people bending the rules that put us all at risk,” he said.
“We have to tighten those elements and we have to recommit ourselves to doing as much as we possibly can.”
Under the new restrictions, essential workers will be required to obtain permits for authorised work.
Additional restrictions will also apply to the construction industry, which will again operate as it did last year with staffing reductions in place, except for critical infrastructure and emergency repairs.
At large-scale construction sites, staffing will be reduced to 25 per cent and at smaller sites only five workers will be allowed.
The move comes as concern grows about mystery cases, illegal gatherings and children spreading the virus.
People will be banned from removing their masks to drink alcoholic beverages in public.
Under the strengthened rules, designed to curb Covid transmission, playgrounds, basketball courts, skate parks and outdoor exercise equipment will also be closed, while exercise will be limited to just two people in total.
“Exercise is just that. It’s not an opportunity for seven households to get together,” Mr Andrews said.
“It’s not Cath and I going for a walk and five other families. There’ll be a time for that but it’s not now.
“We are running alongside this virus at best. We’re at a very delicate point of this outbreak.”
Prof Sutton said he was torn when making the decision to close playgrounds and skate parks.
“I thought about it long and hard, as a father of three kids who love to go to the playground,” he said.
“It is one of the only escapes from home in a day. It isn’t an easy choice.
“The fact remains we have seen lots and lots of gatherings that playgrounds and kids are interacting in large numbers and in proximity and what kids do.”
The average exposure days — the number of days an infectious person is out in the community — was 0.61 and declining at this point of the city’s previous outbreak.
But in the current outbreak the average exposure days are 1.8, meaning cases diagnosed on Sunday were infectious in the community for a total of 15 days, compared to zero at the same point during the last outbreak.
“We (are seeing) too many cases, too many mystery cases, we now have 12 or 13 different chains of transmission, the origins of some are unknown to us … (which) means this is spreading in an undetected way across the community. We are at a tipping point,” Mr Andrews said.
Prof Sutton said a “grumbling” few cases today could end up being 100 in a fortnight, or thousands in a month.
“The evidence around curfews is not dissimilar to evidence around a whole bunch of other interventions,” he said.
“They are hard to tease apart from the suite of interventions that happen but between stopping small gatherings and large gatherings, density quotients, social distancing and the like.
“It is one of a suite of interventions that was very successful last year in Victoria and there are published studies on curfews and people are free to look at them.”
Mr Andrews said he knew people were weary and fatigued by lockdown.
“Each of us need to find it in ourselves to make good choices,” he said.
“I don’t want us to finish up like Sydney, where it’s fundamentally got away from them,” he said.
“We have an opportunity to do better than that.”Deoples COVID-19 Victorian Exposure Sites Table
Prof Sutton urged anyone with the mildest of symptoms to get tested immediately, saying the system could easily process up to 50,000 tests daily.
People are able to drive a further 20 minutes, for example, if it means that they can reduce their wait times at a testing clinic, he said.
“That is what will uncover these chains of transmission that we haven’t found,” he said.
It comes as NSW on Monday announced 478 new cases, along with seven deaths. Just 87 of those new cases were in isolation for their entire infectious period.
In the NT, Greater Darwin and Katherine will enter a three-day snap lockdown from noon, after an infection was detected in the community.
And the nation’s capital has extended its lockdown for a fortnight after announcing 19 new cases overnight.
Meanwhile, 25.8 per cent of Victorians are fully vaccinated against Covid, compared to 26.1 per cent of Australians overall.
And 47.3 per cent of Victorians have received a first dose, with the nation tracking at 47.8 per cent.
BREAKDOWN OF LATEST CASES Of Monday’s 22 new Victorian cases, 17 are linked to known outbreaks, with 14 in quarantine for their entire infectious period.
The latest infections are:
• Eleven cases linked to Al Taqwa College (four students, seven household members)
• Two mystery cases linked to Lygon St (in the same household)
• Two linked to the Newport cluster (one linked to Wolf Cafe, one at Newport Football Club)
• Two cases in Altona North, who have since been linked to the Newport cluster
• Two linked to Glenroy Primary (one student and household member)
• One linked to CS Square shopping centre in Caroline Springs (household contact)
• One linked to a mystery case in Dandenong
• One linked to the St Kilda East engagement party
Seventy-nine infections are associated with schools, along with 39 linked to CS Square shopping centre, 32 cases linked to the Glenroy cluster and four linked to a Middle Park case.
Six Victorians are in hospital with Covid, including two men and a woman in their 40s, two women in their 20s and a child in ICU.
It comes on a day where almost 30,000 people turned out for a test, with 19,880 vaccine doses administered.
Vic Locally-acquired Covid-19

PEACOCK INN FURIOUS AT PARTYGOERS A popular pub in Melbourne’s inner north said it has taken a financial hit from being linked to a party on the street outside — despite being closed at the time.
Peacock Inn owner Andrew Gilbert said he was stunned that functions were being cancelled and his staff were being blamed for the impromptu lockdown booze-up when they had not been at work since August 5.
The party, which occurred when a nearby resident in Northcote set up turntables and played tunes from a balcony, saw hundreds of people descend on local streets.
Mr Gilbert said some revellers appeared to have bought drinks from other venues or brought their own, but his venue had not operated.
He said he had no power to move people on from outside his pub, but urged everyone to follow lockdown orders to prevent stay-at-home restrictions lingering.
“We are all in this together. Every party is another week (in lockdown) you could say.
“Every time people are putting on parties and trying to have a good time when we are supposed to be at home.”
Mr Gilbert said ongoing costs are going “through the roof” while having to be shut, and yet more financial pain could be on the way because of the street party.
“It’s killing us, functions are being cancelled and everything,” he said.
He said functions could bring in $5,000 to $10,000 worth of revenue for each event — and three had been dumped already.
He said he is also getting inundated with cruel emails and social media messages telling him he should be “ashamed” of himself.
FURY OVER MELBOURNE COVIDIOTS Chief Commissioner Shane Patton joined the Premier in lashing Victorians who flouted Covid restrictions.
“We have seen some selfish behaviour and we have seen some absolutely outrageous behaviour,” he said.
“That has been reported widely with the Richmond pub crawl in and around those suburbs, and in parks with people you would describe as normal law-abiding mums and dads with kids, sitting around drinking beers, without masks, not adhering to the guidelines.”
Other breaches include:
• A Mornington Peninsula entrepreneur who planned to host a dance party with up to 1000 guests, with a stage, tents and lounges on their private property;
• A dinner party in Southbank where eight people were fined; and
• A street gathering in Northcote where hundreds gathered to dance and drink.
Mr Patton said every breach was an example of “extremely selfish” behaviour.
“We’ve seen so many different breaches, it’s just ridiculous,” he said.
“Everybody knows they’re doing the wrong thing. They’re trying to get around the rules and guidelines. We have to adhere to the CHO’s guidelines.”
About 80 to 100 infringements were issued over the weekend.
It comes as police probe an engagement party allegedly held in breach of lockdown laws.
The event was attended by an infected person, amid fears it could spark another concerning Covid cluster.
A video of the celebration, seen by the Herald Sun, appears to show dozens of maskless family and friends crammed together as the groom-to-be jokes: “Clearly this is legal because this is a group-therapy session – that’s why my father’s here”.
Another party member than adds: “He’s a mental health clinician”.
It comes as a crackdown is launched to target illegal gatherings.
The Herald Sun understands two people, a mother and her adult son from St Kilda East, returned positive Covid-19 tests on Saturday.

FEARS OVER MAJOR OUTBREAK SITES Concern is mounting over clusters spread across the city after eight major outbreak sites emerged in little more than a week.
Contact tracers are now racing to connect five new mystery cases recorded on Sunday to existing clusters across Caroline Springs, Melton, Middle Park, Richmond, and Maribyrnong.
Mr Andrews on Sunday said stay at home orders could remain in place for months, if necessary, to prevent cases from snowballing in the same way as NSW.
“The choice, really, is between where we are now and hundreds and then thousands of cases,” Mr Andrews said, adding that the strategy was a bid to avoid the situation in NSW, where hundreds of thousands of extra vaccine doses were needed after lockdowns and contact tracing failed.
“I’m determined to make sure that it doesn’t happen here. I know no one’s enjoying this. But what’s worse than this is, well, being locked up until the end of October, or indeed the end of November, because that’s how long it may well take to get 80 per cent of people through the vaccination program,” Mr Andrews said.
Young people appear to be fuelling the spread of the virus, as new figures reveal that 83 people aged under 19 are infected.
Across the state, 44 children under 10 and 39 youths aged between 10 and 19 are infected with the virus.
Sixty-five people aged 20 to 40 years also have the virus.
“We’re dealing primarily with people in their 20s, 30s and 40s, they’re quite an active group, lots of social contacts, lots of clubs and lots of ­exposure sites,” Mr Weimar said.
Apartment block residents in St Kilda East, Glenroy and Carlton were also told to get tested and isolate at the weekend after being linked to the current outbreaks.
More than 500 exposure sites have been identified, including dozens of Tier 1 and Tier 2 sites across inner-Melbourne suburbs, which were added on Sunday.
Opposition Leader Michael O’Brien on Sunday called for the premier to tell Melburnians when the lockdown would end.
“It is certainly not the short, sharp circuit breaker we were all hoping for,” he said.
“We just want the premier to be upfront with us, tell us how much longer he thinks we are going to be locked down for and what those conditions will be.”

NSW CUT OFF FROM REST OF NATION New South Wales is expected to be isolated from the rest of the country for months to come, as state leaders acknowledge its lockdown will never drive case numbers back to zero.
The worsening outbreak could throw into chaos the national cabinet’s agreed plan to reopen Australia, because it assumed there would be only small number of Covid-19 cases when the vaccination targets of 70 per cent and 80 per cent were reached.
The state recorded 415 cases on Sunday as Gladys Berejiklian said it was “not possible to eliminate it completely”.
“The best chance we have to live with it freely and safely is to get the case numbers down as low as possible,” the NSW Premier said.
Victorian Premier Daniel Andrews agreed, saying there was “no way they’re going to get to zero cases”.
“Nothing else they’re doing is working … This is where they’re at now, they’re going to have to vaccinate their way out of this,” Mr Andrews said.
He said there was “no doubt” about the national cabinet’s plan to end lockdowns and reduce restrictions among state and territory leaders.
“No one’s walking away from the plan,” Mr Andrews said.
But senior federal government sources said that for the national cabinet plan to succeed, they expected states would keep their borders closed to NSW for months, and possibly until Christmas.
Mr Andrews said if Ms Berejiklian reopened the state at the 80 per cent threshold, and there were still many cases of community transmission, then “they’ll be locked out to here”.
He said the Doherty Institute modelling underpinning the national cabinet plan was based on Australia reaching the vaccination thresholds while having successfully suppressed the virus.
“That modelling does not assume that there are thousands of cases, and hundreds of cases every day,” Mr Andrews said.
“If we want to be open, if we want to have a new set of rules as we go into a new year, if we want to preserve our health system for everyone who needs it … then when we get to 70 and 80, we have to have cases down here, not raging.
“Otherwise I don’t know how that works.”
Mr Andrews maintained that was why it was paramount that Melbourne’s continuing lockdown was successful because the city and state could not reopen if it had thousands of cases, even if 80 per cent of the population over 16 was fully vaccinated.
“I’m determined to make sure that it doesn’t ­happen here,” Mr Andrews said.
With all of NSW now in lockdown, chief health officer Kerry Chant said on Sunday: “I cannot stress enough the seriousness of the current situation, and my grave concerns that these case numbers will continue to escalate.”
NED-1859 State of our borders

YOUNGEST VICTIM DEAD AT 15 A smiling teen has become the youngest Australian to die while having Covid-19.
Osama Suduh, 15, was from Sydney’s southwest, which has remained the state’s epicentre of the Delta outbreak.
Authorities confirmed on Sunday that although the teenager tested positive to the virus, the reason for his admission was because he had pneumococcal meningitis.
The devastating case came as NSW recorded 415 new local infections of Covid-19 and another four people died.
Authorities confirmed 381 cases were in hospital, with 62 in intensive case and 55 of them were unvaccinated, while seven had received their first dose of the vaccine.

Full text: NSW has recorded its grimmest day of the pandemic: the highest number of cases and deaths in a single day. NSW Premier Gladys Berejiklian says the record 478 new infections, along with seven deaths, are “disturbingly high”.
Melbourne will go into a 9pm to 5am curfew tonight after Victoria reported 22 new cases.
NSW Police and ADF personnel have started a new Covid-19 compliance crackdown, in a bid to reduce case numbers across the state.
The ACT has extended its lockdown by a fortnight after 19 new cases.
Greater Darwin and Katherine have entered a snap three-day lockdown after one community case, feared to be the Delta variant.
Footage has emerged of a man joking about breaching coronavirus restrictions at an engagement party allegedly held during Melbourne’s lockdown, with police now investigating. And NSW Premier Gladys Berejiklian has admitted there is now no way back to a zero Covid-19 strategy for the state.
Yoni Bashan 11pm: Factions at war as crisis cabinet weighs tactics
In the end, it was a late Friday phone call that sealed the deal and resulted in some of the harshest restrictions to be imposed on Sydneysiders during the pandemic.
NSW Premier Gladys Berejiklian had one day earlier assured Police Minister David Elliott that his officers would be handed whatever powers they thought necessary to curb the movement of people around the city – and hopefully stop the ever-rising numbers of Covid-19 infections.
By Friday afternoon, however, it had become clear to Mr Elliott that final approval for his proposals from the NSW crisis cabinet – the government’s most senior ministers charged with guiding the state through the pandemic – would not be forthcoming.
Mr Elliott and Police Commissioner Mick Fuller had wanted a 5km restriction on outdoor exercise to make it easier to track those breaking health rules and stop large numbers congregating at the city’s beaches and parks.
Even worse, he had learned that the pre-agreed measure had been deleted from the agenda by staff attached to Ms Berejiklian’s office, meaning the crisis cabinet had not even discussed the matter.
This is the story about how the state’s most senior pandemic decision-making body has buckled under the strain of Covid-19 cases, seemingly unable to stop daily records in case numbers.

Rachel Baxendale 10.15pm: Curfew is pointless: police, experts
Five million Melburnians will be living under a 9pm-5am curfew for at least the next 16 days, ­despite scepticism from epidemiologists over the efficacy of the measure and opposition from the police union and civil liberties groups.
The curfew comes alongside a 14-day extension of Melbourne’s lockdown, and bans on the use of playgrounds and on drinking ­alcohol in public.
It was imposed as Victoria recorded 22 new coronavirus cases on Monday, including eight in people who had not been isolating during their infectious period.
Of the 204 cases linked to outbreaks that have emerged since August 4, 124, or 61 per cent, have been in people who spent time in the community while infectious.
The cases are spread across eight separate outbreaks for which contact tracers are yet to establish a source of infection.
Testing numbers have been falling away, with 29,986 tests processed on Sunday compared with 38,987 the previous Sunday.

Jess Malcolm 9.30pm: NSW exposure list grows
NSW Health has added several new exposure venues in regional NSW as the outbreak worsens in the state’s west.
New casual contact venues have been listed in Dubbo, Glendale, Ingleburn and Kotara.
These venues include a Dubbo IGA, Bathurst Mitre 10, an Engadine Commonwealth Bank bracnh and a Glendale sports centre.
Any residents of these regions are asked to check the updated list and follow the public health advice.
Anyone who visited these venues at the date and time must get tested and isolate until receiving a negative result.
A full list of locations can be found on the NSW government website.
Liam Mendes 8.45pm: Candid cameras on patrol as police get tough
Bondi beachgoers in Sydney’s east were shocked to discover they were under surveillance by portable CCTV cameras on Monday, as NSW police ramped up patrols and compliance measures to enforce the state’s tough new lockdown rules.
Police Commissioner Mick Fuller said the crackdown and harsher penalties would provide a much needed “circuit-breaker” to help drive down Covid-19 case numbers.
A major police operation is under way, with state highway pat­rol monitoring roadblocks and checkpoints in a bid to limit movement out of Sydney, and hundreds of police officers under instruction to issue tickets for noncompliance.

Jess Malcolm: 8.05pm: Vic to declare ACT an extreme red zone
Victorian Health authorities will declare the ACT an extreme red zone under its traffic light travel permit system from 10pm.
Anyone who has been in the ACT in the past 14 days will be barred from entering Victoria without an exemption or valid permit.
Anyone who enters Victoria with an exemption will need to quarantine for 14 days.
Victoria has also declared greater Darwin and Katherine red zones, meaning returning Victorian residents must obtain a permit to enter and isolate on arrival.
Jess Malcolm: 7.20pm: Qld declares Darwin and Katherine a hotspot
Queensland Health authorities have declared greater Darwin and Katherine a hotspot, after a new positive mystery case triggered a snap three-day lockdown.
From 1am on Wednesday, travellers from these regions will be banned from entering Queensland.
Special permits and exemptions will be granted for returning residents.
Anyone who has been in these regions on or after August 12 will also be banned from Queensland prisons, aged care facilities, disability accommodation services and hospitals.
All Queenslanders are being urged to reconsider travel to the Northern Territory.
Ewin Hannan 7.10pm: Cash to meet employers, union over rollout
Industrial Relations Minister Michaelia Cash will meet with employers and unions on Wednesday to discuss progress on the vaccine rollout and how businesses can comply with health and safety obligations without mandating the jab in workplaces.
Fair Work Ombudsman Sandra Parker will brief the meeting on the regulator’s recent legal guidance including how employers required to open in covid hotspots during lockdowns could have the power to direct workers to be vaccinated against covid.
Australian Information and Privacy Commissioner Angelene Falk, who says new laws might be required to protect privacy if vaccine passports are introduced, will also attend to answer questions from employers and unions.
The Australian reported last week that business and unions wanted greater guidance from the government on workplace vaccinations, with ACTU secretary Sally McManus calling for employers, unions and the government to act in a united way to support and encourage people to get vac­cinated.
Senator Cash said a key focus of the meeting would be “on how businesses can comply with their work, health and safety obligations, including without mandating the vaccine”.
“The Morrison government’s position is clear,” she said. “Vaccination is free and voluntary, but we strongly recommend that everyone gets vaccinated as soon as they can.”
Employer organisations due to attend the meeting include the Australian Chamber of Commerce and Industry, the Australian Industry Group, Master Builders Australia, and the Australian Mines and Metals Association.
As well as the ACTU, union representatives attending the talks include officials from the Shop, Distributive and Allied Employees Association, the United Workers Union and the Australian Workers Union.
Ms McManus on Monday called on the government to provide a new universal leave entitlement through the National Employment Standards for paid vaccination leave for every worker, including casuals, to get the jab and recover from any ritine side effects.
She said NSW, Melbourne, Canberra, and parts of the Northern Territory were in lockdown “because of the Morrison government’s failed vaccine rollout”.
“We need the federal government to remove every barrier people may have to getting vaccinated,” she said.
“One important barrier is any financial penalty. Casual workers and anyone without leave will risk paying a price to get the vaccine due to routine side effects which means lost income because they have no paid leave. This can be rectified with the Federal Government taking action to guarantee paid vaccination leave.”
Jess Malcolm: 7pm: Vaccine doses reach 15.3m
A total of 15,338,926 Covid-19 vaccine doses gave been administered, including 94,497 in the past 24 hours.
The figure means 48 per cent of people over the age of 16 have had one dose, with 26.2 per cent fully vaccinated.
NSW has overtaken Victoria to lead with 5,170,324 vaccines — 47,864 of those completed in the past 24 hours. Victoria has administered 3,981,941, followed by Queensland with 2,837,758, West Australia on 1,394,495, South Australia on 1,040,250, Tasmania with 379,599, the ACT with 356,518 and the Northern Territory’s 178,041.
In the past 24 hours, state and territory clinics administered 52,755 vaccines and commonwealth clinics delivered 41,742.
A total of 660,961 vaccines have now been administered in aged-care and disability facilities, with 2179 given in the past 24 hours.
Jess Malcolm: 6.30pm: Newcastle church exposed for 16 days
Worshippers of a Newcastle church have been placed on high alert after a confirmed Covid-19 case spent time in a venue for over two weeks whilst infectious.
The Redeemed Christian Church of God, City of David, in Waratah has been listed by NSW Health as a close contact exposure site for 16 days.
Anyone who visited the venue all day between Saturday July 31 to Sunday August 15 must get tested and isolate for 14 days regardless of the result.
A Dubbo Japanese restaurant, Sushi Zen, has also been listed as a new close contact venue. Anyone who visited the venue on Sunday August 8 from 12.45pm to 12.55pm must isolate for 14 days.
NSW Health has also added several new casual contact venues, and is urging all people to regularly check the NSW government website.
Jess Malcolm 6.20pm: New measures a much-needed ‘circuit-breaker’
NSW Police Commissioner Mick Fuller says the ramp up of compliance measures and tougher penalties imposed will provide a needed “circuit-breaker” to help drive down case numbers in Sydney.
A major police operation is now underway with state highway patrol monitoring roadblocks and checkpoints in a bid to limit movement out of Sydney, and hundreds of police officers under instruction to issue tickets for noncompliance.
Commissioner Fuller said the move to crack down was caused by the infectiousness of the Delta variant.
“There has been continual escalation, but obviously we are at the turning point where we need a circuit breaker,” he told the ABC.
“We pride ourselves on community policing, but we felt that in terms of the messaging that we put out there over the past particularly seven weeks in multiple languages, through different community leaders, and even our own feedback from community leaders was that it is at saturation point.”
But Commissioner Fuller said authorities were not considering imposing a curfew similar to Melbourne, based on a lack of evidence to prove it would work.
“We look worldwide in terms of what works and we don’t believe a curfew is what will work. We do believe the messaging that we put out, and the orders we have at the moment will make an impact.”
NSW Police Commissioner Mick Fuller says residents should expect to see “high-visibility policing right across the state” over the next 21 days during Operation Stay at Home.
Rachel Baxendale 5.10pm: ‘Cruel, dark day for Victoria’: O’Brien
Victorian opposition leader Michael O’Brien says the reimposition of a curfew, closure of playgrounds and cancellation of state parliament represents a “very dark day” for his state.
“Extending the lockdown was always on the cards, but reimposing the curfew, closing down playgrounds. My goodness. That’s just cruel,” Mr O’Brien said.
“This is unnecessary overreach from a government which is punishing innocent Victorians, because they don’t have a plan to tackle the guilty, and they don’t have a plan to tackle Covid. So many Victorians have done the right thing, but they’re all being punished by this cruel decision today.”
Mr O’Brien said the curfew would see Victorians punished for walking their dogs or putting the bins out at 9.05pm.
“That doesn’t stop the spread of Covid. It’s an overreach,” he said, referring to evidence given in the Supreme Court last year by senior health department medical adviser Michelle Giles that there was no evidence a curfew in isolation was effective in stopping the spread of coronavirus during Victoria’s second wave.
“Last time, the government had to admit in legal proceedings, they had no evidence that the curfew itself had any impact on stopping the spread of Covid.
“The government admitted that in evidence before the Supreme Court of Victoria, and today, they’re reimposing it again, again with no evidence that it’s going to work. None whatsoever.
“The Chief Health Officer couldn’t provide any evidence today. We know that last year the Chief Commissioner of Police Shane Patton said he never requested the curfew. It was always a political decision from the Andrews government to appear tough. Well appearing tough doesn’t work against Covid.”
Mr O’Brien said he could not think of “anything crueller” than banning the use of playgrounds.
“These are often kids who have been denied the opportunity to go to school, denied the opportunity to see their friends, and now the government’s taking away that little bit of sunshine in their lives, to be able to go to a playground,” he said.
The Liberal leader also slammed the cancellation of sittings of state parliament due to take place from Tuesday to Thursday.
“This is appalling. This is not about me, it’s not about Daniel Andrews, it’s about the people of Victoria,” Mr O’Brien said.
“If ever there was a time when the people of Victoria needed governments held accountable for their actions, it’s now. When the government is exercising such extreme power, such draconian power over the lives of Victorians, that government must be held accountable to the people for its actions, and yet the government is shutting down parliament, closing down, no question time, no debate, no opportunity to demand answers of the Premier and his ministers who are doing this to Victorians.”

Jess Malcolm 3.40pm: Covid-19 outbreak in Sydney hospital cancer unit
Another Sydney hospital has been hit with a Covid-19 scare, after multiple staff and patients in St George Hospital oncology unit tested positive to the virus.
Three patients and two staff members first tested positive on August 13 and 14.
A spokeswoman for South Eastern Sydney Local Health District confirmed both staff members were fully vaccinated. Two of the three positive patients had received one dose of vaccine, and the third patient was not vaccinated.
“As a precautionary measure the hospital is treating all patients on the ward as close contacts and has implemented additional infection control procedures on the ward to maintain the health and safety of patients,” the spokeswoman said.
“The hospital is contacting patients who were on those wards at the same time that other patients may have been infectious and asking them to get tested and isolate.”
All staff have been contacted.
Jess Malcolm 3.35pm: Tasmania closes border to Darwin, Katherine
Tasmania will close its borders to Greater Darwin and Katherine from 4pm today, in response to a new mystery case recorded in the Northern Territory.
Greater Darwin and Katherine will be upgraded to a “high-risk” area, barring anyone who has been to these regions since Thursday August 12 from entering Tasmania.
Tasmanian residents will be allowed in but will need to undertake 14 days mandatory quarantine in a “suitable premises”. Those who do not have a suitable residence will be required to enter government-designated hotel quarantine.
Public health authorities are also asking anyone who has recently arrived from the Northern Territory to closely monitor their symptoms and get tested if they arise.
The COVID-19 cluster in Canberra has ballooned to 28, with the region recording 19 new cases overnight including a high-school student and an aged care worker. The aged care worker had received one dose of the vaccine, but was asymptomatic and had worked three shifts while unknowingly infectious with the virus. ACT Health officials now believe the virus made its way into the territory from Sydney via two separate seeding events. Federal Parliament is due to return next week, however, ACT Chief Minister Andrew Barr has said his preference is “they don’t” return “unless they absolutely have to”.
John Ferguson 3.00pm: Victoria’s curfew marks death of commonsense
“The Lockdown 6.0 extension in Melbourne is understandable but the curfew marks the death of commonsense,” writes John Ferguson .
“It is a vast overreach that misreads community sentiment and will deliver little to no practical benefit.
“It will punish the law-abiding for the deeds of a tiny minority, groups that for 18 months have been uncontrollable.”

Remy Varga 2.26pm: Three lockdown breach engagement party guests positive
Three guests at a St Kilda East engagement party have now tested positive for Covid-19, including one on Monday.
Covid-19 logistics chief Jeroen Weimar said contact tracers had already identified 90 close contacts of the 69 guests who attended the illegal gathering last weekend.
“We think it is likely that party was a transmission event,” he said.
Eleven of the 22 cases recorded on Monday are linked to Al-Taqwa College in Truganina while two have been linked to the Newport cluster.

Paige Taylor 2.13pm: NSW outbreak reaches Bourke in far west
The Covid-19 outbreak in the far west of New South Wales has infected 91 people and reached Bourke.
The latest figures in NSW’s far west were revealed Monday at a press conference held by local MP Dugald Saunders and Western NSW Local Health District chief executive Scott McLachlan , who said it was a serious concern that most of the new cases were infectious while in the community.
Over the weekend, testing picked up 35 new cases in the far west. Of those, 32 were in Dubbo. There are now three cases in Mudgee and one in Bourke. The person infected in Bourke is a man now in hospital.

Remy Varga 1.35pm: Extended lockdown’s ‘heavy burden’: Sutton
Victoria’s chief health officer Brett Sutton says deciding to extend the lockdown is a heavy burden for him as he acknowledged the mental health toll of lengthy restrictions.
Professor Sutton said he balanced the extension with the “awful prospect” of the lockdown lasting for months longer, which he said would be “catastrophic for mental health”.
“I don’t want people to have to suffer this for months and months to come,” he said.
Paul Garvey 1.17pm: Unrepentant WA premier slams NSW, defends border control
An unrepentant Mark McGowan has slammed NSW’s handling of the Covid crisis and defended his commitment to maintaining the state’s border controls for the longer term.
A day after his comments about wanting to keep WA Covid-free even once the state hits an 80 per cent vaccination rate sparked criticism from business leaders and Prime Minister Scott Morrison , Mr McGowan told reporters on Monday that he did not understand the controversy.
“I’m getting criticised over east, I understand, for saying I’d prefer to not have Covid. What’s the alternative? NSW? Is that what they want? This defence by the Sydney press corp of NSW is getting a bit ridiculous,” he said.
“Their management of this issue has meant that they now have mass cases all over NSW, they are costing the taxpayers of all states of Australia countless billions of dollars. They’ve got people dying. I don’t want to go there. I don’t want us to be like NSW and we’ve done everything we can to avoid it at this point in time.”
Mr McGowan noted that the transition plan agreed by the states at a meeting of national cabinet late last month explicitly stated that “highly targeted” lockdowns would still be possible even once vaccination rates exceed 80 per cent and the nation enters phase C of the transition.
Only at phase D, which does not have an agreed vaccination rate trigger, would lockdowns fall away and international borders be reopened. In the meantime, he said, WA would continue to target minimal or no Covid in WA.
The current criticism directed at WA was like “Groundhog Day”, he said, noting that WA similarly came under fire last year when Victoria was battling with a major outbreak.
“We’ve been through nearly two years of all the criticism and carping and undermining, and what’s Western Australia achieved? The freest most successful society in the world, the strongest economy in Australia and possibly the world,” he said.
“And yet for some reason, probably because there’s a fanatical desire by some people in NSW to protect the NSW government, we are under attack. I think they need to take a look at the management of NSW rather than the management of WA.”
He said WA — which has kept its mining industry operating throughout the pandemic, allowing the big iron ore mines of the Pilbara to take advantage of record-high prices – was bankrolling financial support for virus-hit NSW.
“What we’ve successfully done because of our industries is fund the bailout for NSW. The people of WA have funded it,” he said.
“If people want to criticise us for doing the right thing, let them. But we will continue to do the right thing.”
He also noted that the agreed transition plan included a host of social distancing measures that are not currently in place in WA, such as the 2 square metre rule, crowd and workplace capacity limitations, and social distancing measures, and which he wanted WA to avoid if possible.

Remy Varga 1.15pm: ‘Shitty choices’: Partygoers ‘not the victims’, says Andrews
Victorian Premier Daniel Andrews has blasted the “shitty choices” of the St Kilda partygoers, saying he was not going “to cop” that they were the victims.
But Mr Andrews defended the Jewish community, saying the poor behaviour captured on video was reflective of individuals.
“This is not an act of faith. This is not part of cultural practice. This is just bad behaviour,” he said.
“I know for a fact the vast majority of the Jewish community … Melbourne and Victoria have a proud Jewish community … are doing the right thing and that’s why they as a community are so angry as well.”
Remy Varga 1.05pm: $350,000 in fines: Cost of lockdown engagement party
Victoria Police Chief Commissioner Shane Patton said he’s referred a St Kilda engagement party to his investigators, saying collectively the guests have earnt themselves more than $350,000 in fines for the illegal gathering.
Blasting the guests as selfish, disappointing and outrageous, Mr Patton said he expected all 69 guests, excluding children, would be fined $5452.
“That’s going to be over $350,000 in fines,” he said.
“That’s an expensive engagement party.”
Mr Patton warned the time for discretion was over, saying police would be instructed to take a harder line against public health breaches.

Remy Varga 1.00pm: No masks off to street drink: Premier blasts pub crawl
Victorian Premier Daniel Andrews says Victoria Police and the state liquor regulator are looking at the venues that participated in a pub crawl in the inner city suburb of Richmond over the weekend.
Mr Andrews said he was “angry” at the venues that had participated, saying it devalued the hard work of pandemic shattered hospitality industry.
Unveiling new restrictions on Monday, Mr Andrews said: “You will no longer be able to remove your mask to drink a cocktail at a pop-up beer garden on a footpath as part of a pub crawl.”
“The VCGLR and I understand Victoria Police are looking at what occurred at the weekend at a number of licensed venues.
“There are being reviews conducted into the terms of those licences and whether any of those licence holders have done the wrong thing.”
Remy Varga 12.56pm: Delta has Victoria ‘an the brink’: Sutton
Chief health officer Brett Sutton says Victoria is “at the brink”, saying the state is struggling to get ahead of the Delta outbreak.
Professor Sutton said the nation was facing a substantial challenge and the state needed to step up, saying cases could explode if tighter restrictions were not introduced.
“We are at the brink and maybe need to step back from the brink,” he said.
Remy Varga 12.51pm: Disappointed, angry: Fury at engagement party attendees
Victorian Premier Daniel Andrews says he’s angry and disappointed after Covid-19 transmission occurred at an engagement party in St Kilda, saying the dozens of guests have created thousands of hours of work for contact tracers.
Mr Andrews said the party devalued the rest of the hard work and sacrifice undertaken by the rest of Melbourne and said the event could become a super spreader event.
“What makes me really angry about that event is that each of those 69 people will have to be interviewed,” he said.
“Their close contacts will have to be spoken to and tested.
“Our contact tracers who are working their guts out for all of us will have to spend literally thousands of hours dealing with hundreds and thousands of people connected to that engagement party.”
“That is the work that they must do, but it is all entirely preventable. That is what makes me angry and disappointed.”
The gathering last weekend is believed to have been attended by as many as 100 people, including a St Kilda East mother and her son whose positive test results were among Sunday’s Victorian mystery cases.
The engaged couple, who The Australian has chosen not to name, are understood to be members of Melbourne’s ultra-Orthodox Jewish community.

Remy Varga 12.43pm: Victoria confirms curfew, tougher extended lockdown
Victorian Premier Daniel Andrews has confirmed a tougher lockdown will be in place until September 2, saying the state is at a “tipping point” and risks becoming NSW.
From 11.59pm tonight, a curfew will be enforced between 9pm and 5am and will apply to intimate and single partner visits.
Outdoor playgrounds, basketball courts, skate parks and exercised equipment will be closed.
Permits will be required for essential workers and some higher education students.
Only two people will be allowed to exercise together including household members but excluding dependants who cannot be left at home.
Construction will be reduced to 25 per cent and mobile pet grooming and letterboxing will be prohibited.
People will no longer be able to remove a mask outdoors to drink alcohol.
Rachel Baxendale 12.38pm: Victoria’s exposure sites balloon to 531
Victoria’s exposure site list has now hit 531, after 54 new sites were added in the 24 hours to Monday, extending from Dandenong in the outer southeast to Meadow Heights and South Morang in the outer north, and across the inner city.
Other suburbs with exposure sites include St Kilda, Caulfield North, Malvern and Balaclava in the inner southeast, Carlton, Brunswick, North Melbourne, Kensington, Coburg North and Glenroy in the inner north and northwest, Footscray, Altona, Altona North, Laverton and Williamstown in the inner west and southwest, and Tullamarine in the outer northwest.
One recent exposure site of particular concern is the public housing tower at 480 Lygon St, Carlton.
A sewage detection at a facility specific to the building alerted authorities to the likelihood of a case there over the weekend, and residents were tested on Saturday and Sunday, with a positive case expected to be confirmed among Monday’s numbers.
While some areas of the building linked to the case have been classified as Tier 1, requiring 14 days quarantine, most of the building is Tier 2, requiring testing and isolation until a negative result is received.
Remy Varga 12.35pm: Police don’t want curfew in Victoria
Victoria police union boss Wayne Gatt says his officer members don’t want a curfew and has warned the cops are already stretched paper thin by the pandemic.
The Police Association Victoria secretary told 3AW on Monday that the “contentious” public health measure wasn’t wanted by police during the second lockdown in 2020.
“Our members didn’t really see great value in it to be quite honest,” he said.
“If they turn something like that [curfew] on again, it’ll be the police again that’ll be asked to enforce it and we are stretched paper thin.”
Mr Gatt said police were already stretched by pandemic redeployments, with between 600 and 700 seconded to hotel quarantine, about 300 on the NSW border and about 250 enforcing compliance with public health rules.
“We’ve still got a business as usual police to run, crime continues unabated of course and public safety remains a focus for us,” he said.
“We are flat out and we do have some station closures as a result of these deployments now to help us manage those workloads.”
“Our members are tired, they’re stretched and they really are juggling those priorities Neil.”
Max Maddison 12.30pm: Delta strain suspicion prompts snap Darwin lockdown
Greater Darwin has been plunged into a snap, three-day lockdown after a case of Covid-19 was recorded in the territory overnight, Northern Territory Chief Minister Michael Gunner has announced.
The lockdown will also include Palmerston and Katherine, which was enacted for 72-hours from midday today. The positive case, a man in his 30s, had travelled to the territory for legitimate work purposes on August 12 after arriving from overseas and completing his 14 days mandatory quarantine.
“He landed in Darwin very late Thursday night, just before midnight, and travelled via taxi to the Hilton Hotel on Mitchell Street,” Mr Gunner told a press conference on Monday.
“Later on Friday morning, he travelled back to the airport in an Uber car to collect a hire car.
The man visited various locations in the Darwin CBD over the next few days for a limited period of time. There are a number of exposure sites.”
With the man asymptomatic, Mr Gunner said health officials were working under the assumption it was the Delta strain. He said there was a “very real risk” the virus had travelled across the community and had come into contact with vulnerable people.

Max Maddison 12.18pm: ACT lockdown extended by two weeks
ACT Chief Minister Andrew Barr has extended the territory’s lockdown by an additional two weeks, after 19 new cases were recorded.
The spike in infections took the total number of recorded cases to 28 since the worsening outbreak emerged on Thursday. ACT Chief Health Office Kerryn Coleman warned there would be a rise in cases before lockdowns began to take effect.
There were about 6500 close contacts currently in isolation. This included student’s at Lyneham High School in Canberra’s north, in addition to a raft of new exposure sites.
“This is concerning and it demonstrates that the virus is active in our community. We have been expecting this, though. And we will continue to see more cases in the coming days,” Mr Barr told a press conference on Monday afternoon.

Debbie Schipp 12.14pm: Parts of NT go into snap three-day lockdown
The Northern Territory capital of Darwin and the town of Katherine have entered a snap three-day lockdown.
The lockdown began at midday.
NT chief minister Michael Gunner said “we have an urgent and important update for the residents of greater Darwin region and Katherine”.
“The NT has recorded one new case of Covid-19 overnight. Because of the circumstances of this case, we have had to make a difficult decision this morning to escalate our pandemic response.
“From midday today, the Darwin, Palmerston, Darwin rural area and Katherine will enter a full lock down for 72 hours. We are in lockdown until midday Thursday.”
Debbie Schipp 12.10pm: ACT records 19 new Covid-19 cases
Nicholas Jensen 12.05pm: Zero daily cases ‘not possible’: Berejiklian
NSW Premier Gladys Berejiklian and CHO Kerry Chant have defended the government’s public health messaging saying the main aim is to reduce case numbers and accelerate vaccination.
“We have to get case numbers down. This level of case numbers is not where we want them to be, where we need to be … We will never eliminate Covid from the world. We have the privilege now of having a vaccine. But vaccination is not a silver bullet,” said Dr Chant.
“We have to work hard to get vaccine levels up and even when we have the high vaccine coverage, we will still have to move around in society in a way that acknowledges the threat of Covid.”
Ms Berejiklian said while Covid is active globally and the Delta variant is “causing carnage”, zero daily cases was not possible.
“Even when you follow the Doherty Institute report to the enth degree, after you have 80 per cent of double doses and you open up to an extent, depending on your case numbers, you are still at risk and you will see cases pop up.
“When you have 80 per cent of your population vaccinated that reduces the number of people that will end up in hospital and the number of people that will die … It is (zero daily cases) always our aspiration and we have to work hard to get the case numbers down.”
“It is a horrible situation. We need to turn it around. But to suggest that we are going to have zero the whole way through until the pandemic ends across the world is not a realistic proposition,” she said.
Nicholas Jensen 11.50am: Deputy Premier backs plan to help regional spread
NSW Deputy Premier John Barilaro said he was confident that the Regional Permit System, designed to limit traffic outside of Greater Metropolitan Sydney, would reduce transmission of the virus across regional NSW.
Premier Gladys Berejiklian says the level of community transmission in New South Wales is “disturbingly high” after the state recorded 478 new local COVID cases and seven deaths related to the outbreak. “We had 478 cases of community transmission to 8pm last night, and we can't stress enough how hard all of us have to work to reduce these numbers, to reduce the growth of the spread, and to make sure we’re all staying home unless we absolutely have to do otherwise,” she said. “Can I also extend our heartfelt condolences and sympathies to seven families who’ve lost a loved one to 8pm last night. Seven deaths in New South Wales. “Unfortunately, only two of them had had one dose of a vaccine and all the others were unvaccinated.”
“We have made a decision about a permit system for Greater Sydney for access to the regions and we will have a limited list of reasons why you can go … There are a number of changes we will make but we will make that clear this week.”
“There have been many examples of people who have left Sydney to go and tender a second residence. We will limit that to one person only.”
Mr Barilaro said residents outside of Sydney are permitted to move within an LGA for essential reasons.
“We want you to minimise that movement but we know sometimes the grocery store is more than 5km away … There is no distance rule within an LGA. If you have to go to the neighbouring LGA to go grocery shopping, there is no limit if that is the only option that you have.”
Nicholas Jensen 11.45am: NSW police chief warns on crackdown
Police Commissioner Mick Fuller said the state will continue to ramp up the enforcement of public health orders in the coming weeks, after issuing another 500 infringements on Sunday.
Of those infringements, 120 were issued to people for not wearing masks and disobeying “a mix of health orders”.
“Over the next 21 days, the NSW community needs to know we are out there enforcing these health orders to stop the spread of the virus so we can come out of lock down … I don’t apologise for that.”
“We all want the same thing but we need a circuit breaking from a law enforcement perspective and that started at midnight last night.”
Rachel Baxendale 11.35am: Victoria imposes strict 9-5 curfew
The Andrews government has decided to impose a fortnight-long 9pm to 5am curfew on Melburnians.
The Australian understands senior ministers see the measure as one of the few options they have left to avoid a NSW-style scenario of uncontrolled Covid spread.
A time is yet to be set for today’s press conference, at which the new restrictions are expected to be announced.
The Australian understands Melbourne’s lockdown will be extended for two weeks, and expanded statewide, with the curfew to be imposed across greater Melbourne.
Essential workers will require permits to leave their homes, and a specialised workers list similar to that used in 2020 will be introduced.
Playgrounds will be closed.
Nicholas Jensen 11.30am: NSW battles ‘outbreak’ in mental health facility
NSW Health has reported 30 cases in the Nepean Blue Mountains connected to two exposure sites.
Premier Annastacia Palaszczuk says police and officials are “stopping everyone” coming in from the southern states to halt the spread of COVID-19. “New South Wales is currently in lockdown, there are stay at home provisions, so the movement needs to be minimal and of course, we only have those exemptions for those essential workers,” she said. “We also know that the positive sewage testing for Delta has been creeping northwards, so we are very concerned. “Police and our officials are stopping everyone coming in from the southern states into Queensland through our airports and they’ll be stopping people coming in through the roads. “These strict border measures are necessary, and they will be enforced. "So if you do not need to travel, do not travel.” Ms Palaszczuk also revealed essential workers who need to cross the border will be required to have at least one dose of a COVID vaccine from Friday.
Dr Chant said there has been a “clear outbreak” in a mental health facility there and also across some other wards in the Nepean Hospital.
“I want to confirm that Nepean Hospital, including the emergency department, remains open. All precautions have been put in place to protect both health and staff and the health of patients presenting to that facility.”
Meanwhile, sewage surveillance has detected the presence of viral fragments in Bourke, Lennox Head, Parkes, Wallacia treatment plants. But no cases have been linked to those sites.
Paul Garvey 11.25am: WA moves to vaccinate 16-year-olds
Western Australians as young as 16 will now be eligible for the Pfizer vaccine under changes announced on Monday by WA Premier Mark McGowan .
The state has for the first time opened up its vaccination programs to people aged between 16 and 29 as it tries to lift the lowest vaccination levels of any state.
Less than 23 per cent of West Australians have received two vaccine doses, compared to between 24.56 per cent and 32.37 per cent in other states and territories.
Mr McGowan said the expanded eligibility was a “brilliant” opportunity for all West Australians over 16 to get vaccinated.
“I know many young people are very keen to get vaccinated and do their part to keep themselves, their families and their community safe,” he said.
The eligibility change comes as WA launches a two-week “vaccination blitz”, with state-run clinics to operate extended hours and a new clinic opening at the Perth Convention and Exhibition Centre in the CBD.
Nicholas Jensen 11.15am: Man in his 40s among latest NSW deaths
chief health officer Dr Kerry Chant announced seven deaths, include a man in his 40s from southwestern Sydney, who had severe underlying health conditions and was not vaccinated.
The others are a man in his 80s from the southwest, a woman in her 70s from the northern suburbs, a woman in her 80s from the inner west, a man in his 70s from the southwest, a man his 80s from the southwest and a man in his 80s from western Sydney who died at Nepean Hospital.
“It is important that we understand the true impact that Covid is having on the community and why it is so critical. We all play a key role in protecting our loved ones from disease,” said Dr Chant.
Nicholas Jensen 11.01am: NSW records 478 cases, seven deaths
NSW has recorded 478 locally acquired cases of Covid-19, the highest number the state has recorded since the beginning of the current outbreak.
There were seven more deaths, only two of them were vaccinated.
Premier Gladys Berejiklian said “our community transmission numbers are disturbingly high”.
Rachel Baxendale 10.55am: Victoria ponders harder, longer lockdown
Victoria’s crisis council of cabinet is meeting this morning to discuss recommendations from the state’s health authorities to bolster coronavirus restrictions, with the current lockdown certain to be extended beyond Thursday.
Options on the table include a 9pm to 5am curfew, increased enforcement, a permit system for essential workers, and making the lockdown Statewide.
Eleven days into the state’s sixth lockdown, coronavirus case numbers are not falling, with authorities particularly concerned about 10 clusters with unknown sources of acquisition which have emerged since August 4 – eight of which have come to light since last Wednesday.
This is in addition to five cases in Monday’s numbers which are yet to be linked to previously known outbreaks.
Recent infections have been linked to restriction breaches, including sleepovers, children attending others’ houses for homework clubs, office workers refusing to work from home, and an engagement party.
Authorities are also increasingly concerned about lax behaviour in public spaces linked to hospitality venues, exemplified by a pub crawl which saw crowds flock to inner city Richmond over the weekend.
There is widespread fear among health authorities and within government that if the current outbreak is not controlled soon, Victoria will find itself in a similar predicament to that being experienced by NSW.
Max Maddison 10.30am: Morrison fires warning shot at McGowan
Scott Morrison has issued a stern warning to West Australian Premier Mark McGowan , saying after agreeing to the vaccination reopening plan on “three occasions”, he would be walking away from a commitment to his own citizens.
Sky News host Paul Murray says the vaccine rollout "is something Australians should be proud of". "Can we always do better – you bet," Mr Murray said. More than 15 million COVID-19 doses have been administered in Australia. Mr Murray said 47.34 per cent of Australians have received their first dose of the vaccine, while 25.64 per cent have received a second dose.
On Sunday, Mr McGowan walked away from the national commitment to limit the use of draconian restrictions once 70-80 per cent of the population had received jabs, saying he reserved the right to enact lockdowns and hard border closures in the pursuit of an eradication strategy.
With the country’s road map seemingly already fractured, the Prime Minister declined to criticise the Labor Premier, but said Mr McGowan would be reneging not only on his commitment to national cabinet, but also to the people of WA, saying “on three occasions, we agreed to this plan”.
“That was done in our first discussion of the national plan, it was then agreed in-principle with the targets set by the Doherty Institute, which made it very clear that once you get to 70 per cent and 80 per cent, at that level … then you are managing the virus just like you are the flu and that was what the national plan was about,” Mr Morrison told ABC News Breakfast on Monday morning.
“It gives people that hope and the path forward, it is the path out and that is the national plan and that plan was agreed to.”
Yoni Bashan 10.20am: Police ordered to get tough on breaches
NSW Police Commissioner Mick Fuller has issued a directive to all officers ordering them not to issue warnings and cautions to people who allegedly breach the state’s public health orders, in a move that is likely to result in a steep increase in fines and other penalties across NSW. Read more here
Lydia Lynch 10.05am: ‘Wonderful’ news on Queensland cases
No local cases have been detected in Queensland for a second consecutive day.
Annastacia Palaszczuk said it was “wonderful” news after a school-based outbreak earlier this month spawned 130 cases.
“Thank you Queensland for that mighty effort,” she said.
Ms Palaszczuk said the movement across the Queensland/NSW had to be “minimal” and from Friday all essential travellers moving across the border must have at least one vaccine dose.
“We are very concerned,” she said. “These strict border measures are necessary and they will be enforced.”
Rachel Baxendale 9.50am: Intrigue surrounds Richmond case
One recent Victorian Covid case in a teacher who lives in inner city Richmond and works at Glenroy West Primary school, in Melbourne’s northwest, had sparked interest, because exposure sites linked to her had been listed as far back as August 2.
This predated the August 4 detection of a case in an Al-Taqwa College teacher, whose case was the first to emerge among the current outbreaks.
Exposure sites linked to the Richmond teacher also overlapped with sites listed in July for people linked to the MCG, AAMI Park, Ms Frankie and Trinity Grammar as part of the outbreak which sparked our fifth lockdown.
But Covid logistics chief Jeroen Weimar said on Sunday there were no genomic or epidemiological links between the Richmond teacher and the earlier cluster, sparked by removalists who visited the Ariele apartments in Maribyrnong and spread via the MCG.
“There are no connections there whatsoever, so we’ve excluded that from our considerations,” Mr Weimar said.
He said there were some possible genomic links to a cluster spread across five households in Coolaroo, in Melbourne’s outer north, which emerged around the same time as the MCG cluster.
He said the Richmond teacher’s exposure sites had been dated back to August 2, out of an abundance of caution, because she had developed symptoms on July 31 and tested negative on August 2.
“As you know, we’re always really conservative about the timing of our exposure sites, particularly when we’re starting to see more community transmission than we’d like to see,” Mr Weimar said.
“She did a test, I believe on the 31st of July, from memory. That was a negative test. Based on her symptom onset, based on her own experience, based on her reporting back, we’ve taken her infectious period from the 2nd of August.”
It is possible the August 2 negative was a false result, with authorities hopeful serology testing may indicate how old the teacher’s case is likely to be.
He said contact tracers did not believe the teacher was the source for the Glenroy West Primary School cluster, now linked to 29 cases.
Nicholas Jensen 9.40am: Deputy Premier defends social media announcement
NSW Deputy Premier John Barilaro has defended his government’s decision to announce a statewide lockdown over social media at the weekend, saying it was “very difficult” to get the information “out through the media”.
Asked if an announcement via social media limited the reach of the lockdown news, Mr Barilaro told ABC RN that was “always going to be the case”.
“Even if we had done a press conference in the middle of Sydney, a lot of people would not have seen that press conference … it would have given them a chance to see the message.”
“We were able to get media releases out, we were able to get through all our media channels, all through our social media channels, using your MPs who are leaders in their communities to talk to their community leaders and get the message out,” he said.
Mr Barilaro also defended his government’s approach to lockdown, saying “it’s irrelevant what Daniel Andrews has to say and what other premiers think” about the state’s current lockdown settings.
“There are a lot of people doing the wrong thing, and regardless of the rules you put in place with people that attempt to do the wrong thing they’ll continue to do the wrong thing.”
“What we’ve now done is address that there are gaps, there are loopholes and of course we will be coming down harder,” he said.
Rachel Baxendale 9.35am: Removalists, MCG not linked to latest clusters
The search for the source of acquisition is ongoing for 10 Victorian clusters of varying sizes which have emerged since August 4, but Covid logistics chief Jeroen Weimar says authorities have all but ruled out a link to the main cluster which sparked the state’s fifth lockdown and originated with removalists from NSW and spread via an AFL match at the MCG.
However, Mr Weimar said on Sunday there were genomic similarities between the current cases and a cluster spread across five households centred on Coolaroo, in Melbourne’s outer north.
The Coolaroo cluster was sparked around the same time as the MCG cluster by a man who had recently returned from NSW breaching home quarantine and interacting with someone he knew at a local Coles supermarket.
It spread through further home quarantine breaches involving family members interacting with one another when making deliveries to one another’s homes.
“We’ve got strong genomic connections across all of the cases (in the outbreaks since August 4) that we’ve looked at so far,” Mr Weimar said.
“I don’t have the results for yesterday’s cases yet, but just about every case before that is genomically connected to this cluster.
“We’re still seeing that and very close connections with the wider NSW, the current active cases in NSW, are still quite closely connected genomically.”
Mr Weimar said that of the most recent cases to emerge, the first cases to present, in an Al-Taqwa College teacher and her Caroline Springs optometrist partner who live in Newport, were still believed to be “upstream” of other cases in the cluster.
“But, as I say, we’ve got (10) different subclusters at the moment, still some linkages we haven’t quite nailed down. I can’t exclude the possibility that there’ve still been some new incursions in from NSW, but we don’t have any more details on that.”
Mr Weimar said it was “very clear” there was no connection to the MCG cluster.
“That is a completely different strand altogether. So we’re not dealing with that, and we’ve not picked up any cases that have any relationship to that outbreak, genomically or epidemiologically.”
“It may be that we never find out the exact source of acquisition for the Newport couple, bearing in mind it’s now going back into very early August, end of July, so it may be that some of those will just get lost in the mists of time. That’s a regret.
“Our focus at the moment is on making sure that everything downstream is being (linked).”
Nicholas Jensen 9.20am: Rail, bus services cancelled in NSW
XPT train and bus services have been cancelled across NSW after a series of Covid-19 infections have led to staffing shortages.
The state’s long-distance train service has been paused after scores of staff were identified as close or casual contacts of a number of infected staff members.
XPT says the growing list of close and casual contacts has led to “mass staff isolations” and the cancellation of a range of services.
In Sydney’s inner west, buses will operate on a Sunday timetable from Monday after services were disrupted throughout last week.
The cancellations come after two staff at Leichhardt’s Transit Systems depot tested positive for Covid-19 more than a week ago, causing staff to isolate until they received their test results.
Rachel Baxendale 9.10am: 10-plus mystery clusters under investigation
Victoria’s number of clusters since August 4 with no identified source of acquisition bounced back up to 10 on Sunday, and is now likely higher, with five of Monday’s cases yet to be linked to a source of infection.
Over the weekend, two previous mystery cases were linked to other clusters, and two entirely new ones emerged.
The mystery cases include:
– An Al-Taqwa College teacher in her 20s and her optometrist partner, who live in Hobson’s Bay. The partner worked at Caroline Springs Square shopping centre and played football at the Newport Football Club;
– A Maribyrnong man in his 20s who works at a warehouse in Derrimut;
– A Melton family of two parents and a child;
Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau on Sunday called an early election for Sept. 20, saying he needed a new mandate to ensure voters approved of his Liberal government's plan to recover from the global health crisis. Lisa Bernhard produced this report.
– A City of Melbourne father who works at the Royal Children’s Hospital, and his son who is in Grade One at St Michael’s Primary School in North Melbourne;
– A Brunswick West man who had visited sites in Flemington and Parkville;
– A Glenroy family linked to Glenroy West Primary School, where there are now 29 cases. This cluster now includes two previous mystery cases in a Roxburgh Park resident who works in Bundoora, and in a Glenroy family whose child attends Corpus Christi Primary School in Glenroy;
– A delivery truck driver who lives in Wyndham Vale in Melbourne’s outer southwest, and does not drive interstate;
– A person who lives in Middle Park and visited the South Melbourne Market and a string of sites in Melbourne’s inner south and southeast. This case is believed to be linked to a case in a cleaner who lives in the City of Greater Dandenong, in Melbourne’s outer southeast, and works in Fitzroy Street. The exact link is not yet clear;
– A construction worker who lives in West Footscray;
– A mother and her adult son from East St Kilda who attended an illegal engagement party last week;
– Five cases in Monday’s numbers which are yet to be linked to a source of infection.
Rachel Baxendale 9am: Victoria looks to rebound from peak cases
Monday’s 22 cases in Victoria follow 22 on Sunday, 21 on Saturday, 15 on Friday, 21 locally acquired and two interstate acquired cases on Thursday, 20 on each of Wednesday and Tuesday, and 11 last Monday.
The outbreak peak so far was 29 on August 7, just three days after short-lived celebrations of zero on August 4 – the day before the state’s sixth lockdown was announced.
Of 204 cases linked to Victorian outbreaks which have emerged since August 4, 80, or 39 per cent, have been in quarantine for the duration of their infectious period, including 14 in Monday’s numbers, 12 in Sunday’s, 11 in Saturday’s, eight in Friday’s, 15 in Thursday’s and 14 in Wednesday’s.
There are currently 205 active cases, including up to two active cases acquired overseas.
As of Sunday, there were four people in Victorian hospitals with coronavirus, one of whom was in intensive care.
The latest cases come after 29,986 tests were processed on Sunday, compared with 32,286 on Saturday, 33,675 on Friday, 40,737 on Thursday, 45,408 on Wednesday, 41,571 on Tuesday, 34,892 on Monday and 38,987 last Sunday.
Victoria’s testing record is 59,355 tests on July 20.
Max Maddison 8.50am: Indigenous MP makes vaccinations plea
Indigenous Australians Minister Ken Wyatt has urged First Nations communities to come forward to get their jabs, but has denied low vaccination rates represent a “failure”.
With 55 infections appearing in Western NSW – the majority of those believed to be Indigenous people – Mr Wyatt defended the Morrison government’s track record on vaccinating vulnerable populations, blaming the media for instilling fear of blood clots in Indigenous Australians.
Mr Wyatt called on Indigenous communities to receive their vaccinations, but conceded that with First Nations people being a priority group, the 14.6 per cent vaccination rates for both doses was “too low”.
“You should not be fearful, this is about protecting you, your community, your family and your elders,” Mr Wyatt told ABC’s Radio National on Monday morning.
“I’m always worried about people dying from the Delta Australian because in many of their communities we’ve, we’ve got vulnerable elders, we have vulnerable adults, what I understand from my agency is that a lot of the adults are attending but not the young ones.”
Rachel Baxendale 8.40am: Victoria records 22 new Covid cases
Victoria has recorded 22 new cases of coronavirus in the 24 hours to midnight on Sunday.
The source of infection for five of the 22 remains under investigation, while eight of the 22 spent time in the community while infectious.
Nicholas Jensen 8.20am: Man ‘drove at’ testing clinic security guard
A man has been charged after allegedly driving at a security guard at a Covid-19 testing clinic in Sydney’s south at the weekend.
Queensland has tightened its border controls with New South Wales which remains in lockdown due to the Delta variant of COVID. Travel is restricted to a short list of essential workers which does not include childcare workers and teachers. Border zone residents can only enter Queensland for essential goods and services that cannot be found in New South Wales. Drivers have been told to expect delays as police will intercept every vehicle trying to cross the border.
At 10.30am on Sunday, a 61-year-old man attended a drive-through testing clinic at Forest Road in Sutherland. The man allegedly ignored directions from staff before becoming verbally abusive toward a security guard.
When the man was directed to leave the clinic, he allegedly drove his vehicle toward the security guard before colliding with two signs and accelerating from the area.
The man was later arrested at a property at Jannali and taken to the Sutherland Police Station.
NSW Police says he was charged with operating a vehicle “so as to harass or intimidate a person, negligent driving and behaving in an offensive manner in or near public place”.
The man was granted strict conditional bail and is due to appear at Sutherland Local Court on September 24.
Nicholas Jensen 8.05am: Sydney workers face plea to get vaccinated
The NSW government is urging tens of thousands of eligible workers across western and southwestern Sydney to access vaccination clinics in a bid to curb rising Covid-19 infections in those areas.
Following yesterday’s so-called ‘Super Sunday’ event at the Sydney Olympic Park and South Western Sydney Vaccination Centre – which saw almost 10,000 people receive AstraZeneca and Pfizer vaccinations – prioritised workers from the 12 worst-affected LGAs can continue to access the clinics until August 22.
Authorised workers in health care, construction, transport, food production and education are eligible for a Covid-19 vaccination if they live in one of the following LGAs or suburbs of concern:
Blacktown, Campbelltown, Canterbury-Bankstown, Cumberland, Fairfield, Georges River, Liverpool, Parramatta, Bayside, Burwood, Strathfield, and Penrith for the following suburbs: Caddens, Claremont Meadows, Colyton, Erskine Park, Kemps Creek, Kingswood, Mount Vernon, North St Marys, Orchard Hills, Oxley Park, St Clair and St Marys.
NSW Health says eligible workers will receive a link to book their vaccine appointment and will be required to bring photo ID as well as proof of their place of work to receive their vaccination.
Nicholas Jensen 7.50am: NSW police launch Covid compliance blitz
After issuing more than 500 infringement notices on Saturday, NSW Police has overnight launched Operation Stay at Home in a bid to boost public health compliance and reduce case numbers across Greater Metropolitan Sydney.
Deputy Commissioner Mick Willing said the operation will see thousands of police officers from across the state deployed alongside ADF personnel, with more than 1400 highway patrol officers “out and about with their specialist equipment”.
“Police will be patrolling back roads, setting up roadblocks, so there is simply nowhere for you to go if you want to breach public health orders,” he said.
“We now have a statewide lockdown, and we need 100 per cent of people to stay at home and comply with the orders. Not 90 per cent, 100 per cent.”
Launch of the operation comes after 31 people were fined for holding a public gathering in Sydney’s eastern suburbs, while eight residents were fined for gathering inside a garage in Jesmond.
“We are faced with a situation with the Delta variant that spreads across young people, so it is particularly disappointing to see young people involved in breaches of the public health order,” said Deputy Commissioner Willing.

Nicholas Jensen 7.30am: PM: ‘Distressing’ situation in Afghanistan
Prime Minister Scott Morrison says the situation in Afghanistan remains “very dangerous” and “distressing”, after the Taliban entered Kabul overnight, following a week-long lightning offensive in which Islamist militants captured most of the country.
This morning Mr Morrison told Sky News the government was working to transfer people out of the country, but said operational details remain sensitive.
“Already, since April, we’ve been able to extract some 430 Afghan locally engaged employees and their families. We already shut down our mission back in May to ensure that Australian diplomatic personnel were able to be safely exited from that region.”
“I can’t discuss the operational details of what we’re doing with our partners, but the situation has been declining rapidly over the last few days. We’ll be meeting again this morning and getting an update on our operations,” he said.
Regarding the supply of one million Pfizer doses from Poland, Mr Morrison said he was very pleased by the first delivery that arrived overnight.
“With these doses we’ll be getting out there in NSW and targeting particularly those 20-to-39 year olds in the hotspot areas of Sydney. We believe that will have a slowing impact on the transmission of the virus.”
“The balance of those vaccines will go to all the other states and territories as well because I don’t take anything for granted in any of those other states.”
Asked whether he was disappointed the US government did not contribute supplies of Pfizer to Australia, Mr Morrison said the US was “dealing with its own Delta outbreak” and understood it was not possible for them to transfer vaccines to Australia at this time.

Nicholas Jensen 6.30am: Emergency Pfizer supplies arrive in Sydney
Australia’s first delivery of Pfizer vaccines from Poland arrived in Sydney overnight, after the federal government secured additional supply from its European counterpart last week.
Prime Minister Scott Morrison said the NSW outbreak was a deciding factor in Poland’s decision to supply the doses to Australia.
“The one million doses, I’ve discussed this with the NSW Premier yesterday, will be targeted at Australians aged 20 to 39 years of age who are identified in the Doherty modelling as the peak transmitters for COVID-19,” he said.
NSW Premier Gladys Berejiklian welcomed the announcement, saying the doses would be “put to good use”.
“We will be targeting 16 to 39-year-olds in those LGAs of concern … They are the ones who cross three generations, and they are ones who were part of the 70 per cent of cases we are currently experiencing in those most problematic areas,” she said.
Approximately 530,000 doses of the allocation will be dispatched to Sydney’s 12 worst-affected LGAs, while 470,000 will be divided across the country on a per capita basis.
Further deliveries of the vaccine are scheduled to arrive from Poland later this week.
The additional one million Pfizer doses are on top of the 40 million the federal government has already locked in.
Paul Kelly 6am: Premiers’ scrambled strategy will lead to chaos
Australia’s hopes of sticking by a national plan at 70-80 per cent vaccination to open the economy, the internal borders and ease restrictions are being torn apart.
The premiers continue to run their agendas. And the premiers are divided. On a bleak Sunday NSW Premier Gladys Berejiklian admitted reality, saying it was “not possible” to eliminate Covid cases, while West Australian Premier Mark McGowan boasted that even at 80 per cent vaccination, his goal would still be “zero” cases and he would attempt to achieve that.
Sydney and Perth are divided by more than the Nullarbor; they have different Covid experiences and have conflicting views on the national cabinet opening-up strategy that Scott Morrison worked long and hard to secure. Read more here
Rachel Baxendale 5am: Police investigate illegal lockdown engagement party
Footage has emerged of a man joking about breaching coronavirus restrictions at an engagement party allegedly held during Melbourne’s lockdown, with police now investigating.
The gathering, held mid-last week, is believed to have been attended by up to 100 people. Two people – a St Kilda East mother and her son – returned positive Covid-19 tests on Saturday, and one of those people is understood to have attended the engagement party while infectious.
The engaged couple, who The Australian has chosen not to name, are understood to be members of Melbourne’s ultra-Orthodox Jewish community.
Authorities fear the gathering could spark another Covid-19 cluster, with the actions of attendees at the engagement party widely condemned by Melbourne Jewish leaders, including Council of Orthodox Synagogues of Victoria president Mark Cohen and Rabbi James Kennard , who is principal of Australia’s largest Jewish school, Mt Scopus.
In the footage, the engaged man jokes in reference to his doctor father: “Clearly this is legal because this is a group-therapy session. That’s why my father’s here.”
Rabbi Kennard condemned the behaviour on social media, saying that while it was “painful to speak out against fellow Jews in public … at this time, the danger of staying silent is too great”.
“The law states that we must stay at home, because the experts tell us that this is the way to save lives, because of the risk of terrible Chillul Hashem (desecration of God’s name), every rabbi and leader must cry out,” Mr Kennard said.
“We must take the heartbreaking path and stop the gatherings – for prayer, for s’machot, for school. Just stop.”
It is understood some members of the ultra-Orthodox community – which represents a small minority within the wider Jewish community – have continued to meet for prayer and schooling during Victoria’s six lockdowns.
Victoria’s COVID-19 Response Commander Jeroen Weimar is warning of the “aggressive” nature of the coronavirus outbreak as exposure sites in the state rise to more than 500 with 13,000 primary close contacts isolating.

Geoff Chambers 4.45am: No way back to zero Covid-19, Berejiklian says
Gladys Berejiklian has conceded NSW will not return to zero Covid-19 cases and that severe ­restrictions and lockdowns will ­remain in place until November, as Western Australia warned it may keep its borders closed despite a national agreement to open up after jab rates hit 70 to 80 per cent.
With NSW and WA warning of continuing restrictions, Scott Morrison announced the emergency purchase of one million Pfizer vaccines from Poland, with 530,000 to be redirected into 12 Sydney hot spots for 20-to-39-year-olds in an effort to avoid surges in deaths and hospitalisations.
Ms Berejiklian, who imposed a snap statewide lockdown on Saturday, said she would not risk unnecessary deaths by reopening the state too soon, with health officials adopting a new strategy after NSW recorded 881 new cases and eight deaths in 48 hours.
Premier Gladys Berejiklian says New South Wales has recorded 415 new locally acquired Covid cases and four deaths related to the outbreak.
Ms Berejiklian said the focus had shifted to a “dual strategy” of suppressing further outbreaks and prioritising an aggressive vaccination campaign across NSW, which would see Covid-19 restrictions in place until at least 80 per cent of residents had received “double dose” vaccinations. On current projections, that would occur around mid-November.
“This is a time when all of us have to take stock and take the situation for what it is,” she said. “It’s not possible to eliminate it completely. We have to learn to live with it. The best chance we have to live with it freely and safely is to get the case numbers down as low as possible.”
While Ms Berejiklian said she would continue to reassess what restrictions could be modified in coming months as immunisation rates increased, she indicated it would be nothing close to what residents considered “living freely” until well into November.
The Australian's Editor-at-Large Paul Kelly says NSW coronavirus numbers are "alarming" with the trend continuing to increase which is now a "threat" to the national recovery.

Adeshola Ore 4.30am: Business’ plea to McGowan: ‘stick to the plan’
West Australia Premier Mark McGowan ’s declaration that he reserves the right to impose border restrictions and lockdowns even when an 80 per cent vaccination rate is reached has angered business leaders.
Mr McGowan doubled down on his eradication approach at the weekend, saying his state would not tolerate any Covid-19 cases or deaths.
He also signalled he would mandate vaccinations in some sectors such as the mining and port industries.
His statement puts him at odds with Scott Morrison , who said there would be no requirement to make Covid-19 jabs compulsory unless governments’ health advisers advocated for a mandate in a specific industry.
Western Australian Premier Mark McGowan says he will pursue a zero Covid policy in his state even after the 80 per cent vaccine threshold is achieved.
Mr McGowan’s comments on an elimination strategy come just weeks after national cabinet agreed to a plan that Australia would open up when 80 per cent of the eligible population was fully vaccinated. The plan, based on Doherty Institute modelling, outlined that at an 80 per cent target, lockdowns would almost entirely end and international travel would restart.
Australian Chamber of Commerce and Industry chief executive Andrew McKellar said the nation’s business sector was desperate for a nationally consistent approach for reopening the country. “We would really urge all leaders to stick to the plan and not pre-empt the situation that we may face in two or three months time. ” he said.
Sky News host Rita Panahi says Western Australia's vaccine passport policy is "abhorrent to everything Australians hold dear" and it has been allowed to happen because one "unprincipled and egotistical premier is drunk on power".

Full text: Gladys Berejiklian snapped at reporters in Sydney on Monday for interrupting her while answering a question about WA Premier Mark McGowan’s comments that he would retain the right to close his state to NSW arrivals even after vaccination rates are increased to 70 or 80 per cent.
“We want to get as close to having no infectious people in the community as possible, we’ve said we want to get as close to that number as possible,” she told reporters.
“And that is exactly what we’re striving for, let me make that very clear.
“But can we pretend that there will always be zero cases of Delta in Australia? I don’t think that is a realistic proposition.”
Her comments came on the worst coronavirus day so far for NSW.
The state broke both its daily case number record and its record for daily deaths caused by the virus, with 478 new cases and seven fatalities.
WA meanwhile has been mostly coronavirus-free, with less than 1100 total cases during the entire pandemic and only nine deaths.
“What is realistic, is trying to get the number of infectious people in the community as close down to zero as possible, that is always our intent,” Ms Berejiklian continued.
“But we also have to accept we're not going to wipe this out, we’re not going to have a situation where across Australia, whether it’s in the quarantine system or elsewhere, that we’re not going to have zero cases.”
Her comments were interrupted by a barrage of follow-up questions from reporters, but the Premier tried to cut through to finish her point.
“Can I say … Can I make this point … Excuse me, can I finish?” she snapped.
“What I’ve just said, is no different to what we’ve said for weeks and weeks and weeks, it’s no different from what we’ve said at the start of the pandemic.
“We can’t pretend we will get to zero and stay at zero forever.”
Mr McGowan’s comments came on Sky News Australia the day before, where he said he would continue with border restrictions and lockdowns even when 80 per cent of the population had been vaccinated.
“Our preferred option is zero Covid, obviously, and that's what we’ll attempt to do,” Mr McGowan said.
When asked if he would maintain a hard border with NSW if the state never achieved zero Covid cases, Mr McGowan said: “We retain that right. Obviously, I'd prefer not to.”
“When they get down to zero or minimal spread, then we can look forward to opening the (WA-NSW) border.”
His comments were slammed by the Prime Minister on Monday, who lamented that Mr McGowan‘s plans to pursue a zero Covid policy as “running down the (national Covid-19) plan” and ”discouraging people to get vaccinated”.
“It has never been the job to get to zero Covid,” Mr Morrison said.
Speaking on the ABC, the PM stressed that Mr McGowan’s plan “wasn’t what was agreed in national cabinet” and that his claims contradicted modelling by the Doherty Institute on when it was safe to phase out lockdowns and restrictions.
“Once you get to 80 per cent vaccination, it is against the county‘s interests not to open up,” he said.
Mr Morrison stressed that the state and federal governments had made a “deal” with the Australian people that restrictions would ease across the country once vaccination rates reached 70-80 per cent.
“That's the deal that all Premiers and Chief Ministers signed up to in making that commitment to their own citizens,” he said.
“We've got to hold to that.”

Full text: A night curfew will again be imposed on Melbourne and playgrounds will be shut as health authorities further harden the city’s lockdown.
It comes as Victoria recorded 22 new Covid cases overnight, including five new mystery infections.
The city lockdown has also been extended by a further two weeks, until 11.59pm on Thursday, September 2.
A curfew will also be implemented from 9pm to 5am, beginning at 11.59pm on Monday, although Premier Daniel Andrews pleaded with Melburnians to begin following the measure from 9pm.
The premier said there was no other option but to tighten rules as Covid was now spreading “undetected” across Melbourne.
He lashed Victorians who were bending the rules in the midst of an outbreak.
NED-3889-Melbourne-lockdown-restrictions
“How many weddings and funerals have happened with handful of people? It is selfish, they are shitty choices and they will keep us all locked down for longer than we should be,” Mr Andrews said.
“I am angry and we are all angry, most of all because it takes away from the brilliant work, that millions of Victorians are doing every single day.”
Chief health officer Brett Sutton said Victoria was “right on the cliff edge” as cases threatened to spiral out of control.
“But if we can pull back from it, we can absolutely get to the finish line that we know we want to get to … But let’s not kid ourselves. There have been breaches, there have been people bending the rules that put us all at risk,” he said.
“We have to tighten those elements and we have to recommit ourselves to doing as much as we possibly can.”
Under the new restrictions, essential workers will be required to obtain permits for authorised work.
Additional restrictions will also apply to the construction industry, which will again operate as it did last year with staffing reductions in place, except for critical infrastructure and emergency repairs.
At large-scale construction sites, staffing will be reduced to 25 per cent and at smaller sites only five workers will be allowed.
The move comes as concern grows about mystery cases, illegal gatherings and children spreading the virus.
People will be banned from removing their masks to drink alcoholic beverages in public.
Under the strengthened rules, designed to curb Covid transmission, playgrounds, basketball courts, skate parks and outdoor exercise equipment will also be closed, while exercise will be limited to just two people in total.
“Exercise is just that. It’s not an opportunity for seven households to get together,” Mr Andrews said.
“It’s not Cath and I going for a walk and five other families. There’ll be a time for that but it’s not now.
“We are running alongside this virus at best. We’re at a very delicate point of this outbreak.”
Prof Sutton said he was torn when making the decision to close playgrounds and skate parks.
“I thought about it long and hard, as a father of three kids who love to go to the playground,” he said.
“It is one of the only escapes from home in a day. It isn’t an easy choice.
“The fact remains we have seen lots and lots of gatherings that playgrounds and kids are interacting in large numbers and in proximity and what kids do.”
The average exposure days — the number of days an infectious person is out in the community — was 0.61 and declining at this point of the city’s previous outbreak.
But in the current outbreak the average exposure days are 1.8, meaning cases diagnosed on Sunday were infectious in the community for a total of 15 days, compared to zero at the same point during the last outbreak.
“We (are seeing) too many cases, too many mystery cases, we now have 12 or 13 different chains of transmission, the origins of some are unknown to us … (which) means this is spreading in an undetected way across the community. We are at a tipping point,” Mr Andrews said.
Prof Sutton said a “grumbling” few cases today could end up being 100 in a fortnight, or thousands in a month.
“The evidence around curfews is not dissimilar to evidence around a whole bunch of other interventions,” he said.
“They are hard to tease apart from the suite of interventions that happen but between stopping small gatherings and large gatherings, density quotients, social distancing and the like.
“It is one of a suite of interventions that was very successful last year in Victoria and there are published studies on curfews and people are free to look at them.”
Mr Andrews said he knew people were weary and fatigued by lockdown.
“Each of us need to find it in ourselves to make good choices,” he said.
“I don’t want us to finish up like Sydney, where it’s fundamentally got away from them,” he said.
“We have an opportunity to do better than that.”Deoples COVID-19 Victorian Exposure Sites Table
Prof Sutton urged anyone with the mildest of symptoms to get tested immediately, saying the system could easily process up to 50,000 tests daily.
People are able to drive a further 20 minutes, for example, if it means that they can reduce their wait times at a testing clinic, he said.
“That is what will uncover these chains of transmission that we haven’t found,” he said.
It comes as NSW on Monday announced 478 new cases, along with seven deaths. Just 87 of those new cases were in isolation for their entire infectious period.
In the NT, Greater Darwin and Katherine will enter a three-day snap lockdown from noon, after an infection was detected in the community.
And the nation’s capital has extended its lockdown for a fortnight after announcing 19 new cases overnight.
Meanwhile, 25.8 per cent of Victorians are fully vaccinated against Covid, compared to 26.1 per cent of Australians overall.
And 47.3 per cent of Victorians have received a first dose, with the nation tracking at 47.8 per cent.
BREAKDOWN OF LATEST CASES Of Monday’s 22 new Victorian cases, 17 are linked to known outbreaks, with 14 in quarantine for their entire infectious period.
The latest infections are:
• Eleven cases linked to Al Taqwa College (four students, seven household members)
• Two mystery cases linked to Lygon St (in the same household)
• Two linked to the Newport cluster (one linked to Wolf Cafe, one at Newport Football Club)
• Two cases in Altona North, who have since been linked to the Newport cluster
• Two linked to Glenroy Primary (one student and household member)
• One linked to CS Square shopping centre in Caroline Springs (household contact)
• One linked to a mystery case in Dandenong
• One linked to the St Kilda East engagement party
Seventy-nine infections are associated with schools, along with 39 linked to CS Square shopping centre, 32 cases linked to the Glenroy cluster and four linked to a Middle Park case.
Six Victorians are in hospital with Covid, including two men and a woman in their 40s, two women in their 20s and a child in ICU.
It comes on a day where almost 30,000 people turned out for a test, with 19,880 vaccine doses administered.
Vic Locally-acquired Covid-19

PEACOCK INN FURIOUS AT PARTYGOERS A popular pub in Melbourne’s inner north said it has taken a financial hit from being linked to a party on the street outside — despite being closed at the time.
Peacock Inn owner Andrew Gilbert said he was stunned that functions were being cancelled and his staff were being blamed for the impromptu lockdown booze-up when they had not been at work since August 5.
The party, which occurred when a nearby resident in Northcote set up turntables and played tunes from a balcony, saw hundreds of people descend on local streets.
Mr Gilbert said some revellers appeared to have bought drinks from other venues or brought their own, but his venue had not operated.
He said he had no power to move people on from outside his pub, but urged everyone to follow lockdown orders to prevent stay-at-home restrictions lingering.
“We are all in this together. Every party is another week (in lockdown) you could say.
“Every time people are putting on parties and trying to have a good time when we are supposed to be at home.”
Mr Gilbert said ongoing costs are going “through the roof” while having to be shut, and yet more financial pain could be on the way because of the street party.
“It’s killing us, functions are being cancelled and everything,” he said.
He said functions could bring in $5,000 to $10,000 worth of revenue for each event — and three had been dumped already.
He said he is also getting inundated with cruel emails and social media messages telling him he should be “ashamed” of himself.
FURY OVER MELBOURNE COVIDIOTS Chief Commissioner Shane Patton joined the Premier in lashing Victorians who flouted Covid restrictions.
“We have seen some selfish behaviour and we have seen some absolutely outrageous behaviour,” he said.
“That has been reported widely with the Richmond pub crawl in and around those suburbs, and in parks with people you would describe as normal law-abiding mums and dads with kids, sitting around drinking beers, without masks, not adhering to the guidelines.”
Other breaches include:
• A Mornington Peninsula entrepreneur who planned to host a dance party with up to 1000 guests, with a stage, tents and lounges on their private property;
• A dinner party in Southbank where eight people were fined; and
• A street gathering in Northcote where hundreds gathered to dance and drink.
Mr Patton said every breach was an example of “extremely selfish” behaviour.
“We’ve seen so many different breaches, it’s just ridiculous,” he said.
“Everybody knows they’re doing the wrong thing. They’re trying to get around the rules and guidelines. We have to adhere to the CHO’s guidelines.”
About 80 to 100 infringements were issued over the weekend.
It comes as police probe an engagement party allegedly held in breach of lockdown laws.
The event was attended by an infected person, amid fears it could spark another concerning Covid cluster.
A video of the celebration, seen by the Herald Sun, appears to show dozens of maskless family and friends crammed together as the groom-to-be jokes: “Clearly this is legal because this is a group-therapy session – that’s why my father’s here”.
Another party member than adds: “He’s a mental health clinician”.
It comes as a crackdown is launched to target illegal gatherings.
The Herald Sun understands two people, a mother and her adult son from St Kilda East, returned positive Covid-19 tests on Saturday.

FEARS OVER MAJOR OUTBREAK SITES Concern is mounting over clusters spread across the city after eight major outbreak sites emerged in little more than a week.
Contact tracers are now racing to connect five new mystery cases recorded on Sunday to existing clusters across Caroline Springs, Melton, Middle Park, Richmond, and Maribyrnong.
Mr Andrews on Sunday said stay at home orders could remain in place for months, if necessary, to prevent cases from snowballing in the same way as NSW.
“The choice, really, is between where we are now and hundreds and then thousands of cases,” Mr Andrews said, adding that the strategy was a bid to avoid the situation in NSW, where hundreds of thousands of extra vaccine doses were needed after lockdowns and contact tracing failed.
“I’m determined to make sure that it doesn’t happen here. I know no one’s enjoying this. But what’s worse than this is, well, being locked up until the end of October, or indeed the end of November, because that’s how long it may well take to get 80 per cent of people through the vaccination program,” Mr Andrews said.
Young people appear to be fuelling the spread of the virus, as new figures reveal that 83 people aged under 19 are infected.
Across the state, 44 children under 10 and 39 youths aged between 10 and 19 are infected with the virus.
Sixty-five people aged 20 to 40 years also have the virus.
“We’re dealing primarily with people in their 20s, 30s and 40s, they’re quite an active group, lots of social contacts, lots of clubs and lots of ­exposure sites,” Mr Weimar said.
Apartment block residents in St Kilda East, Glenroy and Carlton were also told to get tested and isolate at the weekend after being linked to the current outbreaks.
More than 500 exposure sites have been identified, including dozens of Tier 1 and Tier 2 sites across inner-Melbourne suburbs, which were added on Sunday.
Opposition Leader Michael O’Brien on Sunday called for the premier to tell Melburnians when the lockdown would end.
“It is certainly not the short, sharp circuit breaker we were all hoping for,” he said.
“We just want the premier to be upfront with us, tell us how much longer he thinks we are going to be locked down for and what those conditions will be.”

NSW CUT OFF FROM REST OF NATION New South Wales is expected to be isolated from the rest of the country for months to come, as state leaders acknowledge its lockdown will never drive case numbers back to zero.
The worsening outbreak could throw into chaos the national cabinet’s agreed plan to reopen Australia, because it assumed there would be only small number of Covid-19 cases when the vaccination targets of 70 per cent and 80 per cent were reached.
The state recorded 415 cases on Sunday as Gladys Berejiklian said it was “not possible to eliminate it completely”.
“The best chance we have to live with it freely and safely is to get the case numbers down as low as possible,” the NSW Premier said.
Victorian Premier Daniel Andrews agreed, saying there was “no way they’re going to get to zero cases”.
“Nothing else they’re doing is working … This is where they’re at now, they’re going to have to vaccinate their way out of this,” Mr Andrews said.
He said there was “no doubt” about the national cabinet’s plan to end lockdowns and reduce restrictions among state and territory leaders.
“No one’s walking away from the plan,” Mr Andrews said.
But senior federal government sources said that for the national cabinet plan to succeed, they expected states would keep their borders closed to NSW for months, and possibly until Christmas.
Mr Andrews said if Ms Berejiklian reopened the state at the 80 per cent threshold, and there were still many cases of community transmission, then “they’ll be locked out to here”.
He said the Doherty Institute modelling underpinning the national cabinet plan was based on Australia reaching the vaccination thresholds while having successfully suppressed the virus.
“That modelling does not assume that there are thousands of cases, and hundreds of cases every day,” Mr Andrews said.
“If we want to be open, if we want to have a new set of rules as we go into a new year, if we want to preserve our health system for everyone who needs it … then when we get to 70 and 80, we have to have cases down here, not raging.
“Otherwise I don’t know how that works.”
Mr Andrews maintained that was why it was paramount that Melbourne’s continuing lockdown was successful because the city and state could not reopen if it had thousands of cases, even if 80 per cent of the population over 16 was fully vaccinated.
“I’m determined to make sure that it doesn’t ­happen here,” Mr Andrews said.
With all of NSW now in lockdown, chief health officer Kerry Chant said on Sunday: “I cannot stress enough the seriousness of the current situation, and my grave concerns that these case numbers will continue to escalate.”
NED-1859 State of our borders

YOUNGEST VICTIM DEAD AT 15 A smiling teen has become the youngest Australian to die while having Covid-19.
Osama Suduh, 15, was from Sydney’s southwest, which has remained the state’s epicentre of the Delta outbreak.
Authorities confirmed on Sunday that although the teenager tested positive to the virus, the reason for his admission was because he had pneumococcal meningitis.
The devastating case came as NSW recorded 415 new local infections of Covid-19 and another four people died.
Authorities confirmed 381 cases were in hospital, with 62 in intensive case and 55 of them were unvaccinated, while seven had received their first dose of the vaccine.

Full text: Gladys Berejiklian says eliminating the highly contagious Delta strain was now “almost impossible”. Her frank admission came as NSW recorded 415 new cases of Covid and four deaths but on brighter note the state had administered five million doses of vaccine and half of the population has had a first dose. Scott Morrison has confirmed Australia has secured an additional one million doses of the Pfizer Covid-19 vaccine, the bulk of which will be sent to Sydney’s worst hit LGAs. The shipment, due to arrive tonight, comes as Victoria prepares for an extension to its current lockdown beyond Friday, with 25 new cases recorded. And WA Premier Mark McGowan says even with an 80 per cent fully vaccinated threshold, his state will still aim for zero Covid-19 cases through using lockdowns and a hard border.
Adeshola Ore 11pm: Business anger as state goes it alone on borders
West Australia Premier Mark McGowan’s declaration that he reserves the right to impose border restrictions and lockdowns even when an 80 per cent vaccination rate is reached has angered business leaders.
Mr McGowan doubled down on his eradication approach at the weekend, saying his state would not tolerate any Covid-19 cases or deaths.
He also signalled he would mandate vaccinations in some sectors such as the mining and port industries.

Damon Johnston, Angelica Snowden 10.15pm: Teen girl suicides reveal ‘shadow pandemic’
Eight teenage girls have committed suicide in the first seven months of this year, a marked increase in the number of young women taking their lives in a tragic toll being closely watched by the Victorian Coroners Court.
The alarming rise has been recorded by the court amid a deepening youth mental health crisis that expert professor Patrick McGorry has described as a “shadow pandemic”.
New court data reveals eight girls committed suicide to July 31, up from just one in the first seven months of last year. In the same period in 2019, Coroner’s Court statistics show three teenage girls took their own lives while the number was four in 2018 and three in 2017.
The eight deaths in seven months among teenage girls already exceeds annual suicide numbers in this cohort for three of the past four years. Five teenage girls took their lives in both 2017 and 2018, with eight in 2019 and two in 2020.
“The court has noted a potentially higher than expected number of suspected suicides among women under 18 this year,” a court spokeswoman told The Australian.
“While it is too early to determine whether this represents a trend, the court is continuing to monitor closely.”

Rachel Baxendale 9.30pm: Footage of illegal engagement party
Footage has emerged of a man joking about breaching coronavirus restrictions at his illegal engagement party.
The gathering last weekend is believed to have been attended by up to 100 people, including a St Kilda East mother and her son, whose positive test results were among Sunday’s Victorian mystery cases.
The engaged couple, who The Australian has chosen not to name, are understood to be members of Melbourne’s ultra-Orthodox Jewish community.
Their actions have been widely condemned by Melbourne Jewish leaders, including Council of Orthodox Synagogues of Victoria president Mark Cohen and Rabbi James Kennard, who is principal of Australia’s largest Jewish school, Mt Scopus.
In the footage, the engaged man jokes in reference to his doctor father: “Clearly this is legal because this is a group therapy session. That’s why my father’s here.”
Rabbi Kennard condemned the behaviour on social media, saying that while it was “painful to speak out against fellow Jews in public ... at this time, the danger of staying silent is too great”.
“The law states that we must stay at home, because the experts tell us that this is the way to save lives, because of the risk of terrible Chillul Hashem (desecration of God’s name), every rabbi and leader must cry out,” Mr Kennard said.
“We must take the heartbreaking path and stop the gatherings — for prayer, for s’machot, for school. Just stop.”
It is understood some members of the ultra-Orthodox community — which represents a small minority within the wider Jewish community — have continued to meet for prayer and schooling during Victoria’s six lockdowns.

Ellie Dudley 8.15pm: Auctions spike despite lockdown
The number of auctions spanning Australia’s capital cities spiked over the past week, ­despite outbreaks of the Delta variant of Covid-19 sending many parts of the country into lockdown.
Some 1918 homes were taken to auction across the combined capital cities last week, up from 1606 the previous week, data from CoreLogic showed.
In the same period last year, which was at the peak of Melbourne’s 112-day lockdown, only 1046 auctions were held.
The number of auctions last week, however, was lower than the 2139 originally anticipated because of a large number of auctions postponed.
With Melbourne’s latest lockdown extended, only 954 of the 1131 auctions expected to be held in the city forged on.
This time last year, only 191 auctions were held.
Despite almost 16 per cent of the Victorian capital’s auctions being postponed, a substantial rise was still seen, compared with the previous week when 662 homes were auctioned.

Joseph Lam 7.30pm: Bosses already on track for vaccinated workers
As big business and many of Australia’s leaders debate mandating Covid-19 vaccines at work, many have failed to realise that software allowing businesses to track staff vaccinations has been in place for several months in human resources systems.
Software tracking staff vaccinations has slowly been rolled out in health clinics, disability services and dental practices as expected.
But more widely, it has quickly been picked up by construction companies and hospitality businesses across the country from CBDs to towns with populations as little as 10,000.
In Western Australia, Pretzel Australia has been using ­Employsure’s VaccTrak tool since April. It has now registered Covid-19 vaccines for two of its more than 200 staff members.
The software helps employers develop vaccination reports, provide Covid-19 information and ­resources to staff and record proof of vaccination records, says the company’s entrepreneurial owner, Brittany Garbutt.
“Realistically speaking, Vacc-Trak is going to be most effective in a potential outbreak,” she said. “But this whole situation is new and it’s moving quickly so it’s good to keep track of who might be less at risk.”

AFP 6.45pm: Polish vaccines a ‘responsible policy of solidarity’
Poland has sold one million Pfizer Covid vaccine doses to Australia as part of a “responsible policy of solidarity”, the Polish health minister said on Sunday.
Health Minister Adam Niedzieslki said Poland’s vaccine purchases “allow us to meet the needs of our citizens and support others in need”.
Polish ambassador to Australia Michal Kolodziejski said: “In these tough times for our Australian friends, Poland has decided to share with Australia one million doses of Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine, with immediate delivery”.
Poland has fully vaccinated about 55 per cent of its population, but the rate of vaccinations has slowed sharply in recent months and many vaccination centres have been closed due to low demand.
Opinion polls indicate that up to a quarter of Poles are either opposed to vaccination or hesitant about getting one.

Rachel Baxendale 6pm: Jewish leaders pan ultra-Orthodox gatherings
Key members of Melbourne’s Jewish community have publicly condemned the actions of a small group of ultra-Orthodox Jews who have been holding illegal gatherings, in contravention of coronavirus restrictions.
The comments from leaders including Council of Orthodox Synagogues of Victoria president Mark Cohen and Rabbi James Kennard, who is principal of Australia’s largest Jewish school, Mt Scopus.
They come after two of Sunday’s mystery cases were identified as a mother and son from East St Kilda, who are members of the Orthodox Jewish community.
Victorian Covid logistics chief Jeroen Weimar said the pair had co-operated with contact tracers, who are investigating links to illegal gatherings — understood to include a large engagement party held last weekend.
In behaviour which has disgusted the vast majority of the rest of Melbourne’s Jewish community, members of the tiny ultra-Orthodox community have continued to gather in numbers sufficient to constitute a minyan — which is the quorum of 10 adult Jewish men required for certain religious obligations — throughout Victoria’s lockdowns since last year.
In a statement released on Sunday, Mr Cohen said the council condemned the alleged illegal minyanim.
“The COSV has consistently conveyed the restrictions to which synagogues should be following under the guidelines stipulated to keep our community safe,” Mr Cohen said.
“While all COSV Shules abide and are compliant with the directions not to host services, these alleged private minyanim are not only illegal under these restrictions but are a disappointing act that have put the entire Melbourne Jewish Orthodox community at risk.”
Mr Cohen urged all members of the community not to congregate or visit other people’s homes, to check-in everywhere using QR codes, to wear masks, get tested and get vaccinated.
Rabbi Kennard said it was “painful to speak out against fellow Jews in public”.
“But at this time, the danger of staying silent is too great,” he said.
“Because the law states that we must stay at home, because the experts tell us that this is the way to save lives, because of the risk of terrible Chillul Hashem (desecration of God’s name), every rabbi and leader must cry out.
“We must take the heartbreaking path and stop the gatherings — for prayer, for s’machot, for school. Just stop.”

Ellie Dudley 5.30pm: Labor demands Covid cash support for all
NSW Labor is calling for Covid-19 test and isolation payments to be made available to all residents.
The state government announced on Saturday workers aged 17 and over who live in government areas of concern, get tested for Covid-19 and isolate until a negative result is returned will be eligible for one $320 payment in a four-week period for lost wages.
But opposition leader Chris Minns has said the measure was inadequate, and the payment should be offered statewide.
“The Covid test and isolate payment needs to apply right across greater Sydney & regional NSW,” he wrote on Twitter on Sunday.
“There’s reports of people in the regions waiting 7 days for test results. Not good enough.
“No one should be disadvantaged because they’ve done the right thing and got tested.”
The test and isolate payments will commence next week.

Rachel Baxendale 4.55pm: Victorians urged to get tested
Authorities are not seeing “enough activity” at testing centres given the number of mystery clusters in Victoria, state Covid logistics chief Jeroen Weimar says.
Mr Weimar said there were also numerous instances of cases that had arisen from breaches of restrictions, including children having sleepovers and homework clubs with other households, office workers refusing to work from home, and illegal household gatherings.
“This is not just a western suburbs issue. We’ve got positive cases living in Frankston, living in Dandenong, living across our eastern suburbs, St Kilda. Middle Park, the city of Melbourne as well as across our northern and western suburbs, so please do not think that this is something that’s impacting only other people in other communities,” Mr Weimar said.
“Those of us who are essential workers have not only an opportunity to keep working, and that is not only a privilege but it is also a responsibility, it is so important, if you’re an essential worker continuing to travel through our city at this point in time, you must be on top of your symptoms.
“As soon as you see any symptoms whatsoever, come within a hair ‘s breadth of any of these exposure sites, you must get tested at the first opportunity.
“We’re seeing children gathering, we’re seeing schoolwork clubs, we’re seeing sleepovers. If those things are happening to your children, if your children have been contacting each other or have been with other kids over the recent days, you must go and get them tested today. We’ve seen positive cases coming out of this outbreak of that kind of contact.
“If you are supposed to be working from home, because you can, and you’re choosing to work from an office, we’d like you to go and get tested, because again we are seeing people who are not abiding by the work from home directive who are picking up coronavirus spreading it into their community.
“And of course we always see those understandable but very dangerous household gatherings, household visits, popping over just to see to make sure they are OK. All understandable, but also dangerous, because we’re seeing the virus hitch along and move from one cluster to another.
“So please, If any of those scenarios are applying to you, if you’ve got any symptoms whatsoever, I know it’s a nice day out there, we need to get tested today. We are not, frankly, seeing enough activity in our testing centres at this point in time given the number of different strands that we are picking up every single day.”
Of Victoria’s 185 active coronavirus cases on Sunday:

Joseph Lam 4.20pm: 15-year-old Covid-positive Sydney boy on life support
A 15-year-old boy has been put on life support after contracting Covid-19 while battling other underlying health conditions.
It is understood the teenager was in a grave condition on Sunday after being admitted while suffering from pneumococcal meningitis.
Asked about the case on Sunday, NSW Chief Health Officer Kerry Chant said she would only provide some brief information cleared by his family.
“I can confirm that there is someone admitted to hospital that is 15 and that the cause of their admission, while they are Covid positive, is related to another health condition,” she said.
“The family have agreed that we can indicate that he has pneumococcal meningitis.”
“I’ll chase up the vaccination issues with the pneumococcal vaccine.”
NSW Chief Health Officer Dr Kerry Chant has reassured the community that while the state’s health system is “under stress” it remains “ready and able to respond to your health needs”. “The health system is under stress. Let's be frank,” she said. “But it is a big health system, and we have got the capacity to draw on services and staff from a broad range of places. “We have got a level of resilience in our health system, and the other thing I would like to say is if you need urgent care, urgent care is available to you. "So please never think 'oh, they must be so busy, I'm not going to go there when I've got chest pain'. “That's the last thing we want to see at this moment, so please be reassured that the health system is ready and able to respond to your health needs.”

Anthony Piovesan 3.55pm: Trio’s foiled plan to flee Victoria lockdown
Three Melburnians have been caught fleeing the city’s lockdown without a valid travel permit and escaping to the Northern Territory. Two women, aged 24 and 34, and a 40-year-old man travelled separately from Melbourne to Darwin over the weekend without any exemptions.
The 24-year-old allegedly lied to authorities saying she had been in Brighton “a few weeks ago” but later confessed to being in the southeastern suburb of Melbourne last week, Northern Territory Police said.
Melbourne is deemed a coronavirus hot spot with anyone travelling from there requiring an authorised travel permit.
Melbourne has been locked down for almost a fortnight, with the possibility of the strict orders being extended due to the rising number of mystery cases in metropolitan Melbourne.
Each traveller was slapped with a fine of $5056.
Two travellers were sent home on a flight on Saturday and one passenger stayed overnight at Darwin’s quarantine facility before being sent back to Melbourne on Sunday morning.
Northern Territory Incident controller Sachin Sharma urged travellers not to travel to the NT from a declared coronavirus hot spot.
“Authorities are checking each border entry form upon arrival,” he said.
“If you are providing false information about your whereabouts, we will know. If you are expecting to be allowed into the Territory without an exemption, you will not be.
“This is a serious situation and we will continue to enforce chief health officer directions with a zero tolerance approach.”

Rachel Baxendale 3.15pm: Breakdown of Victoria’s 10 mystery clusters
Victoria’s number of clusters since August 4 with no identified source of acquisition is back up to 10, after two previous mystery cases were linked to other clusters and two entirely new ones emerged.
The mystery cases include:
- An Al-Taqwa College teacher in her 20s and her optometrist partner, who live in Hobson’s Bay. The partner worked at Caroline Springs Square shopping centre and played football at the Newport Football Club;
- A Maribyrnong man in his 20s who works at a warehouse in Derrimut;
- A Melton family of two parents and a child;
- A City of Melbourne father who works at the Royal Children’s Hospital, and his son who is in Grade One at St Michael’s Primary School in North Melbourne;
- A Brunswick West man who had visited sites in Flemington and Parkville;
- A Glenroy family linked to Glenroy West Primary School, where there are now 29 cases. This cluster now includes two previous mystery cases in a Roxburgh Park resident who works in Bundoora, and in a Glenroy family whose child attends Corpus Christi Primary School in Glenroy;
- A delivery truck driver who lives in Wyndham Vale in Melbourne’s outer southwest, and does not drive interstate;
- A person who lives in Middle Park and visited the South Melbourne Market and a string of sites in Melbourne’s inner south and southeast. This case is believed to be linked to a case in a cleaner who lives in the City of Greater Dandenong, in Melbourne’s outer southeast, and works in Fitzroy Street. The exact link is not yet clear;
- A construction worker who lives in West Footscray;
- A mother and her adult son from East St Kilda;

Melanie Evans 3pm: US hospitalisations for 30-39s at record rate
Hospitalisations of Covid-19 patients in their 30s have hit a new record, US government data show, a sign of the toll that the highly contagious Delta variant is taking among the unvaccinated.
Thirty-somethings, who are in prime ages for work and parenting, had largely avoided hospital stays for Covid-19 during earlier phases of the pandemic because of their relative good health.
Yet the age group is seeing new Covid-19 hospital admissions increase during the recent Delta-driven surge, which doctors and epidemiologists attribute to the failure of large numbers of Americans to get vaccinated and their highly active lives.
The rate at which adults ages 30 to 39 are entering hospitals with Covid-19 reached about 2.5 per 100,000 people as of last Wednesday, according to the latest data from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and Department of Health and Human Services, up from the previous peak of roughly 2 per 100,000 people in early January.
“It means Delta is really bad,” said James Lawler, an infectious-disease physician and co-director of the Global Center for Health Security at the University of Nebraska Medical Center.
The strain is more transmissible, Dr. Lawler said, and studies indicate that infected people can develop more severe illness than from other strains.
New infections have climbed above 123,000 each day, using the seven-day average, which helps to smooth out irregularities in the data, according to Johns Hopkins University figures.
Hospitalisations, too, have increased from low points in the spring when more Americans became immunised.
Preliminary studies indicate vaccines protect against Delta, especially against severe cases or death, but the shots appear to be less effective against the variant than they are against the earliest versions of the coronavirus.
Uneven vaccination rates across the country and age groups has left pockets of people at risk from the tenacious Delta variant.
Nationally, slightly less than half of those ages 25 to 39 are fully vaccinated, compared with 61% of all adults, CDC data show. Ages are available for 92% of those fully vaccinated.
People ages 30 to 39 years accounted for about 170,852 new Covid-19 admissions of more than 2.5 million hospital stays since August last year, when the data became available. - WSJ

Rachel Baxendale 2.45am: Breakdown of Victoria’s latest cases
There are 185 active coronavirus cases in Victoria on Sunday, including four in people who are in hospital, one of whom is in ICU - up from three in hospital and one in ICU on Saturday.
There are now more than 500 exposure sites linked to the clusters which have emerged since August 4, and more than 13,000 primary close contacts in home isolation.
Of the 25 new community-acquired cases in Sunday’s numbers:
- 10 are in households linked to Al-Taqwa College, including a family of six, a family of three, and a single student in another household;
- Seven are linked to the Glenroy West Primary School cluster, including six students and one household member;
- Three are linked to the CS Square shopping centre in Caroline Springs, including two associated with the Jolly Miller Cafe and one with the YPA real estate agency;
- One is a social contact of the Middle Park mystery case identified on Friday;
Victoria’s COVID-19 Response Commander Jeroen Weimar is warning of the “aggressive” nature of the coronavirus outbreak as exposure sites in the state rise to more than 500 with 13,000 primary close contacts isolating. Mr Weimar said of the 25 new cases reported on Sunday, 10 were associated with household members from Al-Taqwa College. “Particularly two families, one a family of six and one a family of three, all with positive cases in the household and one further household member of a student,” he said. “It highlights how aggressive this virus is when it gets into your community, when it gets into your household, the attack rate of this virus is exceptionally high.”
- One is a cleaner who lives in the City of Greater Dandenong in Melbourne’s outer southeast, who has worked on Fitzroy Street in St Kilda and is believed to be linked to the Middle Park case but the exact links are yet to be established;
- One is a construction worker who lives in West Footscray, and is yet to be linked to any other known positive cases;
- Two cases are in a mother and her adult son from East St Kilda, who are yet to be linked to any other known positive cases;
Of the 25 cases, 12 are in people who were isolating throughout their infectious period, most of whom are linked to Al-Taqwa or CS Square.

Joseph Lam 2.30pm: Chant more stern than usual in Sunday’s update
NSW Chief Health Officer Dr Kerry Chant was a little more stern than usual in Sunday’s Covid-19 update, delivering some rather matter-of-fact messages when questioned by reporters.
“We are at a fork in the road and we have to decide what path we will choose,” she said.
“The path I want is one where I see declining case numbers and increasing vaccination uptake. The vaccine will take us there but it will not be a silver bullet.”
“Vaccination is part of the solution. It helps us because if the person is vaccinated, there is less chance that they get the disease particularly if they have had two doses.
NSW Chief Health Officer Dr Kerry Chant has reassured the community that while the state’s health system is “under stress” it remains “ready and able to respond to your health needs”. “The health system is under stress. Let's be frank,” she said. “But it is a big health system, and we have got the capacity to draw on services and staff from a broad range of places. “We have got a level of resilience in our health system, and the other thing I would like to say is if you need urgent care, urgent care is available to you. "So please never think 'oh, they must be so busy, I'm not going to go there when I've got chest pain'. “That's the last thing we want to see at this moment, so please be reassured that the health system is ready and able to respond to your health needs.”
“And therefore, it means they are less likely to pass it to others. And also less likely to need hospital care and admission to intensive care.”
Asked if hospitals in the LGAs of concern were coping, Dr Chant said they were with some difficulty.
“Look, the health system is under stress ... let’s be frank,” she said. “But … it is a big health system and we have the capacity to draw on services and staff from a broad range of places so we have got a level of resilience in our health system.”

Rachel Baxendale 2.15am: Andrews says NSW’s ‘got to vaccinate their way out of this’
Victorian Premier Daniel Andrews does not oppose NSW being given half of the million extra Pfizer doses secured by Australia from Poland, because “nothing else is working” to control Sydney’s coronavirus crisis.
Victoria will receive 175,000 extra doses as a result of the deal.
“I know some Victorians will ask: ‘why are they getting more than we are?’,” Mr Andrews said.
“Nothing else they are doing is working, nothing else has worked. They’ve got to vaccinate their way out of this now.
“We don’t want to get to that point because, the flip side of that is hundreds of people in hospital, and people dying.
“We don’t want that. We’ve got a chance to do what we’ve done before, and that is drive these case numbers down.”

Rachel Baxendale 2.15am: ‘Far too many cases in Victoria’, says Andrews
Daniel Andrews has warned his state is dealing with “far too many cases” of coronavirus, urging Victorians to stay home amid reports of illegal inner city pub crawls and other gatherings.
“There are far too many cases, firstly. Then of course there are many cases that are not linked,” Mr Andrews said.
“There are a number of mystery cases, and those numbers continue to grow, and that is very challenging.
“If we were to reopen the whole economy, if we were to reopen and let people move freely right now, then we would finish up where Sydney is at: thousands of cases, not cases in the tens and 20s, but thousands of cases, and hundreds and hundreds of people in hospital, and many of them, very unwell. We would finish up with deaths.”
Victorian Premier Daniel Andrews says an additional 84,000 appointments will be made available to allow the state to reach its target of 1 million jabs administered in the next five weeks as 25 new local cases were recorded. “I’m really pleased today to be able to announce there’ll be a further 84,000 appointments added to the website today and into tomorrow,” he said. “So, you can go online today, tomorrow, and book with certainty.” Mr Andrews said the 84,000 appointments meant there would be around 300,000 additional appointments available as part of the five-week “1 million jabs in 1 million arms campaign”.
Mr Andrews said if there was an alternative to the current restrictions, he would take it.
“There is not. We have to continue to be vigilant. I know this is getting really hard, it is getting really frustrating, it is getting really difficult, but I just say to people: look, a sneaky illegal visit to regional Victoria is just not worth it.
“A pub crawl, impromptu or preplanned, Victorian Police are having a close look at that and I will let them update you later on today, but a pub crawl, and that is what it was in Richmond last night, is not worth it. “Nobody should be doing anything that potentially spreads at this virus, because this virus is not something anyone wants to get.
“We’re not talking about people in their 90s. That is tragic enough. We’re about people dying in their 30s and 40s and 50s.”
“I know it’s difficult, I know it’s hard, but so too is being on a machine to breathe, so too is having to nurse someone in full PPE, hour after hour, shift after shift.
“I’ve had some of the conversations with family members who’ve lost a loved one. I’ve had conversations with nurses who’ve nursed them. This is not something that you can cheat your way out of.”
Mr Andrews said the “vast majority of Victorians” were “doing the right thing”.
“But I think there are some people who think these rules don’t apply to them. I just say to them, the consequences are very significant and very serious.”

AFP 1.45pm: Fiji public servants told ‘no jab, no job’
A “no jab, no job” coronavirus policy went into effect in Fiji on Sunday, with unvaccinated public servants forced to go on leave as the Pacific nation joined a number of countries in imposing similar mandates.
A stubborn outbreak of the highly infectious Delta variant that started in April ended a yearlong spell of no community transmission of Covid-19, and has overwhelmed Fiji’s healthcare system with more than 40,000 cases.
The government has argued that mandatory vaccinations are necessary to raise immunisation rates and end the outbreak.
After a period of forced leave starting Sunday, Fiji’s public servants who remain unvaccinated by November will be dismissed.
In addition, employees at private firms could face fines and companies could be forced to stop operations over vaccine refusals.
A growing number of nations are making shots compulsory in critical sectors such as health and public services.
From Canada and the United States to Zimbabwe and Saudi Arabia, authorities in a growing number of countries have moved to require workers in hospitals, schools, travel and public services to get a shot or face varying levels of disciplinary action.
Despite intense political opposition in some nations such as France, governments and experts say mass vaccination is one of the most potent weapons to help end the pandemic and end the economic suffering brought by restrictions such as lockdowns.
Legal expert and former head of the Fiji Human Rights Commission Imrana Jalal said other countries had mandated compulsory vaccinations in various critical sectors, but not on the sweeping scale imposed in Fiji.
The island nation’s economy has been hammered by the pandemic-induced collapse of the tourism industry, with unemployment soaring as a result.
The government has dismissed the lockdown option because of its high economic cost and rising poverty in the nation of 930,000.
With more than 24,000 still-active cases and 358 deaths, its resources are stretched as military-style field hospitals handle the overflow of patients. — AFP

Blake Antrobus 1pm: Where are the areas of most concern in NSW
Multiple suburbs in western and southwestern Sydney are among the areas of “most concern” as NSW health authorities grapple with another surge in Covid-19 cases.
Premier Gladys Berejiklian revealed the suburbs of Blacktown, Mount Druitt, Marayong, Merrylands, Auburn and Guildford were showing a considerable growth in cases despite increasing rates of vaccination across other local government areas.
Cases in Dubbo and Walgett and sewage detections in Bourke have also sparked alarm.
Ms Berejiklian has urged people in those areas not to leave home “unless you absolutely have to”.
“Please know, if you are in these areas, you not only need to take extra precautions but make sure you come forward for testing,” she said.
“We can’t stress enough that we don’t want to go down the path of all these other places overseas where they have literally thousands and thousands and thousands of cases a day.
“We are really begging people to take this seriously … to protect yourself and your loved ones and protect our freedom going forward.”
It comes as NSW records 415 new locally acquired cases of Covid-19 on Sunday.
Tragically, four people also died during the latest reporting period.
Chief health officer Kerry Chant said coronavirus fragments were detected as sewage treatment plants at Lennox Head, Bourke, Parkes and Wallacia, which serves the areas of Warragamba, Mulgoa, Silverdale and Wallacia. She said the public health unit was still concerned about the Maitland area.
“There were some cases investigated overnight,” Dr Chant said.
“If you are a resident in the Newcastle area, please be vigilant for those local concerns notices.”

MITCHELL VAN HOMRIGH 12.15pm: ‘No one able to beat Delta’: Berejiklian
Gladys Berejiklian has told reporters eliminating the highly contagious Delta strain was now “almost impossible”.
“I think when you look around Australia and other states, who had lower case numbers than us, it is very to get those down. It is very stubborn and we are doing everything we can, throwing everything we can, to make sure that we achieve those outcomes in New South Wales,” she said.
“But our aim is to have case numbers as low as possible and to have vaccination rates as high as possible, and with adults are, the experience of Delta is that no other jurisdiction has been able to eliminate it.
“It’s not possible to eliminate it completely. We have to learn to live with it. But the best chance we have to live with it freely and safely is to get the case numbers down as low as possible.”
Premier Gladys Berejiklian says there have been 5 million jabs administered in New South Wales and 50 per cent of the population has received at least one dose. “On a positive note, New South Wales hit five million jabs,” she said. “Thank you, everybody, for coming forward to get vaccinated. Outstanding result but in New South Wales we have now hit five million jabs, and 50 per cent of our population has received their first dose. “So that is a very pleasing result. Thank you. “If we keep that up we can look forward to hitting those vaccine milestones hopefully on the schedule that we have, but if we do really well, obviously that can happen more quickly.”

EVIN PRIEST 12pm: Gladys defends announcing state lockdown via Twitter
Premier Gladys Berejiklian has defended announcing the statewide lockdown of NSW via media release and social media instead of calling another press conference on Saturday.
The whole of NSW, outside greater Sydney, was plunged into a seven-day lockdown on Saturday at 5pm after recording 466 new infections and four deaths.
The order replaced all existing lockdown orders for regional NSW and Dr Kerry Chant said she gave advice for the statewide lockdown because it was “clearly needed”.
It lasts until 12.01am on August 22.
Outrage was directed at the fact it was announced at 2.30pm – only 2.5 hours before it kicked in – and that it was done via deputy premier John Barilaro ’s Twitter account.
Many took to social media to call it a slap in the face to the bush.
“By yesterday most of the state was in lockdown already,” Ms Berejiklian said as she defended Mr Barilaro’s move. “It was just a few local government areas in rural and regional communities.”

Adeshola Ore 11.50am: None of the ACT’s nine active cases required hospitalisation
Of the ACT two new cases announced on Sunday, Chief Minister Andrew Barr said one of the new cases is a man in his 20s, with no identified links to current infections.
The other case is linked to Fiction nightclub in Canberra city, where the man who triggered the territory’s lackdown had visited.
Mr Barr said anyone who visited the venue at the exposure times must isolate for 14 days and get tested.
Mr Barr said he welcomed the announcement from the NSW government to enact a state-wide lockdown.
“Whether you’re on the ACT or NSW side of the border, everyone is in the same situation now,” he said.
“We are aware of the challenges that the cross-border situation presents and we are working with our NSW counterparts to make it as simple as possible.”
ACT Chief Health Officer Kerryn Coleman said none of the territory’s nine active cases required hospitalisation.
Mr Barr said he would update territorians in the coming days about what the additional Pfizer doses would mean for the ACT’s rollout.

Rachel Baxendale 11.30am: Victoria adds 84,000 vaccine appointments at hubs
Victoria has added an extra 84,000 vaccine appointments at state-run hubs over the next month, in addition to an extra 200,000 already announced on Friday.
The new appointments come ahead of all 50 state-run clinics opening AstraZeneca appointments to 18-39-year-olds from Monday, up from a trial of nine clinics last week, and is in addition to any appointments that may arise out of Pfizer supplies just secured from Poland.
Victorian Premier Daniel Andrews said he was not “entirely certain” when Victoria would get its 175,000 doses as part of the Polish consignment.
Prime Minister Scott Morrison says Australia has secured an additional 1 million Pfizer doses and will prioritise 530,000 for the 12 Sydney local government areas of concern. “We have been in discussions with the Polish government now for several weeks, and we have secured an additional just over 1 million doses of Pfizer and they will start landing in Australia from tonight,” he said. “These doses are on top of the 40 million Pfizer doses that Australia has already contracted to be delivered, and of course will be ramping up again significantly in the fourth quarter of this year. “Now the 1 million doses – I’ve discussed this with the NSW premier yesterday – will be targeted to Australians aged 20 to 39 years of age who are identified in the Doherty modelling as the peak transmitters for COVID-19. “530,000 of these doses will be prioritised for express delivery to the 12 city local government areas where the COVID-19 outbreak continues to grow. “Further doses will turn up over the course of this week, and the balance of the doses will be provided to the remaining states and territories on a per capita basis, not including NSW of course, because they will have received those first 530,000 doses.”
“I would not advise anyone to change their plans based on that. Book with confidence, based on what we announced last Friday, based on what I am announcing today, which is another 84,000 appointments,” Mr Andrews said.
“They are a mix of AstraZeneca and Pfizer. If you book AstraZeneca, you’ll come along, you speak to experienced health are official to have a conversation with you about whether AstraZeneca works for you, it is safe for you, you can make informed consent.
“The chief health officer is not here today but if I can quote him, the best vaccine is the one you can get today. No one should delay on the basis that there is more coming. Yes, there is more coming, when that occurs, who knows?
“The more people who are protected faster, then the greater the benefit to all of us.”

Evin Priest 11.05am: NSW records 415 new cases, four deaths
NSW has recorded four deaths along with 415 new local cases of Covid-19 on Sunday.
Premier Gladys Berejiklian detailed the four deaths while also announcing at least 42 cases active in the community while infectious.
But Ms Berejiklian revealed that the number of people infectious in the community was likely go up as the isolation status of 273 cases was investigated.
“Regrettably, four people lost their lives to 8pm last night,” Ms Berejiklian said.
“A female in her 50s in southwest Sydney at Campbelltown Hospital (who) wasn’t vaccinated, a female in her 70s at Royal North Shore Hospital who was only recently given her first dose, a man in his 80s at Liverpool Hospital who wasn‘t vaccinated and a female in her 80s at RPA who was vaccinated but did have underlying chronic conditions.
“Again, our heartfelt deepest sympathies and condolences to all of their loved ones.”
The whole state was locked down on Saturday after posting 466 new infections and four more deaths.
On Sunday, NSW chief health officer Dr Kerry Chant appeared devastated while delivering a stern warning to NSW.
“I personally do not want to see escalating numbers of deaths and hospitalisations, and it does require all of us to act and add here urgently, and not have any degree of complacency, even though we all feel (exhausted) after such a protracted battle against COVID,” Dr Chant said.
“I cannot stress enough the seriousness of the current situation, and my grave concerns that these case numbers will continue to escalate.
“While we have put in additional controls, everybody needs to have a great sense of responsibility to follow the rules.”
Premier Gladys Berejiklian says New South Wales has recorded 415 new locally acquired COVID cases and four deaths related to the outbreak. “Regrettably, four people lost their lives to 8pm last night,” she said. The deaths included an unvaccinated woman in her 50s, a female in her 70s who had recently received her first dose of a vaccine, an unvaccinated male in his 80s, and a vaccinated female in her 80s with underlying chronic health conditions. Ms Berejiklian said the woman in her 70s at Royal North Shore Hospital “wasn’t protected” because she had only recently been given her first dose. "Again, our heartfelt deepest sympathies and condolences to all of their loved ones," she said. "Please know, the last thing we want to see is more deaths because of this outbreak, but unfortunately we know that's what we're going to see unless we reduce case numbers and unless we increase the rate of vaccination."
Premier Berejiklian said Blacktown, Mount Druitt, Merion, Maryland, Orban and Guildford were now areas of concern.
Of the 415 new cases, 167 from western Sydney, 98 from southwest Sydney, 42 from inner Sydney, 36 from Nepean/Blue Mountains, 31 from southeast Sydney, 21 from western NSW, nine from Hunter/New England region, six from northern Sydney and two from Central Coast.
On a positive note, the Premier said NSW has now administered five million doses of vaccine and half of the population have now received their first dose.
Dr Chant said she is “very concerned” about western NSW. “We have cases in Dubbo and we have exposures and sewage detections in a number of other areas such as Bourke (and) Walgett.
Dr Chant said she was pleased cases had settled in the Newcastle area.

Adeshola Ore 10.55am: ACT records two new Covid cases, outbreak now nine
The ACT has recorded two new cases of Covid-19, taking the total number of infections in the territory’s outbreak to nine.
The territory conducted more than 3,200 tests in the past twenty-four hour period.
ANTHONY PIOVESAN 10.45am: Rapid antigen testing to be rolled out in Sydney aged care
NSW will introduce Covid-19 rapid antigen testing across aged care facilities in greater Sydney in a bid to identify cases before they escalate into outbreaks.
The commonwealth announced on Sunday it would roll out the new testing at the Uniting Bankstown Aged Care Facility on Monday, and then continue the program at other facilities that express interest.
Rapid antigen testing (RAT) – which can test for Covid-19 and deliver a result in just 15 minutes – has been the source of much debate in Australian parliament, with some politicians urging the country should have adopted the approach sooner. Rapid antigen testing has been widely used across Europe and the United States since the start of the year.
But in Victoria, the push has been totally shut down with the state’s chief health officer Brett Sutton saying PCR tests were the “gold standard” and rapid antigen testing would not “provide much additional value”.
The federal government has approved a new device which will revolutionise the way workplaces can quickly test for COVID. After a six-month wait, the Ecotest COVID-19 antigen saliva pen has been approved by the Therapeutic Goods Administration. According to its manufacturer, it is the first rapid test which will not require a mouth and throat swab. Path Diagnostics’ Andrew Lloyd says while his pen has 90 per cent of the sensitivity of the gold-standard PCR test, results only take 15 minutes and cost about nine dollars per test as opposed to $90. This means the device could be a far more cost-effective way for employers to test their workers quickly and without discomfort. The government announced this week it was expanding the use of rapid antigen tests, with the TGA approving a slew of fast-result kits which have already been in regular use overseas for months. Employers would still need to hire a health practitioner to perform the tests or supervise staff trained to conduct them.
However, federal Health Minister Greg Hunt said the rapid testing in NSW aged care facilities would allow “fast Covid-19 screening” of people who were more vulnerable against coronavirus and it’s deadly variants.
It comes as Sydney’s Covid-19 outbreak worsened on Saturday when the state posted a record 466 new local cases and four more people also lost their lives to the virus.
“Given the rate at which we know the Delta variant can be spread between people, the very fast turnaround of RAT – around 15 minutes – makes these tests useful in preventing asymptomatic transmission and outbreaks as they can be used on a daily basis,” Mr Hunt said.
“Sadly, the pandemic’s toll in Australia last year was highest among aged care residents.
“That is why, along with increased infection control training and vaccinations, we are looking at further innovations such as RAT to provide an additional layer of protection for the most vulnerable Australians.”

Joesph Lam 10.30am: No new Queensland cases but Palaszczuk tightens border
Queensland has recorded no new locally-transmitted Covid-19 cases over the past 24 hours.
Premier Annastacia Palaszczuk said while no new cases were positive, there is concern about the NSW and Queensland border after NSW was put into a statewide lockdown on Saturday.
“We worked very hard yesterday late afternoon into the evening to get extra police presence down there (at the border),” she said.
“Now, because all of New South Wales is in a lockdown position, there should be very minimal movement over that border. And that extra police presence will ensure we do everything we can to keep Queenslanders safe.
“This is probably the tightest border controls we have put in place, they are going to be very strict, we will be checking people, and of course there is very minimal reason for that movement and we will be checking freight as well.”

Adeshola Ore 10.15am: PM pleads with NSW residents: stay at home
Scott Morrison has pleaded with New South Wales residents to stay at home and follow lockdown restrictions.
On Saturday, the entire state of NSW was plunged into a lockdown after it recorded 466 new cases - its highest number in the outbreak.
“I need you to stay at home and you needed more vaccines from us,” Mr Morrison said.
“More vaccines are on their way. They will be there this week. And so I need Sydneysdiers to stay home so we can beat this thing.”

Adeshola Ore 10.05am: One million Pfizer doses from Poland arrive tonight
Scott Morrison has confirmed Australia has secured an additional one million doses of the Pfizer Covid-19 vaccine.
The extra one million dose, sent from Poland, will land in Australia tonight. The nation has already secured 40 million doses of the Pfizer vaccine.
The Prime Minister described the extra supplies as “one million doses of hope” for Australians and particularly in New South Wales.
Mr Morrison also said by next week 50 per cent of eligible Australians will have received their first Covid-19 vaccine dose.
The extra one million doses will be given to younger Australians aged 20-39, which were identified by the Doherty Institute as peak transmitters of the virus. They will begin being administered this week.
More than half of the doses, 530,000, will be prioritised for 12 local government areas in NSW that have the highest rates of the virus.
Mr Morrison said the additional Pfizer doses would “greatly assist” NSW to vaccinate its younger population in hotspots.
“Many of them have to go to work because they are essential workers that keep the country moving,” he said.
“This will give everyone aged 20-39 in the 12 LGAs the opportunity to be vaccinated.”
The remaining doses will be provided to other states and territories on a per capita basis.
Mr Morrison said the allocation on doses was based “directly” on health advice from Chief Medical Officer Paul Kelly .

Adeshola Ore 9.45am: Staff vaccines should only be imposed with a health order: Labor
Labor frontbencher Tony Burke says any decision on whether employers should be able to mandate Covid-19 vaccines for staff should only be imposed when there is a health order.
Speaking after national cabinet on Friday, Scott Morrison said state and territory governments would use workplace laws to shield businesses from legal exposure if they did not impose mandatory vaccines for employees.
The opposition’s industrial relations spokesman Tony Burke told the ABC any decision on vaccine mandates should be based on health advice.
“What I support is for mandating to be determined by health orders. I just can’t be clearer than that,” he said.
Under current arrangements endorsed by the national cabinet, aged-care and quarantine workers are the only people in the country who must be vaccinated.

Adeshola Ore 9am: WA to pursue Covid zero even after 80% vaccine threshold
Western Australian Premier Mark McGowan says even with an 80 per cent fully vaccinated threshold, his state will still aim for zero Covid-19 cases through using lockdowns and a hard border.
Modelling by the Doherty Institute revealed at 80 per cent lockdowns would not be needed for entire states and extended areas, though localised, targeted lockdowns could still be needed.
But Mr McGowan said elimination of the virus was still Western Australia’s goal, noting “our preferred option is zero Covid obviously”.
Western Australian Premier Mark McGowan says he will pursue a zero COVID policy in his state even after the 80 per cent vaccine threshold is achieved. In an interview for Sunday Agenda, Mr McGowan also said he was keen to introduce mandatory vaccination for certain industries, including the mining industry, with or without national support. "Our preferred option is zero COVID obviously and that's what what we'll attempt to do," Mr McGowan said. "And we don't want to have deaths and we don't want to have spread of the virus, but there can be some easing of some of the rules. "When you get to 70, perhaps 80, if there is a lockdown it might be a lesser area rather than the entire metropolitan area. It might be a country town rather than the entire region."
“That’s what we’ll achieve to do. We don’t want to have deaths,” he told Sky News.
“When you get to 80 per cent it makes it far more easy to ease restrictions but national cabinet has agreed that states have a right to put in place borders.”
His comments are at odds with Scott Morrison ’s who on Friday predicted state border closures should no longer be necessary once Australia reached a double dose vaccination rate of 80 per cent.
Mr McGowan also predicted that his state would have border restrictions with NSW until the end of the year.

Rachel Baxendale 8.20am: Victoria records 25 new community-acquired cases
Victoria has recorded 25 new community-acquired cases of coronavirus in the 24 hours to Saturday night.
Of the 25, 21 have been linked to known outbreaks, while the source of the remaining four is under investigation.
While 12 of the cases were in isolation throughout their infectious period, 13 have spent time in the community while infectious.
Sunday’s 25 cases follow 21 on Saturday, 15 on Friday, 21 locally acquired and two interstate acquired cases on Thursday, 20 on each of Wednesday and Tuesday, and 11 on each of last Monday and Sunday.
The outbreak peak so far was 29 on August 7, just three days after short-lived celebrations of zero on August 4.
There have now been 182 cases linked to outbreaks which have emerged since August 4, ahead of the state’s sixth lockdown being announced the following day.
No source of acquisition has yet been confirmed for either of the Victorian community outbreaks which prompted the sixth lockdown, nor for seven of eight further mystery clusters which emerged on Wednesday, Thursday and Friday.
The first cases to appear on August 4 and 5 were a teacher in her 20s from Hobsons Bay who works at Al-Taqwa College and a Maribyrnong man who works at a warehouse in Derrimut – all in Melbourne’s west.
Wednesday’s new mystery cases related to two parents and a child who live in the City of Melton in Melbourne’s outer northwest, and a father who works at the Melbourne Children’s Eye Clinic at the Royal Children’s Hospital, and his Year 1 son who attends St Michael’s Primary School in North Melbourne.
Thursday’s mysteries include a Brunswick West man, and three people spread across two households in Glenroy, in Melbourne’s north, with no interactions so far identified between the two households.
Vic Locally-acquired Covid-19
Of Saturday’s 21 new cases, 15 were linked to one of the Glenroy clusters, centred on Glenroy West Primary School – with 22 cases now spread across eight households linked to the cluster and/or suburb.
Mystery cases identified on Friday included a delivery truck driver who lives in Wyndham Vale in Melbourne’s outer southwest, but does not drive interstate, a person who lives in bayside Middle Park in Melbourne’s inner south, and a person who lives in Roxburgh Park in Melbourne’s outer north, and works in Bundoora.
The Roxburgh Park case has since been linked to the Glenroy West Primary School cluster but the others remain unlinked.
Of 182 cases linked to Victorian outbreaks which have emerged since early August, a total of 66, or 36 per cent, have been in quarantine for the duration of their infectious period.
There are currently 185 active cases, including up to two active cases acquired overseas.
As of Saturday, there were three people in Victorian hospitals with coronavirus, one of whom was in intensive care.
The latest cases come after 32,286 tests were processed on Saturday, compared with 33,675 on Friday, 40,737 on Thursday, 45,408 on Wednesday, 41,571 on Tuesday, 34,892 on Monday, 38,987 on Sunday and 38,179 last Saturday.
Victoria’s testing record is 59,355 tests on July 20.
Melbourne's sixth lockdown is set to be extended beyond Friday amid concerns about rising case numbers.

Daniel Sankey 6.20am: New exposure sites declared in Dubbo
NSW Health has declared another five Covid-19 exposure sites in Dubbo while confirming more virus trace detections in regional sewage.
Traces of Covid-19 were found at sewage treatment plants in Parkes and Dubbo yesterday. The Parkes plant serves more than 11,000 citizens, while the Brooklyn plant covering 1200 people across Brooklyn, Dangar Island, Cowan, Mooney Mooney and Cheerio Point.
“These are of particular concern, as there are no known cases in these areas,” NSW Health said in a statement.
“Everyone in these areas is urged to monitor for the onset of symptoms, and if they appear, to immediately be tested and isolate until a negative result is received.
Anyone who attended the following venues in Dubbo is considered a close contact and must be tested and isolate for 14 days, regardless of the result.
DUBBO EXPOSURE SITES
■ Saint Laurence O’Toole Church, cnr Fitzroy and Tamworth Street — Sunday, August 8 from 6.50am to 8.35am;

Daniel Sankey 5am: NSW in total lockdown as Delta spread worsens
The entire state of NSW has been placed under strict stay-at-home restrictions, with Premier Gladys Berejiklian abandoning an incremental lockdown approach following the spread of the Delta variant into regional areas.
Despite ruling out a statewide lockdown earlier in the week, Ms Berejiklian said on Saturday afternoon that health advice concerning multiple regional areas had forced her hand. For seven days from 5pm yesterday, all people in regional NSW must to stay at home unless they have a reasonable excuse to leave.
All schooling will be done at home and travelling for exercise and shopping is only permitted within a person’s LGA or within a radius of 5km (formerly 10km).
Lockdown Distance Map
The news came just hours after NSW recorded 466 new locally-acquired Covid-19 cases in the 24 hours to 8pm Friday – with no known source for 345 of those cases – plus four deaths.
Traces of Covid-19 had been found in sewage in Ballina and Broken Hill, two regional towns almost 1500km apart. In addition, 26 new cases had been recorded in western NSW, with another 16 in the Hunter/New England region. There were also 30 cases in Dubbo alone and another four in Walgett.
“The nature of Delta is something we haven’t seen before and it is spreading in a way we haven’t seen before,” Ms Berejiklian said.
“If we want to stop the spread, we need to get vaccinated. Vaccination is key. Don‘t wait.”
The Sunday Telegraph has reported that Prime Minister Scott Morrison “privately raised the issue of a statewide lockdown’’ with Ms Berejiklian in a phone conversation last week, and it was supported by Mr Morrison’s National Security Committee of cabinet.
Ms Berejiklian decided against it at the time with Health Minister Brad Hazzard also publicly ruling it out, the Sunday Telegraph says, but a change of mind occurred after Covid-19 fragments were found in more than 10 sewage treatment plants across rural and regional NSW.
The detection resulted in Nationals leader and Deputy Premier John Barilaro and the Premier agreeing that a statewide – rather than individual local government area – lockdown should occur.
Deputy Premier John Barilaro says the decision to plunge NSW into a statewide lockdown arose from concerns over traces of COVID-19 being detected in sewerage systems in the regions.
Mr Barilaro said on Sky News the LGA by LGA approach had proved “death by a thousand cuts”.
Extra police were staffing Queensland’s border with NSW from Saturday night to stop anyone trying to breach the lockdown.
Queensland Premier Annastacia Palaszczuk is today expected to ban all NSW residents, except freight drivers and health and emergency service workers, from entering the state.
Mayor of Dubbo Stephen Lawrence says he is “calling upon the community” to comply with the public health orders.

Daniel Sankey 4.45am: Victoria prepares for another lockdown extension
Rising Victorian Covid-19 cases, combined with fears over the spread of the Delta variant in NSW, are expected to see the state’s lockdown extended past Friday.
Yesterday, 21 new cases were reported in Victoria, with 11 of those in quarantine. Dozens of new exposure sites were also declared, including a Richmond apartment block over an 11-day period.
Burnet Institute epidemiologist Professor Michael Toole warned Victoria would need to be “prepared for more lockdowns … particularly with what’s happening in New South Wales”.
Vic Locally-acquired Covid-19
“We are getting to the end of the incubation period for those people who got infected seven to 10 days ago,” he said.
“So we should see a decline in the next couple of days – but it surprises you sometimes. Those 40 to 60 people who were infected before the lockdown haven’t been out spreading it all over the place.
“I think this will work, but I think in the next three months, until we can get the vaccination right up to the target at 70 or 80 per cent, we need to be prepared for more lockdowns.”

There was great concern yesterday over eight cases which still had no identified source of acquisition. However, Victoria’s coronavirus response deputy secretary Kate Mason said a Roxburgh Park case had been linked to an outbreak at Glenroy West Primary School.
Ms Mason said Glenroy remained a “big focus” for health authorities, with 345 close contacts from that outbreak alone.
The state’s engagement program also carried out a record 1277 home visits on Saturday.
There have been 21 new local COVID-19 cases recorded in Victoria, with 11 of the cases in isolation during their infectious period.

Courtney Gould 4.30am: Canberra’s Covid-19 outbreak linked to Sydney
Canberra has recorded one new local case of Covid-19 as health authorities confirm the capital’s outbreak is linked to Sydney.
The new case is a close contact of a previously reported case. It brings the territory’s first cluster in more than in a year to seven active cases.
Health authorities confirmed the outbreak, which was sparked after a 27-year-old Gungahlin resident tested positive to the virus on Thursday, had genomic links to cases in Greater Sydney – though it is not yet known exactly how it crossed the border.
ACT Chief Minister Andrew Barr says the territory has recorded one new COVID-19 case which was a close contact of the previous cases, taking the number of active infections to seven.
Chief Minister Andrew Barr thanked Canberrans for coming out in large numbers to get tested. More than 4,500 tests were administered on Friday.
“To put some perspective on this, the total population of the ACT is a little over 430,000. So 4,500 tests in one day is more than 1 per cent of the population. That is a very big sample for surveillance,” he said.
Many ACT residents on Friday continued to experience severe delays at testing sites across Canberra. Health Minister Rachel Stephen-Smith said the government was working to ramp up operating hours but were conscious of the workload for the workforce.

Full text: Australia has just plunged into a new phase of formless free-floating panic – at the sheer uncertainty that faces us. It may be glimpsed in the faces of state and federal political leaders, and in their tone. The fear is starting to grow that there may be no end in sight. And who knows what levels of unease, and worse, are rising behind closed suburban doors across the eastern states, with the streets ominously empty once again.
On each turn on the pandemic road so far, hopes have proved illusory. Covid-19 is staying true to type – a slippery elusive monster that almost seems to delight in outwitting us humans, in mockery of our pride in scientific reason and technological ingenuity. Hope so far has fizzled out every time, in decisive rebuff.
The latest turn has been the hope for vaccine salvation. 2020 became focused on a vaccine being available by the end of the year, a vaccine that would quickly negate the virus threat. Now, eight months into 2021, and with majority populations vaccinated in a handful of countries, a new wave of uncertainty threatens. Israel, Singapore and Holland have opened up only to see rapid acceleration in infection numbers, followed by a growing threat to hospitals, forcing those countries to reimpose restrictions. The same is happening across the United States – Florida hospitals are full. Britain is being watched around the world with fascination, as it tries the same perilous experiment of staring down the virus monster, challenging it do its worst as the public begins to socialise freely.
A further dimension of uncertainty has been added with the Delta variant. The young who were, with earlier strains, seen to be relatively safe from the virus are now vulnerable. More are needing hospitalisation, some intensive care. And, serious for the longer term, the young are becoming prime carriers.
Learning to live with Covid, the futuristic sci-fi devil that became manifest, is tortuously difficult. Given future unknowns, it is not even clear what, in reality, the bleakest scenario might entail. Some degree of herd immunity will come. But even that is ambiguous. Many assume that once a person is vaccinated, they are safe. Multiply that up to 80 per cent of a total population then the virus is contained.
But a person vaccinated against, say, measles is more likely to catch measles in an unvaccinated population than an unvaccinated person in a predominantly vaccinated population. This means, to take the critical case, that an unvaccinated population of schoolchildren may become the next frontier of Covid infection, that is whenever most adults have been vaccinated. Combating the Delta variant in the short to medium term may necessitate home schooling becoming the norm rather than the exception.
Above all, what will come to constitute a tolerable level of herd immunity is likely to be a complex sum of vaccination patterns and sequences through all age groups, in combination with other types of immunity. This complex, viewed from today’s standpoint, is a perplexing unknown.
Many claim their rights are being infringed and that governments are cavalierly increasing their powers under the cloak of emergency. Surely, in answer, the liberal principle remains supreme: that individuals should be free to do whatever they choose unless their act harms others. Lockdown does curtail individual freedoms but does so in order to limit the widespread social harm of illness and death. Likewise, mass vaccination is justified in enabling herd immunity which will, in the end, work for the greater good.
One sign of the generalised social panic in the air is the flight by normally rational people to social media sites spreading sensationalist untruths about Covid and its prevention.
It is less clear how coercive a society should become in punishing the tens of thousands who flout prudent law to attend anti-lockdown demonstrations, or in enforcing vaccination among those who resist. In the end, how many of the hesitant get vaccinated will depend on social cohesion. The collective conscience proved strong in Victoria last year, reflected in high acceptance of lockdowns, and compliance, so I think we can be confident that 80 per cent of Australians will agree to vaccination. Science, smart management and common sense have proved our best tools in the current war. Victoria has handled its recent Covid outbreaks much better than in the past because of efficient QR codes, faster and higher volume contact tracing and testing, and a more refined quarantining system – it has learnt from past mistakes. It is only fair to acknowledge this, especially by those many commentators, including myself, who were critical of the Andrews government and its shambolic Health Department last year.
And, as a nation, we have benefited from the federation structure. It has been vindicated in this pandemic, with management functioning more efficiently on a smaller, more local scale, decentralised down to the states. Differences of opinion among the premiers have actually helped the public debate about alternative strategies in defending against Covid.
Science is not infallible. With pandemic anxiety triggering a rush to spurious certainty, it has itself shown irrationalities. ATAGI, in cutting back its AstraZeneca recommendation to those over 60 – the AZ vaccine which saved Britain – showed a bewildering inability to weigh up risk probabilities of vaccine versus infection. It behaved like a timid bureaucracy with no big picture vision.
Also, furious epidemiological modelling is proceeding to plot possible future infection paths and rates, with the federal government currently pinning some policy hopes on the results. Good luck with that! Mathematical modelling was used last year in the long Victorian lockdown with spectacular irrelevancy.
The greatest uncertainty of all, one that faces the entire globe, is the fear of virus mutation into a variant resistant to current vaccines – Professor Peter Doherty has recently voiced just such a worry. The mega-spread of Covid internationally brings significant threat of mutation. If so, what will follow Delta? And then, what will the delays be in discovering and producing new effective vaccines. Even with Delta, Israeli statistics are showing the Pfizer vaccine less effective in limiting its spread. And on, and on, cycling out into the distant future, magnifying uncertainty.
There have been modest positives. After 18 months of sparring with the virus, grandstanding commentary has become wearisome. We still hear cries of outrage about lockdowns, and their excessive limits on individual freedom, business viability, children’s education, and mental health. But we know, faced with the slippery virus monster, as surely now as night follows day that there is no alternative to lockdown. Those distressed may storm up and down, stamp the feet, even cry out, but they need to grit their teeth and accept what is.
We also know that political decision-making has been devilishly difficult. Perhaps the main Melbourne lockdown last year went longer than necessary, and Victoria would have been better off then with the softer touch of the NSW Premier.
Almost certainly, Sydney would have been better off currently with the firmer hand of Daniel Andrews at the wheel, with his more authoritarian go-hard, go-early disposition. Indeed, Gladys Berejiklian’s soft touch has turned into dithering – globally proven to be disastrous with Covid. On a third front, the federal government was forced last year into rushed juggling of different vaccine options and was unlucky. Probably, it should have moved with greater urgency on Pfizer this year, and its messaging has been haphazard and poor. The Prime Minister himself, understandably eager to provide a timetable, has valiant hopes that the country will be 70 per cent vaccinated by the end of the year. Whether or not he achieves that goal, the leading truth about government in this country, in these pandemic times, is the old cliche that it’s easy to be wise after the event.
Sydney has no foreseeable end to its current lockdown, one which could well extend for months. It might come to learn, as Melbourne might have last year, from Joseph Conrad’s allegory of life suddenly stopped in its tracks. In his novella The Shadow Line, a young captain finds purpose in life as he takes command of a sailing ship in Bangkok. But all his eager ambition is thwarted by a lack of wind. He just manages to get the ship out to sea, precipitated by his own restlessness and the tropical fever that is spreading among his crew. Becalmed for an interminable 14 days adrift in cloying tropical heat, the atmosphere on board becomes fetid, with the chief mate going mad and all the crew, apart from one, falling sick and becoming useless.
Conrad draws the conclusion that in such a state of personal and social stagnation everybody should enter into a searching intimacy with their own self. To learn not to be faint-hearted. To be able to stand up to bad luck, mistakes, and their own conscience. Face-to-face with themselves and their fate, the recommendation is for realism, honesty and resilience, if the person has it in them. Life becalmed in shutdown, long or short, with the outside bleak and motionless, and new opportunity and hope closed off, the future unknown, may require its own searching intimacy with the self. And a long patience. We are at a point with Covid of having to live with uncertainty – a social state without precedent over the last eighty years. It is now futile to behave like the nervous traveller, who has eyes only on the destination. Or the obsessive person, wanting to chart the steps on the life path, in order to tick them off one by one, as if that is living. Such devotion to fruitless, abstract planning can only aggravate incipient psychopathology. Wise advice today might rather suggest: enjoy the journey as best as you can, make the most of it, unlike the bushwalkers whose minds are so focused on the mountain peak ahead they forget to take in the view along the way. In any case, our peak keeps disappearing from view and shifting.
The craving for order and certainty is strange in a species troubled by its own mortality, troubled to the degree that all its religions focus on finding a meaning for death, that there be more to it than dust and ashes. With death, that one ultimate and inescapable human necessity, the timing is usually quite uncertain. Further, to know in advance when the grim reaper will finally strike would be a curse that could well paralyse the life. Much better to live blithely, in ignorance. In this domain, uncertainty is a blessing.
Of course, the fact that Covid-19 triggers fears of acute illness and death changes things. It threatens to bring forward the final date, lifting the saving veil of uncertainty. So, a kind of metaphysical equation is scripted, in hope: predictability and safety in the foreseeable future, that is certainty now, in order to protect the nature and timing of the unforeseeable final departure, including its mystery. The pandemic continues to scoff at all such equations. We seem mere playthings in a new normal, one in which uncertainty prevails and Covid is master.

Full text: As Health Minister Greg Hunt pleads with Australians who have elderly parents to “save mum or dad’s life” by getting them vaccinated, Chief Medical Officer Professor Paul Kelly said it’s time to further target Covid-19 stricken areas with more mobile and pop-up vaccine options.
Two new deputy chief health officers have also been appointed to assist the Commonwealth, including a particular focus on developing an ongoing national contact tracing plan to enable Australia to live with the virus.
While Prof Kelly said a door-to-door vaccination service was a “bit of a stretch” at the moment, making accessing jabs “as easy as possible” was critical.
NED-4235-Australias-Vaccine-Rollout-Timeline
“That would be part of what I was referring to as a circuit breaker, let’s look at the different ways of doing exactly that,” he said.
“We know vaccination, while it’s not going to stop the outbreak, will certainly help.”
Prof Kelly said the transmission potential of the delta variant in Sydney would decrease “every time … a person gets vaccinated”.
“We need to look at ways that we can make that as accessible as possible, to particularly in those (south west Sydney) areas.”
Prof Kelly will also meet with health experts on Monday to develop clinical guidance for use of a new monoclonal antibody drug Sotrovimab, which Australia has purchased for use treating Covid-19 pending Therapeutic Goods Administration (TGA) approval.
“I’m starting a process this week with clinical colleagues to look at clinical guidelines,” he said.
“This medicine is not for everybody, it is an antibody (that) will be mostly aimed at people that are not vaccinated, it will be mostly for people who are at highest risk of severe disease, and it needs to be given early in the treatment.”
Prof Kelly said he was closely monitoring all global researchers developing treatments for Covid-19.
“The real game changer for this will be, when we have a normal pill like we do for … influenza … to people early in the illness or even indeed to prevent illness,” he said.
“That pill does not exist at the moment in the world.”

Prof Kelly said as soon as medicines are developed and “shown to be useful” in treating Covid-19, health officials would work to make them available in Australia.
“But at the moment we have these (Sotrovimab) antibodies,” he said.
Mr Hunt said the loss of life in NSW due to Covid-19 was “tragic” and it was important to note, no fully vaccinated person had lost their lives during the pandemic in Australia.
“What that message says, in particular on focusing on children with parents over 70 … it can save mum’s life or dad’s life,” he said.
Mr Hunt urged families with a loved one in aged care to consider giving their consent for their relative to be vaccinated.
“We don’t want mum or dad to die in agony,” he said.
“We don’t want them to die alone.”
Mr Hunt also announced the appointment of two additional deputy chief health officers in Australia.
Former Queensland deputy chief health officer Sonya Bennett will oversee a national strategy for contact tracing, while GP Steph Davis will focus on mental health and vaccine modelling.
Dr Davis said even Australia reaches vaccination rates of 70 and 80 per cent, modelling by the Doherty Institute showed an ongoing testing and tracing capacity would be needed to live with the virus.
“We’re still going to need contract tracing, testing surveillance, all of that is going to be going for a while to make sure that we can keep the virus at (manageable) levels,” she said.

Full text: Health authorities have warned Victoria faces rising coronavirus case numbers as it emerged an extra 150,000 Pfizer doses were on their way after ­intervention by Prime Minister Scott Morrison.
Victoria has recorded 29 new local cases, with contact tracers scrambling to get on top of the latest outbreak that has sparked a seven-day lockdown.
All of the new cases are linked to previously reported cases and were not in isolation during their infectious period.
Several Werribee supermarkets were listed as exposure sites on Saturday afternoon, forcing many shoppers into self-isolation.
Tier 2 sites include: Woolworths Werribee from 5.45pm to 6.35pm on August 4, ALDI Werribee from 6pm to 6.40pm on August 4, and Coles Werribee from 6.20pm to 7pm on August 4.
The state government holds serious concerns the virus may have already escaped the western suburbs, with the pandemic’s testing commander, Jeroen Weimar, warning the number of exposure sites will continue to rise.
“We did not go into lockdown because we were worried about a few cases in the western suburbs,” he said. “We are worried about a Delta penetration again here in Victoria.
“We’re worried that it might be seeding out quite widely; we’re worried it might be going to places we haven’t yet seen.”
Meanwhile, NSW has recorded 319 cases; its biggest spike since the outbreak started. Nearly 200 of them are still under investigation.
Premier Daniel Andrews said there was arguably “nothing more important” than people getting tested as soon as they showed symptoms.
“That’s how we shut this down,” Mr Andrews said.
“This is very, very significant to see this many cases … There is a certainty that there are more cases out there.”
It comes as the Premier warns of the rapidly moving nature of the Delta variant.
“This will go where the vaccine isn’t,” he said.
“Our system will be overrun if we don’t bring this under control.
“We have it within us to continue to do this work, as tough and gruelling as it is, none of us have the luxury of pretending that this is over.”
He said every Victorian had a role to play in bringing the outbreak to ground.
“I just ask that everyone just pauses and think about the choices you’re making, and whether they are contributing to the spread of the virus, or whether they are helping us to stop the spread of the virus. That’s a pretty simple question to answer,” he said.
Testing commander Jeroen Weimar said genomic testing for the two clusters had not found a match to any other clusters in Victoria or across Australia.
“We are doing ongoing matching with other Australian states. It is very closely associated with the New South Wales cluster and with the city of Hume and other clusters we have worked on here in Victoria there is a close commonality of a Delta strain … but more genomic work is being done. We don’t yet have an absolute match,” he said.
Mr Weimar said two of today’s new cases were old infections and may later be declared not to be of concern.
“They relate to two family members of the city of Maribyrnong case who travelled from Sydney hotel quarantine and returned to Victoria on July 15,” he said.
A Flemington public housing tower has been added to the list of Tier 2 exposure sites after eight members of the same family tested positive.
The family has since been relocated to alternative accommodation.
It is one of the towers plunged into a hard lockdown last year during Victoria’s deadly second wave.
Mr Weimar said of the three quarters of the close contacts of the Al-Taqwa case had returned negative results, as had three quarters of the contacts of Newport Football Club and Spectacle Hub in Caroline Springs.
Vic Locally-acquired Covid-19About 72 per cent of the primary close contacts linked to Wolf Cafe & Eatery in Altona North had also returned negative results, he said.
“I thank the school leadership at Al-Taqwa College and the school community for the active support. We have seen a very busy testing hub with 594 tests done at the college yesterday and over 600 vaccinations at the vaccination hub there over the last two days,” Mr Weimar said.
Mr Andrews said while it was good news the cases were linked, there were still questions over the source of the latest outbreak.
“We’ve got a couple of mystery cases that drive each of the two separate chains of transmission,” he said.
“We simply can’t work out where they got it from. That means that there’s at least two other people out there, and potentially more than that, who have the virus and have given the virus to the people.”
He said investigations had revealed there had been a “bit of visiting going on”, despite restrictions.
But he said that wasn’t limited to just one postcode or multicultural group, adding he thought people across the state were breaching restrictions.
“Of the other people across Melbourne and Victoria who were doing some visiting on the sly thinking that it is all innocent and sly, they got lucky. They didn’t spread it. Others have not been so fortunate,” he said.

HOW THE NEW CASES ARE LINKED MARIBYRNONG CLUSTER
Four new cases all family members of the index case, including two people who flew into Melbourne from Sydney hotel quarantine on July 15 on flight QF445.
HOBSONS BAY CLUSTER
25 new cases, including:
• 1 family member of the index case
• 4 people linked to Spectacle Hub in Caroline Springs including a worker, customer and two contacts
• 1 Newport Football Club player
• 1 case linked to Australian Islamic College of Melbourne
• 1 linked to Wolf Cafe & Eatery in Altona North
• 15 linked to Al-Taqwa College, including 1 teacher and 14 students

FLEMINGTON TOWER ON ALERT — AGAIN Ruth Eyakem, a resident and health concierge at the Flemington tower exposure site, said communication from the health department had improved significantly from last year’s hard lockdown.
“Any order that comes from the government without police or force, we’re happy to do it,” she said.
“The last year with the police was a disaster … you don’t need to treat us like prisoners.”
Ms Eyakem received a text message from the Health Department on Saturday morning alerting her the entire building had been identified as a Tier 2 site.
She emphasised the need for consultation in responding to outbreaks among diverse communities.
“They [health authorities] should research and contact our community leaders,” she said.
Younger people had been a key part in keeping residents up to date with the latest health advice, she said.
“A lot of our kids are very educated and working in the community. Our kids help us a lot,” she said.

VACCINE ROLLOUT TO RAMP UP Victoria’s vaccine rollout will ramp up dramatically in coming days after the federal government decided to send the state an extra 150,000 Pfizer doses before the end of the month. This will see the state’s Pfizer vaccine jabs top half a million a month for the first time in August.
It follows a decision last month to release an extra 150,000 Pfizer doses to locked-down NSW from reserve supplies held by the Commonwealth. Victoria was scheduled to get about 400,000 doses this month but will now get an extra 150,000 starting from August 13. It was meant to get 550,000 Pfizer doses a month starting in September.
Mr Morrison communicated the offer to Premier Daniel Andrews on Friday evening.
“I will always work closely with Dan Andrews and our Premiers to make sure Australians are protected in their time of need,” he said.
NED-3889-Melbourne-lockdown-restrictions
The state opposition called on the government to change its approach to lockdowns, to instead shut down hot spots rather than the entire state.
“The government needs to be a lot more targeted and a lot fairer to people living in areas where there’s no Covid,” opposition leader Michael O’Brien said. “This is too important. We can’t keep living like this.”
The vaccine supply breakthrough comes as authorities were forced to admit “possible” unauthorised home visits had occurred and may have contributed to the virus spreading.
But the government stood by its stance that rulebreakers would not be fined or publicly shamed, despite anti-lockdown protesters being told they would face justice.
“We are not going to win this by turning on each other or by fining our way through,” Mr Weimar said.
VICTORIA'S LATEST COVID CASES
Victoria recorded six new locally acquired cases on Friday, all linked to reported cases in the Hobsons Bay and Maribyrnong outbreaks but none were in quarantine throughout their infectious period.
Genomic sequencing confirmed both clusters carried the highly infectious Delta strain, but the initial source of transmission for both clusters remained a mystery.
Three new cases are linked to the Maribyrnong cluster, the other three – including two announced on Thursday – to Hobsons Bay.
A dedicated public health team, charged with responding to outbreaks in “sensitive settings”, is supporting the Warringa Park specialist school community after it was revealed one new case attended the Hoppers Crossing facility.
Another case, a man who lives with the Maribyrnong case, was a cleaner at Epworth Hospital in Richmond, but in the administration area and not on a general ward.
Mr Morrison also warned that bosses wanting to force their workers to get vaccinated would need to comply with federal discrimination legislation after national cabinet decided against setting hard-and-fast rules about who could be ordered to get the jab.
He said the question of what bosses were allowed to do would turn on the question of reasonableness, such as where employees were in “regular contact” with the public.
National cabinet has “fully agreed” to live with the virus once 70 per cent of the population is vaccinated, under the Doherty Institute’s modelling, which should mean lockdowns are limited to isolated occasions and abandoned when the country reaches 80 per cent.
Meanwhile, almost 100,000 struggling businesses will have cash payments automatically paid to them under a jointly funded $400m support package announced on Friday.
Another $2800 grant will be deposited to 90,000 businesses, while almost 9000 hospitality venues will receive another round of funding between $5000 and $20,000.
An extra $54m will be added to the small business Covid hardship fund, which provides grants of up to $8000 for small businesses not eligible in other schemes which have experienced a 70 per cent reduction in turnover.

COVID CASES LINKED TO MORE SCHOOLS In a newsletter sent to families on Friday night, Islamic College of Melbourne in Tarneit principal Dr Abdul M. Kamareddine said the South East Public Health Unit was investigating a confirmed case of coronavirus that attended the college in July.
“We have been advised that as the Public Health Unit could not identify an exact time the case was infectious, all staff, visitors and students are considered close contacts,” Dr Kamareddine said.
He said the school would close until further notice to enable a risk assessment and undergo an environmental clean.
“Unfortunately this means we will be unable to offer on school site supervision as of Monday, August 9.”
Deoples COVID-19 Victorian Exposure Sites TableMeanwhile, a confirmed case of Covid-19 has also been reported at Kororoit Creek Primary School and its kindergarten in Burnside Heights.
In a newsletter sent to families on Friday evening, Acting principal Alan Noye advised the school was closed to all students and community members until further notice while the Department of Health conducts its investigation.
“The site is now closed to all students, staff and community members until further notice. This means no on-site supervision will be available,” the newsletter said.
Healthdale Christian College’s Werribee campus and Warringa Park School’s Warringa Crescent campus in Hoppers Crossing have also been linked to positive cases and are listed as Tier 2 exposure sites, while Al-Taqwa College in Truganina is a Tier 1 site after a teacher at the school tested positive for Covid.

All the ways Covid has changed us culturally

Full text: Across the Western world, the public has for decades been losing faith in government and government institutions. This has resulted in a relentless quest for non-political institutional authority that governments can deploy in convincing the public.
I don’t mean necessarily convincing the public of the utility of particular policy measures but just convincing them of the broad contours of reality. In the first part of the Covid outbreak the chief medical officer of Australia, and his counterparts, the chief health officers in the states, had automatic credibility. They were sober folks, not playing in the ego and celebrity lanes that politicians occupy, and they knew what they were talking about.
But as the crisis wore on, their authority has eroded. This is mostly unfair. One of the central features of Covid is that no one, no one at all, can accurately predict what will happen. No one can guess with assurance how the virus will mutate, what other countries will do, how effective vaccines will be and for how long.
But the health officials’ loss of credibility is a bit their own fault, too. Innocent of the vices of celebrity but also its subtle temptations and countless traps, some of them became too smug and happy at their own status as players in the game of politics. The worst moment for them all, and in my view perhaps the most irresponsible statement by any senior official in the whole Covid saga, was when Queensland’s Jeannette Young, in a blatant slap at Scott Morrison, said young people “might die” if they had the AstraZeneca vaccine.
Non-political authority and credibility, in our vitriolic and hyper-partisan public culture, is an immensely valuable asset. Those who, for whatever reason, possess it are frankly fools if they throw it away needlessly. Once it’s lost, it’s very hard to recover.
At the same time, there have been irresponsible campaigns waged against health bureaucrats and officials simply because they are not infallible. On Covid, no one is infallible.
The Doherty Institute, partly because of the genuine high quality of its work, but also partly through happenstance, is almost uniquely fitted to hold and project public credibility. First, its work is genuinely world class.
Second, in this highly personalised media age, it is associated with a captivating individual, Peter Doherty. He is a Nobel prizewinner, which, translating broadly, makes him for the public roughly the equivalent of a 100m freestyle Olympic gold medallist who also broke a world record. On top of that, Doherty’s manner is that of a knockabout Aussie bloke. That’s the way we like our heroes.
The Doherty Institute guards its reputation. Its senior personnel, such as the estimable Jodie McVernon, will talk to the media to help educate them but will avoid topics on which Doherty is engaged in not yet finalised research, and will resolutely refuse to be political. That is a very smart discipline, much as we journalists love the maverick pontificator.
Once, the Christian churches, the judiciary, even the police all had non-political moral authority. But they have all been dimin­ished or politicised in different ways. Governments are often guilty in this. To take an overseas example, before the Brexit referendum the British government convinced the UK Treasury to predict that if Brexit won there would be an immediate, severe recession. Brexit duly won, but there was no recession. So Treasury advice was seen as politicised baloney and its credibility with the British people is diminished, probably forever.
Very often it’s advice given in the interests of what is seen as a moral cause that does the most damage. There are countless Australian examples. Many elements of the federal climate bureaucracy have for years and years been massively overstating what the Chinese government has done, or even undertaken, to combat climate change to convince Australians that we are laggards. But – and this distinction is crucial – it is one thing to be sensibly sceptical about exaggerated claims in politicised advice. It is another thing altogether to come to the nihilistic view that nothing any government agency says can ever be trusted. That is an extremely dangerous and profoundly mistaken view for a sizable minority of the community to adopt.
Thus one of the very worst cultural outcomes of Covid in Western societies is that elements of the paranoid right are becoming indistinguishable from elements of the nutty left in their disconnection from reality and their willingness to break the law and encourage violence in demonstrations. Covid should be uniting us as we face a common enemy in the virus, but it is dividing us instead. This happened 100 years ago in the Spanish flu as well.
It is said that no country handles adversity better than Australia, but no country handles good fortune as poorly. Overall, we have had, until this NSW outbreak, good fortune in this pandemic, by international stand­ards. Our Covid death rate has been among the world’s lowest and most of the time, except for the limits on international travel, we have led a relatively normal life.
But quite soon, notwithstanding the tremendous hope in vaccination, life will likely get harder, not easier. I have the greatest possible respect for the Doherty Institute, but all modelling is extremely fallible. The institute is doing good work to educate us to realise we need 70 per cent of eligible adults vaccinated and ongoing social distancing measures of considerable significance to keep Covid deaths at the level of a very bad flu season.
In truth, the evidence of Florida and Britain and numerous other much-vaccinated jurisdictions, while not directly comparable and involving somewhat lower vaccination rates than Doherty proposes, is not altogether encouraging. Moreover, the virus could mutate to become both more contagious and more deadly than Delta, just as Delta is more contagious and more deadly than previous strains.
We could have the maximum practical vaccination rate of 70 or even 80 per cent, and still, quite plausibly, face thousands and thousands of Covid deaths and extreme stress on the health system. That’s not an argument for permanent lockdown. It is an argument for understanding there are no guarantees, the Covid future is intensely uncertain and at some point we will probably have to face up to a lot of Covid deaths compared with our run so far. That means there are big cultural adjustments ahead. I hope we’re up to it.

Full text: Despite Doherty strategy for inoculating young people who are ‘peak transmitters’, Lieutenant-General John Frewen says mRNA supplies are not yet available
A NSW man in his 20s was one of two Covid deaths recorded today among 233 new cases as health authorities scramble to find infections in the Newcastle and Hunter areas after sewage testing detected viral fragments.
Queensland has recorded 16 new cases of Covid-19, prompting the cancellation of Brisbane’s Ekka public holiday next Wednesday.
Greg Brown 11.30pm: Plan B to target the reluctant
Targeted advertising campaigns and incentive programs for groups of Australians most hesitant to be vaccinated will be rolled out if the nation stalls on its plan to reach an inoculation rate of more than 80 per cent.
Lieutenant General John Frewen, the head of the vaccination rollout, said his strategy would evolve “as we become more aware of exactly who is hesitant or where the hesitancy is”.
“Then we need to start tailoring campaigns for that. And that will be part information, it may be part convenience of vaccination, it could well be incentives,” he said.
With the government moving to encourage 20-39 year olds to get the jab, General Frewen said Australians under 40 could now get an AstraZeneca jab from a pharmacist without consulting a general practitioner.
“You will get a very similar informed consent process and if pharmacists are concerned in any way, they may refer people on to a GP if they need to get any additional advice,” he said.
“We have onboarded 1000 pharmacists. We have already got 250 pharmacists administering AstraZeneca and more and more of them are going to come on now.
“We have been prioritising affected government areas in Sydney, so we are just shy of 50 pharmacists there already doing AstraZeneca.

Yoni Bashan 10.45pm: Delays and long waits hinder NSW jabs rollout
NSW vaccination rates have recorded only a modest uptick since Gladys Berejiklian called for an increase over the month of ­August, with progress being ­stifled by lengthy waiting periods at some clinics and access points, confusing residents and causing them to delay getting a jab.
The state recorded more than 84,000 vaccinations on Tuesday, according to figures released by the federal government, only slightly higher than the 82,000 doses reported on Sunday – with the increases reported mostly at GP clinics and primary care sites managed by the commonwealth.
At state-run vaccination hubs, daily inoculation rates have remained relatively unchanged in recent days, hovering between 24,000 and 26,000 doses, as they have since late July.
According to numerous accounts provided to The Australian, people seeking vaccinations through a GP or medical centre have experienced lengthy delays across the city, with bookings for AstraZeneca requiring six to eight weeks of waiting in some regions.
Health officials insisted operations remained efficient at state-run vaccination hubs, with delays of no more than a few days, although they said people seeking AstraZeneca may be eschewing this option to discuss the vaccine with their doctor.

Joseph Lam 10pm: Health workers isolated after colleague infected
About 30 healthcare workers are now in isolation after a staff member at a Sydney hospital tested positive for Covid-19.
The worker at St George Private Hospital in Kogarah, about 15km from the CBD, tested positive to the virus on Wednesday after working while potentially infectious on Monday, according to the Daily Telegraph.
“Any additional identified close and casual contacts will be advised today,” hospital chief executive Peter Ridley wrote in a letter to staff.
“They should wear a surgical mask when leaving their home to be tested and self-isolate for 14 days or until advised by the Public Health Unit.”
The hospital has begun deep cleaning across operating theatres, bathrooms and common areas.
Other staff not in isolation have been told to monitor for symptoms, to maintain social distancing during meal breaks, to maintain hygiene and to clean “high touch surfaces”.

Jess Malcolm 9.15pm: Year 12s opting out of Pfizer offer in protest
The Berejiklian government’s vaccination push for Year 12 students is in danger of being derailed by high levels of vaccination hesitancy among the cohort, coupled with a large number of students opting against the jab in protest against the HSC ­examinations.
The indications of significant hesitancy by students come as new Doherty Institute modelling released on Tuesday found vaccination of young people was a key component needed to move away from lockdowns, with young ­people being the cohort most likely to transmit the virus.
Nearly 20,000 Year 12 students from Sydney’s eight hardest hit areas are scheduled to be vaccinated with Pfizer from Monday as the NSW government pushes to return them to face-to-face learning in time for their exams.
An informal survey conducted among Year 12 students suggests many of those eligible may choose not to have the jab.
A survey of 4507 students within a private Year 12 Facebook group with more than 36,000 members found 40 per cent of respondents would not take up the offer for the Pfizer vaccine.
By comparison, an Australian Bureau of Statistics survey released earlier this month found 73 per cent of Australians would get a Covid-19 vaccine when it was available and recommended for them; just 11 per cent said they would not get one.
Vaccine hesitant responses littered several separate posts in the group, with students raising questions over its efficacy and safety.

Joseph Lam 8.05pm: Police warning on masks
NSW Police have issued a strong message for those who falsely claim to be exempt from wearing a mask, warning false declarations could result in imprisonment of up to five years.
Although mask-wearing rules had changed recently, compliance is not up for negotiation, said Deputy Commissioner Metropolitan Field Operations Malcolm Lanyon.
“Clearly the rules now state that people need to abide by the mask wearing requirements of the Public Health Orders unless they have an exemption. That exemption can be in the form of either a medical certificate or people are able to carry a statutory declaration,” he said.
When asked, all residents with a mask exemption must produce it
“If police ask to see the exemption people are required to present that documentation, and we will investigate all exemptions,” Mr Lanyon said.
“Make no mistake, police are investigators by trade. If we have any reasonable doubt that a document may be false, we can and will investigate these matters thoroughly to bring people before the courts.”
Residents found guilty of making a false declaration can be charged under The Oaths Act 1900 and be liable of up to five years imprisonment.

David Penberthy 7.30pm: Pubs cry foul as footy crowds grow
South Australia’s health bureaucrats have been accused of double standards after allowing a 15,000-strong crowd for this Saturday’s AFL clash at the Adelaide Oval while local businesses face collapse due to punishing restrictions.
As of Wednesday night capacity limits were increased from just 25 per cent to 50 per cent at pubs and clubs as SA creeps slowly out of last week’s seven-day lockdown.
But hospitality businesses say that even with the increase they are struggling to survive and are urging a return to 75 per cent.
Their anger erupted when it emerged that SA Health and the Adelaide Oval’s Stadium Management Authority had signed off on a 15,000 crowd for the traditional “Showdown” between Port Adelaide and the Adelaide Crows this weekend.
Duke of Brunswick publican Simone Douglas wrote an open letter on behalf of the 120-member Hospo Owners Collective representing city entertainment venues saying the SA Government needed to realise businesses were on the brink of collapse.
She said that the withdrawal of JobKeeper and the limiting of SA government assistance to the seven days of the lockdown meant pubs like hers were teetering.
Taking aim at the state’s Covid Transition Committee, Ms Douglas said the actual impact of the lockdown and ongoing restrictions was not understood by those managing the pandemic.

Greg Brown 6.45pm: Bid to boost renewable agency fails
A push by Labor and the Greens to overturn regulations that broaden the investment remit of the renewable energy agency has failed.
The disallowance motion pushed in the Senate was tied 15 each, with One Nation siding with the government in backing taxpayer investment in hydrogen and carbon capture and storage technologies.
Opposition energy spokesman Chris Bowen on Monday told caucus that Labor should oppose ARENA being used for anything other than renewables.
His position was backed by most Labor MPs but faced opposition from Hunter MP Joel Fitzgibbon, who declared it was “poor policy and poor politics”.
The regulations — which had to be rewritten after Labor, the Greens and the crossbench in June vetoed the government’s initial plans — include a provision to invest in carbon capture and storage, battery storage and hydrogen made from gas.
There is a funding increase of $192.5m under the government’s rules.
Joseph Lam 6.35pm: Supermax prison in lockdown
The home of Australia’s most notorious criminals is locked down after a corrective services officer who transported inmates to the centre tested positive for Covid-19.
The Goulburn Correctional Centre, home of Australia’s supermaximum security prison, has been placed into a precautionary lockdown and several inmates are now in isolation.
“The officer had attended the centre briefly today while transporting inmates to the centre. These inmates have been placed into isolation and will be tested for Covid-19 as a precaution,” a Corrective Services spokeswoman told The Daily Telegraph.
“The CSNSW Covid Command Post is working with the centre to ensure all precautions are taken,” she said.

AFP 6.15pm: Boffin Barbie: toy creator honours vaccine co-creator
Toy giant Mattel hopes to “inspire the next generation” after creating a model of its iconic Barbie doll in honour of Sarah Gilbert, co-creator of the Oxford/AstraZeneca coronavirus vaccine.
Professor Gilbert said she found the news “very strange” but hoped “children who see my Barbie will realise how vital careers in science are to help the world around us”.
“My wish is that my doll will show children careers they may not be aware of, like a vaccinologist,” she said.
The toy company created models in honour of five other women in the sciences: US healthcare workers Amy O’Sullivan and Audrey Cruz, Canadian campaigner Chika Stacy Oriuwa, Brazilian researcher Jaqueline Goes de Jesus, and Australian medic Kirby White.
“Barbie recognises that all frontline workers have made tremendous sacrifices when confronting the pandemic and the challenges it heightened,” said Lisa McKnight, senior vice president of Barbie and dolls at Mattel.
“To shine a light on their efforts, we are sharing their stories and leveraging Barbie’s platform to inspire the next generation to take after these heroes and give back.
“Our hope is to nurture and ignite the imaginations of children playing out their own storyline as heroes.”

AFP 5.30pm: Macau orders testing after first cases in 16 months
Macau has ordered compulsory coronavirus testing for all residents after a family of four was found to be carrying the Delta variant, breaking the city’s record of over 16 months virus-free.
Over the next three days authorities plan to test all 680,000 residents at 41 testing centres, the government said on Wednesday.
The testing is one of a host of new measures announced after the gambling hub recorded 491 days without a single local infection.
Authorities are investigating whether the daughter of the family contracted the virus on a flight from Zhuhai to Xi’an in mainland China last month, Macau’s leader Ho Iat-seng said on Wednesday.
The same flight carried two other infected people from Nanjing, the centre of a Delta-variant outbreak in China that has led to more than 300 new cases across 15 provinces and cities in two weeks.
Long queues formed on Wednesday morning outside testing centres and the city’s health app crashed, local media reported.
Macau has adopted mainland China’s health app, which rates infection risk, tracks movement and generates test and vaccination records.
“I have to say sorry to all residents,” Ho said.
Macau has kept infections low by closing itself off from the rest of the world for much of the pandemic and placing restrictions on arrivals from mainland China.
It has recorded only 60 cases and no deaths.
But the zero-Covid strategy has come with deep economic costs for the only place in China where gambling is allowed.
Macau’s casinos account for about 80 per cent of government revenue. The city ordered a shutdown of all casinos for two weeks when the virus was first detected last year, causing a loss of $US937m ($1.26bn), according to an estimate by the University of Macau.
Revenues have climbed this year as some of the border restrictions with mainland China were relaxed but they remain well below pre-pandemic levels

Rachel Baxendale 4.46pm: Melbourne teacher tests positive to Covid-19
Victoria’s latest Covid-19 case is in a teacher at the Melbourne Islamic school which was linked to 113 Covid-19 cases at the height of Victoria’s second wave.
Al-Taqwa College in the outer southwestern suburb Truganina wrote to parents on Wednesday afternoon, telling them the school would close immediately after a teacher had tested positive.
The letter says the department has directed all staff, students and their households to isolate and get tested immediately.
Thursday is set to be a student free day at the school, with only classes to resume on Friday and continue until further notice.
Meanwhile, the health department has issued a Tier 2 exposure site alert for Coles Yarraville, in Melbourne’s inner west, between 4.30pm and 5.30pm last Thursday July 29.
Earlier, the department confirmed that an investigation into a new case was underway.
“The Department of Health is investigating a confirmed case and will provide more information shortly,” a departmental spokeswoman said shortly after 3pm.
The new case comes after Victoria recorded its first “zero day” of no locally-acquired cases on Wednesday, for the first time since the state’s fifth lockdown.
Matthew Denholm 4.24pm: Vaccine passports, incentives ‘a slippery slope’
Former federal Liberal minister Eric Abetz has broken ranks to attack the concept of vaccine passports and freedom incentives as “dangerous” and a “slippery slope”.
The Tasmanian Senator, a minister in the Howard and Abbott governments, warned against the erosion of medical privacy and personal freedom.
“I encourage everyone to consider getting vaccinated as soon as possible, however once 100 per cent of the population has had the opportunity to be fully vaccinated, lockdowns and all restrictions should be a thing of the past and vaccine passports should not be a blunt instrument to force people to be vaccinated by locking them out of society,” Senator Abetz said on Wednesday.
“Denied or limited access to government and private businesses goods and services should not be based on one’s medical status and the idea of a domestic ‘vaccine passport’ is a dangerous one that can create a class of citizens.
“The question then becomes, and which no-one seems willing to discuss, is how far do the authorities go to restrict these freedoms? How many vaccinations and booster shots or other medical procedures will be required on a person’s vaccine passport to allow them to participate as full citizens? This is a slippery slope. Once the genie is out of the bottle, there will be no turning back and freedom will be seriously compromised.”
Paul Garvey 4.21pm: WA FIFO worker returns ‘very weak’ positive
Western Australia will scale up its Covid-19 testing centres after a fly-in fly-out mine worker was found to potentially be carrying the virus.
Premier Mark McGowan on Wednesday said the man had returned a “very, very weak” positive test result and had been active in the community for the past week.
The man was at Perth Airport on 20 July, the same day as a Queensland man who later tested positive for Covid-19 arrived at the airport.
The FIFO worker has already returned a negative test since returning the weak positive. His girlfriend and three of his closest work contacts have also tested negative.
In a further twist, the man had also previously had the virus in March and April last year.
While there are no additional restrictions as a result of the latest case, WA health minister Roger Cook said anyone who was showing symptoms or had been to an exposure site should get tested.
“There’s no reason to think this will lead to a lockdown but it is a cause for concern,” he said.
The man had been asymptomatic throughout the period of his possible infection.
Mr McGowan said the man had been mainly in the areas of Greenwood and Fremantle while potentially infectious.
“We’re scaling up our testing centres so people who are feeling unwell, or people who have been at any of the potential exposure sites can go and get themselves tested as soon as possible,” he said.
Jared Lynch 3.45pm: Online fee shock for shoppers in lockdown
Retail giants Kmart and Target are charging shoppers click and collect fees during lockdown, despite stores being only opened to fulfil online and pick-up orders at Covid-19 hotspots.
Meanwhile other major retailers, including Woolworths-owned rival Big W, are operating pick-up services free.
In one case, Kmart slugged a pregnant woman a $3 click and click fee on a $9 pair of maternity leggings which equates to 30 per cent price hike.
The company said it was continuing to charge a $3 fee on click and collect orders totalling less than $20 to cover “part of the cost for our team members to individually pick, pack and store your order”.

Rachel Baxendale 3.16pm: Infection emerges in Victoria after earlier zero recording
No sooner was Victoria celebrating its first day with no locally-acquired coronavirus cases, than a new one emerged.
The state’s health department has confirmed on Wednesday afternoon that an investigation into a new case is underway.
“The Department of Health is investigating a confirmed case and will provide more information shortly,” a departmental spokeswoman said.
The fact that the case is being investigated appears to indicate that no link to known outbreaks has been immediately identified.

Max Maddison 2.53pm: PM rubbishes ‘Anthony’s idea’ of cash for vax
Scott Morrison has continued his broadside against Labor’s vaccination cash incentive plan, as he pins the policy on Anthony Albanese .
Since the $6 billion plan’s fruition on Monday, the Morrison government has attacked the idea as being unnecessary, and representative of the opposition’s profligate spending.
The Prime Minister used a question from the Opposition Leader during question time on Wednesday afternoon about the advice of the chief medical officer Paul Kelly to continue his assault on Labor.
“This is a policy that has been put forward by the Leader of the Opposition, which is ill considered, which is ill informed, that is ill disciplined. This is a policy that he has not sought to consult on, not sought to take proper advice on,” Mr Morrison said.
“I note that those opposite, to quote them, referred to this as Anthony’s idea. That’s how they referred to it.”
Earlier on Wednesday, Covid-19 vaccination commander Lieutenant-General John Frewen revealed all incentive options were being explored to help vaccinate resistant cohorts of the Australian population. Mr Albanese used the comments to question the federal government’s resistance to the idea.
But Mr Morrison rubbished the suggestion, saying Lieutenant-General Frewen was not recommending paying $4.2 billion to people who had already received the vaccine.

Ellie Dudley 2.33pm: Covid victim a 27-year-old forklift driver
A 27-year-old forklift driver has been revealed as the young man who died overnight after contracting Covid-19 in south west Sydney.
Aude Alaskar passed out at the Liverpool apartment he shared with his wife on Tuesday and was unable to be revived by paramedics, The Daily Telegraph reported.
Prior to his death, Mr Alaskar had been complaining of feeling “a little fatigued” and was being checked by health authorities daily, NSW Chief Health Officer Kerry Chant told reporters on Wednesday.
“We are aware that with Covid you can get sudden deaths and I think that it is important to understand that your health status can deteriorate (quickly),” Dr Chant said.
But Mr Alaskar’s relatives told The Daily Telegraph he had received a clear Covid test the day before he died and said his family had a long history of heart problems.
Dr Chant confirmed Mr Alaskar had not been vaccinated against Covid-19.
Asked whether his wife, who he is believed to have contracted the virus from, had been vaccinated, NSW Health would not say.
“Due to patient privacy, NSW Health has no further information to provide,” a spokeswoman said.

Max Maddison 2.27pm: Christensen free to speak mind on masks: PM
Scott Morrison has defended Nationals MP George Christensen’s “right to free speech” amid allegations he is “undermining” public health measures.
While responding to a question from Macarthur MP Mike Freelander , which cited comments by Mr Christensen saying Covid mask mandates is an “insanity”, the Prime Minister said he didn’t share the views of the Dawson MP, but defended his ability to speak his mind.
“I have been very clear about that but I tell you what, in this country people have a right to free speech. They do. They do have a right to free speech in this country and that is not something that the government is seeking to clamp down on,” Mr Morrison told Question Time on Wednesday afternoon.
Moments before, Mr Christensen had been flaunting requests by speaker Tony Smith for all members to wear face masks while in the chamber. After being alerted to this by Labor, Mr Smith asked the Dawson MP to respect the statement he made on Tuesday.
Mr Morrison then turned his attention to Labor’s preselection of outspoken AstraZeneca critic Michelle Anada-Rajah in the seat of Higgins. He accused Labor of “setting the standard”, talking down the AstraZeneca vaccine.
“The leader of the Labor Party should take the example of the former leader of the Labor Party who’s happy to get out there and support the CSL workers who are out there making those AstraZeneca vaccines that the leader of the Labor Party seems to be crab walking away from,” he said.

Matthew Denholm 2.10pm: Tasmania reaches 50pc vax milestone
Tasmania will have given half of its eligible population their first Covid-19 vaccine by the end of today.
Premier Peter Gutwein said the 50 per cent first-vaccination “milestone ... puts Tasmania well ahead of the national average of just over 41 per cent”.
“I am very thankful that Tasmanians are hearing our message and they are taking action to protect themselves, their loved ones and our community,” Mr Gutwein said. “Importantly 25 per cent of Tasmanians have now had their second dose as well; meaning that one in four eligible Tasmanians are now fully vaccinated, and that we are well on the way to giving us the very best chance of combatting COVID-19.”
Max Maddison 2.02pm: No mRNA vaccines for under 40s despite Doherty advice
Covid-19 vaccination commander Lieutenant-General John Frewen says the federal government won’t start vaccinating under 40-year-olds, despite the Doherty Institute warning it is vital because they are high Covid transmitters.
COVID-19 Taskforce Commander Lieutenant General John Frewen says vaccine incentives may be discussed later in the rollout as currently “demand is still exceeding supply”. “I have said incentives is something we will consider but right now Australians are coming forward, in the last seven days, we've have had 1.2 million doses going into people’s arms,” he said. Lieutenant General Frewen said incentives may be introduced to get “some of the more hesitant” groups to get inoculated and “positive alternatives” are being considered. “There's cash, there's the ideas of lotteries, all these things have been discussed but what is resonating with people right now really is being able to get back to the sort of lifestyle we used to enjoy.”
Lieutenant-General Frewen reiterated that AstraZeneca was already accessible for younger age groups, but said the main reason for not opening up mRNA to all cohorts was expectation, which was undermined by constrained supplies.
“The idea for 30-39 – we will open mRNA towards the end of this month, early next month – means that when people are told they can access the vaccine they can do it in a reasonable period of time,” Lieutenant-General Frewen told a press conference on Wednesday afternoon.
“AstraZeneca is available right now under informed consent. People need to make a decision whether they have the available vaccine now or whether they wait.”
The Doherty Institute recommended that vaccinating under 40-year-olds offered the “greatest potential to reduce transmission” given that a high proportion of vulnerable Australians were already vaccinated.
Rachel Baxendale 1.40pm: ‘New info’ about positive traffic controller
Victorian Covid-19 logistics chief Jeroen Weimar says contact tracers have identified “new information” regarding a Covid testing centre traffic controller who tested positive for the virus last week.
The worker at the Moonee Valley testing centre in Melbourne’s northwest was working at a time when positive cases attended the drive through facility, but no direct links between him and those people have yet been officially identified.
While two of his colleagues subsequently tested positive, it is believed they caught the virus from him, and not vice versa.
“There are very strong indications, or there’s a strong line of investigation around some movements that he had at work,” Mr Weimar said on Wednesday.
“The team is reviewing that again this afternoon and if we can confirm that connection then we’ll announce that shortly.”
Asked what the “line of investigation” was, Mr Weimar said it was “too early to say”.
“As I said the the team is reviewing a number of different factors over the course of today, and we’ve got some new information about movements around that particular worksite, and it may well be that that gives us a clear connection,” he said.
“We know that genomically it’s connected, so it is part of this same Delta cluster that we’ve been working with over the last three or four weeks. But that’s the last piece of the puzzle that I’m very keen to land in the next day or two.”

Max Maddison 1.29pm: Cash incentives for vaccination ‘on the table’
Covid-19 vaccination commander Lieutenant-General John Frewen says all incentive options are on the table, including cash and lotteries, to encourage resistant cohorts to get their jabs, but says at the moment, demand is continuing to outstrip supply.
The Morrison government has delivered a fierce attack on Labor’s $6 billion cash incentive plan, which they claimed was a “vote of no confidence and an insult to Australians”. But Lieutenant-General Frewen flagged cash payments as a possible route once demand began to slow.
“We will look at all possible alternatives. There is cash, there is the idea of lotteries – all these things are being discussed. What is resonating with people right now really is being able to get back to the sort of lifestyle we used to enjoy,” Lieutenant-General Frewen told a press conference on Wednesday
But he warned the time for incentives was still a while off, with strong demand for mRNA vaccines meaning there was little reason to encourage vaccine uptake.
“Right now, I have said incentives is something we will consider but right now Australians, in the last 7-day, we have had 1.2 million doses going into people’s arms,” he said.
“Demand is still exceeding supply right now so the time for incentives may be later when we’re getting into some of the more hesitant groups.”

Rachel Baxendale 1.24pm: Victoria weighs offering AZ to under 40s in clinics
The Victorian health bureaucrat in charge of the state’s vaccination rollout says the health department is “actively considering” offering AstraZeneca to under-40s at state-run clinics.
The Australian Technical Advisory Group on Immunisation’s latest advice is that the benefits of Covid-19 vaccination with AstraZeneca “strongly outweigh the risks of adverse effects” in people aged below 60 “in the context of an outbreak”.
ATAGI’s position remains that Pfizer is the preferred vaccine for under 60s, but supply constrains mean the Pfizer vaccine is not expected to be made available to under-40s in Victoria until at least September.
This means that Victorians aged under-40 who are not part of a priority group can currently only access a Covid-19 vaccine if they seek AstraZeneca through a GP.
Asked whether the Victorian health department was likely to administer AstraZeneca to under-40s, deputy secretary in charge of vaccination, Naomi Bromley , said: “We are actively considering that at the moment, and we think we’ll have more to say on that in coming weeks.”
“People in those age groups absolutely can go to GPs, and GPs have many, many access points all across the state, and plenty of supply,” Ms Bromley said.
“So it’s not that people can’t access it. We are looking very closely at whether we open that access up in our state system, and again, we’ll come back to you when we’ve got more to say about that.”

Ellie Dudley 1.06pm: Number of calls to Lifeline breaks national daily record
Lifeline Australia received the highest daily number of phone calls in the 58 year history of the business on Monday, as Australia’s Covid-19 crisis continues to take its toll.
Some 3345 callers sought support from the suicide prevention service on Monday, to seek support through the isolation, anxiety and uncertainty of the pandemic, Lifeline Australia Chairman John Brogden said.
In an exclusive interview with Sky News Australia, Lifeline Chairman John Brogden has revealed the mental health support service on Monday recorded its highest ever number of calls in one day. It comes as Greater Sydney has been in lockdown for over a month, Brisbane has just entered lockdown, and Victoria recently came out of lockdown. Mr Brogden told Sky News host Paul Murray 3,345 calls were made to the support service on Monday - the highest number of calls received by Lifeline in 58-and-a-half years. “That’s a lot of grief, that’s a lot of frustration, that’s a lot of anger,” Mr Brogden said. “In one sense, thank God they’re reaching out and they’re talking, but that’s a lot of stress and pressure out in the community.”
“This has been a tough period for all Australians, and it has pushed many of those already struggling into crisis - but we’re glad they know help is out there,” he said.
“The fact that so many Australians are reaching out – many for the first time - and seeking help is a good thing.
“Our volunteers are working harder than ever and giving people the support they need when they need it.”
Mr Brogden expects the high volume of calls to continue through the current lockdown period in NSW and Queensland, “because these kinds of events leave a long tail of trauma.”
If you, or someone you know, is feeling overwhelmed, call Lifeline on 13 11 14.

Max Maddison 1.01pm: Domestic flights ‘limited to vaccinated-only’
Liberal MP Trent Zimmerman says domestic flights may be limited to people who are vaccinated, but warns there’s still a while to go before we get to that point.
Scott Morrison has pushed “freedom exemptions” as the incentives he believes will encourage the necessary uptake of vaccinations to reach the thresholds outlined by the Doherty Institute.
Despite concerns preventing sections of the community from participating in society could push ardent anti-vaxxers further underground, Mr Zimmerman said he didn’t consider restrictions on people who weren’t vaccinated as punitive
“I think that’s something we got to look at but that’s really going to come at the tail end when we see what vaccination rates are like,” Mr Zimmerman told Sky News on Wednesday afternoon.
“My impression is why the Labor proposal for cash inducements is unnecessary and wrong is that most people I talked to really want to get vaccinated, it’s a very small part of the population that is vehemently opposed to vaccines.”

Evin Priest 12.55pm: Limit shopping trips to once every three days
NSW residents have been urged to shop only once every three days where possible as supermarkets, grocery stores and fruit shops continue to occupy the state’s list of Covid-19 exposure sites.
NSW Police Deputy Commissioner Gary Worboys says officers are “taking a very firm approach” when it comes to cracking down on COVID rulebreakers but are “also very fair”. “The police are taking a very firm approach. There's absolutely no question about that, but we are also very fair,” he said. Mr Worboys said police “listen” to NSW residents and determine whether they “have a reasonable excuse”. “If they can mount a reasonable argument, they're not the people getting penalty infringement notices,” he said. Mr Worboys said on Tuesday 360 penalty infringement notices were issued. “Those 360 people need to have a good hard look at themselves and make sure that when they walk out the door, my view is you turn around and have a look at who is inside your home and what you are going to bring back to those people,” he said.
A fruit store in Campsie in Sydney’s inner west was on Wednesday listed as a close contact site with an alarming duration of exposure times.
NSW Health’s extensive casual contact list also includes 20 Woolworths stores, five Coles locations, six Aldi stores and three Bunnings outlets as well as a swath of other businesses ranging from chemists to independent grocery stores.
NSW chief health officer Kerry Chant said less trips to the shops were going to be key in reducing locally acquired case numbers across Greater Sydney.
“This is one of the tightest lockdowns we have ever had,” she said on Wednesday.
“Can I just say the mobility data is showing that we are getting down to what Victoria did in the stage 4 lockdown.
“From a public health perspective, I can‘t be clearer, please do not go out and about.
“Please minimise. If you can go shopping every three days, if you are able to do that, please do.” – NCA Newswire

Ellie Dudley 12.32pm: South Australia records one new local virus case
One new locally acquired coronavirus case has been detected in South Australia in a man in his 20s.
The man has been linked to the Modbury cluster via a family member who tested positive for the virus on July 20.
He has been in quarantine and did not display any symptoms.
SA Premier Steven Marshall said the new case as “a concern”, but said it was “a massive relief” he had been in quarantine.
The state is currently in the process of relaxing the restrictions that were imposed during a seven-day lockdown in July.

Erin Lyons 12.27pm: Question that Berejiklian refused to answer
Gladys Berejiklian refused to answer one particular question about Sydney’s lockdown after the state recorded another 233 new infections overnight.
The spike in case numbers came just 12 hours after NSW Health added a staggering 174 exposure sites to its alerts list, which featured several Bunnings stores and retail outlets like The Reject Shop and other discount stores.
She was asked why these businesses were still open despite the rise in case numbers.
“Obviously the lockdown rules we have in NSW are some of the harshest our nation has seen,” she argued.
“We need people to remember every time they leave the house that they could have the virus or someone they come into contact with could have the virus.”
“Why is The Reject Shop open?,” a reporter interjected.
Ms Berejiklian argued non-critical retail stores should not be open and that there may be “historic situations” where health has listed a site.
“Why is Bunnings open, it is not open in Queensland?” the reporter asked again.
“Next question,” Ms Berejiklian said.
Bunnings actually is open in Queensland despite the latest outbreak.
A statement on its website says stores are open in Greater Brisbane, Ipswich, Logan City, Moreton Bay, Redlands, Sunshine Coast, Gold Coast, Noosa, Somerset, Lockyer Valley and Scenic Rim. – NCA Newswire
Rachel Baxendale 12.20pm: Fewer than 3000 Victorians remain in quarantine
Victorian Covid-19 logistics chief Jeroen Weimar has provided an update on the status of the state’s most recent coronavirus outbreaks, after there were no new community-acquired infections recorded in the 24 hours to midnight on Tuesday.
Following 220 community-acquired cases linked to the two recent NSW incursions, there are now 99 active cases in Victoria, up to seven of which are in overseas arrivals in hotel quarantine.
Only 33 of 400 exposure sites linked to the most recent outbreaks remain active.
Approximately 815,000 Covid-19 tests have been processed since the outbreaks emerged just over three weeks ago.
During that period, 40,000 close contacts have been identified and required to complete a fortnight’s quarantine.
Of these, fewer than 3000 remain in quarantine.
As of Wednesday, there are nine people in Victorian hospitals with coronavirus, two of whom are in ICU on ventilators.
Victorian health department deputy secretary in charge of vaccination, Naomi Bromley , said 60,000 extra Pfizer appointments would be made available to 40 to 59-year-olds in coming weeks, as a result of the period between first and second doses being extended from three weeks to six.

Ellie Dudley 12.00pm: Apartment blocks identified as high-exposure sites
Apartment buildings have been identified by NSW health authorities as places with high-exposure rates, chief health officer Kerry Chant says.
NSW Chief Health Officer Dr Kerry Chant has pleaded with residents to stop “looking for loopholes” in public health orders after the state recorded 233 new local COVID-19 infections overnight. With daily case numbers heading in the wrong direction, Dr Chant said it was "too soon" to talk about living with the disease, emphasising that residents were “dealing with one of the most challenging times that we have ever experienced as a nation”. “I think it is too soon to talk about living with COVID. Our vaccine coverage levels are not high enough,” she said. “We need to do all we can to drive these numbers down and we all have a part to play. “So rather than looking for loopholes of what you can do in the public health orders, can I just ask everyone in the community and business to really reflect. “I'm also asking business to take those decisions; you are required under the public health orders to work from home if it is at all practical. “I think that many of those businesses can do more.”
“We are seeing some cases in apartment buildings and we have seen transmission with the Delta strain, more than we have seen with previous strains in this context,” she told reporters on Wednesday.
“That was why we introduced mask wearing for common areas and why we’re also messaging now to be careful as you move about apartment buildings.
“Please, in apartment buildings, get tested at the earliest possible time. Remain isolated.”

Ellie Dudley 11.48am: 47 infectious in community means peak yet to come
Premier Gladys Berejiklian says NSW case numbers will get worse.
The state recorded 233 new cases of the virus on Wednesday, 47 of which were infectious while in the community.
New South Wales Premier Gladys Berejiklian says "we need people to remember" every time they leave the house that they "could have the virus". "Or someone they come into contact could have the virus," Ms Berejiklian said during a media conference on Wednesday. It comes after New South Wales recorded 233 new coronavirus cases, with at least 47 of those infectious in the community, and two additional deaths, including a man in his 20s.
Ms Berejiklian said due to the large number of infectious people active in society NSW residents should brace for another spike in cases.
“I’m not going to rule out case numbers won’t get worse, I actually think they will get worse,” she said.
“If you look at the number of people infectious in the community, it indicates that perhaps we haven’t reached our peak.”
Ellie Dudley 11.38am: AstraZeneca advice ‘written by experts’
NSW chief health officer Kerry Chant has refused to update the messaging encouraging young people getting AstraZeneca, despite accusations the language currently used isn’t strong enough.
The NSW Health website says young people should take up the AstraZeneca vaccine “if they wish to.”
AstraZeneca v Pfizer - Doherty
Dr Chant on Wednesday said the directive was written by experts who have considered the situation.
“Their advice is anyone in the context of this outbreak should be considering (the AstraZeneca vaccine) if you’re 18 and over,” she said.
“I have continually urged all age groups to strongly consider vaccination and talk to your immunisation provider.”
Dr Chant said she was “really concerned” about the number of eldery people who haven’t taken the jab.
Ellie Dudley 11.29am: Backtrack on HSC student return to classrooms
NSW Premier Gladys Berejiklian has backtracked on her previous claims that all year 12 HSC students would return to school in mid-August.
On July 28, Ms Berejiklian said year 12 students would recommence face-to-face learning on August 16.
NED-4300-Geographical-Vaccination-Rates-NSW
But on Wednesday, she said it is only the “intention” of NSW authorities to have students return on that date, but could not provide a guarantee.
“Our intention still is where (returning on August 16) is necessary that will occur but exactly how often that occurs and in what context is being determined this week,” she said.
“I do want to foreshadow that given where the case numbers are at, especially in those eight local government areas and students won’t be vaccinated until the week of August 9, that we need to make sure we adjust our policies according to what’s happening.”
Ms Berejiklian said “it is likely” there wouldn’t be “a uniform policy” but one that reflects what is happening in their communities.

Ellie Dudley 11.14am: Man in 20s ‘felt fatigued, died suddenly’
An unvaccinated man in his 20s has died after contracting Covid-19.
The man was from south-west Sydney and died “quite suddenly,” NSW premier Gladys Berejiklian said.
“Obviously our deepest condolences to his family and loved ones,” Ms Berejiklian said.
“But it demonstrates again how this disease is lethal, how it affects people of all ages.”
The 20-year-old man complained of feeling “a little fatigued” and was being checked by health authorities daily, chief health officer Kerry Chant said.
Premier Gladys Berejiklian says New South Wales has recorded 233 new locally acquired cases of COVID-19 with at least 47 infectious in the community – and the death of a man in his 20s. “Very sadly, a male in his 20s passed away at home with COVID from south-western Sydney overnight,” she said. “Obviously our deepest condolences to his family and loved ones. “But it demonstrates again how this disease is lethal, how it affects people of all ages. “Unfortunately, the gentleman wasn't vaccinated, hadn't had any dose of the vaccine. “As we understand it, the death happened quite suddenly.”
“We are aware that with Covid you can get sudden deaths and I think that is important to understand that your health status can deteriorate and you can have sudden death with COVID infection,” she said.
He died while living with one other person, who had also been diagnosed with Covid-19 and has since been moved to hospital.
The death has been referred to the coroner.
Another death was detected in an unvaccinated woman in her 80s who died at the Royal Prince Alfred Hospital in Sydney’s inner west.
“She tested positive for COVID on July 27th and has been being cared for in the Royal Prince Alfred Hospital since then. She was not vaccinated,” chief health officer Kerry Chant said.
There have now been 17 deaths associated with the latest outbreak.
Ellie Dudley 11.12am: Urgent search for cases in Hunter, Newcastle
NSW health authorities are desperately tracking down any cases of Covid-19 in the Hunter Valley and Newcastle area, after “very high rates” of the virus were detected in sewerage surveillance.
“The sewerage detected high viral load which suggests there could be undetected cases up around the Newcastle area so we are really keen to have people come forward to get tested,” premier Gladys Berejiklian said.
NSW chief health officer Kerry Chant said she was “very concerned” about the sewerage detection from the Shortland, Burwood Beach and Belmont treatment plants.
“These sewage treatment plants servea number of areas and we will put those in on the website but a particular call out for all of Newcastle and Lake Macquarie but particularly Birmingham gardens, Shortland, Maryland, Fletcher, Minmi, Cameron park, Mayfield, Stockton and Fern Bay,” she said.
“It is critical that we can get those testing levels up to really understand as soon as possible whether there are any undiagnosed cases in the area.”
Ellie Dudley 11.01am: NSW records 233 new virus cases
NSW has recorded 233 new locally-acquired cases of Covid-19 as infections in greater Sydney continue to spread.
At least 47 cases were active in the community for the entirety of their infectious period, which Premier Gladys Berejiklian said is “the number we are desperate to see reduced.”
A total of 105,000 tests were conducted in the 24 hours to 8pm last night.

Charlie Peel 10.26am: Extra AstraZeneca expected in Queensland next week
The extra 150,000 AstraZeneca vaccine doses given to Queensland by the federal government are unlikely to arrive until next week.
New daily cases in Queensland, from July 25, 2021
Authorities had hoped to give the extra vaccines to pharmacies around Brisbane to deliver into people’s arms this week, however, Health Minister Yvette D’Ath said it was unlikely that would happen because there was a delay in transporting the vaccines and necessary consumables such as syringes.
NED-4196-QLD-Restrictions-lifting
“The commonwealth has got these vaccines already, they offered them a couple of days ago, so we would hope that that 150,000 vaccines can arrive earlier than next week,” Ms D’Ath said.
“We will look at our own AZ supply and if we can redirect that to those 224 pharmacies that have approval now and our consumables, we will do that as well.
“But I don’t think it’s acceptable that they have to wait until next week to wait for the commonwealth to deliver those vaccines and those consumables when they have got it in supply now and we ask them to be delivered as soon as possible because the sooner we start getting these vaccines in people’s arms, the safer those individuals become and the safer our community becomes.”

Charlie Peel 10.22am: Ending lockdown by Sunday a challenge, Young says
Queensland’s chief health officer Jeannette Young says the state faces a “big challenge” to stem the spread of the virus around Brisbane to bring an end to the lockdown on Sunday.
Dr Young said it would take extra measures and precautions to achieve and urged people in lockdown to reconsider whether they needed to make online purchases to prevent the need for delivery workers to travel.
Queensland Vaccine Locator
“Do you need those people out in the community delivering packages and things?” Dr Young said.
“Maybe just leave them for a week. And click and collect - do you really need that furniture that I know you can go and click and collect which is safer, absolutely, than going into the store, but it still means you’re putting someone else at risk.
“Please, everyone, just think what you could do to just stay at home for the next few days until Sunday because it would be really good if we could lift it.
“That’s a big challenge, though, when I look at other states and how long it’s taken before they could lift their restrictions.
“If we don’t do something really, really, really special in Queensland, we’ll be extending the lockdown.
“So, please, I ask of all of you - try your absolute hardest to stay at home if you possibly can.”
Max Maddison 10.18am: Let’s hope PM gets rollout right now: Plibersek
Deputy opposition leader Tanya Plibersek says she “hopes the Prime Minister is right”, because fixing problems in the vaccination rollout are too important “for our country to keep getting it wrong”.
Scott Morrison has laid out a vaccination roadmap for the nation, with hopes of hitting the 70 per cent threshold by the end of the year. But Ms Plibersek cautioned the federal government’s vaccination targets had been missed before.
“It is the same Prime Minister who said that all aged care workers should be vaccinated by Easter, and we have outbreaks in nursing homes in Sydney right now because of partially vaccinated or unvaccinated workers,” Ms Plibersek told Sky News on Wednesday morning.
“We’ve got aged care residents in hospital, we’ve got serious problems. Because the Prime Minister was wrong about that. So, you know I hope he’s right.”
She also defended Labor’s vaccine incentive plan, saying with lockdowns costing the economy $2 billion per week, $6 billion represented “good value for money”.
“Yeah, well he thinks anything that’s not his idea is a bad idea. This is an acknowledgment that if we pay people who’ve already been vaccinated, it’s an acknowledgment that they’ve done the right thing already,” she said.

Charlie Peel 10.14am: Unlinked Cairns case likely caught Covid from ship
The Cairns maritime pilot who tested positive for Covid-19 is believed to have picked up the virus from a ship.
The man works in the state’s far north as a pilot to guide ships through the waters around the Great Barrier Reef.
His positive test on Tuesday prompted the closure of his child’s daycare clinic and sparked concerns that the virus circulating in Brisbane had spread into the north.
However, Chief Health Officer Jeannette Young said testing showed the man had a different Delta strain to the Brisbane cluster.
Southeast Queensland’s COVID outbreak is showing no sign of slowing despite half of the state’s population being locked down until Sunday afternoon. It is feared the Delta strain could have spread to the Far North, with authorities investigating a positive case in Cairns. More than 150,000 extra doses of AstraZeneca are on the way to the state. Queensland’s vaccination rate has increased by four per cent but the state still has the highest hesitancy in Australia. Queensland’s chief health officer says she is hopeful of lockdown lifting as planned on Sunday, given the increase of people getting tested, as well the decrease in traffic on the city’s streets and roads.
“It is not the Delta strain that is circulating in Brisbane and it hasn’t clustered with any other known case of Delta in Queensland,” Dr Young said.
“So now those whole genome sequence experts will go and see whether it clusters with any other case in Australia or overseas.
“But it’s highly likely he’s acquired this infection while he’s been about his work piloting one of those ships.
“So he has very high CT values, extremely high. So that means very little virus.
“His family members who live in the same household as him, his partner and child, are negative, but he did take his child to a child care centre, so that’s why the child care centre his child attends has been closed while they clean it and assess the risk there.”
The new cases recorded on Wednesday were linked to Indooroopilly State High School and Ironside State School.
Dr Young said all of the cases were able to be linked, however there is still a missing link between a family of five, who tested positive last week, and two people who arrived from overseas earlier in July.
Charlie Peel 10.00am: Queensland records 16 new local virus cases
Queensland has recorded 16 new cases of Covid-19, prompting the cancellation of Brisbane’s Ekka public holiday next Wednesday.
There are now 63 cases linked to the cluster around Indooroopilly in Brisbane’s inner west, mostly spreading through school students and their families.
Only two of the new cases did not spend time in the community while infectious.
Chief Health Officer Jeannete Young has said the state’s lockdown of 11 government areas is unlikely to be lifted until there is no community transmission.
Deputy Premier Steven Miles said the cancelled public holiday would be postponed after August.
The new case of Covid-19 detected in a reef pilot in far north Queensland on Tuesday has been confirmed as the highly-virulent Delta strain and has not been linked to the Brisbane cluster.
“The reef pilot was vaccinated as all of our reef pilots are which is very good but we will be continuing to ramp-up testing in Cairns in order to ensure there’s been no further transmission there,” Deputy Premier Steven Miles said.
The state’s cluster is now at 63.
It comes as a record 51,000 tests were conducted. The outbreak is the largest since the first wave of the pandemic hit in March 2020.
Ellie Dudley 9.50am: Queensland, NSW set to deliver virus updates
Authorities from Queensland and NSW will front the media this morning to provide updates on the evolving Covid-19 situations in their respective states.
Queensland Deputy Premier Steven Miles , Health Minister Yvette D’Ath and chief health officer Jeannette Young will provide an update at 10am.
The state recorded 16 new cases of locally acquired Covid-19 on Wednesday, all of which were linked to the Indooroopilly cluster.
The cluster has grown to 47, as concerns grow about the potential of a new case in far north Queensland.
NSW Premier Gladys Berejiklian will hold a press conference at 11am to update the state on the latest Covid-19 numbers.
A total of 199 new community cases were reported for the state on Tuesday.

Ellie Dudley 9.25am: NSW Health revises status of 170 exposure sites
NSW Health has added or updated the advice for more than 170 exposure sites across greater Sydney, but just one has been identified as a close contact location.
The state health department regularly issues updates throughout the day on new venues where the virus has potentially spread.
But on Tuesday evening an email issued to journalists simply said “a number of new casual contact venues” had been identified, and provided a link back to the health website.
The World of Fruit shop in Campsie is the one site which has been updated to “close contact” status.
Previously, the shop in sydney’s south west was identified as an exposure site for a brief window in late July.
Now, anyone who attended the location at 244 Beamish Street between 3pm and 4pm on Monday July 19; 6am to 7pm on Tuesday July 20; 5am to 7pm on Wednesday July 21; and 5am to 7pm on Sunday July 25 must immediately be tested and isolate for 14 days regardless of the test result.
All of the 533 potential exposure sites can be viewed on the NSW Health website.

Ellie Dudley 9.14am: Covid case forces unit block lockdown
A unit complex in south-west Sydney has been locked down after a number of residents tested positive for Covid-19.
Police attended the building on Warby Street in Campbelltown at 8.00pm on Tuesday night and subsequently locked it down.
It has not been confirmed how many people have contracted the virus.
The incident follows similar occurrences in apartment complexes in Bondi Junction and Blacktown.

Ellie Dudley 8.53am: Radio star uses profit motive for jab appeal
KIIS FM news presenter Brooklyn Ross has posted a six-minute video encouraging Australians to get vaccinated and decrease vaccine hesitancy towards the AstraZeneca jab.
The video began by addressing concerns among young Australians regarding changing health advice on the AstraZeneca vaccine.
Ross said the updated ATAGI advice was due to the escalating Covid-19 situation across Australia.
“Any adult can go and get AstraZeneca in Sydney and that changed because of Delta,” he said.
“Cases just keep going up. 14 people are dead in a month. If you catch this strain there is a one in 300 chance you’ll die.”
Ross said ATAGI encouraged all NSW residents to “strongly consider” getting the AstraZeneca vaccine, because it “beats the hell out of getting Covid.”
The video pointed out the profit differences between AstraZeneca, which is not-for-profit, and Pfizer which is privately owned.
“AstraZeneca is a viral vector vaccine, the type of vaccine that has been protecting people for years and has a lot of experience.”
“Pfizer and Moderna are both mRNA vaccines which are good but it is technology that hadn’t been used before Covid.”
Mr Ross also said AstraZeneca is the “Aussie choice” as it is made in Melbourne, whereas the Pfizer vaccine is imported.
Australians are more likely to develop blood clots from a flight, cigarettes or the contraceptive pill than they are from the AstraZeneca vaccine, Ross said.

Rachel Baxendale 8.47am: Victoria records a ‘donut day’ with zero cases
Victoria has recorded zero new cases of coronavirus in the 24 hours to midnight on Tuesday.
The “donut day” represents the first 24 hour period without any community transmissions since two incursions from NSW prompted the state’s fifth lockdown last month.
New daily cases in Victoria, from July 10, 2021
Wednesday’s zero follows four locally-acquired cases on Tuesday, two on Monday, four on Sunday, two on Saturday, three on Friday, seven on Thursday, and an outbreak peak of 26 on Thursday July 22.
Only two of the 22 cases over the past seven days had not been in quarantine for the duration of their infectious period.
This includes a traffic controller in his 20s who tested positive for coronavirus after working at the Moonee Valley Racecourse drive through Covid-19 testing centre.
Investigations are ongoing into how the traffic controller contracted the virus.
Aside from two work colleagues who the man is understood to have infected, all testing centre colleagues have tested negative for the virus.
Victoria’s total number of community acquired cases since two incursions from NSW emerged just over three weeks ago stands at 220.
There are currently 99 active cases, including up to seven active cases acquired overseas.
At least 114 of those infected during the current outbreaks have recovered, and more are expected to do so in coming days.
As of Tuesday, there were 10 people in Victorian hospitals with coronavirus, including three in intensive care, of whom one was on a ventilator.
The latest cases come after 30,117 tests were processed on Tuesday, up from 22,217 on Monday, 21,417 on Sunday and 25,779 on Saturday, but down from 32,760 on Friday, and 35,863 last Wednesday, and well down from the July 20 Victorian record of 59,355.
Max Maddison 8.34am: Drive-through clinics for maximum vax convenience
There’s a “really good opportunity” to get 70 per cent of the population fully vaccinated by the end of the year, says Covid-19 vaccination rollout commander Lieutenant-General John Frewen .
The release of modelling by the Doherty Institute on Tuesday laid out the pathway forward for the nation to move back to normality, which would see lockdowns almost entirely scrapped with 70 per cent of the population vaccinated, and society almost operating as it was pre-pandemic at 80 per cent.
Supply issues have hampered the rollout so far, but Lieutenant-General Frewen said he was “very confident” everyone who wanted a first dose would be able to receive one by the end of the year, and if demand remained at current levels, a “good population” would receive both jabs.
“I am not going to tie myself to particular numbers because it really is about the willingness of the public to get vaccinated, but I think we have got a really good opportunity to get to 70 per cent this year,” Lieutenant-General Frewen told ABC Breakfast News on Wednesday morning.
“But as we have seen from international experience, getting above 70 per cent does require concerted effort, so we will work hard to get to 70 per cent this year and if we can get further then that will be great.”
To assist with the rollout, he said that the federal government was looking to bring onboard “every possible place of vaccination”. This included drive-through vaccination clinics being a “potential option”, which he said was part of offering “maximum convenience” for Australians.

Ellie Dudley 8.15am: TikTok to stream Chant, Berejiklian updates live
Social media giant TikTok will from Wednesday live stream the NSW health authorities’ daily Covid-19 update in a bid to have the state’s younger generation informed of pertinent information.
TikTok Australia and New Zealand Global Public Policy Director Brent Thomas said the live stream would provide the NSW community with “useful and credible information.”
“We’re supporting the NSW Government to livestream their daily 11.00am COVID-19 press conferences on TikTok from Wednesday 4 August, bringing important COVID-19 updates to the TikTok community,” Mr Mason said.
“This livestream will be hosted on NSW Health’s new TikTok account, @nswhealth, providing crucial information on COVID-19 case numbers, hot spots, rules and restrictions, vaccination updates and how the community can best stay safe during these tough times.”
In July, NSW chief health officer Kerry Chant conducted a live Q&A on the platform, to chat with Australian influencers and spread safe information about the state’s latest outbreak.
The health updates are already live streamed on Twitter and Facebook.

Ellie Dudley 8.04am: Treatment hope for those unable to be vaccinated
Infectious disease physicianhas flagged a potential alternative for people who are unable to get the Covid-19 vaccine due to existing health problems.
JCU Infectious Diseases Professor Emma McBryde says those who have received the jab “shouldn’t have to endure the same restrictions” as those who are unvaccinated. “I think the thing that’s really going to work…is giving certain risk-related privileges if you like to people who are vaccinated,” Professor McBryde told Sky News host Andrew Bolt. “It’s totally based on the fact they're a lot less likely to transmit COVID and the main thing people really crave is freedom of movement, freedom of association, being allowed to join their friends and family and so on and I think that would be a huge incentive for people to get vaccinated. “We have to respond to public health threat in proportion to the risk that people propose and if people have gone out and got themselves vaccinated and are a low risk then they shouldn’t have to endure the restrictions as unvaccinated people.”
As Australia strives for a 70 per cent vaccination rate by the end of the year, concerns have arisen for those who are unable to get the jab as it is a risk to their health.
Kirby Institute Therapeutic Vaccine and Research Program head Gail Matthews said there are drugs that would be employed to have these people vaccinated sooner.
“There might be some use there for some of the drugs called monoclonal antibodies, which showed some early promise for treatment to prevent people coming into hospital and getting sick,” Professor Matthews said.
“I think there are some interesting treatments out there that we need to look at carefully.”
Currently, 15.7 per cent of all Australians have been fully vaccinated against Covid-19.

Ellie Dudley 7.42am: ‘Don’t blame people of SW Sydney for poor vax rate’
Canterbury-Bankstown Mayor Khal Asfour has rejected claims his LGA has not pitched in to boost the state’s vaccination effort, after it was revealed the high-risk area had the lowest jab rate in Sydney.
Despite being the epicentre of Sydney’s Delta outbreak, southwest Sydney has the lowest vaccination rate in NSW, with just 33.1 per cent of adults receiving at least one dose and 14.7 per cent fully vaccinated.
Vaccination rates by SA4
But Mr Asfour said the vaccine messaging has been “botched from the start” and his area is not to blame for the low uptake.
“We are getting the message out to get the jabs in arms,” he told Channel 9’s Today.
“Unfortunately, the messaging was botched from the start when the federal government announced all these changes and that’s what caused confusion.
Mr Asfour added “if we had enough supply” from when the roll out began, “we wouldn’t be in the mess we’re in today.”
On Monday the federal ALP revealed a plan to give $300 to every Australian who was fully vaccinated against Covid-19.
Mr Asfour said the incentive would be “a good thing.”
“We want more people to get the jab,” he said.
“Community leaders are working hard to make sure the message is getting out there. Working with NSW Health, with government, to make sure they know it is safe and that’s what is going to get us out of this lockdown.”

Ellie Dudley 7.35am: Police conduct random compliance tests
Queensland Police has ramped up compliance efforts across the state, with random breath testing-style checks on cars to make sure people are not breaching public health orders.
Deputy police commissioner Steve Gollschewski said the plan had “commenced already” and will operate at an increased capacity if needed.
“We’ve been running what we’ve called RBT reception centres across the state overnight and we’ll ramp it up if we need to,” he told Channel 9’s Today.
Queensland individuals will be fined up to $1000 if found to not be complying with public health orders, and businesses $6000.
A fine for not wearing a mask is $236.
“The message is not “can I go out?” But “should I go out?” Mr Gollschewski said.
“Don’t go out. Stay at home and only go out if you’re absolutely permitted to do so.”

Ellie Dudley 6.30am: ‘Impossible to avoid all deaths country reopens’
Australians must choose between a potential spike in deaths or remaining in lockdown “forever”, Director of the Doherty Institute’s Epidemiology department Jodie McVernon says.
Modelling from the Doherty Institute is guiding Prime Minister Scott Morrison in presenting his roadmap out of the pandemic.
Mr Morrison has promised Australia will begin to live lockdown-free once 70 per cent of the population has been fully vaccinated against Covid-19, and will ease border restrictions at 80 per cent.
But Professor Vernon said it would be impossible to avoid deaths entirely as the country reopens.
“The reality is we can’t avoid COVID forever,” she told ABC Radio National.
“We cannot keep our borders shut. We’ve had very strong border controls. We’ve gone so well, all the way up to this stage and we’re seeing so many countries around the world that have gone so well now struggling with Delta.”
“Covid certainly for the near term, this is not something that’s going away, we can’t hide and hope it comes and goes past.
“So we do have to have a really mature approach to thinking about how we’re going to move forward as a society in a way that doesn’t require lock downs.”

Ellie Dudley 6am: Queensland Opposition demand clarity amid retail rule confusion
Queensland’s opposition leader David Crisafulli has called on the state government to increase the “clarity” surrounding current restrictions, amid confusion of retailers unsure whether they should remain open.
Eleven LGAs in south east Queensland will live under strict stay-at-home orders until 4pm on Sunday at the earliest.
Asked on Tuesday whether stores like JB Hi-Fi and Cotton On should be open during lockdown, Chief Health Officer Dr Jeannette Young said: “No, they’re not essential to me, I would hope that they’ve heard that message, and they make a decision that has contributed to our success”.
“If you’ve got a question whether you’re an essential worker, then you’re probably not,” she said.
But large retailers in the area have remained open during the period as it has not been mandated that they close their doors.
Mr Crisafulli said the instructions were unclear, and called on the state government to draw harder lines.
“This is a classic case that retailers are saying if you’re not telling me I have to be closed, I owe it to my staff to be open,” he said.
“The individual also has to take some responsibility and the individual has to make an assessment - is it essential for me to leave?
“So, you know, I get that, but it’s also up to the government to be clear in your message and you can’t hang business out to dry for that uncertainty and then fill in that void.”
Mr Crisafulli promised his government would share health advice with the population if elected into office.

Geoff Chambers 5am: Vaccine focus turns to ‘peak young transmitters’
A revised vaccine strategy will fast-track jabs for adults under 40, considered the “peak transmitters” of the Delta strain, while nearly halving coronavirus deaths and hospitalisations under a 70 per cent inoculation target.
New health modelling guiding Australia’s post-pandemic recovery shows the retention of high-level testing, tracing and quarantine measures is critical to improving national health outcomes, while Treasury analysis shows that achievement of higher vaccination rates can reduce the cost of lockdowns by more than $400m a week.
After unveiling the vaccine thresholds needed to guide Australia through national cabinet’s four-phase reopening plan, Prime Minister Scott Morrison said on Tuesday new Doherty Institute modelling showed that deaths, hospitalisations and infection rates would be on par with the flu once Australia achieved a vaccination rate of 80 per cent.
AstraZeneca v Pfizer - Doherty
The Doherty report, which recommends low-level social restrictions throughout the four-step reopening plan, found “rapid epidemic growth is expected at 50 and 60 per cent vaccine coverage” before transmission substantially reduces by the 70 and 80 per cent targets.
Mr Morrison said the focus of governments and health officials would shift when Australia moved out of the current suppression phase, with the second and third stages of the national cabinet strategy envisaging a “change in what we’re managing”.
Lieutenant-General John Frewen , commander of the national vaccine rollout, said on Tuesday he had developed a plan to get younger cohorts vaccinated sooner with Australians aged 30-39 brought forward to this month and the 16-29 age group from October.
Sky News Political Editor Andrew Clennell says the Doherty Institute modelling really illustrates why Australia needs up to 70 or 80 per cent of the population vaccinated.
“That is absolutely able to be accommodated within the campaign plan and we’re looking to bring on 30 to 39s, which is the next-highest priority as one of the key transmissibility groups from the end of this month, start of September,” he said.
Mr Morrison said the shift to vaccinate all adults had progressed from an initial focus on inoculating the “most vulnerable in the community”, with the modelling showing deaths and hospitalisations would be nearly halved under a strategy to vaccinate all adults as opposed to focusing on the oldest Australians first.
Modelling of the “all adults” vaccination strategy shows that 3084 people would be admitted to intensive care and 1984 people would die in the first 180 days of a major breakout, assuming a 70 per cent vaccination rate and only basic restrictions and tracing capabilities.
Prime Minister Scott Morrison says in Phases B and C of the COVID-19 pathway the focus will shift from managing cases to managing hospitalisations.

Stephen Rice 4.45am: Police vow no mercy on anti-vaccination violence
Australia’s counter-terrorism chief has vowed to crack down on activists who incite violent resistance to vaccination and lockdowns, amid a surge of online death threats against political leaders and chief health officers.
Australian Federal Police ­assistant commissioner Scott Lee told The Australian he was deeply concerned by the “escalation in the online environment” as the impacts of Covid-19 were felt in lockdowns and on people’s ­mental health.
“We are looking at the online environment very closely and where we see commentary cross the threshold that goes to the ­potential for a commitment to ­violence or violent acts, that’s where we’ll take action,” he said.
Authorities fear online conspiracy theories are becoming real-world terror threats in the wake of Monday’s arrest of a Perth man for impersonating a police officer, following an investigation into a fake video purporting to show AFP commissioner Reece Kershaw plotting to overthrow the federal government.
On Monday, The Australian revealed the video was circulating in online conspiracy circles and had been watched more than 100,000 times, with police concerned unbalanced individuals might act on it.
The video claims to record the commissioner detailing how political leaders will be arrested and removed from office, with “the last resort to pull a handgun on someone”.

Greg Brown 4.30am: PM open to jab lottery, but not a cash splash
Scott Morrison has lashed ­ Anthony Albanese ’s proposal to pay people to get Covid-19 jabs as a “vote of no confidence in Australians”, but left the door open to ­implementing a vaccine lottery.
The Prime Minister said Labor’s proposal to give $300 to everyone who was fully vaccinated by December 1 was a “bubble without a thought”.
“It says to them that their health concerns that they might have about a vaccine can be paid off. And I don’t think that’s the view of Australians,” Mr Morrison said on Tuesday.
“I think doing it for themselves, their family, their communities and for their country is what motivates them to do this.”
Sky News host Peta Credlin says Anthony Albanese and the Opposition are running an "amateur strategy" – hoping that the government's vaccine failures will be enough for them to win the next election.
However, Mr Morrison said the government would “look at” proposals for a vaccine lottery if an ­increased uptake was needed, ­arguing there was a “big difference” between a lottery and Mr ­Albanese’s cash handout policy.
“The fiscal difference is pretty huge … and we’ve had lots of private offers of how things like that might work,” Mr Morrison said.
“But the primary reason why Australians are going to do this is because Australians know that it’s good for them, their family and their country.”
Prime Minister Scott Morrison says he thinks the proposal put forward by Opposition Leader Anthony Albanese and Labor regarding cash incentives for getting vaccinated is a "vote of no-confidence in Australians".

Full text: New health modelling guiding Australia’s post-pandemic recovery shows the retention of high-level testing, tracing and quarantine measures is critical to improving national health outcomes, while Treasury analysis shows that achievement of higher vaccination rates can reduce the cost of lockdowns by more than $400m a week.
After unveiling the vaccine thresholds needed to guide Australia through national cabinet’s four-phase reopening plan, the Prime Minister said on Tuesday new Doherty Institute modelling showed that deaths, hospitalisations and infection rates would be on par with the flu once Australia achieved a vaccination rate of 80 per cent.
The Doherty report, which recommends low-level social restrictions throughout the four-step reopening plan, found “rapid epidemic growth is expected at 50 and 60 per cent vaccine coverage” before transmission substantially reduces by the 70 and 80 per cent targets.
Mr Morrison said the focus of governments and health officials would shift when Australia moved out of the current suppression phase, with the second and third stages of the national cabinet strategy envisaging a “change in what we’re managing”.
“The plan shifts in phase B, and further in phase C, where our focus is on managing hospitalisations, serious illness, and of course avoiding those fatalities,” Mr Morrison said.
“Those outbreak scenarios which Doherty modelled indicate that when you get to that 80 per cent (target) … then you are dealing with a scenario that is not unlike living with an infectious disease like the flu.”
AstraZeneca v Pfizer — Doherty
Doherty Institute director of epidemiology Jodie McVernon said the modelling showed that, if some social measures were kept in place and public health capacity was maintained, Australia could reduce adverse outcomes 100-fold. In the first 180 days of a breakout with 70 per cent of the population vaccinated, only 16 people would die if effective tracing, testing and quarantine arrangements were in place. However, this would rise to nearly 2000 deaths if ineffective arrangements were in place.
Professor McVernon said mask wearing was not included in the Doherty Institute’s analysis of ongoing Covid-19 restrictions, which focused on social-­distancing measures.
“The types of restrictions that we’ve described and consider in terms of the transmission potential are really around something where there are no stay-at-home orders, there are some social-­distancing rules and the two-square-metre rule,” Professor McVernon said.
“There’ll be caps on numbers of people in stadiums and workplaces and things like that. “
Lieutenant-General John Frewen, commander of the national vaccine rollout, said on Tuesday he had developed a plan to get younger cohorts vaccinated sooner with Australians aged 30-39 brought forward to this month and the 16-29 age group from October.
“That is absolutely able to be accommodated within the campaign plan and we’re looking to bring on 30 to 39s, which is the next-highest priority as one of the key transmissibility groups from the end of this month, start of September,” he said.
Mr Morrison said the shift to vaccinate all adults had progressed from an initial focus on inoculating the “most vulnerable in the community”, with the modelling showing deaths and hospitalisations would be nearly halved under a strategy to vaccinate all adults as opposed to focusing on the oldest Australians first.
Modelling of the “all adults” vaccination strategy shows that 3084 people would be admitted to intensive care and 1984 people would die in the first 180 days of a major breakout, assuming a 70 per cent vaccination rate and only basic restrictions and tracing capabilities.
However, in the same scenario focusing on vaccinating the oldest citizens first, there would be 5002 ICU admissions and 3563 people would die.
Professor McVernon said the data showed it was imperative to encourage Australians aged 20 to 39 to get vaccinated. “This is the group now where we’re proposing the reorientation of the strategy,” she said.
Sky News Political Editor Andrew Clennell says the Doherty Institute modelling really illustrates why Australia needs up to 70 or 80 per cent of the population vaccinated.
Treasury also released updated forecasts on Tuesday, based on the Doherty Institute vaccine scenarios, which outlined the impacts of Covid-19 restrictions and different levels of vaccine coverage on economic growth.
Josh Frydenberg said that if stage four restrictions, similar to those imposed in Victoria last year, were enforced across the country, the hit to GDP would be $3.2bn a week. Under stage three restrictions, the cost would be $2.35bn a week. The Treasurer said the ongoing cost of managing Covid-19, based on four scenarios between 50 and 80 per cent vaccine coverage, would range between $140m a week under stage three of the reopening plan and $570m a week if only half of eligible Australians were fully vaccinated.
“These numbers underline the imperative of Australians getting vaccinated,” Mr Frydenberg said.
“It is the way out of this crisis and it is the way to avoid in the future longer, more severe lockdowns. The second key finding or outcome from the economic analysis is that the economic cost comes down significantly, if governments work quickly to get on top of the virus. Early interventions, short, sharp lockdowns are the most cost effective way to handle the virus.
“What Treasury has found is that, at 50 and 60 per cent vaccination rates, it’s five times more costly should governments not move early to get on top of the virus. And that’s the short, sharp lockdowns that we’re now seeing in Queensland, that we’ve seen in Victoria and that was seen in South Australia.”
In relation to transmission, the Doherty Institute report said the focus should be on vaccinating the 20 to 39 age group rather than on children. “Expanding the vaccine program to the 12-15 year age group has minimal impact on transmission and clinical outcomes for any achieved level of vaccine uptake,” it said.
Pressed on NSW Premier Gladys Berejiklian’s ambition to increase the state’s vaccine coverage to 50 per cent before considering an end to the Greater Sydney lockdown, Mr Morrison said the Doherty research showed that “short, sharp” lockdowns were required. “In terms of breaking out of a lockdown, that is a different set of factors,” he said. “There is no doubt that, as vaccination rates rise, that tempers the ability of the virus to spread.”
Chief medical officer Paul Kelly said the existing strategy of “suppression with no community transmission” was designed to avoid severe illness and minimise pressure on hospitals.
Shadow Attorney-General Mark Dreyfus says Prime Minister Scott Morrison rejected the idea of paying Australians to get vaccinated because the Labor Party “put it forward”.

Full text: Stadium carparks, supermarkets and shopping centres could be turned into vaccination sites within months as the jab rollout chief reveals how he plans to reach Australia’s summer vaccination target.
Lieutenant General John Frewen’s Covid-19 vaccine campaign plan, quietly released on Tuesday, reveals the critical marks to reopen the country will “potentially” be met in the final two months of the year.
He expects Australia’s 70 per cent target will be met in November and the 80 per cent target in December, with the vaccine rollout fast-tracked with new distribution points including:
DRIVE-through clinics across the country from the middle of October, including in stadium car parks.
JAB sites at supermarkets and shopping centres from late November.
WORKPLACE immunisation programs involving interested businesses, starting with trials from the middle of October.
PHARMACIES operating after hours and on weekends.
While a decision is yet to be made about how and when children will be vaccinated, General Frewen’s plan proposes that jabs will be given to students at schools from December.
According to the document, adults aged in their 30s will be able to get the jab from September, with those aged 16 to 29 given access from October.
The additional vaccine distribution points will be particularly targeted at younger adults, with General Frewen’s plan noting they typically have “more transient relationships” with GPs who have been central to the first phase of the rollout for older Australians.
A major communications campaign will be put in place with the aim of motivating all eligible adults to get at least their first dose by December 20.
This would involve three key phases of advertising in the middle of this month, late September and early November.
From next month, a national response option will also be put in place in the vaccine program, enabling up to 42,000 extra doses to be sent into an area hit by an outbreak over a two-week period.
Amid concerns the vaccination workforce is already “fatigued and burnt out” because of the pandemic, General Frewen’s plan also explores additional personnel who could help administer jabs, including paramedics, medical students and nurses not already involved.
After Labor leader Anthony Albanese called for all vaccinated Australians to receive $300, the official plan said financial incentives were “unlikely to drive whole-scale vaccine update”.
Instead, rollout chiefs will work with industry on other incentives for “targeting cohorts of people”, such as gift vouchers and prize draws.

FOUR NEW CASES IN VICTORIA Four new locally acquired cases of coronavirus were detected in Victoria on Tuesday.
Each case has been epidemiologically linked to the state’s current outbreaks, and all have been in isolation throughout their infectious period.
One new Covid case was also detected in hotel quarantine, bringing the total number of active cases across the state to 124.
Premier Daniel Andrews said it was still too early to guarantee restrictions would be further eased next week.
“Pleasingly we’ve seen very low case numbers and they’ve all been tucked away,” he said.
“We hope that trend continues and if it does we’ll get advice from the chief health officer and hopefully we’ll he able to take some positive steps.
“If we keep following these rules, as challenging as they are, then there’s every chance we’ll keep these numbers low, and with low numbers you have more options.”
Of Tuesday’s four new cases, two are linked to the Young & Jackson cluster, one is linked to the Coolaroo cluster and the other is a workplace contact of the Moonee Valley testing site.
Ten people are now in hospital with Covid-19 in Victoria. Three of those are in ICU, and one person is on a ventilator.
More than 90 per cent of primary close contacts have been cleared, with 536 cleared on Monday.
More than 3000 remain in quarantine.

CALLS FOR FRESH INSIGHT INTO LOCKDOWN TRIGGERS An inquiry into the pandemic’s impact on the tourism and events sectors in Victoria has called for governments to provide more certainty on the triggers for lockdowns and border closures.
It comes as a report from the Legislative Council’s Economy and Infrastructure Committee, tabled to parliament on Tuesday, made 22 recommendations that were critical to the recovery of both sectors.
Committee Chair Enver Erdogan said Victoria’s tourism and events sectors were among the industries most affected by the virus.
“Tourism relies on people being able to move about freely and events cannot happen without people being able to come together safely. Both of these have been difficult and, at times, impossible during the pandemic,” Mr Erdogan said.
The state government has provided a number of support packages over the past 18 months which have assisted the tourism and events sectors, including the large Business Support Fund, but the Committee heard that more can be done.
Among the recommendations, the Committee called on Visit Victoria to develop individual support packages, including funding and future marketing campaigns, specific to the strengths and needs of each tourism region in Victoria, including Melbourne.
The report also recommended the Victorian government establish an events industry taskforce to review and revise its consultation processes with the events sector, as well as consider options to support businesses who have been ineligible for the Business Support Fund, including sole traders.

O’BRIEN’S BID FOR RAPID TESTING It comes as Opposition Leader Michael O’Brien stood on the steps of state parliament to call on the government to adopt rapid Covid tests more widely.
The party leader demonstrated the tests by taking a nasal and throat swab, with a negative result returned 15 minutes later.
The Liberal Nationals want to see the tests used for major events and access to visit people in hospital and aged care.
But when asked about the tests, Mr Andrews said the current advice was not to use them in these situations
He said they worked best when used frequently, such as for daily testing.
“I won’t be taking advice from people on the front steps of parliament, if it’s all right with you; I’ll be taking from experts,” Mr Andrews said.
“You’re not going to see me ditching advice in favour of political stunts.”
Mr O’Brien said rapid testing was already used in the system and were a good tool to avoid restrictions.
“It should be used across Victoria to keep us safe and keep us open,” he said.
“We need to be able to get back to our lives … And rapid testing is a way we can do it.
“The accuracy of rapid testing is between 95 per cent and 99 per cent.
“At the moment when we’ve got people going to major events the testing option is zero.”
However, chief health officer Brett Sutton said the use of rapid antigen tests was not justified given Victoria’s relatively-free Covid status.
“When we are in a situation, where we are in Victoria, where there are … virtually no cases, we want a test that will tell us that we are negative all of the time,” he said.
“When you are doing tens of thousands of tests per day, you don’t want dozens of false positive cases that you need to chase up as they are real cases, put others in quarantine and declare them primary close contacts when that is not a correct result.”
Professor Sutton said the widely used PCR test was the “genuine gold standard”.
“It is the test that has the highest accuracy of detecting a positive case or a negative case,” he said.
“A rapid antigen test is reasonably good in that setting, but it’s not a perfect test by any means. You really want a supremely accurate test if you have a true positive case out there. “You want to find every single one of them.”
Professor Sutton added he would always hold consideration for rapid antigen testing if it was relevant to the specific circumstances.
“If we were in a situation where we had hundreds of cases and our testing system was under significant strain and that turnaround time for tests were three, four, five days — and you instead wanted to be able to get the infectious individuals tested and get that test result quickly and therefore isolate their most primary close contacts — that might be different,” he said.
“We’re not in a space now where it would provide much additional value.”

QLD’S DELTA COVID CLUSTER WORSENS Queensland’s Delta outbreak has worsened overnight, with the state recording 16 new Covid-19 cases on Tuesday morning.
The current cluster, which was first detected at Indooroopilly State High School last week, now stands at 47.
All 16 new cases have been linked to the high school. Of the new cases, one case is a student from Indooroopilly State High School, two are students at Brisbane Girls Grammar, three cases are from Ironside State School, and five new cases are family contacts of previously confirmed cases.
Dozens of new exposure sites were listed late on Monday, with health authorities urging all southeast Queensland residents to regularly check the list and get tested.

NSW RECORDS 199 NEW CORONAVIRUS CASES Health officials have put more suburbs on notice for encouraging Covid-19 to “creep” after New South Wales recorded 199 new locally acquired cases of Covid-19, Premier Gladys Berejiklian has revealed.
“Unfortunately, 50 of those were infectious in the community and that‘s the number we’re really watching to try and get down as much as we can,“ NSW Premier Gladys Berejiklian said.
Of 199 locally acquired cases, 88 were linked to a known case or cluster, 67 were household contacts and 21 were close contacts while the source of infection for 111 cases is under investigation.
PAYMENT PLAN FOR JABBED AUSSIES All Australians who are fully vaccinated by December 1 would receive $300 under a Labor plan to fast-track the rollout and kickstart the economy.
The cash would be paid to anyone who has received both jabs, including adults who are already vaccinated and kids as young as 12 who will be able to access the vaccine from next week.
Labor leader Anthony Albanese will unveil the $6bn plan on Tuesday. If an election is held before December 1, a new Labor government would deliver the payments, but Labor would not send out the cash if elected at the poll that is more likely to be held next year.
“The government has failed on its two jobs this year, the rollout of the vaccine and fixing quarantine," the Opposition leader said.
“It needs to use every measure at its disposal to protect Australians and our economy.”
The Opposition will push Scott Morrison to introduce the incentive by December 1, arguing the government’s vaccine rollout plan shows enough jabs will be available to vaccinate 80 per cent of the eligible population by then.
Last Friday, the Prime Minister said the national cabinet had agreed 70 per cent would be the threshold to reduce the reliance on lockdowns and ease restrictions for vaccinated Australians.
Once the country reaches 80 per cent, lockdowns will only be used in “highly targeted” circumstances and vaccinated Australians will be exempt from all domestic restrictions.
The national cabinet agreed incentives may be offered in the phase between 70 and 80 per cent.
But in a statement, Mr Albanese — along with shadow treasurer Jim Chalmers and Opposition health spokesman Mark Butler — said the $300 offer “would be a further incentive for Australians to be fully vaccinated and would deliver a much-needed shot in the arm for businesses and workers struggling from lockdowns”.
“Vaccinations are a race Australians can no longer afford to lose,” they said.
“The faster this is achieved, the faster the recovery as we emerge from the lockdowns that are bleeding hundreds of millions of dollars a day from the nation’s finances.”
“Labor will continue to propose constructive solutions to protect the health of Australians and the economy.”
When asked about federal Labor’s proposal to offer $300 incentives for those who got the jab, Mr Andrews said supply was still the biggest issue facing the rollout.
Meanwhile, the idea has been slammed by Finance Minister Simon Birmingham, who has labelled it as “unnecessary and unlikely to work”.
“We looked at it, and the evidence says it’s unnecessary and unlikely to work,” he told the ABC.
“It’s clearly unnecessary in the sense that Australians are responding … They do want to get their vaccines.”
Vaccine Figures
Mr Birmingham said Labor’s plan was “insulting” to the Australians who were already doing the right thing and getting vaccinated, accusing Mr Albanese of “splashing cash and hoping for the best.”
Vaccine rollout chief Lieutenant General John Frewen met with business chiefs last month and discussed vaccine incentives, such as airlines offering free frequent flyer points.
But he said such incentives were not “as necessary” at the moment because there was “a lot of interest from the community about getting vaccinated”.
“I think perhaps later in the campaign when we’re starting to get to those people who are less convinced or a bit more hesitant, that may be a better time for incentives,” General Frewen said.
Mr Morrison intervened last month to back Port Melbourne’s Prince Alfred hotel, after the nation’s medical regulator tried to block its campaign to give free beer to vaccinated patrons.
A range of incentives have been trialled overseas, including vaccine lotteries, while US President Joe Biden has encouraged state governments to offer $100 payments to people who are vaccinated.

MAJOR AUSSIE VACCINE PASSPORT MOVE The federal government today takes the first tentative step towards introducing a Covid-19 vaccination passport in a move that many industry groups have welcomed to re-open society for business.
But some said they wanted to be protected against claims of discrimination from potential customers who refused to show proof of a Covid-19 jab.
Services Australia, in a deal with Apple and Google, will now allow digital certificates to readily show Covid vaccination records on both iPhone and Android devices.

VIC TIGHTENS BORDER WITH NSW Victoria will tighten its border restrictions with New South Wales, introducing rules for people in the travel bubble between the states, despite no cases in the region.
It comes as the Herald Sun can reveal new details of the government’s rent relief scheme for businesses, with support to kick in for those whose turnover falls by at least 30 per cent.
There were two new coronavirus cases in Victoria on Monday; both were linked to current outbreaks and in quarantine while infectious.
Health Minister Martin Foley on Monday announced border residents could now only move between NSW and Victoria for six essential reasons. These include access to goods and services, including medical care and a Covid test, and for care and compassionate reasons.
NED-1859 State of our borders
Border crossings are also allowed for work, education, vaccination appointments and sport and exercise.
Residents cannot travel further than necessary for these activities, which means they must use the closest possible location.
Mr Foley said that under previous rules, border bubble residents on the NSW side could holiday in Lorne and shop in Bourke St. He said there had been no cases in the region but the tougher rules were based on expectations the outbreaks in NSW will “get worse before they get better”.
Authorities also scrapped limits for group bookings at hospitality, venues, tours and gyms.
More than 38,000 people are booked in for a first dose of the Pfizer vaccine at state hubs this week, with another 3000 appointments available.

HUNT SUPPORTS RAPID TESTING Australians may soon be able to have on-the-spot Covid-19 checks at pharmacies or even at home as the federal government backs the expanded use of rapid antigen testing.
Federal Health Minister Greg Hunt said he was “very supportive” of the technology and wanted it to be used more widely, including ultimately for self-diagnosis.
It comes as Australia’s expert immunisation panel has cleared the way for about 220,000 children aged 12-15 to receive the Pfizer Covid-19 vaccine from next Monday.
The vaccine will initially be available to children in that age group who have specific medical conditions — such as asthma, diabetes and obesity — or live in a remote community or identify as Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander.
Mr Hunt said the nation’s immunisation experts were likely to approve the Pfizer vaccine for all children over 12, possibly by the end of the month, once they received further data from overseas.
At least 18 rapid antigen tests are currently approved for use in Australia and can deliver results within about 15 minutes. The Therapeutic Goods Administration said a PCR test involving throat or nasal swabs remained the “gold-standard” because rapid antigen tests were typically less accurate, particularly for asymptomatic patients.
Scott Morrison will on Tuesday release modelling from the Doherty Institute and Treasury which informed the national cabinet decision last week to set vaccination targets of 70 per cent and 80 per cent to reopen Australia and reduce the reliance on lockdowns.
A lockdown in southeast Queensland has been extended to Sunday, as authorities scramble to contain a new Delta outbreak that has widened with 13 new cases, including 10 children.
The death toll from Sydney’s outbreak reached 15 as a cluster at an aged-care home grew to 20 cases after a “superspreading event” at a “Christmas in July” party.

Southwest Sydney and far west NSW have lowest vaccine rates in the state

Full text: About 14.6 per cent of people aged 15 and over are fully vaccinated in Sydney’s south west, while the North Sydney and Hornsby area had the highest rate of double vaccination with 26.9 per cent.
NED-4300-Geographic-Vaccination-Rates-Map
Data released by the federal government shows as of August 1, the North Sydney and Hornsby area, as well as the Southern Highlands and Shoalhaven are the most protected regions in NSW, as more than half the population has had at least one dose of a Covid-19 vaccine.
The Far West and Orana region had the worst vaccination rate in the state with 13.4 per cent fully vaccinated and 34.1 per cent with at least one dose.
The Hunter Valley excluding Newcastle were second lowest with 14.1 per cent fully vaccinated and Coffs Harbour next on 14.6 per cent.
Nationally 19.23 per cent of Australians are fully vaccinated, meaning many parts of NSW are ahead of the rest of the country.
Daily Telegraph – News Feed latest episode
This includes Sydney’s inner west with a fully vaccinated rate of 22.8 per cent, Ryde with 23.3 per cent, Baulkham Hills and Hawkesbury on 25.5 per cent and Blacktown is also doing well with 19.8 per cent.
The collection of vaccine rollout data has recently been overhauled after it was revealed some doctors were recording each jab based on the postcode of the clinic where it was delivered, rather than where the patient lived.
This had skewed the Australian Immunisation Register data, particularly in areas like the NSW and Queensland border towns where people regularly cross between states.
During the early stages of Sydney’s Covid-19 outbreak, Prime Minister Scott Morrison indicated he had seen the vaccination rates of then hardest-hit local government areas Fairfield, Liverpool and Canterbury-Bankstown, but the information was never made public.
NED-4300-Geographical-Vaccination-Rates-NSW
One source familiar with the vaccine rollout data said they believed there was some reluctance to publish the data if it showed stronger multicultural areas had a lower vaccination rate.
In February the government provided $1.3 million to multicultural organisations to help reach culturally and linguistically diverse communities, but advertising experts have repeatedly warned more was needed.
Vaccine transparency is expected to get a major boost on Tuesday when the federal government plans to release the full report by the Doherty Institute modelling different Covid-19 scenarios for Australia depending on uptake of the jab.
NSW Vaccine Locator
The report commissioned by the government found Australia would need to reach at least 70 per cent of the eligible population vaccinated for a significant easing of domestic restrictions.
But South Australian independent senator Rex Patrick warned this figure could be too low.
“When you translate those numbers back into the entirety of the population, including children, you get to numbers like 56 per cent, which is way too low compared to other jurisdictions,” he said.
“We’ve got a lack of transparency here and that needs to be fixed.”

NSW RECORDS 199 NEW CORONAVIRUS CASES Health officials have put more suburbs on notice for encouraging Covid-19 to “creep” after New South Wales recorded 199 new locally acquired cases of Covid-19, Premier Gladys Berejiklian has revealed.
“Unfortunately, 50 of those were infectious in the community and that‘s the number we’re really watching to try and get down as much as we can,“ NSW Premier Gladys Berejiklian said.
Of 199 locally acquired cases, 88 were linked to a known case or cluster, 67 were household contacts and 21 were close contacts while the source of infection for 111 cases is under investigation.
PAYMENT PLAN FOR JABBED AUSSIES All Australians who are fully vaccinated by December 1 would receive $300 under a Labor plan to fast-track the rollout and kickstart the economy.
The cash would be paid to anyone who has received both jabs, including adults who are already vaccinated and kids as young as 12 who will be able to access the vaccine from next week.
Labor leader Anthony Albanese will unveil the $6bn plan on Tuesday. If an election is held before December 1, a new Labor government would deliver the payments, but Labor would not send out the cash if elected at the poll that is more likely to be held next year.
“The government has failed on its two jobs this year, the rollout of the vaccine and fixing quarantine," the Opposition leader said.
“It needs to use every measure at its disposal to protect Australians and our economy.”
The Opposition will push Scott Morrison to introduce the incentive by December 1, arguing the government’s vaccine rollout plan shows enough jabs will be available to vaccinate 80 per cent of the eligible population by then.
Last Friday, the Prime Minister said the national cabinet had agreed 70 per cent would be the threshold to reduce the reliance on lockdowns and ease restrictions for vaccinated Australians.
Once the country reaches 80 per cent, lockdowns will only be used in “highly targeted” circumstances and vaccinated Australians will be exempt from all domestic restrictions.
The national cabinet agreed incentives may be offered in the phase between 70 and 80 per cent.
But in a statement, Mr Albanese — along with shadow treasurer Jim Chalmers and Opposition health spokesman Mark Butler — said the $300 offer “would be a further incentive for Australians to be fully vaccinated and would deliver a much-needed shot in the arm for businesses and workers struggling from lockdowns”.
“Vaccinations are a race Australians can no longer afford to lose,” they said.
“The faster this is achieved, the faster the recovery as we emerge from the lockdowns that are bleeding hundreds of millions of dollars a day from the nation’s finances.”
“Labor will continue to propose constructive solutions to protect the health of Australians and the economy.”
When asked about federal Labor’s proposal to offer $300 incentives for those who got the jab, Mr Andrews said supply was still the biggest issue facing the rollout.
Meanwhile, the idea has been slammed by Finance Minister Simon Birmingham, who has labelled it as “unnecessary and unlikely to work”.
“We looked at it, and the evidence says it’s unnecessary and unlikely to work,” he told the ABC.
“It’s clearly unnecessary in the sense that Australians are responding … They do want to get their vaccines.”
Vaccine Figures
Mr Birmingham said Labor’s plan was “insulting” to the Australians who were already doing the right thing and getting vaccinated, accusing Mr Albanese of “splashing cash and hoping for the best.”
Vaccine rollout chief Lieutenant General John Frewen met with business chiefs last month and discussed vaccine incentives, such as airlines offering free frequent flyer points.
But he said such incentives were not “as necessary” at the moment because there was “a lot of interest from the community about getting vaccinated”.
“I think perhaps later in the campaign when we’re starting to get to those people who are less convinced or a bit more hesitant, that may be a better time for incentives,” General Frewen said.
Mr Morrison intervened last month to back Port Melbourne’s Prince Alfred hotel, after the nation’s medical regulator tried to block its campaign to give free beer to vaccinated patrons.
A range of incentives have been trialled overseas, including vaccine lotteries, while US President Joe Biden has encouraged state governments to offer $100 payments to people who are vaccinated.

MAJOR AUSSIE VACCINE PASSPORT MOVE The federal government today takes the first tentative step towards introducing a Covid-19 vaccination passport in a move that many industry groups have welcomed to re-open society for business.
But some said they wanted to be protected against claims of discrimination from potential customers who refused to show proof of a Covid-19 jab.
Services Australia, in a deal with Apple and Google, will now allow digital certificates to readily show Covid vaccination records on both iPhone and Android devices.

VIC TIGHTENS BORDER WITH NSW Victoria will tighten its border restrictions with New South Wales, introducing rules for people in the travel bubble between the states, despite no cases in the region.
It comes as the Herald Sun can reveal new details of the government’s rent relief scheme for businesses, with support to kick in for those whose turnover falls by at least 30 per cent.
There were two new coronavirus cases in Victoria on Monday; both were linked to current outbreaks and in quarantine while infectious.
Health Minister Martin Foley on Monday announced border residents could now only move between NSW and Victoria for six essential reasons. These include access to goods and services, including medical care and a Covid test, and for care and compassionate reasons.
NED-1859 State of our borders
Border crossings are also allowed for work, education, vaccination appointments and sport and exercise.
Residents cannot travel further than necessary for these activities, which means they must use the closest possible location.
Mr Foley said that under previous rules, border bubble residents on the NSW side could holiday in Lorne and shop in Bourke St. He said there had been no cases in the region but the tougher rules were based on expectations the outbreaks in NSW will “get worse before they get better”.
Authorities also scrapped limits for group bookings at hospitality, venues, tours and gyms.
More than 38,000 people are booked in for a first dose of the Pfizer vaccine at state hubs this week, with another 3000 appointments available.

HUNT SUPPORTS RAPID TESTING Australians may soon be able to have on-the-spot Covid-19 checks at pharmacies or even at home as the federal government backs the expanded use of rapid antigen testing.
Federal Health Minister Greg Hunt said he was “very supportive” of the technology and wanted it to be used more widely, including ultimately for self-diagnosis.
It comes as Australia’s expert immunisation panel has cleared the way for about 220,000 children aged 12-15 to receive the Pfizer Covid-19 vaccine from next Monday.
The vaccine will initially be available to children in that age group who have specific medical conditions — such as asthma, diabetes and obesity — or live in a remote community or identify as Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander.
Mr Hunt said the nation’s immunisation experts were likely to approve the Pfizer vaccine for all children over 12, possibly by the end of the month, once they received further data from overseas.
At least 18 rapid antigen tests are currently approved for use in Australia and can deliver results within about 15 minutes. The Therapeutic Goods Administration said a PCR test involving throat or nasal swabs remained the “gold-standard” because rapid antigen tests were typically less accurate, particularly for asymptomatic patients.
Scott Morrison will on Tuesday release modelling from the Doherty Institute and Treasury which informed the national cabinet decision last week to set vaccination targets of 70 per cent and 80 per cent to reopen Australia and reduce the reliance on lockdowns.
A lockdown in southeast Queensland has been extended to Sunday, as authorities scramble to contain a new Delta outbreak that has widened with 13 new cases, including 10 children.
The death toll from Sydney’s outbreak reached 15 as a cluster at an aged-care home grew to 20 cases after a “superspreading event” at a “Christmas in July” party.

Full text: Queensland awaits indications on Sunday of how long the Brisbane region’s lockdown will last, and two more schools have been alerted for possible cases. The NRL and AFL have dealt with the Queensland lockdown by rescheduling. Earlier as NSW recorded 210 new cases today, Queensland authorities announced a snap, three-day lockdown of 11 LGAs stretching from the Gold Coast to the Sunshine Coast, amid alarm over a growing cluster in the state’s south east. Meanwhile, Scott Morrison has set a goal to fully vaccinate a further 10.7 million Australians by the end of the year under a national reopening plan that will reduce restrictions for inoculated residents, ­resume some international travel and make lockdowns less likely. But the situation in the US may be a sobering lesson.
COVID-19 Australia: Cumulative vaccinations by state
Staff reporter 11.55pm: Queensland wary of more Delta cases on Sunday
More cases of community-spread Covid cases in southeast Queensland are predicted to be revealed on Sunday as the Brisbane-centred region enters its first full day of its strictest restrictions so far of the pandemic, putting millions more Australians under lockdown.
Details of the southeast Queensland lockdown ordered from Saturday afternoon are here. It is currently due to end on Tuesday afternoon but may be extended. Two more schools have been alerted for possible cases.
In the Sydney region, more than 1300 police prevented crowds from gathering in the city and the surrounding suburbs, with officers patrolling the skies, the harbour and the roads, the Sunday Telegraph reported.
Police had an enormous checkpoint operation around Sydney, including closing the Harbour Tunnel in both directions and patrolling the harbour, to thwart any repeat of last weekend’s lockdown rally – successfully for Saturday.
New South Wales Shadow Police Minister Walt Secord says the police operation to halt attempted anti-lockdown protests in Sydney on Saturday was an “overwhelming success”. “Those far-right conspiracy theorists and anti-vaxxers crawled back under the rocks they live under.”Mr Secord told Sky News the decision to deploy up to 1000 extra police officers in Sydney to deter protesters was one he “fully” supported. “It was an overwhelming success, and I want to thank police officers who showed up today.”
The Sunday Mail (Qld) says Queenslanders have been warned to expect there will be new cases of community-transferred infections announced on Sunday.
Health officials are on the hunt for missing links to the latest coronavirus incursion into Queensland, and chief health officer Jeannette Young has acknowledged the virus could be “anywhere” in the southeast, it says.
Authorities have warned to expect an “enormous” number of Covid exposure sites visited by the latest cases, with bus routes, supermarkets, chemists and a TAFE building among the new venues added to the list, the Sunday Mail says.
Six community-acquired Covid cases were revealed on Saturday – all linked to a Covid-positive Indooroopilly State High School student.
They included the girl’s family members – both parents and two siblings – as well as a medical student who tutors the 17-year-old and a staff member from Ironside State School, where one of the siblings attends.
Two other Brisbane high schools on Saturday night told parents they had been touched by the outbreak. Brisbane Grammar School emailed parents saying that a student had tested positive to Covid-19, saying anyone at the BGS Spring Hill campus on July 28, 29 and 30 was ordered into home isolation until further advice was provided directly by Queensland Health authorities.
St Peters Lutheran College in Indooroopilly also sent out a late email to parents saying the school had been identified by Queensland Health as a potential exposure site.
The snap, three-day stay-at-home order plunged the tourism and hospitality industries into turmoil, forcing mass cancellations at hotels and resorts, restaurants and function venues which had to lay off staff and bin tens of thousands of dollars worth of produce, the Sunday Mail reported.
Queensland Tourism Industry Council CEO Daniel Gschwind said tourism operators were already reeling from lockdowns in the southern states and last week’s hard border closure with NSW.
Victoria, Tasmania and the Northern Territory have closed their borders to travellers from southeast Queensland, as 11 LGAs in the state are plunged into a three-day lockdown to contain the spread of growing COVID-19 infections.
A freight company in southwest Sydney has become a Covid breeding ground with 24 workers testing positive, the Sunday Telegraph says.
NSW Health Minister Brad Hazzard said smaller businesses are seeing higher levels of transmission than larger businesses. “On the logistics side we had one particular freight organisation where 24 workers have became positive,” he said.
“We need to make sure that in these smaller logistic organisations these owners understand the need for a strong Covid safe plan in the first instance, but then applying the Covid safe plan.”
This came as NSW recorded 210 new cases, with 81 in southwest Sydney and 72 in western Sydney.
Victoria has declared the 11 Queensland locked-down local-government areas red zones under the state’s border permit system. The lockdown applies to the City of Brisbane, Moreton Bay Regional Council, City of Gold Coast, City of Ipswich, Lockyer Valley Regional Council, Logan City, Noosa Shire Council, Redland City, Scenic Rim Regional Council, Somerset Regional Council and Sunshine Coast Regional Council.

The uptake of COVID-19 vaccines in the United Kingdom has left the business and tourism sectors “absolutely thrilled” with commercial prospects heading into the backend of the year, says Australian British Chamber of Commerce CEO David McCredie. “That double jab really is a ticket to freedom and has allowed the UK to open up,” he told Sky News Australia. “Talking to businesses there, they’re absolutely thrilled that this is happening, particularly the tourism industry. “We have a strong tourism industry here but the idea that this summer may not be quite as difficult as they first imagined, the tourism that might come back during this period but also into the start of the new year for the … so a very positive sign for the backend of the year for the UK.”
Agencies 11.05pm: Health, trade chiefs urge jab makers to spread help
Four of the world’s most prominent health, trade and financial organisations on Saturday implored Covid-19 vaccine manufacturers to prioritise doses for poorer countries to combat the “acute and alarming shortage”.
A joint statement by the heads of the World Health Organisation, World Trade Organisation, International Monetary Fund and World Bank said countries which have progressed far in vaccinating against the disease should release doses rapidly in favour of less fortunate nations.
“We reiterate the urgency of providing access to Covid-19 vaccines, tests and treatments to people throughout the developing world,” they said.
“In the area of vaccines, a key constraint is the acute and alarming shortage in the supply of doses to low and low-middle income countries, especially for the rest of 2021.
“We call on countries with advanced Covid-19 vaccination programs to release as soon as possible as much of their contracted vaccine doses and options as possible to Covax, AVAT (the African Vaccine Acquisition Trust), and low and low-middle income countries.” Covax aims to get donor-funded jabs to poorer countries.
The leaders said vaccine delivery contracts for poorer nations were being delayed, with less than 5 per cent of purchased vaccine doses having been delivered.
“We urge Covid-19 vaccine manufacturers to redouble their efforts to scale up production of vaccines specifically for these countries, and to ensure that the supply of doses to Covax and low and low-middle income countries takes precedence over the promotion of boosters and other activities,” they said.
They called on governments to reduce or eliminate barriers to the export of vaccines and all materials involved in producing them.

Labor leader Anthony Albanese will be forced into isolation until Tuesday, as the ACT implements stay-at-home restrictions for anyone who has been in 11 locked-down Queensland LGAs since July 21. Mr Albanese has been deemed an essential worker by the ACT government, so he is allowed to go to Government House, however, it is unclear if he will be able to hold press conferences.
Staff reporter 10.20pm: Postponed NRL matches to be played on Sunday
The NRL have produced a Super Sunday comeback — securing Queensland government approval to restart the competition with a triple-header at Brisbane’s Suncorp Stadium despite the snap lockdown.
NRL CEO Andrew Abdo and ARLC chairman have used their persuasive powers and strategic nous to assure Queensland health officials the game is safe to continue under unprecedented protocols and empty stadiums after being forced into the extraordinary postponement of three matches on Saturday, News Corp Australia Sports Newsroom reports.
The NRL’s revised round-20 schedule will also include two crucial matches on Monday night.
A triple-header without crowds at Suncorp Stadium on Sunday will kick-off with the Knights versus Raiders at 1.50pm.
Originally scheduled for Saturday night on Fox Sports, the much-anticipated grand final rematch between the Storm and Panthers will now be played at 4.05pm on Sunday.
The final match on Sunday will be the Dragons versus Rabbitohs at 6.25pm.
In order to make-up for Saturday’s postponed matches, Monday night football will return to Fox Sports with the Bulldogs playing the Titans at 6pm before the Sharks and Sea Eagles clash at 8.05pm.
FULL report is here.
Staff reporter 8.25pm: State’s CHO makes appeal to Queenslanders
Queensland’s chief health officer Dr Jeanette Young has issued an appeal to the state’s people affected by the new lockdown, which says in part:
“Queensland, I have always had faith in you. But I do not have faith in this virus.
“The latest incursion of Covid-19 into southeast Queensland is deadly serious. It is our biggest outbreak in months and risks being our biggest ever.
“The Delta strain of the virus is unforgiving, which is why we’ve placed southeast Queensland into lockdown until 4pm Tuesday.
“Right from the start, Queensland has gone hard and gone early when we’ve needed to lock down. It has worked. Your willingness to listen and take swift and strong action to help fight the spread of this virus has been our biggest asset in stopping the spread. Thank you.
“This time I need you to listen more carefully and adhere more closely to what we’re asking than ever before.’'

Vaccine doses rollout across age groups
Courtney Walsh 6.25pm: New AFL schedule set for Sunday
The AFL has managed to baulk another Covid-19 challenge by hastily arranging the evacuation of clubs from Queensland and its southeast regional lockdown on Saturday.
All three matches due to be played in Brisbane and on the Gold Coast this weekend will instead be played on Sunday in Melbourne as a result.
At one stage on Saturday, the AFL had more charter flights in the air than West Coast had goals to three-quarter time in their clash against Collingwood at the MCG.
Brisbane have landed in Launceston but will be confined to their rooms ahead of a matching against Hawthorn on Sunday.
Melbourne is on a flight back to the Victorian capital after landing in Brisbane, only to be turned around after an extended stint on the tarmac awaiting instructions.
Port Adelaide was in Melbourne preparing for a flight to Queensland but instead will play the Giants at Marvel Stadium on Sunday night.
The Swans shared a flight to Melbourne with the Gold Coast Suns, while Essendon are also returning home after spending a fortnight in Queensland.
There will now be three matches in Melbourne in Sunday, beginning with the match between the Suns and Melbourne, with matches also played in Tasmania and Western Australia.
The Swans will play Essendon at the MCG at 3.10pm, while the Giants and Port Adelaide clash at 6.10pm will feature as the second leg of a double-header at Marvel Stadium.
AFL clubs and broadcast manager Travis Auld said it had been a challenge to rearrange three matches given the short notice ahead of the lockdown in Queensland.
“We thank each of the six clubs, players, venues, broadcasters, umpires, officials and ticketing agents for their agility and collaboration this morning as we worked through rescheduling the three games and we thank respective state governments for their ongoing support,” he said.
“While the pandemic will continue to challenge us, the health and safety of those in our game and the wider community remains paramount and we again thank everyone associated with the game for their continued support of the 2021 Toyota AFL Premiership Season.”

New South Wales Health Minister Brad Hazzard says there has been a “real uptick” in the number of Sydney residents who are willing to get vaccinated. Mr Hazzard said before the Delta outbreak, there was “disinterest” among the population to get vaccinated but this has changed since the outbreak. “Five or six weeks ago before we had this current outbreak of the Delta variant, I think there was a level of disinterest in Sydney, in getting vaccinated,” he said. "What we’ve seen is a real uptick in willingness to have one of the vaccines, either one of the vaccines." He said the increased uptake can be partly attributed to pharmacies being able to administer vaccines. “I think particularly the opening up of the pharmacies has seen a rapid uptake in the 20 in the regions and the 50 in the city.”
Nicholas Jensen 5.30pm: Eight people arrested in Sydney crackdown
NSW Police issued more than 250 Penalty Infringement Notices and arrested eight people after thwarting a second anti-lockdown protest on Saturday.
At the conclusion of the operation, Deputy Commissioner Mal Lanyon said the vast majority of infringement notices were issued to individuals for breaching the stay at home orders by travelling outside their LGA.
More than 70,000 vehicles were checked by police at 11 designated traffic points stationed on major roads leading into the city centre, and 42 mobile units deployed across our roadways.
NSW Police said a man in his 40s was arrested at a home in Oatley after travelling on trains outside his LGA without a reasonable excuse. He was taken to Kogarah Police Station, where charges will be laid.
A further operation is planned for tomorrow and officers will have an ongoing presence to ensure there are no further protests and that the community comply with the public health orders.
“Today’s activities demonstrate to the community that NSW Police will not tolerate actions that present a risk to public safety and our ability to stop the spread of COVID-19. We continue to ask the community to work with police to ensure compliance,” said Deputy Commissioner Lanyon.

Chris Kenny 4.54pm: No end in sight for this lunacy
They thank us for staying home, and for getting tested. They thank us for getting vaccinated, and for checking in. And they thank us for snitching on our neighbours. In short, they thank us for our compliance – and we could do without all these thanks, thank you very much. They are, at best, patronising – and more likely manipulative and desperate.
We might prefer our politicians work sensibly through a crisis, taking tough decisions and accepting responsibility, rather than outsourcing to unelected officials the most draconian restrictions imposed on our society, while refusing to detail the “medical advice” or canvass any sort of public debate about costs and benefits – let alone defining outcomes.
Despite endless press conferences that catastrophise the situation daily, there is precious little clarity about objectives. Political leaders, health officers and media ignore how the vulnerable have been protected through the vaccination of aged care services and the over-70s – the nirvana we dreamed of last year – and instead focus on national adult full vaccination rates.
A major police operation is underway in Sydney with checkpoints set up at arterial roads heading into the CBD as officers crackdown on anti-lockdown protests.
A University of Western Australia study this week said we might need 90 per cent vaccination of the entire population to put lockdowns behind us. The Grattan Institute went for 80 per cent. But to what end?
Are we in this to make sure there are no Covid-19 outbreaks? The aim should be to give the vulnerable a chance to accept protection – and then get on with life as openly as we can possibly manage.

Agencies 4.35pm: China outbreak spreads as WHO sounds alarm on Delta
Mushrooming outbreaks of the highly contagious Delta variant prompted China to impose stricter Covid-19 restrictions on Saturday as the WHO urged the world to quickly contain the mutation before it turns into something deadlier and draws out the pandemic.
China’s most serious surge of coronavirus infections in months spread to two more areas Saturday — Fujian province and the sprawling megacity of Chongqing.
More than 200 cases have been linked to a Delta cluster in Nanjing city where nine cleaners at an international airport tested positive, with the outbreak spanning Beijing, Chongqing and five provinces as of Saturday.
The nation where the disease first emerged has rushed to prevent the highly transmissible strain from taking root by putting more than one million people under lockdown and reinstituting mass testing campaigns.
Worldwide, coronavirus infections are once again on the upswing, with the World Health Organisation announcing an 80 per cent average increase over the past four weeks in five of the health agency’s six regions, a jump largely fuelled by the Delta variant.
First detected in India, it has now reached 132 countries and territories. “Delta is a warning: it’s a warning that the virus is evolving but it is also a call to action that we need to move now before more dangerous variants emerge,” the WHO’s emergencies director Michael Ryan told a press conference.
He stressed that the “game plan” still works, namely physical distancing, wearing masks, hand hygiene and vaccination.
But both high- and low-income countries are struggling to gain the upper hand against Delta, with the vastly unequal sprint for shots leaving plenty of room for variants to wreak havoc and further evolve.

Nicholas Jensen 4pm: Premier acknowledges ‘shock’ lockdown move
Queensland Premier Annastacia Palaszczuk has asked residents of 11 council areas in southeast Queensland to do the right thing, as strict new lockdown rules take effect.
In a video message posted to Twitter, the Premier said she understood the snap, three-day lockdown would come as a shock, but going “hard and fast” was her government’s only option to ensure contact tracers stayed ahead of a growing Delta cluster, which rose to seven cases today.
“I know that news of a snap lockdown will come as a shock to many families, but we know that this Delta virus is incredibly contagious and we have to go hard and we have to go fast,” said Ms Palaszczuk.
“I’m asking everyone in those 11 LGAs to stay home and stay safe, and remember if you have any symptoms whatsoever you must go and get tested.”
Deputy Premier Stephen Miles earlier urged Queenslanders not to panic buy after they were given five hours’ notice of the lockdown, which would restrict them to within 10kms from their homes.

Christine Kellett 3.48pm: Locked down Queensland offered federal support
Vaccine supplies will be redirected to Queensland if required, Australia’s Acting Chief Medical Officer says, as greater southeast Queensland is declared a commonwealth hotspot.
Professor Michael Kidd said the Health Protection Principal Committee had held an emergency meeting today in response to the unfolding situation in Queensland and rising numbers in NSW, and both outbreaks remained matters of concern to the committee.
He said medical, financial and logistical support had been offered to Queensland at its request, including help with contact tracing. Disaster relief payments will also be available to those eligible for them.
“Asymptomatic testing will be made available by general practitioners and respiratory clinics, (and) we will reprioritise vaccine supplies if required,” Professor Kidd told a press conference this afternoon.
He said 40.5 per cent of all people aged 16 and above in Australia had now received a first dose of the Covid vaccine.
“This is a significant milestone in our response to COVID-19 — 18.7% of people aged 16 and above have now had both doses of a Covid in 19 vaccine, and are fully protected.
“More than a 200,000 doses of vaccine have been administered over each of the past three days. Over the past five days, 990,000 doses of vaccines have been administered, and we have now had over 4.2 million doses administered to people in Australia.
“Almost 80% of people aged 70 years of age and above, have now had a first dose of vaccine, and 41.5% of people aged 70 years and above have received both doses, and
are now fully protected.”

James Hall 3.08pm: Lockdown looms for Queensland
Queensland’s snap lockdown is due to take effect in little under an hour, Chief health officer Jeannette Young pleads with organisers of a planned protest to stay at home tomorrow.
Under what the government is touting as Queensland’s strictest lockdown yet, residents of 11 local government areas in the south east will only be allowed to leave home for the following reasons:
– To buy essentials such as grocery and medications
– To work if you can’t work from home. No school, except for those children of essential workers
– To exercise within 10km from home
– To seek healthcare, including to get a Covid-19 vaccination or to provide help, care or support
The affected LGAs are Brisbane, Ipswich, Logan City, Moreton Bay, Redlands, Sunshine Coast, Gold Coast, Somerset, Noosa, Lockyer Valley and Scenic Rim.
There will be no visitors to homes in those LGAs, and non-essential businesses will be forced to close down.
Read the full list of lockdown rules and their timeline here.
The Delta variant of COVID-19 is just as contagious as the chickenpox, the United States Centres for Disease Control and Prevention has warned. The latest warning comes as unvaccinated residents account for the bulk of new Covid cases and hospitalisations in the nation.
Nicholas Jensen 2.30pm: Show of force deters protesters in Sydney
A show of force in Sydney’s CBD appears to have had the desired effect.
More than 1000 police officers have been deployed around the city and surrounds in a bid to deter any further anti-lockdown demonstrations.
The strong police presence has been concentrated across Victoria Park, Broadway and George Street, where more than 3000 protesters converged last Saturday.
NSW Police have also established checkpoints at a number of arterial roads into the city, including the Princes Highway, the Pacific Motorway, and the Bradfield Highway, where they are pulling over cars to ensure drivers are within 10km of their homes.
Boundaries have been drawn between the West Link Road and The Crescent at Lilyfield; South Dowling Street and Todman Avenue at Zetland; Bradfield Highway at Milsons Point and New South Head Road and Ocean Avenue at Edgecliff.
Mounted Police and helicopters have also been mobilised across the city, with public health orders reportedly being dictated to residents from loudspeakers.
Earlier, it was announced all taxis, Ubers and other ride-sharing services would be restricted from entering the CBD, and train and bus stations were also being monitored.

Agencies 2pm: Chinese factory activity sinks to lowest level
Chinese factory activity weakened in July to its lowest level since the start of the pandemic, data showed Saturday, as manufacturing was impacted by slowing demand, weak exports and extreme weather.
The Purchasing Managers’ Index (PMI), a key gauge of manufacturing activity in the world’s second-largest economy, dropped to 50.4 in July from June’s 50.9, the National Bureau of Statistics said.
A PMI reading of over 50 indicates expansion, while below that figure suggests contraction.
The reading appeared to be levelling out between April and June, and July shows the first marked decline, making it the lowest PMI figure since February 2020, analysts said.
While the figure was worse than many forecasts, it was still above the 50-point mark that separates growth from contraction.
China’s fragile economic recovery is threatened by a recent resurgence of the Delta variant of the coronavirus that is threatening to dampen holiday consumption over the summer.
“On the whole, China’s economy continues to maintain expansion momentum, but the pace has slowed down,” said NBS senior statistician Zhao Qinghe.

Ellen Ransley 1.25pm: Vic authorities investigate traffic controller’s infection
Victorian authorities continue to probe how a traffic controller acquired Covid-19, after the state recorded two new locally acquired cases on Saturday
Both are linked to existing clusters, however one case was not in quarantine for their infectious period, but had “limited time in the community”.
The second case was in quarantine “throughout their entire infectious period”, a statement from the Victorian Department of Health said.
Health Minister Martin Foley said one of the cases was a personal close contact of the Newport apartments resident, who was moved “very quickly into hotel quarantine”.
The other is another Moonee Valley traffic controller, who shared a car with a previous case.
“He was isolated as soon as he was identified as a primary close contact, and had very limited time in the community,” Mr Foley said.
Victoria has recorded two new locally transmitted COVID-19 cases as the state enjoys its first weekend out of lockdown.
“But he did have an exposure site, which we posted last evening – the Woolworths in Devon Plaza, Doncaster, which was listed as a Tier 1 exposure site.”
Mr Foley said authorities were still trying to identify how the first traffic controller contracted Covid-19.
“Whilst we know that the genomic sequencing has linked him to the original incursions from New South Wales, we have yet to determine the precise acquisition source. We continue to work through possible links,” he said.
More than 32,000 tests were carried out on Friday, while 19,502 vaccine doses were administered.
There are currently 6654 Victorians isolating as close contacts.
Victoria has recorded more than 200 cases linked to the two outbreaks that jumped the border from Sydney’s deadly Delta cluster – one from a team of Sydney removalists who transited through the state and the other from a family who returned to Melbourne’s north from a NSW red zone.

Courtney Walsh 1pm: Qld lockdown postpones matches as AFL grapples with fallout
The AFL is still working through the fallout from the snap Covid-19 lockdown in Queensland which has forced three games to be postponed.
Tonight’s update is here.
The prospect earlier was that all three matches will be played in Victoria on Sunday or, perhaps, Monday night.
But that was dependent on the ability of clubs to evacuate Queensland before the lockdown begins at 4pm on Saturday.
Melbourne was to be re-routed to Perth, where they will enter quarantine ahead of a match against West Coast scheduled for next Saturday night.
They have landed in Brisbane but remained on the tarmac with the prospect of instead returning back to Melbourne.
Port Adelaide is in Melbourne as they await direction on where and if they will play the Giants on Sunday.
A press conference with coach Ken Hinkley was postponed as a result of the uncertainty.
It has been reported the Gold Coast Suns players have been sent to pack their bags with a view to departing southeast Queensland.
AFL clubs and broadcast manager Travis Auld said it was an evolving situation.
“The evolving Covid situation in Queensland has seen the state announce a three-day lockdown and, as a result, we have had to postpone three games scheduled to be played in Queensland in Round 20,” he said.
“These games will be rescheduled to be played at a time to be confirmed.
“While the pandemic will continue to challenge us, the health and safety of those in our game and the wider community remains paramount and we again thank everyone associated with the game for their continued support of the 2021 Toyota AFL Premiership Season.”

Glenda Korporaal 12.40pm: Rapid testing for CBA workers as companies pitch in
The Commonwealth Bank will begin rolling out rapid antigen testing for staff in some 30 branches in Covid hot spots in Sydney’s western suburbs next week.
The bank is also working on offering its 40,000 staff around the country Covid vaccinations at their workplace – possibly as soon as the next few weeks – once sufficient supplies are available.
The move is part of a push by corporate Australia to help accelerate the vaccine rollout in order to help re-open the economy and avoid costly lockdowns.
CBA chief executive Matt Comyn, who got his second shot of the Pfizer vaccine at Sydney’s Olympic Park on Thursday, said he believed that most of the bank’s staff were keen to get vaccinated.
The bank was working closely with the vaccine rollout task force headed by Lieutenant General Frewen to co-operate with the government’s rollout plan.
It was also offering its premises to the federal government if extra vaccine hubs were needed for the public.

Nicholas Jensen 11.45am: Taxis blocked from CBD, paramedic under investigation
NSW Police have responded to approximately 1500 Covid-related incidents in the state, 885 of which were reported through Crime Stoppers.
Deputy Commissioner Mal Lanyard said Strike force Season had deployed about 1000 police officers to central Sydney on Saturday to respond to any protesters. Taxis, Uber and other ride sharing services have also been blocked from entering the CBD in a bid to quell a repeat of last weekend’s scenes.
“Investigators have been continuing to investigate the events of last week’s protests with 85 people charged to date. Over 300 infringement notices have been issued and last night a 49-year-old man from the Central Coast was charged with criminal offences relating to the incitement of last week’s protest online.”
New South Wales Health Minister Brad Hazzard has announced the state has recorded 210 new locally acquired COVID-19 cases, with the majority of these in southwest and Western Sydney.
Regarding the NSW Health staff who attended last Saturday’s protest, Mr Hazzard said investigations were ongoing with police.
“I understand there was one paramedic and either an assistant in nursing or nursing staff and one other I am not sure about at this stage.”
“Can I just say how disappointed I was to hear about the process itself but the fact that health staff would go to such a demonstration … In a democracy people are entitled to demonstrate legally but it was not a legal demonstration. It was not approved by the police.”

Nicholas Jensen 11.40am: NSW records 14th death linked to latest outbreak
NSW’s Deputy Chief health officer Dr Jeremy McAnulty has confirmed a man in his 60s has died in his south west Sydney home from Covid-19, marking the fourteenth death since the beginning of the Delta outbreak.
Health Minister Brad Hazzard would not elaborate when asked whether the man had sought medical treatment before he died, citing privacy reasons.
NSW Health says there are currently 53 patients in intensive care — six aged in their 20s, four in their 30s, 18 in their 50s, 14 in the 60s, nine in their 70s and one in their 80s.
“But the older age brackets are actually having less numbers now … it is the younger people who are actually taking up places in our intensive care units in our hospitals,” said Mr Hazzard said on Saturday, as the state recorded 210 new daily cases.
Mr Hazzard also said contact tracers were facing delays in the southwest because of a language barrier.
“When you have a large number, and successive days of test numbers, particularly in communities where it is sometimes very hard to get simpler answers, it can take a while.”
“I met last week with the senior people among the tracer team and the case interviewers and what they were indicating was that translation is an issue for us … We need to have translators and we do have them of course.”
Mr Hazzard also confirmed that the man who was reported to have attended last week’s protest while infectious did in fact not attend.
“One gentleman was stopped at Central Station and turned around, given a $1000 infringement. It appears he complied with the police order, saw that he was doing the wrong thing and followed police instructions.”
“Unfortunately he did test positive but we believe he did not actually go to the demonstration,” Mr Hazzard said.

Brent Read 11.35am: NRL in emergency talks with Qld government
The NRL is locked in emergency talks with the Queensland government as they scramble to save the competition.
Tonight's update is here.
The Queensland government on Saturday morning confirmed 11 local government areas would go into lockdown from 4pm on Saturday afternoon as officials looked to stop the spread of the Covid-19.
Chief health officer Dr Jeanette Young said there would be no games played when asked about the NRL and AFL.
“No, there will be no football matches,” Dr Young said.
“So, no community sport, no professional sport, nothing for the next three days. Starting as of 4pm today.”
The NRL has three games scheduled to be played this afternoon including one in Rockhampton. That game could still go ahead but the two scheduled for Suncorp Stadium are in jeopardy.
ARL Commission chair Peter V’landys confirmed the game was locked in talks with the Queensland government as they sought exemptions to keep the competition alive.
The NRL sent a text message to their clubs urging them to instruct their players to return to their hotels.
They then released a statement confirming all clubs would return to level four by security protocols.
“All clubs have been advised to inform their players to return to the team hotels and remain at the team hotels until further notice,” the NRL said.
“The NRL is working with the Queensland Government, clubs and broadcast partners to determine the best course of action for today’s matches.”

Courtney Walsh 11.29am: AFL scrambles to relocate Qld matches
The AFL is scrambling in a bid to relocate the matches that were scheduled to be played in Queensland this weekend.
Melbourne was on the way to Brisbane to play the Suns on the Gold Coast at 3.10pm, but their plane has been diverted towards Perth instead.
Brisbane still has clearance to land in Launceston for a match against Hawthorn, but the restrictions they are travelling under have been tightened.
Port Adelaide was due to play the Giants on the Gold Coast on Sunday. Whether the Giants can relocate from Queensland before the 4pm lockdown and the match be moved remains to be seen.
The Swans were scheduled to play Essendon in Brisbane on Saturday night. That match is now off.
A game in the VFL between Southport and the Gold Coast was called off nine minutes into the match.
“There’ll be no football matches,” chief health officer Dr Jeanette Young said on Saturday.
“No community sport, no professional sport for the next three days.”

New South Wales Health Minister Brad Hazzard has announced the state has recorded 210 new locally acquired COVID-19 cases, with the majority of these in southwest and Western Sydney. Mr Hazzard said 81 of the new cases were acquired in southwestern Sydney with 72 cases acquired in Western Sydney. “Again, the focus, unfortunately, has been in that area and I'll just ask everybody in that local area to do what NSW Health has asked now on many occasions, and that is stay at home,” he said. “Unless you must go out, unless it’s essential that you go out … and definitely do not go and visit another household.” He said 198 people are in hospital with 53 of these in intensive care and 27 requiring ventilation. “That tells us that it’s an extremely serious disease and people are ending up in our hospitals in substantial numbers.”
Nicholas Jensen 11.01am: NSW records 210 new locally acquired cases
NSW has recorded 210 locally acquired cases of Covid-19 in the past 24 hours, with 21 of those infectious in the community and the isolation status of 120 people still under investigation.
More than 105,000 tests were recorded across NSW to 8pm on Friday.
“Again, unfortunately, of those 210 cases, by far, the majority were in southwest Sydney and western Sydney,” Health Minister Brad Hazzard has told a press conference.
“We had 81 cases acquired in southwestern Sydney and 72 cases acquired in western Sydney. Again, the focus, unfortunately, has been in that area and I’d ask everybody in the local area to do what NSW Health has asked on many occasions and that is a stay-at-home.
“Currently we have 198 people in hospital in New South Wales. Fifty-three of those are in intensive care, 27 are requiring ventilation.”
Mr Hazzard stressed the Delta variant was “partial to younger people” and continued to spread rapidly among people under 40.
Of the 210 locally acquired cases, 138 cases were people under the age of 40.
“My message to younger people is please understand this is a virus that you can be susceptible to,” said Mr Hazzard.

Nicholas Jensen 10.46am: This lockdown is different: Miles
Queensland’s Deputy Premier has urged people in 11 local government areas not to panic buy ahead of a three-day lockdown authorities say is the strictest yet.
Residents in Brisbane, Moreton Bay, Gold Coast, Ipswich, Lockyer Valley, Logan, Noosa, Redlands, Scenic Rim, Somerset and the Sunshine Coast will be subject to stay-at-home orders from 4pm today, amid concern over the rapid spread of the Delta cluster, first identified in Brisbane’s Indooroopilly yesterday.
Chief health officer Jeannette Young said students and staff who attended the Indooroopilly State High School — where a 17 year-old girl first tested positive — have been sent into 14 days of quarantine.
Queensland Health will now also place all students and staff who have attended Ironside School into two weeks of quarantine.
“Today we now have all five people in one household infected (with the Delta variant) … We know that we have another person today who is a medical student at the University of Queensland who is a tutor for that 17-year-old that we announced yesterday. She’s infected.
Dr Young said she suspects the medical student is the “index case” and took the virus back to the household where it spread.
“We are rapidly contact tracing the medical student. She has been to a lot of venues, a lot of places, at Royal Brisbane and Women’s Hospital, at the University of Queensland, at the Translational Research Institute at the PA, and also she has a sibling who works in a hospital.”

Christine Kellett 10.30am: Eleven Qld LGAs locked down, hunt for missing link
Queensland Health officials are searching for the missing link between two returned overseas travellers and the infection of a Brisbane medical student who is believed to have then passed the Delta variant on to an Indooroopilly schoolgirl, triggering a snap, three-day lockdown in southeast Queensland.
Eleven local government areas — Brisbane, Moreton Bay, Gold Coast, Ipswich, Lockyer Valley, Logan, Noosa, Redlands, Scenic Rim, Somerset and the Sunshine Coast — will be locked down from 4pm today, after locally acquired cases increased by six overnight, taking the current cluster to seven.
Chief health officer Jeanette Young said genome sequencing had traced the outbreak to two returned travellers — one from the UK, the other from Indonesia — who flew to Brisbane via Singapore on the same flight on June 29. Both served out their time in hotel quarantine at the Rydges Southbank. One then went home to Buderim, on the Sunshine Coast.
It has not been established how either of the travellers may have infected the University of Queensland medical student, who is then believed to have passed on the virus to the Indooroopilly teen, whose family is also now infected.
“Today, we now have all five people in one household have been infected,” Dr Young said.
“Then we know that we have another person today who is a medical student at the University of Queensland who is a tutor for that 17-year-old that we announced yesterday. She’s infected. And I suspect — although it’s hard to know because of the very rapid transmission time frames — I suspect that that medical student is the index case and has taken it into that household, and then it has spread within that household.”

Nicholas Jensen 10.07am: Queensland announces snap, three-day lockdown
Queensland Health has announced 11 local government areas will enter a snap- three-day lockdown from 4pm today, after recording six more locally acquired cases of Covid-19.
Deputy Premier Steven Miles said: “From 4pm today, the 11 LGAs that currently have mask-wearing requirements will go into lockdown.”
“This will be the strictest lockdown that we have had.”
Non-essential businesses will not be permitted to open, hospitality, including pubs, clubs, and cafes, will be restricted to takeaway only.
Cinemas, entertainment venues, hairdressers, gyms, places of worship will all be
closed.
Queensland Health says the restrictions will apply to anyone who has been in those 11 LGAs from 1am this morning.
“Even if you are no longer in those 11 LGAs, if you were here at 1am this morning, these restrictions apply no matter where you are now,” said Mr Miles.
“We have seen from the experience in other states that the only way to beat the Delta strain is to move quickly, to be fast, and to be strong. That is now the nationally agreed approach.”
It is now believed a 17 year-old Indooroopilly student who tested positive yesterday may have contracted the virus from a university tutor who came to her home. Other members of the family have since tested positive. The cluster now stands at seven
Chief health officer Jeanette Young said the tutor had attended many sites and authorities were now expecting “an enormous number of exposures” as a result, stretching all the way up to the Sunshine Coast.

Nicholas Jensen 10am: Vaccine debate turns into live TV shouting match
A debate about the government’s new national reopening plan has descended into an ugly shouting match between Liberal MP David Falinski and Labor MP Jason Clare on live television.
The conversation became heated after Mr Faliniski said the Labor Party and Opposition Leader Anthony Albanese needed to take a stronger stand against vaccine hesitancy in its party.
“We need the Labor Party generally not to endorse candidates like Michelle Raja, who’s spent a large part of this pandemic campaigning against what is a very safe vaccine,” Mr Falinski told the ABC’s regular Saturday Pollie Panel segment.
But Mr Clare returned fire, saying the Liberal Party had done the most to damage to the vaccine rollout because it told his electorate the AstraZeneca vaccine was not safe.
“How desperate is the Liberal Party that they’re now blaming the Labor Party for this vaccine rollout stuff-up?” Mr Clare said.
“I tell you who has done more damage to the AstraZeneca rollout than anybody else in the country that’s Scott Morrison … Remember that late-night press conference back in April? That scared the crap out of everybody in the country that AstraZeneca wasn’t safe. That’s why we’ve got vaccine hesitancy in my electorate at the moment.”
“If excuses won gold medals at the Olympics, Scott Morrison would be on the dais in Tokyo singing the national anthem at the moment,” said Mr Clare.
The pair shouted over each other for several moments, despite the hosts’ attempts to intervene, with Mr Clare telling Mr Falinski to “put a cork in it”.
Mr Faliniski also criticised the president of the Australian Medical Association, Omar Khorshid, saying: “I’d love to see the president of the AMA criticise doctors doing that rather than constantly criticising governments around Australia that are trying to do the best for their communities.”

Adam Creighton 8.35am: US provides a sobering lesson on vaccines
The US is limping towards President Joe Biden’s Fourth of July goal of having 70 per cent of American adults vaccinated with at least one shot of a Covid-19 vaccine.
Australia has a herculean task ahead to convince 80 per cent of the population to get vaccinated, a threshold the Grattan Institute says is necessary before lockdowns and masks can be consigned to the past.
The nation most responsible for the trifecta of vaccine miracles last year offers sobering lessons. US states, as early as May, started ­offering an extraordinary array of incentives to encourage Americans to get vaccinated.
The big states including California, New York, Illinois and Michigan offered a mix of cash lotteries with million-dollar prizes and for students the chance to win full university scholarships.
Other states were a little less conventional. Washington State offered Joints for Jabs (where marijuana is legal). The Snaxx for Vax scheme in Arizona extends to both joints and edibles.
Louisiana rolled out Shot for a Shot, offering an alcoholic beverage for every vaccination dose. Maine, a little more traditional, offered hunting and fishing licences.

Geoff Chambers, Greg Brown 8am: PM sets goal of 16.8m shots to Covid freedom
Scott Morrison has set a goal to fully vaccinate a further 10.7 million Australians by the end of the year under a national reopening plan that will reduce restrictions for inoculated residents, ­resume some international travel and make lockdowns less likely.
Following a marathon national cabinet meeting on Friday, the Prime Minister unveiled a new four-phase national plan that sets a vaccine coverage target of 70 per cent before the country can move out of the current suppression phase.
With more than 3.7 million people already fully vaccinated, a further 10.7 million will have to ­receive both jabs to reach the ­target of 70 per cent of all Australians eligible for the vaccine, or 14.4 million people.
A further 16.8 million vaccine doses will be required to hit the 70 per cent target.
National Cabinet’s vaccination targets are “not a silver bullet” out of the COVID-19 pandemic, according to Epidemiologist Professor Tony Blakely.
The reopening blueprint, based on health and economic modelling provided by the Doherty ­Institute and Treasury, outlines four stages ending in a post-­vaccination phase where Australians live with Covid-19 in a similar way to influenza.
The Weekend Australian ­understands there will be enough supply to jab all eligible Australians twice before the end of the year and the federal government is increasingly confident it can hit 80 per cent coverage by December, advancing the country to the third phase of the plan.

Chris Griffiths 7.30am: TGA defies US ban on ‘miracle’ disinfectant
A miracle, Covid-fighting disinfectant that lasts more than 15 weeks has achieved TGA approval in Australia despite a ban being slapped on it in the US this month.
SurfaceWise2, made by Allied BioScience, says it is the only product of its kind to be verified by a regulatory body to reduce germs by up to 98.5 per cent over 15 weeks. That includes Covid-19.
“The Therapeutic Goods Administration has listed SurfaceWise2 as a hospital-grade disinfectant effective against germs, bacteria and Covid-19,” Allied BioScience says in a statement.
The revised TGA listing mentions 98.5 per cent protection over 15 weeks. The TGA is the body that approves the drugs we take.
The revised TGA listing mentions 98.5 per cent protection over 15 weeks. The TGA is the body that approves the drugs we take.
Allied BioScience in a statement said the outcome was achieved through three-month pilots into the Australian healthcare and public transport sectors, and extensive independent lab testing. A spokesperson said this 15 weeks intended purpose clause had only now been added by the TGA, even though the original TGA approval was in 2020.

Sharri Markson, Liam Mendes 7am: Doctors in the spotlight over anti-AZ stand
Australia’s top health officials are growing increasingly frustrated with the medical regulator’s failure to rein in medicos undermining public confidence in the lifesaving AstraZeneca vaccine by perpetuating conspiracy theories about the jab.
The Weekend Australian can reveal some of the country’s leading officials are highly concerned that doctors, who have a strong social media following, appear to be flouting the legislated guidelines that state a registered health practitioner must not “contradict the best available scientific evidence”.
The Australian Health Practitioner Regulation Agency policies also prevent abusive online conduct, stipulating doctors “communicate effectively, courteously, professionally and respectfully with and about other health care professionals”.
Several vocal medical professionals have come to the attention of commonwealth and state health officials for aggressive anti-AstraZeneca commentary.
Robert Hackett, a Sydney anaesthetist, has also perpetuated a conspiracy theory that the Coalition is deliberately spreading Covid-19 in order to make money from AstraZeneca, calling for a royal commission into the vaccine and accusing the LNP of being a “crime family”.

Full text: Even then, face masks and some restrictions on gatherings would need to be reintroduced during danger periods to keep Covid-19 deaths below the annual flu toll.
Melbourne’s Burnet Institute, a world-leading medical research body, has undertaken modelling to help guide policymakers at the same time the Doherty Institute has done similar work for Australia’s national Covid cabinet.
Scott Morrison will today discuss vaccine targets proposed in the Doherty report with state leaders in an effort to reach a consensus on how to ease restrictions, prevent lockdowns and gradually reopen the borders.
The Burnet’s modelling – which was provided to the Andrews Government earlier this week – projects that about 3000 Victorians would die from the virus each year if Australia was to “let it rip” and abandon all measures completely after reaching high vaccination levels.
However, it found that once 95 per cent of those over 60, 70 per cent of those aged 12-59, and 70 per cent of under-12s are vaccinated Australia could safely reopen its international borders – provided the number of deaths and hospitalisations were balanced with intermittent restrictions.
Because current Covid-19 vaccines do not offer 100 per cent protection, the Burnet’s head of modelling Nick Scott said it was not yet possible to have open borders, no restrictions and no deaths at the same time.
Restriction Levels table
However, he said reaching the “95/70/70” vaccination levels could limit Victoria’s Covid deaths to a level of about 31 a year without resorting to lockdowns, border closures or the absence of major events.
“This gives us lots of hope,” Dr Scott said.
“It shows that we don’t need to be in the situation we are in forever. Once we get high vaccine coverage we don’t need to just keep pulling out the lockdown as soon as we get a few cases.
“We can actually just let it go for a little bit then slowly put the brakes on with a much more acceptable approach.”
Based on international data weighing up the effectiveness of Covid vaccines, as well as the impact of public health and distancing measures used in Victoria, the Burnet’s Covasim model provides several “acceptable” paths to reopen the country.
While the report says a highly vaccinated Victoria could manage five new Delta cases entering the state each day with contact tracing, it found measures would need to be introduced when average daily cases rose higher.
Deaths vs Restrictions
Rather than extreme measures such as lockdowns, the projections show masks, limiting outdoor gatherings to 50 and working from home where possible would be enough to address the risks during those periods.
Under the “light” restriction model, schools and entertainment venues could remain open, though pubs, restaurants and places of worship would need 4sq m density rules.
Major events such as the AFL grand final and concerts have not been included in the model, however it is expected they could continue during periods of higher daily cases provided plans were in place to limit the mixing of spectators.
Most crucially, Burnet deputy director Margaret Hellard said the higher Australia’s vaccination levels rose, public health measures would not be required as often.
“It is vital to have high levels of vaccine in the community because it protects people from severe disease related to Covid, but also it will impact on transmission,” Professor Hellard said.
“Once we have a high level of vaccination and we open up our borders, we need to understand that you may need to have some level of restriction.
“You can’t just say ‘we are all vaccinated, we’ll open our borders’. It has to be a combination of the two. This is us functioning in the world, this is going to visit family, this is going on holiday, this is us bringing in workers from the pacific region to pick fruit on our farms. These are the lives we live.”
The Prime Minister on Thursday said targets proposed in the Doherty report – yet to be publicly released – were achievable.
“That’s up to all of us to go and get vaccinated to achieve those,” he said.
“We want to be able to go forward. Countries that have launched into open have found themselves within days having to walk back. Now, we don’t want that.”
He said he was confident there would be “ample supply” of the vaccine over the next five months to ensure all Australians who wanted the jab would be able to access it by Christmas.
Mr Morrison said the Doherty modelling was being considered in conjunction with an economic analysis on the costs of lockdowns.
It comes as another organisation, the Grattan Institute, on Thursday released a report saying borders could reopen and lockdowns could end once 80 per cent of the population was vaccinated.
The institute’s modelling showed at this level, along with 95 per cent vaccination for the most vulnerable, severe cases would be rare while the virus remained in the community.

PATIENT FIGURES TO DETERMINE RESTRICTIONS Counting only the number of Covid patients in hospital rather than new daily cases could significantly cut the time Australians spend living under restrictions when high vaccinations rates are achieved.
With the Covid vaccines lowering the chances of a jabbed person having a serious illness, health experts in the most vaccinated nations are reducing their focus on non-symptomatic or mild cases in their policy settings.
The latest long-term Covid-19 control modelling from Melbourne’s Burnet Insti­tute also finds that switching to hospitalisation rates as a trigger for restrictions would safely allow Victorians to spend less time under restrictions in the future.
However, Burnet deputy ­director Margaret Hellard warned Australia was still ­nowhere near the levels of vaccination required to make the switch away from counting total case numbers.
Once 70 per cent of people under 60 and 95 per cent of seniors vaccinated against Covid, Australia may be in a position to change its focus, the modelling finds.
“One you are vaccinated, your proportion of people who will get sick and are hospitalised is markedly different to your number of cases,” Professor Hellard said.
“There are a number of countries who are asking the question, ‘do we look at the number of infections, or do we look at the impact of infections on hospitalisation’.
“But we have to reach high levels of vaccination before we can have the luxury of that conversation.”
According to the latest Burnet modelling, Victorians could still spend between 280 and 350 days a year under some restrictions despite having high vaccination rates if a seven-day average of daily case numbers continued to be used as a threshold.
But if the mild cases were ignored and the threshold was instead changed to having fewer than 100 Covid patients in the state’s hospitals, the modelling shows restrictions could only be needed for ­between 115 and 220 days.
“Without herd immunity if restrictions are lifted exponential growth resumes. However, using hospital usage as a trigger threshold for restrictions may lead to less overall time under restrictions while still achieving adequate health outcomes,” the report found.

Full text: Australians can move to the next step of the four-phase plan to normality when the nation is 70 per cent vaccinated, under a deal stuck in national cabinet.
Non-urgent elective surgery will be postponed at public hospitals from Monday in Greater Sydney.
Police commissioner Mick Fuller says any protestors who attend a rally on the weekend will be met with over 1000 police officers as NSW records 170 new Covid-19 cases.
COVID-19 Australia: Cumulative vaccinations by state
Joseph Lam 9.30pm: NSW Police begin checks ahead of protest
NSW Police are getting in early ahead of planned protests over the weekend, warning they’ll be conducting compliance checks on public transport.
The announcement arrived late on Friday after the state’s top cop Commissioner Mick Fuller delivered a warning earlier in the day.
“If you do (attend the protests), you will be met by up to a thousand police who will be ready to deal with you, whether that be via the health orders or other laws,” he said.
Cyber cops have spent the week monitoring online forums and social media ahead of the planned march. It’s expected that it won’t be as large as last Saturday’s protest, Mr Fuller said.
“Protesters are using chats and other forums so it has been more complex to work out numbers, but it is a very similar type of intel summary that we saw leading up to last week,” he said.
“We know that this is such an important time for NSW in terms of winning the battle against the virus and coming into town to protest is not the answer.
“So from our perspective we have to expect it will be a protest. It appears it will not be in the same numbers. But we can still look untidy and can still be violent.”
On Friday NSW Police also announced some 300 soldiers will join their ranks in conducting compliance checks across greater Sydney.
The additional ADF support will arrive over the next few days as local authorities increase their capacity on the ground.
“The increased resourcing was successful in boosting operational capacity and allowing police to check on more individuals who were subject to self-isolation orders,” NSW Police said.
“All officers and ADF personnel wear appropriate PPE and work under strict health guidelines developed in consultation with NSW Health.
“To this date no NSW Police officer has contracted COVID-19 after conducting operational compliance checks.”
Olivia Caisley 8.55pm: More than 400 Aussie kids stranded overseas
There are nearly 40,000 Australians stranded overseas of which 4,569 are considered vulnerable and more than 400 are children, a senate committee scrutinising the government’s response to the Covid-19 pandemic has heard, with the majority of people stuck in India and the UK.
Deputy secretary of the Department of Foreign Affairs, Tony Sheehan, told the committee on Friday there were 38,523 Australians registered with the department as seeking to return home.
The number of foreign arrivals was halved to 3034 a week earlier this month over a spike in Delta cases.
In India there are 10,268 Australians registered and in the UK, 6,405. In the US 2440 Australians have lodged their desire to return home and in Thailand 1078. DFAT also has 1018 Australians listed in Pakistan and another 994 in the Philippines.

Sophie Elsworth 7.50pm: Tech giants’ blitz on Covid untruths
Tech giants including Facebook and Google have removed hundreds of thousands of posts spreading misinformation about Covid-19.
At a Senate committee hearing on Friday into foreign interference through social media, Facebook’s head of public policy Australia, Josh Machin, confirmed it has teams focused on removing both misinformation and disinformation relating to the pandemic and Covid-19 vaccines.
In Australia Facebook has removed 110,000 pieces of harmful Covid-19 misinformation alone.
“Since the beginning of the pandemic we’ve removed harmful misinformation claims about Covid – 18 million posts (worldwide) along those lines, we’ve worked with 80 fact checkers around the world where we refer material to them,” Mr Machin said. “There are 167 million posts that we’ve applied a false label after fact checkers have looked at them … we’ve also been trying to direct people to credible and authoritative sources of information.

Yoni Bashan 7.05pm: Health staff face probe over anti-lockdown protest
NSW Health is investigating four members of staff who allegedly attended a lockdown protest in Sydney over the weekend, potentially breaching public health orders and the department‘s code of conduct.
The Australian understands health staff have been encouraged to report co-workers who are suspected of having attended the event, which saw thousands of people demonstrate in the Sydney CBD against ongoing lockdown conditions.
In response to questions, a NSW Health spokeswoman said: “NSW Health agencies are aware of reports of four staff who it is claimed attended the lockdown protest.
“Each report is being investigated and any individuals found to have breached the
code of conduct will be subject to appropriate disciplinary action.“

Paul Garvey 6.30pm: WA could ban shipping companies breaking rules
West Australian Premier Mark McGowan says the state could ban shipping companies that do not follow new Covid-19 safety precautions for their vessels.
Mr McGowan said his government expected all ships transiting through Indonesia or any other Covid-19 hotspots on their way to WA to take “all reasonable steps” to avoid the infection of their crews.
Under the new measures announced on Friday afternoon, shipping companies will not be allowed to undertake crew changes or make onshore visits in high-risk locations.
Shipping companies that do not comply with the rules, Mr McGowan said, would be barred from WA ports.
“If necessary, if the risk becomes too high, and shipping standards are not being met, we will deny entry to WA ports for incoming ships with suspected exposure to Covid-19,” he said.
Four vessels with Covid-19 infected crews have arrived in Perth in recent weeks, and another six ships that have transited through Indonesia are currently headed for WA.
Managing ships with Covid-infected crew had been a major logistical exercise that came at both a cost and a risk to WA, Mr McGowan said.
“Today’s announcement is a warning, a final warning, to any shipping companies that might put WA and their crews at risk,” he said.
Mr McGowan acknowledged that the new measures were tough.
“These are very robust and quite draconian measures, but they’re necessary,” he said.
“What I’ve found over the course of the last 18 months is that being tough works.”

Greg Brown 6.05pm: We can get to 70pc by year end: PM
Mr Morrison said national cabinet had not put timelines on when to reach each phase of the plan.
“Timelines are now in the hands of all Australians together with state and territory governments and the federal government. We get there when we get there and I hope we get there as soon as we can,” Mr Morrison said.
Prime Minister Scott Morrison is urging the population to speed up their second AstraZeneca jab only a month after their first which conflicts with ATAGI’s recommendations. The Australian Technical Advisory Group on Immunisation's advice was for those in affected areas to expedite times between doses but all others in New South Wales must wait for the suggested 12 weeks. Mr Morrison will head into another vaccine brawl when he heads into National Cabinet meets on Friday when each state government will look at how many Australians need to be vaccinated to end lockdowns for good. It’ll be the first time all leaders will see crucial scientific modelling on vaccination rates from the Doherty Institute.
He said he would “hope” phase B can be reached by the end of the year.
“There will certainly be the supply and the distribution and the opportunity to do that. But whether that is achieved is up to all of us,” Mr Morrison said.
He said he was encouraged with the higher uptake of the AstraZeneca vaccine, particularly from people aged under 40.
“I believe we can get there by the end of the year to 70 per cent. The UK has got there. Israel has got there,” Mr Morrison said.
“We’ve actually delivered and administered more vaccines than the state of Israel now in volume terms. So I believe we can get this done, but it’s not something that any one government, any one vaccination clinic, any one Australian, can achieve on their own.”
“If you want to get vaccinated, the AZ vaccine is there for you, it is a highly effective vaccine, as we’ve seen all around the world,” Mr Morrison said.
“It is the most recognised COVID-19 vaccine in the world, and it is there and available to boost the vaccination efforts right across the country.”
Mr Morrison said there has not yet been a decision on the vaccination rate to reach the final stage of the plan, which is living unrestricted.
“There is not a vaccination target set at this point. One was not recommended by the Doherty Institute. It is too hard to say what the situation will be down the track,” Mr Morrison said.
“It will depend on the booster program which we have ample vaccines for ...(and) the durability and the proof of those vaccines over time.
“There are too many unknowns before we can understand life as normal.”
Greg Brown 6.00pm: Next stage will end caps on returning Aussies
In phase C, caps on returning Australians will be abolished and more international students will be granted entry.
Vaccinated Australians will be able to travel overseas.
“We will lift all restrictions on out-bound travel for vaccinated Australians and we’ll extend the travel bubble for unrestricted travel to new candidate countries,” Mr Morrison said.
“We’re already working with Singapore to that end as well as specific countries, but there maybe others that present in the course of moving to that phase.
“There will be a gradual reopening of inward and out-bound international travel with safe countries - those that have the same sort of vaccination levels as Australia.”
Greg Brown 5.50pm: 70pc vaccination needed to limit lockdowns
Australians can move to the next step of the four-phase plan to normality when the nation is 70 per cent vaccinated, under a deal stuck in national cabinet.
Scott Morrison said stage two of the plan could be activated – which will see an increase in international arrivals and a limit of lockdowns - when the vaccination rates are reached nationally, with each state also needing to hit 70 per cent target before it moves out of the suppression phase.
Phase C of the plan – which will just about see an end to lockdowns and more international travel - can be activated under a vaccination rate of 80 per cent of eligible people.
“These are targets for all Australians to achieve,” Mr Morrison said.
“States, territories, working together, communities working together, individuals, GPs, pharmacists, Australia will get this done by working together. The targets are there for us all to achieve and for us all to work towards.”
Joseph Lam 5.30pm: Delta as contagious as chicken pox: CDC
The Delta variant is as contagious as chicken pox and its spread is unlikely to be stopped by vaccines, according to a US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention internal document, the New York Times reports.
The CDC presentation called for the agency to now “acknowledge the war has changed” as the variant is more transmissible than the viruses that cause the common cold, seasonal flu and smallpox as well as those causing MERS, SARS, Ebola, New York Times reported. The report suggests that those with weak immune systems should wear masks in places with little transmission of the virus
The news arrived after mask-wearing guidelines for the vaccinated both indoors and in public areas were introduced onTuesday, a decision which was reportedly made based on the new CDC document.
Joseph Lam 5.10pm: Elective surgery to be suspended from Monday
Non-urgent elective surgery will be postponed at public hospitals from Monday in Greater Sydney, excluding the Illawarra, Shoalhaven and Central Coast Local Health Districts.
NSW Health announced the new measures on Friday, saying that the decision was “part of its comprehensive planning for its pandemic response”.
All emergency surgery and urgent elective surgery will continue unaffected.
“Non-urgent elective surgery will be temporarily postponed at public hospitals in Greater Sydney, excluding the Illawarra Shoalhaven and Central Coast Local Health Districts, from Monday, 2 August,” NSW Health said in a statement.
“All emergency surgery and urgent elective surgery will continue unaffected. There is currently sufficient ICU capacity for all patients who require intensive care, with more than 500 beds available throughout the system”.
NSW added: “Postponing non-urgent surgery will support the state’s healthcare workers as they manage the demands of the COVID-19 response, providing increased capacity to support health services for the people of Greater Sydney”.
Angelica Snowden 4.05pm: Return of illegal Air BnB parties in Vic
Victoria Police say there has been a resurgence of illegal parties at Airbnb style accomodation in recent weeks despite an overall high level of compliance with the state’s Covid-19 rules.
Victoria police deputy commissioner Rick Nugent said partygoers had been busted on a number of occasions when neighbours dobbed them in.
“In previous lockdowns the (parties) were primarily in and around Melbourne... particularly the CBD,” deputy commissioner Nugent said.
“It’s occurring a bit more into regional centres now and we issue fines to people present whether it’s six people, 10 people or 12 people,” he said.
“(There are) a number of parties in homes still. So people are thinking they will hold a 21st birthday party or other parties. Neighbours call, we turn up.”
Deputy commissioner Nugent said following anti lockdown protests last weekend attended by more than 1000 people, 74 had breached public health directions and had been interviewed by police. Of those, five matters will proceed to court.
Police released the images this week of three protestors - two men and a woman - who set off dangerous flares at the rally in a bid to gather more information about them. Deputy commissioner Nugent said it “won’t be long” before they are arrested.
After NSW police commissioner Mick Fuller warned anti-lockdown protestors not to gather in Sydney this weekend, deputy commissioner Nugent said authorities would monitor a few pop-up protests planned for this Sunday in Melbourne.
Aside from the illegal parties and last weekend’s protest, there is a high degree of compliance with Covid-19 rules in Victoria including at the NSW border.
Out of about 60,793 border checks, 98 per cent had the correct permits to enter.
Joseph Lam 3.45pm: PM, leaders to give national cabinet update after 4pm
Australian state and territory leaders are expected to speak publicly at 4pm following today’s national cabinet in which further lockdown measures and reopening the nation’s borders were discussed.
NSW Premier Gladys Berejiklian earlier on Friday said she would use the meeting to call for an early release of her state’s vaccine allotment from the federal government.
In the cabinet, leaders were presented with preliminary findings from the Doherty Institute which was commissioned to create a roadmap to reopening earlier this month.
Also being discussed in the national cabinet are support payments, which Prime Minister Scott Morrison has indicated would be increased.
Olivia Caisley 3.30pm: More than 400 children stranded overseas
There are nearly 40,000 Australians stranded overseas of which 4,569 are considered vulnerable and more than 400 are children, a senate committee scrutinising the government’s response to the Covid-19 pandemic has heard, with the majority of people stuck in India and the UK.
Deputy secretary of the Department of Foreign Affairs, Tony Sheehan, told the committee on Friday there were 38,523 Australians registered with the department as seeking to return home.
The number of foreign arrivals was halved to 3034 a week earlier this month over a spike in Delta cases.
In India there are 10,268 Australians registered and in the UK, 6,405. In the US 2440 Australians have lodged their desire to return home and in Thailand 1078. DFAT also has 1018 Australians listed in Pakistan and another 994 in the Philippines.
Mr Sheehan revealed that 438 unaccompanied minors were still stranded overseas and 6,039 Australians had expressed a wish to only come back from September of this year.
As the Morrison government comes under pressure to build dedicated quarantine facilities to supplement the hotel system, Tasmanian Senator Jacqui Lambie asked whether Christmas Island could be used to house returning Australians.

Eli Greenblat 2.10pm: Woolies to have pop-up vax clinics for staff
The nation’s biggest retailer, supermarket giant Woolworths, is lending its considerable corporate muscle to ratcheting up the pace of the vaccine roll out and will create pop-up Covid-19 vaccination hubs at its distribution centres as well as provide eight hours of paid leave for staff to get the jab.
In an update to staff from Woolworths chief executive Brad Banducci, he said a speeding up of vaccination rates was crucial in protecting the community and getting out of lockdowns.
“It is now clear that accelerating the rate of vaccination in Australia is key to protecting our communities and loved ones and the easing of restrictions. It is also essential to ensuring our teams are able to continue to provide food to Australian communities - something they do with pride every day,” Mr Banducci said in an email to Everyday Rewards members sent on Friday.
“This is why we are advocating for all our teams to be vaccinated as soon as possible – as and when supply allows – and remain committed to playing our part in supporting vaccination efforts across the broader community wherever we can.”
Mr Banducci said Woolworths has been working with the State and Federal Governments, as well as other food retailers to understand how it can speed up the vaccine rollout for its team members working in food distribution centres and stores.
He said Woolworths would take the following actions:
• Establishing pop-up vaccination clinics at key food-related distribution centres in South West Sydney with assistance from the Federal Government, to provide teams working onsite access to vaccines.
• Store teams in the five most-affected LGAs in South West Sydney are now able to secure early appointments with help from the NSW Government at the nearby Homebush Vaccination Centre.
• Woolworths will provide up to eight hours of paid leave for full-time and part-time team members to receive their vaccination.

Jack the Insider 1.50pm: Poor man’s vaccine? AZ is a miracle
I received my second shot of the AstraZeneca vaccine a month ago. According to the TGA, I received two of the 6.1 million doses of the Oxford based vaccine administered in Australia as of the end of June 2021.
In my case, the first dose brought on a little pain in the deltoid muscle. I’ve described it in the strictly non-medical term as a bit of a dead arm, like a blow with a cricket ball from a medium pacer. Noticeable, discernible but no big deal. Play on.
Younger Australians are rolling up their sleeves in larger numbers and receiving the AstraZeneca vaccine. More than 300,000 people have gotten the jab since the prime minister urged people to discuss the matter with their doctor. One-third of those receiving AstraZeneca in the last four weeks have been aged under 40. ATAGI is now advising people of all ages in Greater Sydney to consider taking up the dose.
The second dose came and went without any identifiable adverse reaction, mild or otherwise with the possible exception of a bit of fatigue in the 24 hours directly afterwards but who knows, I might have just been tired anyway.
AstraZeneca has been portrayed as a poor man’s vaccine or worse a roll of the dice with recipients chancing their arm. Street corner advice from resident media experts has pushed it into the shadows. A month ago, the ABC’s Norman Swan suggested the vaccine would be withdrawn from the market if it were not for the pandemic, an odd statement at best and one grounded in a hypothetical alternative that cannot be proven.
With a national vaccine roll out the like of which we’ve never experienced and with an understandable level of hesitancy in the general community, language matters. Messaging matters.
But in a flush of ill-considered rhetoric, AstraZeneca became the bête noir of Australia’s vaccination program.

Ellie Dudley 1.30 pm: Man stopped from protesting tests positive, breaches iso
A man who was fined before attending last Saturday’s anti-lockdown protests in Sydney has tested positive for Covid-19, according to police.
NSW Police approached the man at Central station on the day of the rally, and fined him $1000 for breaching stay-at-home orders.
He tested positive for Covid-19 the next morning.
When NSW Police performed a check of the man’s house in Granville on Friday morning, they discovered he was not home.
“Subsequent enquiries revealed the man was not at work but was located at a home in Constitution Hill,” a statement from NSW Police read.
NSW police commissioner Mick Fuller said any protestors who arrived for a subsequent rally this weekend would be met with over 1000 police officers.
“The strike force from last week has locked up over 60 individuals and issued over 200 infringements and that will continue so if you turn up, you can expect the same sense of force,” he said.
Robyn Ironside 12.52pm: How to use frequent flyer points when you can’t fly
Qantas has found a way to help frequent flyer members use their points while waiting for international borders to reopen.
On Monday an online “points auction” will get underway, giving members the chance to bid on five offerings ranging from a luxury Queenstown holiday for four to a kids soccer clinic with Socceroos coach Graham Arnold.
There is also a private charter flight for 30 people to either Byron Bay, Hamilton Island or Devonport on offer, a session in the Boeing 787 simulator or two preloved Qantas A380 skybeds for the lounge room.

Rachel Baxendale 12.19pm: Vic virus response ‘based on bitter experience of 2020’
Victorian Health Minister Martin Foley says his state’s approach to managing coronavirus is based on the “bitter experience” of 2020, but that the choices NSW makes in managing its current outbreak are “a matter for them”.
On this day last year, Victoria recorded 549 new cases of coronavirus, ahead of going into Stage Four lockdown on August 2, with cases peaking at 725 (later revised down to 687 due to duplicate reports) on August 5.
There would be 801 deaths, 655 of which would involve residents of private aged care facilities - an outcome largely being avoided in NSW at present due to vaccination.
“I think I can say that the bitter experience, the painful experience, the huge loss that so many Victorians enjoyed this time last year, has burned deeply into our psyche, and has burned deeply into our public health response to teach us that we can all make a contribution, that we all need to build the best possible public health response we can, that that response has to continually take account of the changing evidence of the Delta virus and other potential variants of concern that might come along,” Mr Foley said.
Former Victorian Liberal Party President Michael Kroger says the difference between Victoria one year on from recording their highest daily total of COVID-19 cases shows “the virus is unpredictable”
He said he believed the experience of 2020 drove how the Victorian community “treat respectfully and carefully the threats that Covid-19 continues to cause us”.
Asked whether NSW should be adopting Victoria’s approach of mandating statewide mask-wearing at all times while outside the home, Mr Foley said: “Victoria has through bitter experience learnt that going hard and going early works, and a part of that is masks.”
“As the Burnett Institute’s report of last week indicated, masks played a really significant part in running down last year’s second wave, arguably up to about 40 per cent of the contribution according to the Burnett.
“We’ve shared (those lessons) with all the other states and jurisdictions, but how other states and jurisdictions pick that up is a matter for them.”
On Thursday NSW mandated masks outside the home in 11 western Sydney local government areas but the requirement does not apply elsewhere in the city.
Ellie Dudley 12.00pm: NSW vaccination rate ‘steadily increasing’
NSW Premier Gladys Berejiklian says the state’s weekly vaccination capacity is steadily increasing.
“Our capacity is gone from about 60,000 a week and we will be getting around up to 350,000 a week by the way we’re going in of all the mass hubs,” she said.
“We also want to take the jabs out to the community in south-western Sydney and Western Sydney, so we’re going to community leaders to get the jab to them.”
“We are really keen to make sure we make things happen and I will have further things to say about that this week.”

Ellie Dudley 11.58am: People ‘presenting to hospital not alive, but dead’
Some NSW residents have died from Covid-19 before NSW Health was aware of their positive reading, says Brad Hazzard.
The NSW Health Minister urged people who are experiencing symptoms to present for testing as early as possible to avoid disastrous scenarios.
“Very sadly, we are seeing more families coming in with a family member who is presenting not alive but dead. That is a terrible situation,” he said.
“We are hearing some families, particularly in southwest Sydney and Western Sydney, are staying at home when they have symptoms and not coming out and getting tested.”
NSW chief health officer Kerry Chant said she was “struck by the tragedy” of people arriving at hospital already severely unwell or dead.
“We’ve had a number of people that are presented to hospital severely unwell and sometimes dead,” she said.
“I just think that people need to know that with COVID, you can deteriorate quite quickly.”
“We have great health resources. I want to reassure the community that they will be treated with dignity and respect.”
New South Wales has recorded 170 new COVID-19 cases with 42 infectious in the community.
Rachel Baxendale 11.53am: Mystery over traffic controller case in Victoria
Victorian health department deputy secretary in charge of contact tracing, Kate Matson, said work was ongoing to identify how a traffic controller at one of Melbourne’s largest Covid-19 testing centres contracted coronavirus.
The unvaccinated traffic controller in his 20s returned a positive test result on Wednesday, having developed symptoms on Monday and got tested on Tuesday.
He had worked for two days while likely infectious at the Moonee Valley Racecourse drive through testing centre in Melbourne’s northwest.
The man lives in Frankston, in Melbourne’s outer southeast, and had visited his partner in the southwestern suburb of Newport.
“Whilst we have genomics back linking his case through to the original Ariele Maribyrnong apartment complex outbreak, we have not yet identified further links that I can report on today,” Ms Matson said.
“We are continuing with testing of his work and social and household contacts. I’m pleased to report that we have 48 of 58 results back from his colleagues at the Moonee Valley Racecourse testing site, and thus far they are all negative.
“We are conducting testing today at a Newport apartment complex that he had visited, and we are supporting those residents on the ground.”
Health Minister Martin Foley said genomic sequencing had “narrowed the gap”, in terms of building a picture of the traffic controller’s link to the Maribyrnong outbreak.
“But it hasn’t provided us that direct link, and we’re looking hard for that direct link,” he said.
Asked which part of the Maribyrnong outbreak the case was likely linked to, Mr Foley said he “wouldn’t like to speculate”.
“There’s a number of different prospects as to was it work related, was it social contact related, and we’re working through all of those aspects,” he said.

Rachel Baxendale 11.46am: Covid-19 fragments detected in Victorian wastewater
Victorian Health Minister Martin Foley said authorities were concerned about detections of coronavirus fragments in sewage samples taken from suburbs in Melbourne’s east and west.
A second detection has been picked up in the Camberwell area, in Melbourne’s east, for the period spanning July 26-29. This follows an earlier detection for July 25-27.
In Melbourne’s outer northwest, coronavirus fragments have been detected at the Caroline Springs water treatment plant between July 26-28.
This plant covers a long list of nearby suburbs including Albanvale, Burnside, Burnside Heights, Caroline Springs, Deer Park, Delahey, Hillside, Keilor Downs, Kings Park, Plumpton, Sydenham, Taylors Hill and Taylors Lakes.
“That is a lot of communities and a lot of people, but the wastewater detection is our early warning signal,” Mr Foley said.
“Please, if you are showing the slightest of symptoms, come forward and get yourself tested.”
Health authorities are not aware of positive cases in these areas.
The detections may indicate viral shedding from recovered cases who are no longer infectious, or they may be in quarantined close contacts who are yet to test positive, but authorities remain concerned that they could also be a sign of as-yet undetected cases who have been infectious in the community.
Ellie Dudley 11.42am: Year 12 teachers won’t be prioritised for Pfizer
Year 12 teachers will not be prioritised alongside students for the Pfizer jabs set to be delivered at Qudos Bank Arena, as Gladys Berejiklian urges them to organise the AstraZeneca jab for themselves.
The NSW Premier on Friday announced the sporting stadium in western Sydney would be used to administer 20,000 jabs to students in hotspot areas next week.
But teachers will not be getting the jab through the new program.
“There is nothing stopping teachers getting vaccinated now, AstraZeneca is available,” Ms Berejiklian said.
“It’s only two or three days of waiting, so if you book today, you are likely to get (it soon).”

Ellie Dudley 11.37am: Covid-infected person may have attended protests
A Covid-19 infected person may have attended anti-lockdown protests, says NSW chief health officer Kerry Chant.
Dr Chant said investigations were ongoing, but if it is revealed they did in fact attend, they would have been infectious while in the crowds.
“I am not aware of any cases that have arisen from the protest but many people may choose not to disclose that,” she said.
“We are following up one person to ascertain whether they actually had made it to the protest.
“Police did turn that person away and issued an infringement to them. We are currently working with police operationally to locate that person and determine whether they actually did subsequently attend the protest.”
NSW health authorities are urging Sydneysiders not to attend another anti-lockdown protest scheduled for Saturday.

Ellie Dudley 11.25am: ‘If you are not home, we will take action against you’
Police commissioner Mick Fuller says the “primary reason” he called in the defence force to help with the Covid-19 outbreak was to increase compliance checks in south-west and western Sydney.
It is not mandatory for the ADF to have been vaccinated against the virus.
“(We have) well over 2000 premises that we have to visit to make sure that people who have Covid or a close contact are abiding by the health orders,” he said.
Mr Fuller spoke to an incident on Friday morning of a positive Covid-19 case who attempted to go to work on a building site despite having contracted the virus.
“That sort of behaviour is exactly why we need strong health orders, law enforcement and defence, getting the highest level of compliance.”
An additional 300 Australian Defence Force personnel have been deployed onto Sydney’s streets after NSW Police Commissioner Mick Fuller submitted a formal request for assistance on Thursday.
Covid-19 positive patients or close contacts will “absolutely get a knock on the door” by NSW Police or the Australian Defence Force,” he added.
“If you are not home, we will take action against you, whether criminal or $1000 infringement.”
“From the perspective of the damage that this will cause if people do not listen, I think it puts us back into the lockdown and that is the key message and we are supported by the community, taking strong action against people who are not staying at home.”
Up to 300 ADF personnel will be sent to Sydney to help enforce compliance with the health orders.

Ellie Dudley 11.15am: Protesters urged to stay home this weekend
NSW authorities have urged anyone planning to illegally protest against lockdown measures to stay home.
The pleas come after more than 3500 protestors fronted the Sydney CBD last Saturday for a condemned anti-lockdown rally.
“Your actions will hurt, forget about the rest of us, but you could be taking the disease home and passing it on to your parents, your siblings, your brothers and sisters or anybody you might have limited contact with,” Premier Gladys Berejiklian said.
“Do not give those you love the most a death sentence.”
Police commissioner Mick Fuller said any protestors who arrived for a rally on the weekend would be met with over 1000 police officers.
“The strike force from last week has locked up over 60 individuals and issued over 200 infringements and that will continue so if you turn up, you can expect the same sense of force,” he said.
Ellie Dudley 11.11am: 187 in NSW hospitals with Covid, 58 in ICU
Up to 187 people are currently in NSW hospitals due to Covid-19, 58 of which are in intensive care and 24 requiring ventilation.
“I think this underscores the severity of COVID,” NSW chief health officer Kerry Chant said.
“It is critical that we continue to follow the help advice and work together to see these numbers drop.”
Dr Chant called on NSW residents to present for testing as soon as symptoms arise.
“ Tragically, we’ve seen people present very late for care,” she said.
“When people present late, we haven’t got the opportunity to provide them with the great care that our health services can provide.”
Ellie Dudley 11.09am: NSW Premier to ask national cabinet for more vaccines
NSW Premier Gladys Berejiklian said she would use today’s national cabinet meeting to call in the commonwealth for more Covid-19 vaccines, as well as early release of NSW’s allocated doses.
“It’s really important for us to get as many jabs in arms as possible because more jabs in arms means more freedom for all of us,” she said.
“I’ll be fighting for more vaccines but also calling for New South Wales to be given its proportion sooner, as soon as we can, so we can get jabs in arms.
“I don’t want any issue of holding back on vaccines for months. If the vaccines are in Australia, we want New South Wales to get its share because that will help us in keeping people out of hospital but also slowing the spread and a chance of freedom.”
Ms Berejiklian announced the Qudos Bank Arena would be used to vaccinate year 12 students in hotspot areas from August 9.
“There are about 20,000 students will be getting them done from the Monday to Friday, getting all those jabs in of those high school students doing year 12 in those eight local government areas of concern,” she said.
Ellie Dudley 11.02am: NSW records another 170 new cases
NSW has recorded 170 new locally-acquired cases of Covid-19 as infections in greater Sydney continue to surge.
At least 42 cases were active in the community for the entirety of their infectious period.
“That is the number we want to see come down in order for us to have that level of freedom that all of us are desperately wanting to have,” Premier Gladys Berejiklian said.
Up to 95,000 tests were conducted in the 24 hours to 8pm last night.
Ms Berejiklian said the state authorities expect the case numbers to “bounce around”, despite today’s cases being significantly lower than Thursday’s.
Rachel Baxendale 10.53am: Victoria’s three new cases linked to known outbreaks
Victorian Health Minister Martin Foley has given details of the state’s three latest coronavirus cases at his daily Covid-19 briefing.
The three locally acquired cases are all linked to known outbreaks and in people who were in isolation for the duration of their infectious period.
One is in a household contact of a student at Bacchus Marsh Grammar.
The second of Friday’s cases is a close contact of cases at the Isola apartment building in Burnley St, Richmond.
Mr Foley said this case lives on the same floor as three previous cases in the building - the first of whom was linked to the Ms Frankie/AAMI Park cluster.
The person has been in hotel quarantine for the duration of their infectious period.
Friday’s third case is in a Trinity Grammar staff member who had been quarantining on Phillip Island for the duration of their infectious period.
Mr Foley said the positive result explained previous coronavirus fragment detections in sewage from the island.
There are six people in Victorian hospitals with coronavirus, two of whom are in ICU, and one of whom is on a ventilator.
Mr Foley said authorised officers had made 1157 visits on Thursday Victorians in home quarantine.
“Overwhelmingly, well into the high 90 per cents, were all doing the right thing in isolating throughout,” he said.
Ellie Dudley 10.51am: Australia’s 80 per cent vaccine goal ‘achieveable’
The 80 per cent goal of Australians vaccinated is “achievable”, with “90 per cent” of Australians claiming they are prepared to get the jab, Grattan Institute’s Stephen Duckett says.
“The surveys show that 90 per cent of Australians are happy to be vaccinated,” Dr Duckett told Sky News.
The issue, Dr Duckett said, is some people are saying they are happy to take the jab, but “just not yet.”
If vaccines can be approved for two to 11-year-olds, he believes the goal can be achieved by Christmas.
“If not, it is going to take a bit longer, maybe by March,” he said.
“The goal is achievable, and the benefits are really good.”
The Grattan Institute’s Dr Stephen Duckett says a goal to get 80 per cent of Australians vaccinated is “achievable”, with “90 per cent” of Australians saying they are prepared to get the jab.
Ellie Dudley 10.23am: New modelling reveals jab rate needed to open borders
Australia would need 95 per cent of seniors and 70 per cent of people under 60 vaccinated against Covid-19 to open the borders, one of the nation’s leading research institutes has found.
New modelling from Melbourne’s Burnet Institute shows that without those targets met, Australia’s borders must stay shut or else risk thousands of deaths.
Vaccinated Australians will need regular booster shots to ward off emerging strains of COVID.
Even if the vaccination rates reach the stipulated levels, face masks and some restrictions on gatherings would need to be reintroduced during large outbreaks, the modelling found.
Scott Morrison will today discuss vaccine targets proposed in a report from The Doherty Institute with state leaders at national cabinet in an effort to reach a consensus on how to ease restrictions, prevent lockdowns and gradually reopen the borders.
Rachel Baxendale 10.06am: Victorian health update coming up shortly
Victorian Health Minister Martin Foley and departmental deputy secretary in charge of contact tracing, Kate Matson, are due to address the media at 10.30am
The press conference comes as Victoria recorded three new locally-acquired coronavirus cases on Friday, all of which are linked to known outbreaks and in people who were in quarantine throughout their infectious period.
Ellie Dudley 9.59am: NSW Premier to front media at 11am
NSW Premier Gladys Berejiklian will front the media for her regular press conference at 11am, following a record number of 239 cases for the state on Thursday.
She will speak alongside NSW Health Minister Brad Hazzard, chief health officer Kerry Chant and NSW Police Commissioner Mick Fuller.
More than 70 of Thursday’s cases were active in the community for their entire infectious period.
Lydia Lynch 9.35am: Queensland won’t change jab advice for younger Aussies
Queensland will not change vaccine advice for younger Australians after an international study found similar blood clot risks between the Pfizer and AstraZeneca jabs.
A study of 1.3 million Spanish people, published in the Lancet this week, found patients were more likely to develop blood clots from Covid-19 than vaccines.
Chief health officer Jeannette Young said she had been “aware of that data of course for quite some time”.
“The clotting I am worried about, that we are all worried about for AstraZeneca is different to that,” she said.
Queensland Chief Health Officer Dr Jeannette Young says it is “critically important” the state remains “very cautious” amid recording one new local COVID case.
“Lots and lots of Australians get blood clots in their legs - deep venous thrombosis, pulmonary emboli - all the time, it is actually quite a common health condition.
“This other condition, thrombosis with thrombocytopenia syndrome (TTS) is quite different.”
Dr Young agreed the risk of general blood clots was no higher after a vaccine, but TTS was a rarer and more worrying condition.
“We have not seen that specific syndrome with Pfizer or Moderna or the mRNA vaccines,” she said.
Dr Young has advised people under the age of 40 not to get the AstraZeneca vaccine.
“Anyone who is 60 years of age, or older, you are the most at risk group. We know that if you get infected you have a high risk of getting severe disease and potentially dying,” she said.
“We have plenty of AstraZenca vaccine available out in Queensland.”

Ellie Dudley 9.29am: PNG to destroy thousands of donated vaccines
Papua New Guinea will have to destroy thousands of donated doses of the AstraZeneca vaccine that have now expired.
Australia’s continued support of a vaccination rollout in the Pacific is of great importance and serves “our interests in the medium-term, and in the long term as well," according to Minister for International Development and the Pacific Zed Seselja.
It is estimated up to 15,000 doses of AstraZeneca expired in the country on Thursday, which were donated by the UN’s COVAX vaccine program.
Final figures will be provided by Papua New Guinean health authorities in coming days.
Around 82,000 people (9 per cent) of the country’s population have received the first dose of the jab.
The low uptake is understood to be due to widespread vaccine hesitancy and logistical issues.
Ellie Dudley 9.25am: CHO ‘struggling’ to work out how Brisbane 17yo infected
Queensland’s chief health officer Jeannette Young said she was “struggling” to understand how a 17-year-old girl in Brisbane contracted Covid-19.
State health authorities were alerted that the student of Indooroopilly State High School tested positive for the virus at midnight on Thursday.
“We will have to wait until we have genome sequencing results back later today to be able to work out from where she has got this,” Dr Young said.
“We do know that we have had 13 incursions of the virus into Queensland over the last six weeks, and we know any particular outbreak, someone can get infected, not have symptoms and then spread the virus to someone else.”
Dr Young said it was “critically important” for Queenslanders to remain cautious and get vaccinated.
Rachel Baxendale 8.40am: Victoria records three new local cases
Victoria has three new locally-acquired in the 24 hours to Friday.
All three cases are linked to the state’s current outbreaks, and all were in quarantine throughout their infectious period, the health department says.
Friday’s three cases follow seven on Thursday, eight on Wednesday, 10 on Tuesday and 11 cases on each of Monday and Sunday, all of whom had similarly been in isolation throughout their infectious period.
There were 12 locally acquired cases on Saturday, 14 last Friday and an outbreak peak of 26 on Thursday July 22.
The latest cases bring the total number of community acquired cases since two incursions from NSW emerged just over a fortnight ago to 108.
There are currently 200 active cases, including up to 10 active cases acquired overseas - although there were no new overseas-acquired cases in the 24 hours to Friday.
Several of those infected during the current outbreaks have recovered, and more are expected to do so in coming days.
The latest cases come after 43,542 tests were processed on Thursday, up from 42,009 on Wednesday, 35,863 on Tuesday and 24,340 on Monday, but well down from the July 20 Victorian record of 59,355.

LYDIA LYNCH 8.20am: Brisbane schoolgirl tests positive to Covid overnight
A Brisbane schoolgirl who tested positive to Covid overnight is Queensland’s only new local case detected overnight. The 17-year-old girl became unwell on Thursday and tested positive last night.
Chief Health Officer Jeannette Young said her diagnosis was “concerning” as authorities do not know how she was infected.
The girl’s family of five, who live at Taringa, are being tested.
Indooroopilly State School was closed for deep cleaning last night.
Health Minister Yvette D’Ath said the teenager was unknowingly contagious at school for two days. There are 43 active cases in the state.

Adria Calatayud 8am: Lancet publishes latest data on AstraZeneca risks
AstraZeneca says analysis of its Covid-19 vaccine showed no increased incidence of thrombosis with thrombocytopenia syndrome after a second dose.
The estimated rate of thrombosis with thrombocytopenia syndrome was 2.3 for every million vaccines, with incidence rates comparable to those among unvaccinated individuals, the Cambridge, UK-based pharmaceutical company said.
After the first dose, the rate was 8.1 per million vaccines, AstraZeneca said. No specific risk factors or definitive cause have been identified in the safety data, the company said.
AstraZeneca said the data was published in the medical journal The Lancet, and that its database included reported cases of thrombosis with thrombocytopenia syndrome globally up to April 30 occurring within 14 days of administration of the first or second dose of its vaccine. - Dow Jones

Ellie Dudley 7.40am: Dutton won’t reveal vaccine target to reopen borders
Minister for Defence Peter Dutton has refused to give an indication of what level of vaccination Australia needs to reopen international borders.
National Cabinet is set to meet on Friday to further discussions about opening up, based on modelling from the Doherty Institute.
Asked directly what percentage of Australians need to be vaccinated to permit international travel and prevent further lockdown, Mr Dutton said: “I’ll leave that to the PM.”
“The Doherty Institute has done a lot of work with universities and experts around the country,” he told Channel 9’s Today. “If you live in Queensland or in Victoria or elsewhere around the country at the moment, look at what’s happening in NSW.
“It could happen here tomorrow. We’re fortunate in Queensland at the moment but if you think you’ve got time to get vaccinated or you don’t think it’s going to happen, think again.”
Mr Dutton also voiced his support for vaccine passports as Australia looks to open up.
“We are going to have, I think, a situation where some people will refuse to be vaccinated,” he said. “The economy is not going to stay closed. We’ve not going to stop people seeing their family member or kids going to school because we’ve got a minority of Australians who don’t want to be vaccinated or don’t want to do the right thing.”

AFP 7.30am: Biden steps up fight against Delta virus surge
President Joe Biden stepped up actions to combat the spread of the surging Delta variant of the coronavirus, asking every US federal worker to either declare they are fully vaccinated against Covid-19 or wear masks and be tested.
“We have the tools to prevent this new wave of Covid from shutting down our businesses, our schools, our society as we saw happen last year,” he said in a speech on his administration’s new initiatives.
The White House said just ahead of the address that all four million federal employees and on-site contractors “will be asked to attest to their vaccination status.” Those who do not declare they are fully vaccinated will be required to wear a mask on the job regardless of location, physically distance from co-workers, and “comply with a weekly or twice weekly screening testing requirement.”
The moves stop short of a full-on vaccination mandate for federal workers - something that was being considered as the administration was mulling ways to protect federal workers and set an example for the private sector.
But Biden said the nation needed to remain vigilant. “We are not fully out of the woods,” he said, urging Americans not to make the issues of vaccination or wearing masks political ones.
“This is not about red states and blue states. It’s literally about life and death.”
Joe Biden's approval ratings have sunk to a new low according to a recent Rasmussen poll. The poll, which was conducted among 1,500 likely voters, found that 46 per cent approved of Mr Biden’s job as president, while 52 per cent disapproved The same poll found 42 per cent “strongly disapprove" of the president's first six months in office, which does not bode well for the Democrats in next year's midterm elections Democrats only hold a narrow margin in both the House and the Senate and face an uphill battle not to lose control of Congress next year. In the 2022 midterm elections, Republicans only need to make a net gain of five seats to regain control of the House and a net gain of one seat to take back the Senate.
Biden will direct the Pentagon to study adding Covid vaccinations to its list of required vaccinations for members of the US military.
He also called on state and local governments to offer $US100 as an incentive for holdouts to get vaccinated -- a nod to what the White House described as successful cash-for-jab efforts already implemented in some states.
The rules regarding getting vaccinated or masking up and getting regularly tested should not just apply to federal workers, with Biden set to urge private sector employers to follow suit, according to the White House.
“The federal government, we see ourselves as a model for other companies and other organisations, and that’s something that we don’t take lightly,” said White House deputy press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre .

Ellie Dudley 7.15am: Busy schedule for today’s National Cabinet meeting
National cabinet will meet today to discuss the matters of lockdown and reopening Australia’s borders. Topics will include support payments, which the prime minister has announced will be increased, as well as the vaccine rollout.
Modelling from the Doherty Institute regarding the roadmap to reopening will also be up for discussion. The modelling was commissioned earlier this month, and outlines the steps to be taken to rebuild the Australian economy and resume international travel.
Overseas, the UK about two weeks ago started to open up their borders, as almost 70 per cent of the population is vaccinated. Meanwhile in the Netherlands, the government was forced to reimpose restrictions after the virus resurfaced when borders were opened at a 50 per cent vaccination rate.

Ellie Dudley 6.55am: ‘Throw the book’ at the GPs charging for vaccines
President of the Royal Australian College of General Practitioners Karen Price says the “book should be thrown” at any GP charging patients for the Covid-19 vaccine.
Patients at the Blessed Health Care clinic in Campsie have been asked to pay up to $250 for a vaccine consultation on their first visit with a second dose costing a further $120.
Dr Price said that was “absolutely not on.” “It’s not in the spirit what we signed up to and it’s not what most GPs are doing,” she told ABC News Breakfast.
Calling on a “full investigation” into the matter, Dr Price said her understanding was the people charged didn’t have access to Medicare.
“The people arriving at the clinic were workers from a local construction site who are overseas citizens so there is some difficulty for them accessing Medicare,” she said.
“There was a language barrier so they found navigating the state hundreds where it’s available to them for free difficult. So there were some circumstances here and it needs to be thoroughly investigated and if there was any breach of the rules, absolutely throw the book at them.”

CLIONA O’DOWD 6.45am: This won’t be the last lockdown, warns Macquarie
Australia is at risk of several more months of lockdowns due to low vaccination rates, Macquarie Group has warned.
But the investment banking giant is hopeful the nation can hasten its vaccination rollout and expects much of the population to be vaccinated by the end of the year.
Speaking on the sidelines of Macquarie’s annual meeting on Thursday, chief executive Shemara Wikramanayake revealed a still-cautious stance on the near-term economic outlook, with Macquarie closely watching the government’s next fiscal stimulus steps.
Ms Wikramanayake and Macquarie chairman Peter Warne were also forced to defend the company’s role in the disastrous Nuix float, telling shareholders the bank’s own review found it had followed its “usual rigorous standards” in its handling of the IPO.
“The challenge for us in Australia is that our vaccination rate is low, and we’re seeing in places like the UK where there’s a higher vaccination rate and the Delta variant is right there, that they are actually able to treat it more like a flu”.
“Until we get some much greater vaccination rates, we will have to work with potential lockdowns,” she warned.

Ellie Dudley 6.20am: Police ‘well prepared’ for another Sydney protest
NSW Police Minister David Elliott says he is “very concerned” another illegal anti-lockdown protest will happen in Sydney on Saturday, but the police are “well prepared”.
About 3500 angry Sydneysiders fronted the CBD last weekend to rally against the strict lockdown measures the NSW government has imposed to fight the coronavirus.
With plans bubbling away on social media for another large-scale rally on Saturday, Mr Elliott said police have “redoubled” their efforts.
“NSW police are well prepared for any contingency tomorrow,” he told Channel 9’s Today.
“Now, we’ve got further support from the Australian Defence Force. The message is clear. Don’t go out tomorrow. Don’t attend any illegal protests tomorrow.”
On Thursday afternoon the NSW government called on additional targeted support from the ADF to fight the growing outbreaks in southwest and western Sydney.
Mr Elliott defended the government against criticisms they should have made the decision earlier. “We’ve had ADF support for 18 months. We’ve had 200 soldiers, sailors and airmen assisting us with this particular operation since the beginning of the pandemic,” he said.
“What we’re seeing is right across west Sydney now, an extra 300 but they will be supporting police on operations. This is an important message to the community, that all levels of government are taking this seriously.”
He added that the ADF would be present in the community for “as long as we need them for.”

Eric Sylvers 5.30am: EU overtakes US in Covid-19 vaccines
The European Union passed the US in Covid-19 vaccinations, with the continent inoculating people at a sustained pace and America struggling to convince vaccine holdouts to get a shot, as the Delta variant spreads.
The EU has given at least one vaccine shot to 259 million people, or 58.3 per cent of the total population of its 27 member countries as of Thursday, according to figures compiled by Our World in Data, an Oxford University project tracking the global vaccine rollout. The US has reached 56.7% of its population, equivalent to 189 million people.
The EU has boosted its figure by 9 percentage points in the past month while the US managed less than a 3-point increase. The vaccine drive in the EU and the US has gained new urgency in recent weeks as the more contagious Delta variant of the virus sweeps across the globe. Infections have risen quickly in both places, pushing political leaders and public health experts to seek new ways to get people motivated to get vaccinated.
In Europe, some governments are seeking to convince people by putting restrictions on those who don’t get vaccinated. France and Italy recently announced new rules requiring vaccination, a recent negative test or proof of recovery from Covid for people who want to partake in some aspects of daily life such as indoor dining at restaurants or going to the gym.
The measures haven’t been universally accepted, with people demonstrating against the requirements in France and Italy. — Dow Jones

Geoff Chambers 5am: Targeted lockdowns ‘to run into new year’
Scott Morrison and national cabinet leaders are preparing for targeted lockdowns to run into next year, with Treasury updating its assumptions on the frequency and economic ramifications of Covid-19 restrictions in response to the highly contagious Delta strain.
Scenarios prepared by the Doherty Institute outlining the optimal vaccine coverage required for Australia to begin opening up have been shared with Treasury officials, who have been tasked with modelling the economic costs of various health outcomes.
The Australian understands Treasury is updating its assumptions on the frequency of lockdowns and other Covid-19 restrictions, which will be provided to national cabinet leaders to balance the health and economic advice.
Prime Minister Scott Morrison says Greater Sydney’s lockdown “has to work” amid a shift in lockdown politics from the federal government.
Ahead of today’s national cabinet meeting at which state and territory leaders will be briefed on the Doherty Institute’s preliminary findings, the Prime Minister refused to commit to lockdowns ending by the end of the year, saying “no one can give those guarantees”.
“The virus is unpredictable and it would be irresponsible to do so,” he said.
The Morrison government’s cautious approach comes after countries with high vaccination rates – including Singapore and Israel – were recently forced to reintroduce lockdowns and Covid-19 restrictions in response to new Delta outbreaks.
Assistant Minister to the Attorney-General Amanda Stoker says there is tension between premiers who are responsible for the health response and the federal government that bears the economic brunt of what occurs.

Yoni Bashan 4.45am: Army called in to curb runaway Covid-19
Health officials have been unable to identify the source of almost 800 Covid-19 infections in Sydney’s latest outbreak, as contract tracers struggle to keep pace with the spread of the virus and new cases reach record levels.
After case numbers jumped to 239 on Thursday, up from 177 the day before, NSW Premier Gladys Berejiklian called in the Australian Defence Force to help enforce compliance with lockdown measures and tightened ­restrictions on the eight worst-affected local government areas.
New South Wales Premier Gladys Berejiklian admits the government’s strategy for dealing with the state’s current outbreak is "far from perfect" but says it has still prevented “thousands and thousands of cases”.
With the number of ­people ­infectious while in the community increasing, official figures show 779 Covid-19 cases remained under investigation late on Thursday, ­including dozens of infections stretching back a fortnight.
The source of 118 cases recorded in the first two weeks of July remains under investigation.
Among the tighter restrictions imposed by the NSW government on Thursday in the eight hardest-hit areas were mandated mask use outdoors and a 5km travel limit. Fines have been increased, and police given the power to shut non-compliant workplaces.

Glenda Korporaal 4.30am: Get Covid-19 vaccination or stay home: NAB
National Australia Bank chief executive Ross McEwan has told people who do not want to get vaccinated that they can “stay at home” while those who are vaccinated should be given more freedom.
In some of the strongest comments by a business leader, in an interview on Melbourne radio 3AW, Mr McEwan urged Australians to get vaccinated.
Mr McEwan said a survey by the bank found that 80 per cent of Australians were “happy to get vaccinated.”
“Ten per cent say they’ll swing and 10 per cent say, ‘Not for me, thank you’,” he said.
“Let’s target the 80 per cent who do want to get the job done and get the vaccination into their arms. Then work on the 10 per cent who can be swung across. Then let’s open this economy up because everybody’s had a chance.
“Let’s get 90 per cent of the population vaccinated and give them freedom. For those that don’t want the vaccination, well they can stay at home.”

Young drive massive push for AstraZeneca jabs

Full text: According to figures seen by this newspaper, the momentum is increasing, with 4839 of those jabs being administered on Wednesday alone — the same day the nation delivered a ­record 201,470 vaccine doses.
If the trends continue, it will mean that more than 20 per cent of the state’s daily jabs will have gone to under-40s heeding the calls by Prime Minister Scott Morrison and Premier Gladys Berejiklian to seek health advice from their GP and get vaccinated.
The news comes as worrying new data revealed that Sydney’s second Covid wave is mainly hitting younger ­people. Sixty-five per cent of cases recorded in the past week were in people under 40.
“We have to also remember that the communities of southwestern and western Sydney are also particularly young,” Chief Health Officer Kerry Chant said.
Young people are being hospitalised with Covid-19, including two teenagers currently in intensive care, as well as eight ICU patients in their 20s, and four in their 30s.
The age group with the most infections in the past week were 30 to 39-year-olds – representing 227 cases.
Experts say the numbers show that younger Australians are keen to do what they can to protect themselves and help get the country out of the ­pandemic.
Edgecliff resident Adelaide Bracey, 26, has booked in to get her first jab because she “just wants to do the right thing”.
“I want Australia to open up again and I want to protect my family and my friends,” she said.
Professor Lyndal Trevena, of the School of Public Health at the University of Sydney, applauded the positive approach by younger jab recipients.
“Until recently there was some pent-up demand because younger people weren’t eligible, but we have also hit that tipping point where the risks of the disease are seen to outweigh the very small risks of the vaccine.”
NED-4235-Australias-Vaccine-Rollout-Timeline
Daily Telegraph – News Feed latest episode
Provocate managing director Troy Bilsborough said the news about the uptake was positive because the NSW lockdown proved Australia’s economy — and the Morrison government’s political fortunes — could not afford for people to wait for Pfizer later in the year.
The news comes as national cabinet prepares to meet on Friday to discuss modelling to guide the nation’s reopening plan, which will be based on hitting as-yet undetermined vaccination thresholds.
Lieutenant-General John Frewen, co-ordina­tor general of the govern­ment’s Operation Covid Shield, said “the momentum is building” behind the vaccine program.
“We need to learn to live with this virus and vaccination is the way we do that,” he said.
“We don’t give in to Covid. We remain strong and determined to get back freedom.”

Greek on Halifax chef forced into hotel quarantine despite not having coronavirus

Full text: Joseph Vaccaro had already completed a week of home isolation when he was contacted by SA Health on Monday and told he would be forced into a medi-hotel.
He worked in the kitchen on the night of July 17 when a person infected with Covid visited the restaurant.
A staff member later tested positive.
Mr Vaccaro said staff who worked on the night, including cleaners, had been moved to hotel quarantine for their final week.
He said everyone had gone above and beyond to follow the rules and comply with requests, but described the move to The Pullman as an “absolute over-reaction” and a “complete farce”.
“We were more than happy to do everything required from our own home, which is exactly what we were doing,” Mr Vaccaro said.
“It was awkward, but it wasn’t unpleasant. Now it is totally unpleasant.”
He said he had complied with all requests from health officials – even going so far as to drive to Tailem Bend for a coronavirus test when The Greek was identified as an exposure site because the line-up at the Victoria Park testing station was so long.
“We have to buy our own bottled water,” he said.
I don’t even have a window to open.
“I’ve been locked in this airtight room since Monday.”
He said the kettle in his room was also replaced multiple times after it tripped the power.
Mr Vaccaro said the situation had also stressed his mother, who had Parkinsons and for whom he provided care.
Chief public health officer Nicola Spurrier has defended moving uninfected people to hotel quarantine on the basis that they had been at high-risk “superspreader” sites.
About 100 people were moved to medi-hotels.

Vaccinate our way to freedom Australia will need 70 per cent of people under 60 and 95 per cent of seniors vaccinated against Covid to open safely, one of the nation’s top research institutes has found.
Even then, face masks and some restrictions on gatherings will need to be reintroduced during danger periods to keep Covid-19 deaths below the annual flu toll.
Melbourne’s Burnet Institute, a world-leading medical research body, has undertaken modelling to help guide policymakers. It comes at the same time as the Doherty Institute has done similar work for Australia’s national Covid cabinet, which meets today to discuss the data.
The Burnet Institute’s modelling found once 95 per cent of those over 60, 70 per cent for those aged 12-59, and 70 per cent of children were vaccinated Australia could safely reopen its international borders – provided the number of deaths and hospitalisations are balanced with intermittent ­restrictions.
COVID-19 Stats - Horizontal with Lazy Load
Premier Steven Marshall said it could take several meetings of the national cabinet to work through predictions on vaccine thresholds, and it was unlikely binding agreements would be finalised on Friday.
“We are looking at those thresholds we need to get to, to the various stages where we no longer have lockdowns,” Mr Marshall said.
“We need to start the discussion, it might take several meetings, and if we need to have additional meetings or get additional information we will do that,” he said. “This is a very important decision for Australia and we need everyone around that national cabinet table to be playing their part to create a pathway for certainty for the people of Australia.”
Business leaders have called for a vaccine threshold target so they can make plans without the fear of sudden lockdowns or border closures.
Mr Marshall said Australia would learn from lessons in Northern Hemisphere nations which had relaxed restrictions at various levels. These include places such as The Netherlands, where restrictions were eased when vaccination rates hit 50 per cent, but a subsequent surge in cases saw them reintroduced.
“We need a careful and considered pathway,” Mr Marshall said, adding more stocks of vaccine arriving next month would help the rollout.
South Australia administered 13,770 vaccinations on Wednesday for a total of 844,675. About 40 per cent of people have now had one shot and 17.9 per cent are fully vaccinated.

Great wall in place as lifeline rolls out South Australia’s doors to its eastern border neighbours remain shut leaving border communities angry at the 40km buffer zone and returning South Australians waiting to have exemption applications processed.
The team behind the 5600-member Cross Border Call Out Facebook page, led by Paula Gust, is demanding extension of the 40km buffer zone with Victoria to at least 70km, an end to the requirement for weekly tests and more testing sites.
“When will the city decision-makers consider the regional people,” they posted.
“When will you accept and appreciate that we have never had a positive Covid test on the Vic-SA border?”
While SA appears on track to contain the Modbury cluster Premier Steven Marshall said he did not expect any immediate changes to the hard border with Victoria and that “NSW is a real worry.”
SA has a hard border with Victoria and NSW apart from border community buffer zones, while travellers who have been in greater Brisbane in the past 14 days are prohibited from entering SA.
The Modbury cluster has risen by two to 21 but both are in quarantine. Both are linked to Tenafeate Winery – a woman in her 80s who was already in Tom’s Court with her husband who had tested positive, and a man in his 40s who is related to a previous case and already in a medi-hotel.
SA Exposure Sites
SA health officials are examining the Victorian situation. “Obviously we still have pretty strong border restrictions in place – I think it is going to be a pretty messy period for some weeks to come,” Mr Marshall said.
“(But) we will look to reduce that restriction with Victoria in coming weeks.”
Mr Marshall said there were thousands of South Australians overseas and interstate who wanted to return but officials had to manage risk. About 1700 seeking exemptions to the hard border are in NSW.
“At the moment my primary concern is the health of the people of South Australia and getting people back to work,” he said.
“We will do what we can to process the applications but in a prudent way that is not going to unnecessarily increase the risk to this state.”
Almost 5000 small to medium-sized businesses have received $14.5m so far from the $100m plan to compensate them for the loss of income over the lockdown.
Businesses are eligible to receive $3000 but must prove their turnover was cut by at least 30 per cent over the lockdown. Sole traders are eligible for $1000 grants.
The Crows and the Power will fly back to Adelaide for Showdown 50 in round 21 using a “sterile corridor” with crowd numbers yet to be ­decided.

Data modelling shows Sydney lockdown could stretch until September

Full text: The modelling by the Populations Intervention Unit at the University of Melbourne predicted that with the tough new lockdown rules put in place on July 18, it could take as long as seven-and-a-half weeks from that date to push the community infection numbers down to an acceptable level.
That would mean the lockdown wouldn’t end until the second week of September.
The researchers said they ran the numbers 10,000 times to account for the high unpredictability of the Delta strain and found the median length of time needed from July 18 was 5.8 weeks, which would mean the numbers would abate by August 27.
The researchers put the benchmark for successfully suppressing the numbers at five daily cases, on a rolling 14-day average.
But when a reporter asked Gladys Berejiklian about the modelling at Wednesday’s press conference, she was dismissive.
“We see versions of lots of modelling,” she replied.
“Remember the modelling we were presented with 18 months ago about the number of cases and deaths which would happen in Australia?
“That didn’t materialise.”
The Premier was referring to the doomsday scenarios predicted by epidemiologists in the early days of the pandemic.
“Modelling has a role and a purpose, but what is the most effective tool for us to measure what the result looks like is our own activity,” she then said.
When NCA NewsWire put the Premier’s comments to epidemiologist Tony Blakely, one of the co-authors of the study, he reacted strongly.
“That is utter rubbish,” he said.
“This is a deliberate political ploy to discredit the modelling.”
Professor Blakely issued one of those early warnings in a March 23, 2020 report called “The maths and ethics of minimising Covid-19 deaths”.
That report predicted that the virus could kill 134,000 Australians if society continued to function as normal.
But in the interview on Wednesday, he made the argument that it would be unfair to disregard those numbers, because Australia didn’t allow society to function as normal, instead opting to take strong action to prevent the spread of the virus.
“I get annoyed with politicians that misrepresent modelling - it's utter deception,” he said.
Ms Berejiklian has said the lockdown likely won’t end until the number of people who are active in the community while infectious is pushed close to zero.
NSW reported 111 new local coronavirus infections on Wednesday and at least 60 of those had spent time in the community since they caught the virus.

Coronavirus: Only 40pc of Sydney people staying at home, modelling says

Full text: The modelling predicts that if 80 per cent of Sydneysiders complied with public health orders and stayed home, it would take a month for cases to reduce from the peak to below 10. However, if compliance fell to 70 per cent, it would take more than two months to bring the outbreak under control.
Covid-19 modeller and director of the University of Sydney’s Centre for Complex Systems, Mikhail Prokopenko, says Sydney’s current level of social distancing is inadequate for outbreak control.
Professor Prokopenko said that to see a drop off in case numbers in one month, Sydney residents must reduce their social interactions including shopping to one tenth of their normal activity.
NSW has recorded another spike in COVID-19 cases with 97 new infections today, with no changes to restrictions for now.
“Our estimation shows that with only 40 per cent of people staying at home, that would be inadequate even for a less transmissible variant, and for Delta it doesn’t even scratch the surface. It’s inadequate to bring the incidence down.
“If that trend continues then the incidence numbers will not start reducing, they will keep growing and then the suppression will not be achieved and the lockdown will continue.
“What would be required would be for everyone to reduce their shopping frequency or duration to just 1 out of 10 typical trips or hours. So, if someone spent 10 hours a week doing the shopping, now it needs to reduce to just one hour of shopping a week,” Professor Prokopenko said.
“The same goes for chatting with neighbours, and other activities which involve being around people outside your household.
“Crucially, 80 per cent of social distancing also means that many services currently deemed essential would need to be included under the lockdown restrictions.”
Professor Prokopenko said that when he ran his modelling, he was shocked at the level of non-compliance with public health orders.
“I totally was surprised because our previous model during lockdown last year was showing that we immediately switched to 80 if not 90 per cent compliance,” he said. “I thought it would be something in this interval.”
He said many of the 60 per cent of people who were active in the community were going to work. “Some of them may have a legitimate reason not to stay at home because they’re engaged in essential services,” Professor Prokopenko said. “Maybe 30 per cent are doing essential services and maybe the other 30 per cent are simply not complying.”
The University of Sydney modelling comes after similar modelling completed by the Burnet Institute found that tougher restrictions would likely be needed to control the outbreak of the Delta variant in NSW.
The Burnet Institute’s modelling found that if the current restrictions in NSW are kept in place, it would take at least two months for daily cases to fall below 40 and many more months for cases to reduce to zero.

New modelling from Burnet Institute suggests stronger Sydney measures are needed

Full text: The Burnet Institute modelling shows if the state is to control its current Delta variant Covid outbreak, stricter stage four restrictions, similar to those brought in during Victoria’s second wave, will be required.
The modelling also suggests giving up the greater Sydney lockdown would be “catastrophic”, given the urgency of rising cases across the state.
Under Melbourne’s stage four restrictions, there was an 8pm to 5am curfew (with the only reasons to leave home for work, medical care or caregiving), exercise was for a maximum one hour per day and no more than five kilometres from your home, weddings were banned, TAFE and uni study had to be done remotely and face coverings were compulsory outside.
The institute said the state’s original stay-at-home orders and updated restrictions brought in on July 9, combined with contract tracing, managed to avert a significant number of infections, hospitalisations and deaths.
But the modelling indicates the impact of the current restrictions have not been effective enough to control the spread.
“If stage four restrictions were applied now, the epidemic curve would decline sharply,” the researchers said.
While difficult to estimate how long it would take to move from current case levels to a seven-day average of less than five cases a day, they suggested about a month.
“Even if density restrictions are maintained for an entire year, without additional restrictions the model projects around 12 times as many deaths as influenza deaths in 2017 – one of the worst years on record,” they said.
The non peer-reviewed modelling estimates whether the stage three and stage four restriction levels used during Victoria’s second wave in 2020 would be enough to control the current Delta outbreak in NSW.
NSW restrictions introduced on July 9, limiting outdoor public gatherings to two people, requiring people to stay within 10km of home and allow only one person per household to leave home for shopping per day, are roughly the same as Victoria’s stage three – plus a mask requirement – restrictions.
Burnet’s simulation shows stage three restrictions, plus the mask rule, would stop daily case numbers from further increasing “but are unlikely to be sufficient to eliminate community transmission in an acceptable time frame”.
“There is little doubt that while the current strategy of NSW Health has impacted on the course of the epidemic, including their stay-at-home measures, mask policy and trace and track interventions, our modelling indicates more is needed to stop this infectious Delta outbreak,” the institute’s Professor Margaret Hellard said.
“NSW’s current restrictions are approximately equivalent to Victoria’s Stage 3+masks restrictions, so the good news is they still have room to move in tightening the public health response. Contact tracing has been beneficial and remains critical.”
Burnet’s Director and CEO, Professor Brendan Crabb said there was benefit in “going hard, going fast” in any pandemic response, but NSW still had public health levers they could use.
“Introducing more stringent measures like Victoria’s stage four-style restrictions would likely bring the outbreak under control and reduce the length of lockdown,” he said.
“Measures such as curfew and masks outdoors should also be seriously considered as these were a part of Melbourne’s stage four restrictions.”

Modelling plots best path to opening up and living with the coronavirus

Full text: That’s one scenario revealed in modelling completed by epidemiologists at the University of Melbourne, who have estimated case numbers and deaths depending on how many infected travellers are allowed in to the country plotted against vaccination rates.
Tony Blakely, who led the team that completed the modelling, based on Victoria’s second wave, said it was unlikely Australia would be able to fully open up to all travellers with no quarantine requirements before 2023.
Scott Morrison last week laid out a four-stage plan to Australia’s return to normal life living with Covid-19, and he has pinned each stage to as yet undetermined vaccination rates. But Professor Blakely said the milestones should be more nuanced and should include consideration of mitigation strategies such as masking and the ongoing role of contact tracing.
“Vaccines alone will not get us herd immunity,” Professor Blakely said. “We need to start thinking about what our risk tolerance is. One of the things we have the most control over is the number of people coming into Australia per day who are infected. The really good news is that we can actually make that pretty low.”
He said by requiring international travellers to be vaccinated and to have a PCR test before flying here, it would be possible to keep the number of infected travellers entering the country to just 0.2 per day if those travellers were coming from countries with low Covid-19 case numbers such as Vietnam. Australia could allow 4250 people from countries with low infection rates per day to enter the country, half the pre-Covid-19 volume, and still keep the number of infected travellers to 0.2.
Professor Blakely’s modelling assumes that the Delta variant or subsequent variants have a reproductive number of five or six, although he thinks six is most likely. Based on that level of transmissibility, and keeping the number of infected arrivals to 0.2 a day, Australia would be likely to record 3.7 cases of Covid-19 a day if 60 per cent of the whole population was vaccinated and some suppression measures remained in place. That would equate to 32 deaths a year.
If children were not vaccinated, case numbers at these settings would be higher at between 22 per day with 186 deaths per year.
If only 50 per cent of the whole population including children was vaccinated, applying the same settings, case number would be 16 per day, with 171 deaths per year. Deaths per year would drop to just 6.1 if 80 per cent of the whole adult population was vaccinated.
Professor Blakely said the government should consider what its risk tolerance is and how many travellers it will allow into the country after everyone in the community has had the opportunity to be vaccinated. “You determine your risk tolerance and you decide on your policy settings and what number of infected people coming into the country per day keeps us within that envelope,” he said.
“I’m very happy for people to have aspirational targets about what proportion of the population we want to have vaccinated. But I wouldn’t want the country to be held ransom to achieving a vaccine target before we open up. I think the time to open up is once all adults and children have had an opportunity to get their vaccine.”

Covid-19 vaccine targets to unlock the path to freedom

Full text: National cabinet agreed to a four-step blueprint on Friday for a phased easing of restrictions once Australians have met the new vaccine thresholds, which will be set using scientific modelling from epidemiologists at the Doherty Institute in Melbourne.
But, to secure the support of national cabinet, Mr Morrison was forced to accept demands from Labor states to slash the number of international arrivals by 50 per cent, amid concern over the more-infectious Delta strain.
The numbers of foreign arrivals will be cut to 3034 a week from July 14 with no end date in sight, dampening the repatriation hopes of 34,000 Australians stranded overseas and alarming business, which is warning of critical skills shortages driven by a “Fortress Australia” mindset.
The Prime Minister sealed the breakthrough agreement in separate late-night conversations with NSW Premier Gladys ­Berejiklian and her Victorian counterpart Daniel Andrews on Thursday, following a week of political conflict between the states and commonwealth over vaccine supply.
The broad details of the plan had been thrashed out by Mr Morrison during his two weeks of quarantine at The Lodge before being circulated to the states on Friday morning.
In his first in-person appearance since returning from the G7 summit in Cornwall and France, the Prime Minister said further restrictions on international travel represented a “prudent action while we remain in this suppression phase of the virus”.
Mr Morrison said the first phase of his plan would include new trials of at-home quarantine – most likely in South Australia – and the introduction of a vaccine authentication regime on the international border. Lockdowns would only be used as a “last ­resort.”
He rejected suggestions that the halving of overseas arrivals was the result of hotel quarantine system failures, after community outbreaks flared across the nation and plunged 11 million people into lockdown. Rather, it was “about the Delta variant”, he said.
“It’s simple,” he said. “The delta strain is more contagious, and so we’re just seeking to take precautionary steps to overall reduce the risk. I mean infection rates in quarantine are 1 per cent.”
Mr Morrison signalled the abandonment of any pursuit of an elimination strategy, making it clear he wanted to get to a stage where Australians had enough protection through vaccinations so that Covid-19 “would be like the flu”.
Australians would need to “learn how to live with those strains, learn about them, and modify our approaches as required”, he said.
Just over 8 per cent of the ­Australian population is fully vaccinated. The nation broke through the 8 million dose mark on Friday, making it one of the slowest rollouts in the OECD.
Medical experts welcomed the plan on Friday, but suggested the delta strain would require an unlikely vaccination take-up of more than 80 per cent to allow for the full unwinding of restrictions.
Australian Medical Association president Omar Khorshid said the plan recognised that the “road out of this crisis is vaccination”. “The four stages of the plan announced today show a ­future that includes a reduction in restrictions, a limited use of lockdowns, an increase in travel caps, and potential return of international outbound travel – particularly for those who are vaccinated,” Dr Khorshid said.
“By the final stage of the plan, we see a vaccinated population and as a result, a health system prepared to treat Covid similar to how we manage the flu.”
University of Melbourne epidemiologist Tony Blakely said vaccination was “not sufficient” to unlock restrictions and warned that Australians would need to practice Covid-safe living – such as masks, QR tracing and social distancing – for the next two years.
Business Council of Australia chief executive Jennifer Westacott said the plan provided hope.
“We are pleased to see plans to trial alternative quarantine options and the return of international students and economic visa holders,” Ms Westacott said. “We think we can be more ambitious and provide more incentive for getting the vaccine: for example vaccinated residents should be able to return to Australia as soon as possible. Also, vaccinated residents should be exempt from domestic restrictions.”
Australian Industry Group chief executive Innes Willox said it was a “major step forward that ­finally delivers some hope to the Australian community” but he was disappointed at the “unwelcome six-month 50 per cent cap on international arrivals”.
Group of Eight universities chief executive Vicki Thomson said she backed the plan’s inclusion of commercial trials for the limited entry of student and economic visa holders during the first phase. “It seems likely that we may not see significant international student numbers returning to Australia until well into 2022, which is not unexpected but still sobering for the sector – notwithstanding our first priority of keeping Australians safe,” she said.
Chief medical officer Paul Kelly said home quarantine could be more safe than the current hotel system, arguing there was ­“decreased interaction with staff”,
Professor Kelly said there would need to be a shift in the national psychology to “concentrate increasingly on severe illness rather than (on) numbers of cases”.
The slashing of arrival caps was a win for the Victorian, West Australian and Queensland governments, which had been pushing for a decrease until more of the population was vaccinated.
NSW Premier Gladys Berejiklian said she didn’t agree with the decision but would respect her fellow state and territory leaders.
While timelines under the four-step plan have not been agreed, Mr Morrison said a new phase could be entered once a yet-to-be specified vaccine threshold was achieved. He was optimistic all Australians would be offered a first jab by the end of the year. “I would hope that we were living in that second phase next year,” he said.
Anthony Albanese said the plan had come too late, arguing that the nation was already 18 months into the pandemic. “We need to fix the rollout of the vaccine and we need to fix the national quarantine,” he said.

Full text: While there were 11 new cases in NSW on Thursday – and three in Victoria – officials said a sense of serious concern from Premier Gladys Berejiklian and the state’s chief health officer, Kerry Chant, had eased as contact tracers managed to track the spread of Covid-19.
There was no discussion of lockdowns nor a request for ­additional resources, said sources involved in the briefings who were prevented from speaking publicly.
Ms Berejiklian and Dr Chant, however, stopped short of ruling out further restrictions if the number of cases that could not be linked to existing infections grew, with the Premier describing the outbreak as the “scariest period” since the pandemic began.
“It is a very contagious variant but at the same time we are at this stage comfortable that the settings that are in place are the appropriate settings,” Ms Berejiklian said.
Employer groups hailed the ­deferral of a citywide lockdown, describing it as “proportionate and balanced”, although some epidemiologists warned the NSW ­government was pursuing a high-risk strategy and urgently needed to ­consider more restrictions.
There are now 49 Covid-19 cases in the city since a limousine driver contracted the virus transporting airline crew and tested positive on June 16.
Investigations into that case are ongoing, with police examining the conduct of the driver and limousine company.
All but one of the cases recorded on Thursday were linked to a known source, with the largest cluster – now 36 infections – still concentrated in Sydney’s east.
Of most concern are three cases whose origins remain unidentified, but that number remained too low to justify a full-scale lockdown to halt the movement of people and catch up on tracing efforts, Dr Chant said.
“I am not dismissing any situation, but that is the purpose of that strategy, to get it to a pause. We are not in that situation,” she said. “You have a sudden surge of cases and you want everybody to stay in the same place, and that ­allows you to get any backlog of any contact tracing.”
The unlinked cases include a hairdresser, a nine-year-old child from St Charles Primary School in Waverley, and a healthcare ­worker – all in the city’s eastern suburbs. No cases have been linked to the nine-year-old but three contacts of the hairdresser have tested positive.
Victoria declared a swath of Greater Sydney and surrounding regions as a red zone – stopping all non-essential travel – as restrictions on Melbourne eased on Thursday.
A man in his 60s, who was visiting his daughter in Sydney and ­returned to Melbourne on Sunday tested positive to Covid-19 and on Thursday his co-worker at a Sandringham drycleaner was also confirmed to have the coronavirus.
As NSW officials worked to contain the spread of cases, concerns were heightening around a potential cluster that had emerged in parliament following a positive test recorded by Agriculture Minister Adam Marshall.
Mr Marshall attended a dinner with three NSW Nationals colleagues at Christo’s Pizza in Paddington on Monday only to learn of his exposure to the virus the ­following evening. By then he had attended a joint-party room meeting, question time, and a budget night dinner.
Ms Berejiklian attended the same budget night dinner as Mr Marshall, along with a large number of cabinet members and government MPs, but said on Thursday that she was not required to self-isolate for 14 days because she had been deemed a “casual contact”.
There were 48,402 tests reported to 8pm on Wednesday, an ­increase from the previous day’s total of 44,640, though Sydney residents have been urged to raise this number further.
Economists say it is too early to gauge the impact from the existing but limited restrictions, but they were likely to be mild.
EY chief economist Joanne Masters said: “We know the most economically impactful thing is social distancing, followed by the closure of domestic borders, followed by international border ­restrictions.
“We have been seeing a pick-up in interstate travel, but every time you have a border closure it slows that down. It’s the confidence factor.”
The northern beaches Covid-19 outbreak and lockdown cost the economy $3.2bn in lost working hours in December, according to KPMG modelling.
Helen Waldron, from employer organisation Australian Industry Group, said the NSW approached showed it was possible to achieve “the same health results without the much more widespread disruption to normal economic activity” in other states.
“Any approach to Covid-19 needs to achieve the desired health outcomes with the least disruption to normal economic and social activity and we urge the Premier to hold her ground against calls for lockdowns which would damage the state’s economy and put peoples’ livelihoods at risk,” Ms Waldron said.
Epidemiologists and public health experts remain sceptical about whether health authorities will be able to contain the spread of Covid-19 without further ­restrictions.
“I think the chance of them getting this without a lockdown is less than 50-50,” said University of Melbourne Epidemiologist Tony Blakely.
Professor Blakely said leaving gyms open, considering the ­fleeting transmissions that had taken place, was “bonkers” and called for them to be shut.
He also urged tighter limits on home visitors ahead of the ­weekend. “I would be very impressed and surprised if they get through this without a lockdown,” he said.
Mary-Louise McLaws, a World Health Organisation adviser, said: “One of the problems is NSW does not like to go into lockdown, as they don’t like to interfere with the business sector.
“As someone who has had ­experience with an outbreak I’ve seen that going in earlier has a way better outcome than waiting too late,” Professor McLaws said.
“We humans who have ­Saturday and Sunday off, that’s when a lot of us go out, go ­shopping or as we’ve seen fly to interstate.”

Full text: Experts say the research, developed by the Burnet Institute, has highlighted the need to preserve public health measures as a key line of defence against coronavirus even with high vaccination coverage.
The COVASIM mathematical modelling also suggested Australia was unlikely to achieve herd immunity with current levels of vaccine hesitancy and the higher infectiousness of new variants.
Burnet Institute head of modelling Nick Scott said public health measures, such as lockdowns, social distancing, mask wearing and the use of QR codes, would need to continue to prevent deaths.
“Without herd immunity, if we stopped taking a public health approach and allowed the virus to spread, it is likely to infect a large proportion of the community,” Dr Scott said.
“Those who are vaccinated would be protected and may only experience mild or no symptoms.
“But among those not vaccinated – possibly up to 30 per cent of the community – we could see a large number of hospitalisations and deaths as well as many cases of ‘long Covid’.”
The modelling presented scenarios projecting coronavirus infections, hospitalisations and deaths one year after new infections enter the community, even with a vaccinated population.
One scenario created by Dr Scott and his team assumed a 50 per cent vaccine efficacy in preventing infections and a 93 per cent efficacy at preventing deaths among people who did become infected.
That would make it a virus that was 1.5 times as infectious as the one in Victoria between June and November 2020 and where 80 per cent of people aged over 60 and 70 per cent of people aged younger than 60 were eventually vaccinated.
“We found that if the virus enters the community when 60 per cent vaccine coverage has been reached and is left unchecked, we could see 4885 deaths in Victoria within a year if no public health responses are introduced,” Dr Scott said.
“If we get peak vaccination coverage up to 95 per cent, the number of deaths reduces to 1346.”
The modelling showed that if vaccine efficacy against infection was 75 per cent, with the same parameters in the scenario described, the number of deaths after one year could be less than 1000.
But if the virus was more infectious, deaths would remain at very high levels, even if the vaccine was highly efficacious, the researchers said.
Global COVID-19 vaccine inequality has created a two-track pandemic, according to World Health Organisation Director General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus. He says while Western countries are being protected with vaccines, poorer nations are still exposed. The WHO is calling on leaders to commit to share doses by June and July as G7 leaders prepare to meet this week.
Burnet Institute deputy director and leading infectious diseases and public health specialist Margaret Hellard said the modelling was a “worst-case” scenario and showed what could happen if governments didn’t intervene and “let the virus run” even with moderate-to-high vaccine coverage.
She said with 30 per cent of Australians indicating they do not want to be vaccinated, public health measures must remain if governments want to prevent thousands of Covid-19 deaths.
“We need much higher vaccine coverage to reduce infections and severe infections,” Professor Hellard said.
“Although vaccinations might not stop every outbreak, they will reduce the likelihood of outbreaks occurring, reduce the need for quarantine and restrictions and save lives.”
The COVASIM is a model developed by Burnet Institute and Institute for Disease Modelling in the USA and provides governments with more specific and precise data to inform their Covid-19 responses.

Victoria lobbying for UK ban in attempt to stop mutant strain escaping hotel quarantine

Full text: The Victorian government remains on high alert over the mutated virus, which has seen the UK move to a total lockdown with more than 50,000 new cases a day. There are now four confirmed cases of the new strain in Victorian hotel quarantine with genomic testing under way to determine a possible fifth.
Victoria has lobbied for national action and Deputy Chief Health Officer Allen Cheng addressed the Australian Health Protection Principal Committee on Tuesday.
The committee agreed to bring forward a paper on the issue, which would consider modelling on how quickly the superbug could spread if introduced into the community.
Senior government sources said consideration was not currently being given to banning UK visitors, but they conceded Australia’s current settings may not be appropriate.
More than 40 countries across Europe, Asia, South America, the Caribbean and the Middle East have already suspended travel with the UK.
However, government sources said the ongoing trade war with China made it unlikely Australia would shut the border to the UK, its seventh-largest trading partner.
But Victoria could push for a New Zealand-style arrangement that imposes strict requirements for travellers from the UK and US, including confirmation of a negative COVID test 72 hours before departure.
Victorian health officials remain most concerned about travellers from the UK, US and Qatar after it was revealed five of eight flight crew to test positive for COVID-19 had travelled on Qatar Airways.
Police and Emergency Services Minister Lisa Neville said the situation in the UK was very concerning and consideration needed to be given to a broader border closure.
“I think it’s really important that we look at this issue,” she said. “I’m not the health expert. I want the health experts advising our leaders, which is why the Premier has asked for national cabinet, let’s get the advice.”
Ms Neville, responsible for the state’s quarantine program, said the transmission of the super virus to Victoria was worrying.
“But what I want to do is reassure Victorians that we have built a hotel quarantine program that assumes every single person that comes off a plane is positive with whatever strain they have,” she said.
“That’s why we’re testing every staff member, it’s why we’ve got our own workforce, it’s why people can’t work across different sites.”
The Herald Sun understands Scott Morrison would be open to calling an extra or early national cabinet meeting before the next one slated for February 5 if asked.
But on Tuesday he insisted Daniel Andrews had not requested an earlier meeting.
“I spoke to the Premier last night (Monday night) and he didn’t ask for one,” Mr Morrison told 3AW. “We spoke about the UK strain last night … it is a great concern to us.”
Mr Morrison said the AHPPC would discuss how to ensure the strain stays out of the community here and any recommendations made by the panel would be considered by the federal government.
“If any further measures are required, then certainly they would trigger that and they recommend that then, of course, if necessary, we would need to action it,” he said.
After the medical experts’ meeting on Tuesday afternoon, the federal Department of Health confirmed the Australian border to the UK would remain open.
“The Australian government is monitoring the situation in the UK very closely,” a spokesman said. “Combined with other measures, including high testing rates, social distancing and strong localised response, mandatory hotel quarantine has resulted in relatively low numbers of cases in Australia compared to the rest of the world.
“Repatriation flights with mandatory quarantine will continue assisting Australians to return home, including from the UK.”

Full text: NSW has two new locally acquired cases, linked to the BWS Berala cluster. Victoria has recorded three new COVID-19 cases after more than 32,000 tests in the past 24 hours. There are virus alerts across 63 Sydney suburbs. Meanwhile, the crowd has been halved for the Sydney Test on Thursday, with fans from regional areas have been urged not to attend. Covid testing sites across Melbourne closed within an hour of opening yesterday, swamped by thousands of Victorians requiring tests after returning from NSW.
New South Wales Chief Health Officer Dr Kerry Chant has announced two new community cases have been identified since the 8pm cut-off last night.
Patrick Commins 9.10pm: JobKeeper cuts won’t halt recovery: economists
Phasing out the JobKeeper pandemic wage stimulus payments will not be enough to derail Australia’s robust economic recovery as the nation’s housing and manufacturing sector ended the year in rude health, experts say.
From Monday, the federal wage subsidy was reduced to $1000 a fortnight for eligible full-time workers, and to $600 for part-time employees. The scheme is due to expire on March 28.
Anthony Albanese renewed his attack on the transition plan, saying it was “premature” to withdraw support while there were “millions of Australians who continue to do it tough”.

Richard Ferguson 8.25pm: Next election costs to spike by $30m
The next federal election is likely to cost Australian taxpayers nearly $30m extra due to special anti-coronavirus measures to keep voters safe, the electoral commission has revealed.
As government MPs prepare for Scott Morrison to call a poll between August and November, the Australian Electoral Commission estimates the election will cost at least $400m – up from $372m in 2019 – to bolster postal voting and hire COVID-19 wardens.
In a recent submission to the Senate’s budget estimates, the AEC said face masks, extra staff and bigger polling booths that allow more social distancing will drive up costs.

Remy Varga 7.40pm: NRL star says hotel quarantine unfair
Canberra Raiders halfback George Williams has tweeted his frustration after he was detained in hotel quarantine in Victoria, saying even criminals get an hour of fresh air each day.
The English rugby league star said on Monday he had been ordered into hotel quarantine after leaving the ACT in December to travel to Bateman’s Bay in NSW and then on to Victoria.
Williams said he checked the health advice multiple times before travelling but “the rules had now changed literally within an hour of leaving so we had to go straight into mandatory hotel quarantine for 2 weeks”.
“This is something we and other act travellers was (sic) not aware of and there are many in the same situation as on the same virgin Australia flight who can’t understand this at all, again the airline at Canberra airport that told us we was (sic) safe to travel without any restrictions,” he tweeted.
Williams said the hotel room was “very small” and he couldn’t open the window.
“We are not even allowed to leave the room?! Sorry but criminals all get 1 hour a day fresh air or out of their cell. HOW IS THIS FAIR? Help!”

AFP 7pm: Beijing races to vaccinate millions
Thousands of people lined up in Beijing on Monday to receive a COVID-19 vaccine as China races to innoculate millions before the Chinese New Year mass travel season next month.
More than 73,000 people in the Chinese capital have received the first dose of the vaccine over the past couple of days, state media reported, including community workers and bus drivers.
Health authorities on New Year’s Eve granted “conditional” approval to a vaccine candidate made by Chinese pharma giant Sinopharm, which the company said had a 79 per cent efficacy rate.
People were bussed into a temporary vaccine centre at a central park, after being instructed to fill in electronic forms about their health status and any allergies at an outside gate.
Some were wearing two layers of surgical face masks.
One man surnamed Gu, a catering worker in his 30s, said his employer had booked him a vaccine appointment at the centre, and that he wanted the jab “for peace of mind”.
“I believe any adverse effects will be controllable,” he said.
Footage from state broadcaster CCTV showed queues outside local hospitals and community health centres as people waited to read consent forms and have their temperatures taken before getting the jab.
Health officials said gyms and empty factories were among centres being used for the vaccination programme.
China plans to vaccinate millions this northern winter in the run-up to Lunar New Year in mid-February.
Beijing has already administered around 4.5 million doses of largely unproven emergency vaccines this year — mostly to health workers and other state employees destined for overseas jobs, according to authorities.
But China now plans a gradual rollout for the vaccine starting with key groups considered to have a high risk of exposure to the virus, including port and food logistic workers and people planning to return to studies abroad.
China — where the coronavirus first emerged late in 2019 — has broadly stamped out the virus inside its borders, introducing swift local lockdowns and mass testing when cases emerge.
But the country has stepped up testing and movement controls after a recent spate of small local outbreaks, including a handful of cases in Beijing.

Oliver Moody 6.15pm: Berliners abandon lockdown chickens
Germany’s largest animal shelter says it is dealing with a glut of mistreated and abandoned chickens bought by Berliners in their ill-considered pursuit of a little rural idyll in the city.
The Tierheim Berlin, which looks after 1300 animals from cats to snakes and monkeys at a futuristic-looking 6.5ha compound on the outskirts of the capital, also said it had been inundated with requests to borrow its inhabitants during the national lockdown.
Growing numbers of urbanites have been buying or renting chickens since the start of the pandemic, apparently in the hope of enlivening their monotony with a touch of the rustic.
In many cases, however, the animals have been kept in such inhumane conditions that they had to be confiscated by Berlin’s public veterinary offices, according to Annette Rost, a spokeswoman for the Tierheim.
The shelter said it was looking after roughly three times as many chickens as it would in a normal year, and had at times run out of space for them.
Among those brought in for rehousing were six newly hatched chicks that had been dumped in a box in Weissensee, a northeastern suburb. They had been so badly neglected they had to be warmed up with a lamp and put on a special diet to fatten them up.
The authorities also seized five chickens that had been housed in cardboard boxes on the balcony of a high-rise flat in Lichtenberg, a district of east Berlin dominated by old socialist-era tower blocks.
“Their condition was catastrophic,” the Tierheim said. “Because they lived in boxes and couldn’t get out of one another’s way, they were stressed out and injured each other.”
The animal shelter has also urged Berliners who are thinking of acquiring an animal to alleviate their lockdown-induced solitude to ensure that they are prepared to keep it for life. “For many, animals have become a substitute for social contact,” Ms Rost said.

Erin Lyon 5.30pm: Virus alert for 63 Sydney suburbs
Thousands of Sydney residents across 63 suburbs have been urged to monitor for symptoms after virus fragments were detected across two sewage plants.
Dozens of Sydney suburbs have been put on alert after sewage surveillance detected signs of the virus in the Liverpool and Glenfield areas.
Thousands of residents have now been urged to monitor for symptoms.
NSW Health issued an alert on Monday, highlighting that virus fragments were detected at the two treatment plants in Sydney’s southwest.
Health authorities said findings could simply indicate the presence of known cases of COVID-19 that had been diagnosed in recent weeks.
“However, NSW Health is concerned there could be other active cases in the local community in people who have not been tested and who might incorrectly assume their symptoms are just a cold,” the department said.
The alert comes as NSW diagnosed two new cases, both believed linked to the growing BWS Berala cluster.
Both cases were found after the 8pm cut off and will be reported in Tuesday’s numbers.
NSW chief health officer Dr Kerry Chant urged people to be vigilant.
“It is really important that we all bring that to mind any time we’re out and about … someone could have COVID and that’s why we need those universal precautions of keeping that physical distancing and the mask wearing particularly in those indoor settings.
“There will be positive people in any setting you go in.
The Liverpool and Glenfield sewage treatment plants cover these suburbs:
Bardia, Hinchinbrook, Hoxton Park, Abbotsbury, Ingleburn, Prestons, Holsworthy, Edmondson Park, Austral, Cecil Park, Cecil Hills, Elizabeth Hills, Bonnyrigg Heights, Edensor Park, Green Valley, Pleasure Point, Casula, Hammondville, Liverpool, Moorebank, Wattle Grove, Miller, Cartwright, Lurnea, Warwick Farm, Chipping Norton, Voyager Point, Macquarie Links, Glenfield, Catherine Field, Gledswood Hills, Leppington, West Hoxton, Horningsea Park, Middleton Grange, Len Waters Estate, Carnes Hill, Denham Court, Airds, Ambarvale, Appin, Blair Athol, Blairmount, Bow Bowing, Bradbury, Campbelltown, Claymore, Eagle Vale, Englorie Park, Eschol Park, Glen Alpine, Kearns, Leumeah, Macquarie Fields, Menangle Park, Minto, Raby, Rosemeadow, Ruse, St Andrews, St Helens Park, Varroville, Woodbine.

Rachel Baxendale 3.40pm: Allan defends contact tracing delays in notifying businesses
Acting Victorian Premier Jacinta Allan has defended the Department of Health and Human Services, following numerous reports of businesses discovering through the media that their venues have been named as coronavirus exposure sites, and then waiting hours to be contacted by contact tracers.
The Australian is aware of one business which was not contacted for 16 hours after their cafe was listed as an exposure site on the DHHS website, after a contact tracer misspelled their email address.
DHHS has also issued numerous corrections after publishing incorrect information about exposure sites, including naming a cellar door in northeast Victoria which closed down years ago, having confused it with a winery in east Gippsland 400km away.
Asked whether the tardiness in contacting business owners was good enough, Ms Allan said the government was putting information on its website “as soon as we possibly can”.
“There is a huge effort going on at the moment, to test, to trace, to provide that information to the Victorian community, and I appreciate for business owners they’re people wanting to do the right thing and they’re wanting to get the information out,” Ms Allan said.
“The information does need to go through a verification process within DHHS and business owners will then be contacted.
“There’s a monstrous team effort going on at the moment from the contact tracing team, our public health team, epidemiologists, the pathology teams, the nurses, everyone’s working really, really hard, and in terms of providing information about exposure sites, the priority has been placed on getting that information out as quickly as possible.
“It’s also I think important to note that the task has been made perhaps a little more challenging over the Christmas holiday period, because people move around much more frequently than they would normally do with the normal course of events.”
Ms Allan said contact tracers were in the process of interviewing 311 close contacts of the 24 people who have so far tested positive for coronavirus as part of the Black Rock cluster.

Rachel Baxendale 3pm: Farm workers can cross border: with limits
Acting Victorian Premier Jacinta Allan has announced special arrangements to enable farm workers to move between New South Wales and Victoria.
Amid harvest across many sectors of the agriculture industry, many farmers were already facing significant labour shortages due to a lack of backpackers and migrant workers.
Ms Allan said on Monday that effective immediately, arrangements under the “National Agricultural Workers’ Code” had been put in place to enable workers to move between Victoria and NSW, subject to restrictions requiring them to wear masks at all times in NSW and isolate when not at work.
The workers will only be allowed to leave their accommodation while in NSW to acquire food or in case of emergency.
“There are some really strong standards around this but it’s also important to ensure we have the movement of our agricultural workforce,” Ms Allan said.
Rachel Baxendale 2.50pm: All new local Vic cases linked to Black Rock cluster
All three of Victoria’s new locally acquired coronavirus cases on Monday have been linked to the Black Rock cluster, which now numbers a total of 24 cases, Acting Premier Jacinta Allan has told a press conference.
The results come after 32,468 tests were processed in the 24 hours to Monday, with Ms Allan acknowledging the significant delays Victorians had endured to get tested, after testing centres were overwhelmed following the closure of the NSW border on Friday.
“We know that people did experience delays over the course of yesterday, but we also saw by the afternoon wait times did significantly reduce, and today, whilst we know that it will be another very busy day at our testing sites, with the extra capacity that’s been added today, over and above the capacity that was added yesterday, the extended hours, the additional sites, we are expecting the sites to be able to accommodate the demand that we expect over the course of today,” Ms Allan said.
She said close contacts of positive cases would be prioritised for testing.

Rhiannon Down 2.30pm: Waits for virus testing continue in Melbourne
Coronavirus test site wait times across Victoria have been stretched to more than two hours, as hundreds flock to get tested.
Monash Health, Dandenong Drive Through was at 200 minutes wait today, and the Alfred Hospital, Western Health, Springers Leisure Centre and Heidelberg Repatriation Hospital test sites at 2 hours, according to the DHHS, which offers information on its online wait times estimator.
Test sites with some of the lowest wait times of about 40 minutes include Monash Health’s Don Tatnell Leisure Centre in Parkdale.
Western Health’s Melbourne Showgrounds test site, IPC Health’s West Sunshine Community Centre and Wantirna Trash and Treasure Market were all reported to be at half-hour average wait times.
Rhiannon Down 2.15pm: Three new venues added to Sydney exposure sites
A cinema, supermarket and a beauty salon have been added to NSW’s health authorities list of COVID hotspot sites.
Anyone who was in the screening of animated film ‘The Croods: A New Age” at the Reading Cinema Auburn on Parramatta Rd on Wednesday has been urged to get tested and self-isolate for 14 days.
Patrons of the OKS Beauty and Hair salon in Lidcombe and shoppers at the nearby Woolworths have also been deemed casual contacts.
Health authorities ask anyone who attended the following venues to get tested and self-isolate for 14 days:
Reading Cinema Auburn, 100 Parramatta Rd, Auburn, Wednesday between 30 December 10.10am to 12.10pm
OKS Beauty and Hair, 52 Joseph St, Lidcombe, Thursday 31 December between 10.30am to 12pm
Woolworths Lidcombe, 92 Parramatta Rd, Lidcombe, Thursday 31 December between 12.15 to 3.45pm

Rhiannon Down 2.10pm: Australia’s ‘pleasing’ total: 21 new cases in 24 hours
Australia has recorded 21 new coronavirus cases in the last 24 hours.
Australia’s Chief Health Officer Doctor Paul Kelly said the numbers are “pleasing” despite the recent outbreaks.
He hit back at calls for the vaccine to be rolled out sooner, saying the TGA approval process needs time to run its course, with a process of approvals and further testing.
“It will be explained later in the week, we will be making more announcements about that process, and we’re just being cautious in terms of the late March time late at this stage,” he said.
“We are hoping it may be shorter than that, but at this stage we are being upfront: that that is our plan.”

Staff reporters 1.55pm: SCG halves Test crowd amid fears of Covid spread
The Sydney Cricket Ground will have its capacity limited to 12,000 — half what was originally expected — for the third Test between Australia and India.
That number could be even lower if it rains, sources told The Australian.
Separately, Venues NSW chairman Tony Shepherd told the Financial Review that the organisation would ask for permission to return to its original plan of 50 per cent capacity if the number of coronavirus infections remains low over coming days.
The major step back from original plans for a 50 per cent capacity come as country cricket fans were urged to boycott the match to help keep the regional areas of NSW free of COVID-19.
Cricket Australia and the SCG officially confirmed on Monday that they had revised crowd restrictions for the New Year’s Showpiece based on NSW Government advice and that the match would be completely re-ticketed.
Tickets will be refunded and those who were ticket holders will be given an exclusive window to repurchase tickets via Ticketek from 5pm on January 4 through to 12pm on January 5.
Any remaining tickets will be released to the public after that point.
“In response to the public health situation in NSW, we are working closely with Venues NSW and NSW Health to put appropriate biosecurity measures in place for our staff, players, match officials, broadcasters and fans to ensure we play the third Test safely,” said CA interim chief, Nick Hockley.

Rhiannon Down 1.40pm: Puffing Billy the latest Vic virus exposure site
Melbourne’s iconic Puffing Billy tourist attraction has been added to Victoria’s list of coronavirus exposure sites.
The steam train in Emerald in the Dandenong Hills has closed to visitors after an infected person visited the attraction on Thursday.
“In the interests of safety, train services on Tuesday 5 January 2021 and Wednesday 6 January 2021 have been cancelled and all Puffing Billy Railway public facilities will be closed,” Puffing Billy Railway said, in a statement.
“A deep clean of the affected areas and surfaces are currently being undertaken, in accordance with the strict infection control guidelines put in place by the Department of Health and Human Services.”
Anyone who visited the steam train on Thursday December 31 between 3 and 5pm is advised to monitor for symptoms and get tested if they develop.

Rhiannon Down 1.15pm: Chadstone shopping centre flags virus case
Melbourne’s mega-shopping centre Chadstone in the city’s southeast has been flagged as a potential exposure site, after a worker tested positive for the virus.
Chadstone management said that the Boost Juice employee was on site last Tuesday, and the site was undergoing a deep clean, through the centre remained open.
“We are working closely with the team at Boost Juice, both kiosks at Chadstone are currently closed and a deep clean has been undertaken. We’ve also completed a deep clean of our centre, as an additional precaution,” the statement said.
The shopping destination said a regime of additional cleaning had since been introduced.
“We have an increased cleaning roster in place, with additional focus on specific areas including; balustrades, retailer door handles, vertical transport, toilets, sinks, change tables and parents’ rooms, customer entry and touch points, information screens, as well as communal furniture throughout the centre,” the statement said.
The worker was at the store on Tuesday December 29 between 6 and 11pm.

Rhiannon Down 1pm: Speed up vaccine, extend JobKeeper: Albanese
Opposition leader Anthony Albanese has urged the government to bring the coronavirus vaccine to Australians sooner than March.
“It makes no sense for the TGA to have recommended, as it is likely to do, in January, the approval of the Pfizer vaccine but for the rollout to not occur until March,” he said.
“What we know, as Australia is not at the front of the queue, we have never been at the front of the queue and that’s why Labor argued very early on that we needed to get these deals signed, we needed to get six deals signed, which is international best practice and the fact is that other nations got to the front of the queue way back in March of last year and Australia isn’t at that point yet.”
Mr Albanese also renewed calls for the JobKeeper payment to be maintained at it’s 2020 level, after the government moved to cut the payment at the end of the year.
“The JobKeeper payment should not be reduced, that these reductions are unwise, they will hurt individuals, they will hurt families but, importantly as well, they will hurt businesses by reducing economic activity at a time when we know there is still a major handbrake on the economy,” he said.

Evin Priest 12.15pm: Outrage over packed concert, overcrowded wedding in west
A packed Human Nature concert at the Rooty Hill RSL and a wedding with up to 700 guests at Fairfield have seen a venue fined, Sydneysiders outraged, and left the NSW police minister “furious”.
Footage of hundreds of music fans singing at the Human Nature concert at Rooty Hill RSL’s Sydney Coliseum at the weekend have been widely condemned, as mandatory mask laws come into effect in NSW today.
“Mate it was jam packed in the auditorium there wasn’t a spare seat in the house there was no distancing between people inside, you were touching elbows with the person next to you who you didn’t know,” audience member Ian said, on 2GB.
“I wore a mask so I felt reasonably happy about that part of it.”
Theatre operator West HQ chief executive Richard Errington defended the event saying the venue had stuck to audience limits.

Staff Reporters 12.05pm: Victoria’s new cases linked to restaurant cluster
Acting Victorian Premier Jacinta Allan says the three locally acquired cases reported today are linked to the outbreak at the Thai restaurant at Black Rock, in Melbourne. That cluster now has 24 active cases linked to it.
Rhiannon Down 12pm: SCG Test will go ahead in ‘Covid-safe way’
NSW acting Premier John Barilaro says he is “confident” the state is equipped to host the test match at the SCG.
Mr Barilaro said NSW health authorities were up to the task of running the event in a COVID-safe way.
“In our state, and our venues, like the grand final, Everest or other race days, the Big Bash, we can and we have shown that we can run events in this state in a safe way that protects our citizens, protect the players, protect those that attend,” he said.
“And most importantly, doing it in a framework that is COVID-safe.”
He urged regional communities to stay away from Sydney.
“I know for regional people the New Year’s Test is something which is an annual pilgrimage,” he said.
“We love coming to Sydney for this purpose and a lot of the members are from regions. In normal times I would say that is fantastic but I would be saying to people today to consider what’s occurring in Sydney with the infections and the restrictions.
“In regional and rural NSW right now, we’re enjoying no restrictions, we got to have the summer and the Christmas we were robbed last year because of bushfires and drought, we got to have that this year,” he said.
“The risk would be that if someone from the regions comes to Sydney that they could take it back to a regional area.
“My advice to people would be — think about it, reconsider, maybe this year isn’t the year to come to Sydney to watch the test and that’s what we’ll be doing.”
“I’m not going to be enforcing people or putting in a direction for people not to come to Sydney but I think people, and I know regional people use common sense, and they will reconsider their visit.”
He said Cricket Australia and the SCG will make an announcement later today about the Test, and foreshadowed a change to ticket numbers.
“We’re also giving consideration to the numbers as ticket sales continue and I will advise today that the SCG and cricket later today will be making an announcement in relation to the Test. But we are confident – we are confident – that through the parameters set by Health, the advice that government gets from Kerry and her team, that will take that all into account,” he said.

Mackenzie Scott 11.45am: Queensland virus testing rates triple
Virus testing levels almost tripled yesterday in Queensland following the chief health officer’s renewed calls for returned travellers from Melbourne to get checked and isolate.
A total of 6296 tests were conducted across the state yesterday, a considerable rise on the 2742 tests processed the day prior.
No new locally transmitted cases were found overnight, with the five reported this morning found in hotel quarantine.
On Sunday, Queensland’s chief health officer Dr Jeannette Young announced additional fever clinics would be opened and times extended in order to meet the demand for testing. There are currently 76 testing sites in the state, with 18 in the southeast region.
The decision came following long queues of more than four hours at some clinics over the weekend.
Dr Young said it was important “we catch the very, very first case”.
Queensland has not had community transmission of COVID-19 for 111 days. The last time an active case was found outside of quarantine was 18 days ago, when a woman linked to the NSW Northern Beaches cluster tested positive on arrival to the state and returned home

Rhiannon Down 11.35am: Barilaro hits back at WA Premier’s criticism
NSW’s acting Premier has hit out at states with fewer overseas arrivals saying Sydney’s hotel quarantine program was doing the “heavy lifting” for the rest of the country.
In the latest chapter in a war of words between acting Premier John Barilaro and WA Premier Mark McGowan , Mr Barilaro defended his state’s hotel quarantine system.
“I’m sick to death of being lectured to by WA and some of the other states when we’re doing the heavy lifting,” he said on 2GB radio.
“(We’ve had) 105 thousand passengers through Sydney, 50 per cent or close to end up in other states so we’re like the dry cleaner or the care wash, we clean them and sent them back to their states clean.
“All that risk lies with NSW and our health system, when we get lectured by these others it is bloody hard to accept when we’re doing the heavy lifting.
Mr Barilaro threatened that NSW could decide to step back and let other state’s pick up the slack.
“Maybe what we should be doing is collecting them at the airport, ask them where their final destination is and keep sending them on another connection and those states can deal with them,” he said.
“I know the treasurer has sent them a bill for the costs associated and they baulked at that.”
Rhiannon Down 11.30am: Woman fined twice for trying to flee Byron Bay
A Cronulla woman who broke out of self isolation in Byron Bay is among the latest instances of Sydneysiders defying quarantine orders.
Former WHO epidemiologist Professor Adrian Esterman says New South Wales is “struggling a bit at the moment” regarding its ability to effectively deal with the state’s COVID outbreak.
Acting Police Commissioner Mal Lanyon said the 27-year-old woman had received two infringement notices in just three days for failing to comply with health orders.
“That obviously puts the rest of the public and herself in significant danger,” he said.
A wedding in Fairfield in Sydney’s west was also fined over the weekend for hosting a celebration with 600 to 700 guests.
The operator has been fined $5000 for hosting double the amount of guests permitted.

Rhiannon Down 11.20am: Cases linked to Sydney cluster being probed
NSW chief health officer Dr Kerry Chant said the two cases of community transmission recorded today were linked to the Berala BWS, and under investigation.
“One, a gentleman in his 40s who visited the BWS Berala at – on 24 December,” she said. “And another case, a female in her 40s, who also has some association with the BWS
and the Woolworths at Berala, but those investigations are ongoing.”
Dr Chant urged Sydneysiders to commit to wearing masks to prevent community transmission after the cluster was spawned from a leak in hotel quarantine.
“The Berala cluster originated from returning overseas travellers and then there was a healthcare worker person who was involved in the transfer of those patients and then that person passed it on unknowingly to a close contact and that close contact went to the BWS,” she said.
“Can I just stress that at the time where the person entered the BWS, they had no symptoms and no reason at all to think they had COVID infection.
“And it really is important that we all bring that to mind that any time we’re out and about, someone could have COVID and that’s why we need those universal precautions of keeping that physical distancing and the mask-wearing particularly in those indoor settings.”
Rhiannon Down 11.10am: Two new NSW cases from BWS Berala cluster
Mr Barilaro said despite the welcome day of zero local cases authorities were still on high alert with two cases already identified in connection to the Berala cluster that will be in tomorrow’s tally.
“There are zero locally-acquired cases in NSW today,” he said. “That is good news, but we also get data overnight and we normally wait for the next day but it’s important this morning we talk about that, we have already identified two cases overnight connected to the Berala BWS.
“So, again, my message to everybody, everyone though today we are talking about a zero day of locally-acquired cases, it is important that we keep that testing regime up and that is my message – knowing that already overnight there are two cases that will be part of tomorrow’s official announcement.”
Rhiannon Down 11.05am: NSW has 7 cases, all in hotel quarantine
NSW has recorded 7 cases in the last 24 hours today, all from overseas in hotel quarantine.
Acting Premier John Barilaro said the state had recorded zero cases of community transmission. Two positive tests came in after the 8pm cut-off.
Some 22,275 tests were processed in NSW in the past day, the acting Premier urging Sydneysiders to get tested.
He said testing is “crucial” for the state’s response, and has hopes of reaching daily testing numbers of up to 50,000.
“My plea today for those in western Sydney, please come out in numbers,” Mr Barilaro said.

Rhiannon Down 10.35am: Packed Sydney concert prompts outrage
Footage of hundreds of music fans singing while not wearing masks at a concert in Sydney on Saturday has sparked outrage.
Images of a packed audience at a Human Nature gig at the Rooty Hill RSL’s Sydney Coliseum have been widely condemned, as mandatory mask laws come into effect in NSW today.
“Mate, it was jam-packed in the auditorium there wasn’t a spare heat in the house there was no distancing between people inside, you were touching elbows with the person next to you who you didn’t know,” audience member Ian told 2GB radio.
“I wore a mask so I felt reasonably happy about that part of it.”
Theatre operator West HQ chief executive Richard Errington defended the event saying the venue had stuck to audience limits.
“The theatre was not full, the capacity was just under 2000 and there was just over 1200 … we’ve been approved for 75 per cent seated capacity which must be ticketed and seated,” he said.
Opposition leader Jodi McKay expressed her dismay at the images on social media. “No social distancing, very few masks and a predominantly older audience,” she said.

Rhiannon Down 10.05am: Tourism group wants national border agreement
The peak tourism body is calling for a national border agreement, as the industry reels from sudden border closures between Victoria and NSW.
NED-2974-UKs-Mutant-Covid-Strain
Australian Tourism Industry Council executive director Simon Westaway said the impact border uncertainty had on the billion dollar industry sector was “significant”.
“These borders are changing so quickly the arrangements and conditions are altering literally within 24 hours notice,” he said.
“And, look, I just think we’ve seen this story play out in 2020, and obviously 2021, we’re only a couple of days in, we’re already in the same situation as before.
“When we have no consistency around the way that states and territories address COVID outbreaks or small hot spots, or larger hot spots. We’ve got to get a better system.”
Victoria closed its borders to NSW at midnight on Friday, sparking a mad scramble from holiday-makers to flee the state and massive traffic jams across the borders.

Rhiannon Down 9.55am: AMA now wants Sydney Test cancelled
Medical experts have urged the NSW government to cancel the Sydney test or risk creating a “superspreader” event.
Australian Medical Association head Dr Omar Khorshid said having crowds at the cricket posed an “unnecessary risk” as health authorities grappled with potentially hundreds of cases linked to a west Sydney bottle shop.
“If there was going on at the Sydney Cricket Ground, whether it be at the bar, the toilet, the turn stile, you can imagine how many people would be impacted,” he said. “Whether because you have a more transmissible version, or a super spreader, spreading the virus all over the ground.”
He said the government needed to put health outcomes ahead of all else to battle the crisis.
“The safe thing to do is to say we’re in a health emergency, it’s time to make decisions on the basis of health, rather than economy and sport, and it’s just the wrong decision and we’re certainly calling on the NSW government to relook at this question,” he said.

More than 4 million Americans have received initial doses of the Pfizer-BioNTech or Moderna coronavirus vaccines, falling short of the predicted 20 million by the new year.
The US coronavirus death toll climbed to 350,000 cases over the weekend, a figure which President Donald Trump disputed.
The figures come as audio of the president pressuring an election official to “find” enough votes for him to win the state of Georgia came to light.
Coronavirus cases have also soared in Canada with the country surpassing 600,000 cases on Sunday.
Canada passed half a million cases just two weeks ago and has notched up 15,860 deaths.

Victoria has recorded three new locally acquired cases of coronavirus in the 24 hours to Monday, as well as one new case from and international return traveller in hotel quarantine.
There are now 36 active cases in the state.
The latest numbers come after 32,468 tests were processed in the 24 hours to Monday.
Rhiannon Down 8.50am: No fines yet in Sydney over mask mandate
The first fine is yet to be issued for defying mandatory mask laws that came into effect at midnight in Sydney.
NSW Police Minister David Elliott said no one in the state had yet been fined for defying mask orders and that police would use their discretion.
“(Police) don’t want to go out and fine people for the sake of fining them,” he said. “Police want to fine people to make sure their friends and social networks know that the masks are being rolled out.
“This won’t be a long-term measure. You will find once we are on top of this and the given period of grace that the chief health officer deems, I think this will be a short term measure and a short term measure until we can make sure everybody is safe.”
Mr Elliott dismissed anti-mask protesters that gathered at Bondi on Sunday as a vocal minority. “They are outliers and they are less than 1 per cent of the population,” he said.

Rhiannon Down 8.40am: Sydney wedding with 700 guests attracts fines
Police have fined a wedding party and venue operator after about 700 guests gathered in Fairfield in Sydney’s southwest on Saturday to celebrate the nuptials.
NSW Police Minister David Elliott said the 46-year-old operator had already been fined $5000 for breaching health directives.
“It is not about the fines or the punishment, this is about compliance and people need to realise the police are enforcing a law to keep them healthy,” he said.
“We don’t want to go back into lockdown. That’s why we have introduced these Public Health Orders and I’m very disappointed that the Fairfield police area command has had to go through that over the last 48 hours.”
He said the 700 guests needed to self isolate and get tested.
“This isn’t one or two people coming from an area in lockdown or, you know, this isn’t a dozen people that turned up unannounced, this is twice the amount of people that were allowed to attend that wedding reception in an area not far from Berala,” he said.
“So, it is a time that western Sydney needs to be well and truly on its game when it comes to complying with public health orders.
“This just does not make sense.”
Rhiannon Down 8.30am: Victoria increases Covid testing capacity
As many as 10 new coronavirus testing sites will open across Victoria as the state grapples with a new cluster in Melbourne’s south.
The new sites are located across Melbourne and the state’s east after a number of exposure sites were reported across Gippsland including Leongatha and Lake Entrance in recent days.
Queues at testing sites overwhelmed health authorities in Victoria over the weekend as hundreds of potential close contacts lined up for testing.
The new pop-up and drive-through testing sites are located at:
Monash Health – Kingston Heath Soccer Club, Cheltenham
Eastern Health – East Ringwood Reserve (former Maroondah Club), East Ringwood
Aquadome – Lakes Entrance, Lakes Entrance

Rhiannon Down 8.20am: Warning vaccines could be rendered useless
Australia’s deals to get access to the Pfizer, Novavax and AstraZeneca vaccines could be rendered useless if the virus mutates or if there is a drop off in effectiveness overtime.
Doherty Institute head of vaccine and immunisation research group Professor Terry Nolan said Australian researchers were in the process of developing new vaccines to counter the risk.
“It is believed that the current vaccines will likely protect,” he said.
NED-2778 Moderna v Pfizer
“But the mutations which are occurring are changing all the time, and there is no guarantee that they will protect into the long-term and we need other types of vaccines that will be able to be tuned should those mutations get to a point where the vaccines don’t work.”
He said two vaccines that targeted a specific part of the coronavirus spike protein were under development at the research institute.
“We are hoping when it is completed in the next few months,” he said. “We are hoping in the second quarter of this year to start vaccinating healthy humans aged between 18 and 75, and that will involve, on current projections, depending on how the other studies progress, about 150 subjects for that trial.”

Rhiannon Down 8am: Bar owner ‘not told’ venue was an exposure site
A restaurateur whose bar was added to the list of coronavirus hotspot venues in Victoria has spoken out about the breakdown in communication he experienced with health authorities.
Grape & Grain Bar owner John Tei said the DHHS didn’t inform him his restaurant in Moorabbin in Melbourne’s south was an exposure site after an employee tested positive.
Mr Tei said he found out about the staff member on Sunday morning but didn’t receive a call from the DHHS until the night.
“(I feel) frustrated. Confused more than anything else. I just would love to know the direction I need to take,” he said.
“I have, of course, closed the bar and taken a lot of things on myself. All staff were tested, and they are all coming back negative, which is awesome.”
The Grape & Grain Bar was one of a string of bayside and southeastern suburbs venues to be added to health authorities list including Woodlands Golf Club – club bar in Mordialloc, Hotlocks By Rachael Hairdresser in McKinnon and the Holy Family Parish in Doveton.

Rhiannon Down 7.45am: Sydney warned of ‘hard’ Covid lockdown
Any future lockdown in Sydney would be “hard and local”, acting NSW Premier John Barilaro said.
Mr Barilaro said tougher restrictions could be on the cards as health authorities battle to control a new outbreak linked to a Berala bottle shop.
He said the number of potential contacts posed a concern with a thousand customers passing through the store over Christmas Eve alone.
“If you look from 22 to 26 December, they could be big numbers, and we will always consider what we can do in relation to a lockdown, further restrictions, especially where there is a hot spot,” he said.
“One of the things we said when we were lifting restrictions was that if we had to respond, it would be fast and it would be hard and local, just like we have done for the peninsular.”
Testing sites were overwhelmed in Sydney’s west as potentially thousands of close contacts flooded testing sites.
Rhiannon Down 7.30am: Fall in testing numbers alarms NSW authorities
NSW authorities have called for more people to get tested for coronavirus after test numbers dipped to 19,000 yesterday.
Acting NSW Premier John Barilaro said numbers from overnight pointed to a shortfall in testing and called for Sydneysiders to step up.
“Today is the start of a new week, working week, and we know weekends, it does drop-off a little,” he said.
“I’m looking forward to the next 24 hours we (need to) get more people out testing because it is the testing that gives us data and the results we have seen.”
The government is expected to further announcements on the latest COVID numbers at 11am today.

Rhiannon Down 6.45am: Anti-mask protesters swamp Bondi Junction Westfield
Sydneysiders not wearing masks will face fines of $200 from today after NSW premier Gladys Berejiklian announced mandatory mask laws on Saturday.
Dozens of anti-mask protesters marched through a Bondi shopping centre on Sunday in defiance of the new health orders making mask-wearing compulsory at indoor venues in a bid to control rising coronavirus cases.
On the first day that new mask rules came into effect in Sydney, protesters defied restrictions during a rally at a shopping centre in Bondi Junction.
The protesters swarmed Westfield Bondi Junction wearing no masks, some holding placards asserting their freedom.
One protester was reported to have held a placard which claimed “masks increase the risk of infection” contrary to medical advice.
The decision comes as NSW health authorities race to control an outbreak linked to a Berala BWS.

Rhiannon Down 6am: Case numbers balloon in the UK
Coronavirus case numbers in the UK have ballooned, with the country recording 57,725 new cases — it’s highest total of the pandemic.
British Prime Minister Boris Johnson warned that tougher restrictions to combat the rising coronavirus cases could be on the way.
“It may be that we need to do things in the next few weeks that will be tougher in many parts of the country,” Johnson told the BBC’s The Andrew Marr Show. “I’m fully, fully reconciled to that.”
A row over whether schools should reopen has intensified over the weekend, as the country battles with the crisis.
Opposition Labour leader Keir Starmer urged the prime minister to immediately impose national lockdown measures.
“It’s no good the prime minister hinting that further restrictions are coming into place in a week or two or three,” he told British media, adding the virus was “clearly out of control”.

Tessa Akerman 4.55am: Swamped testing sites turn away thousands
COVID-19 testing sites across Melbourne closed within an hour of opening yesterday, swamped by thousands of Victorians requiring tests after returning from NSW and further stressed by health staff taking holiday leave.
Despite the temporary closures and lack of staff, Victorian health authorities processed more tests than their NSW colleagues on Saturday — 22,477 samples compared to 18,923 — although that remains far short of the more than 40,000 daily tests undertaken at the height of the second coronavirus wave.
By 9.30am on Sunday, the Department of Health and Human Services listed drive-through sites in Darebin, Keysborough and West Footscray as “over capacity, no further accepted”. Cars were also turned away from the Melbourne Sports and Aquatic Centre in Albert Park, which was listed as a three-hour wait, and sites in Chadstone, St Albans and Broadmeadows had waiting times of more than two hours.
Department of Health and Human Services Testing Commander Secretary Jeroen Weimar has thanked Victorians who went for testing amid a statewide crackdown on a COVID-19 cluster linked to the Northern Beaches outbreak.
But Jeroen Weimar , who is co-ordinating Victoria’s COVID-19 response, defended the long waiting times for testing.

Rachel Baxendale 4.45am: DHHS makes corrections galore, without apologies
Victorian health authorities have been forced to amend a list of potential coronavirus exposure sites after incorrectly listing locations, including one hours away from where it originally said it was.
The Department of Health and Human Services on Saturday published an alert for the Wonga Estate winery in Strathbogie, in Victoria’s northeast.
Later that day, that alert was replaced with one for the same time period but for the Wyanga winery in Lakes Entrance, a five-hour drive on the other side of the Great Dividing Range.
Health authorities also listed on Saturday possible coronavirus spread at the European Bier Cafe in Melbourne’s CBD for December 21, prompting panic from Melburnians, given the early date of the potential exposure period.
However, that alert was later updated to show the exposure period a week later — on December 28.
Hours after the listing was posted, European Bier Cafe owner Paul Watson posted on Twitter that he had yet to be contacted by DHHS and had been unable to reach them.

Patrick Commins 4.30am: Avalon outbreak ‘inflicted $3.2bn hit’
The northern beaches COVID- 19 outbreak and lockdown cost the economy $3.2bn in lost working hours in December, according to modelling conducted by KPMG.
A preliminary analysis shows that even NSW’s more measured approach to suppressing the latest outbreak will come at a significant cost in terms of lost activity, with 34m fewer hours worked in December as a result of the localised lockdowns. It will slow but not stop the economic rebound that began in the September quarter.
KPMG chief economist Brendan Rynne said on Sunday: “I think the NSW government is doing a very, very good job in ­applying pressure quickly to contain the spread of the virus.”
“Unfortunately, that pressure brings with it an economic cost as it directly and quickly hits the supply side, and the longer it goes on, it then transfers to demand via confidence,” Dr Rynne said, adding that this depressing effect would extend into the new year.
The KPMG analysis looked at how changes in government restrictions — as measured by the Oxford Government Response Stringency Index — affect hours worked and through that GDP.
Dr Rynne estimated that the increase in restrictions, including social distancing and reimposed border controls, would translate to 34 million fewer hours worked in December than would have been the case were it not for the Avalon outbreak before Christmas.
Based on the historical relationship between economic output and hours worked, the drop in working hours pointed towards a $3.2bn hit to real GDP, he said.

Agencies 4.15am: India green lights enormous vaccination drive
India has authorised the emergency use of two coronavirus vaccines developed by AstraZeneca and Oxford University and by local pharmaceutical firm Bharat Biotech, the country’s drug regulator said on Sunday.
“The … vaccines of Serum Institute (AstraZeneca/Oxford vaccine) and Bharat Biotech are being approved for restricted use in emergency situations,” the Drugs Controller-General of India, V.G. Somani , said in New Delhi.
Prime Minister Narendra Modi tweeted the fast-track approvals were “a decisive turning point to strengthen a spirited fight” that “accelerates the road to a healthier and COVID-free nation”.
India is the world’s second-most-infected nation with more than 10.3 million cases and almost 150,000 deaths, although its rate of infection has come down from a mid-September peak of more than 90,000 cases daily.
The approval is expected to kick off one of the world’s biggest vaccination drives in the country of 1.3 billion. The government has already been holding nationwide drills ahead of the mass inoculation drive and 96,000 health workers have been trained to administer the shots.

Full text: Jodie McVernon — director of epidemiology at Melbourne’s Peter Doherty Institute for Infection and Immunity and an expert member of the council of chief health officers that delivers high-level scientific advice to Scott Morrison and the premiers — said there was no need “to press the red emergency button” and bring forward distribution of the jab from March.
Her position is at odds with Anthony Albanese who on Wednesday urged the Prime Minister to make the vaccine available as soon as January, when some or all of the three overseas formulations ordered by the government are expected to be approved.
“No, I don’t think we need to press the red emergency button right now,” Professor McVernon said. “We are not in the same universe as the countries that have done that. There would have to be a significant tipping point for the commonwealth and the regulator to decide we were at an emergency usage stage. I … am very heartened by the faith the NSW government has in its system and its measured and proportional response to what has happened on the northern beaches.”
There were 7 new COVID-19 cases in Sydney on Friday, with a further case in quarantine in Queensland linked to a superyacht which arrived in Cairns after a six-week trip from the Maldives.
Updated state by state modelling on the transmission potential of the virus by University of Melbourne professor in mathematical biology James McCaw, who sits alongside Professor McVernon on the Australian Health Protection Principal Committee, shows that the risk of COVID-19 spreading in NSW is nearly a third higher than in Victoria.
Perversely, the success of Western Australia and Queensland in containing the virus jars with their outbreak risk being rated as the highest of the mainland states — calculated at 1.55 and 1.33 respectively. As the index measures “current settings and behaviours”, it could reflect a degree of public complacency in those jurisdictions.
Professor McVernon said Australians should not be “judged harshly” on the numbers.
“If the virus is imported into a given state or territory the reproductive potential shows what is the likelihood it will spread … effectively it’s an indication of how free the populations are,” she said.
“And look, that was the point of getting to zero community transmission — letting people get out, socialise and have a healthy economy. So we shouldn’t berate the population for that.”
The modelling on the federal Health Department’s common operating picture database cut out at December 8, before the northern beaches outbreak took hold in Sydney. A southeast Queensland man who visited the area on December 12, prior to the lockdown, has now tested positive to COVID. Viral traces had also been detected in sewage in Wynnum on Brisbane’s bayside, Bundaberg and nearby Bargara Beach, Queensland chief health officer Jeannette Young said. South Australia also recorded a case linked to the northern beaches cluster, after a local resident aged in his 20s returned a positive test.
Alarm about the mutations reported in Britain and South Africa intensified this week after federal chief medical officer Paul Kelly confirmed four cases of the British strain had been detected among returned travellers in hotel quarantine. Two were in Sydney, two in Melbourne.
British authorities say the variant spreading in London, southeast England and Wales could be up to 70 per cent more infectious than the coronavirus that causes COVID-19, though there was no proof it made the disease deadlier.
British Health Secretary Matt Hancock warned that the mutated South African strain, now identified in two cases in Britain involving people thought to be contacts of those who had recently travelled between the two countries, could be even more contagious. Announcing further lockdown measures to come into effect next week, Mr Hancock said: “This new (South African) variant is highly concerning because it is yet more transmissible and it appears to have mutated further than the new variant discovered in the UK.”
Health Minister Greg Hunt, who accused Mr Albanese of undermining confidence in a vaccine by pushing for an accelerated rollout, said on Christmas Eve that the vaccine introduction would not be fast-tracked from March, with the government sticking with its approach to “underpromise and overdeliver”.
After the failure of the University of Queensland vaccine, which was to deliver 50m doses, additional supply was ordered of the Oxford-AstraZeneca and Novavax vaccines, in addition to 10m doses contracted from Pfizer of the German BioNTech vaccine.
Professor McVernon said public confidence in the immunisers was as important as their effectiveness, and would be underpinned by the experience in the UK and US after those hard-hit countries approved the Pfizer jab under emergency-use provisions. Another vaccine produced by American biotech company Moderna Therapeutics has been provisionally authorised by the US regulator, the Food and Drug Administration, paving the way for nearly 1 million people to be treated to date under President Donald Trump’s “Operation Warp Speed” initiative. “Obviously for any vaccine development program to work we need to be confident of its safety and its effectiveness, and the fact that we have not had to use the vaccines with the urgency of other countries does mean we benefit from the additional time,” Professor McVernon said.
Pfizer in Australia would not be drawn on when the vaccine would be available here. “We have confidence in our ability to quickly scale and manufacture large quantities of a high-quality COVID-19 vaccine, leveraging multiple sites in the US and Europe,” a spokeswoman said.
“Pfizer and BioNTech are committed to delivering on their agreement with the Australian government to supply 10m doses … over the course of 2021 subject to regulatory approval.”
Asked if fast-tracking the ­process was an option if the containment situation deteriorated, Professor McVernon pointed to October’s decision by the Therapeutic Goods Administration to issue a “provisional determination” in favour of Pfizer and the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccines before the latter was delayed by a dosing glitch in final-phase human trials. The problem, reportedly, has been resolved and British regulators are expected to green light the rollout within days.
A provisional determination by the TGA means the drug developer can apply for provisional registration in Australia and Professor McVernon said this implied an accelerated pathway was possible.

Full text: Australia's policymakers were bracing in March for up to 150,000 deaths from the coronavirus as infections spread globally and health officials warned hospitals might not be able to cope.
Ten weeks later, with just 103 COVID-19 deaths, some experts say the modelling behind the national cabinet's decisions was flawed and some commentators say the response went too far.
When Prime Minister Scott Morrison announced a ban on mass gatherings of more than 500 people on March 13, Australians seeing widespread lockdowns imposed overseas began to ask for the modelling behind the national cabinet's decisions.
Two days later, Deputy Chief Medical Officer Paul Kelly said the number of infections could range from 20 per cent to 60 per cent of the population. "The death rate is around 1 per cent. You can do the maths," Professor Kelly said.
The maths worked out to between 50,000 and 150,000 deaths.
On Tuesday, Chief Medical Officer Brendan Murphy told the Senate inquiry into the Morrison government's response to the pandemic that Australia had avoided 14,000 deaths by implementing strict social distancing measures, considerably fewer than the initial warning. Grattan Institute health economist Stephen Duckett said the variation between the estimates of potential deaths came down to the difference between taking no action to prevent the virus spreading and taking only limited action.
"The estimate of deaths in those early days, they assumed no lockdowns and no action," Dr Duckett said.
"If you let the disease rip, you'd have a huge number of deaths."
UNSW Business School professor of economics Gigi Foster, who has been a vocal critic of the lockdown decision, said the small number of deaths vindicated her argument governments had gone too far.
"That's an order of magnitude lower than what the modelling initially expected," she said, warning models that overestimated the spread could mean blanket restrictions that were "far more costly" than they needed to be.
ANU infectious diseases professor Peter Collignon said the modelling prepared for the government by the Doherty Institute released in April was also flawed as it assumed every person infected would pass it on to 2.5 others. Professor Collignon also took issue with the assumption people's behaviour would not change as the risk of interacting with others became clear, which he dubbed "unrealistic".
The Doherty Institute modelling made no reference to a potential 150,000 deaths or 60 per cent of the population becoming infected.
The expert modellers from the Doherty Institute have defended their work against accusations it overestimated the risk of COVID-19 to Australia. Professor James McCaw last week tweeted the modelling didn't overestimate the risk: "Rather, it underestimated society's ability to respond and prevent transmission."

Full text: Chief Medical Officer Brendan Murphy has defended the early modelling of expected coronavirus cases in Australia, despite the numbers being nowhere near as bad as even the best-case scenario.
Authorities have never released full modelling but in early April released some data.
Prepared by the Doherty Institute, it predicted daily demand on intensive care beds running from 5000 a day for the best case, including quarantine, isolation and social distancing, to 35,000 a day if the outbreak was uncontrolled.
Modelling suggested 20 per cent of the population would become infected in the first wave - or 5.1 million people - and 1 per cent would die, adding to 51,000 deaths.
By Tuesday this week, just 7133 people had been infected,and 102 had died.
Liberal Senator James Paterson questioned Professor Murphy about the modelling on Tuesday, saying the government's policy had been predicated on it.
"On the basis of that modelling, governments envisaged that we would gave quite serious restrictions ... for up to six months," he said.
"Happily that now doesn't appear to be the case. We're now only two months in and they're being eased. So policy was predicated on six month restriction scenario is obviously going to be quite out of step for what ends up being a two month scenario isn't it."
Professor Murphy said Australia was doing much better than expected but there was "no clear model or path".
"We're all finding our way," he said. "We're all looking at the danger every day and reevaluating our position, in health as in all the other responses. So, it is a very uncertain time and we still don't clearly have the end game."
The modelling had been aimed at ensuring hospitals could cope and Australia could avoid the tragedy of places like New York. It had been calculated from the basis that Australia could not staff more than 7000 intensive care beds.
"So we looked at the modelling and said what do we have to do in the somewhat artificial situation of a community-wide outbreak to bring it down to that level," he said. "That was really the purpose of that modelling - we wanted to reassure governments collectively that we had the tools in our kit bag to manage down to within the health system capacity."

Full text: Chief Medical Officer Brendan Murphy has defended the early modelling of expected coronavirus cases in Australia, despite the numbers being nowhere near as bad as even the best-case scenario.
Authorities have never released full modelling but in early April released some data.
Prepared by the Doherty Institute, it predicted daily demand on intensive care beds running from 5000 a day for the best case, including quarantine, isolation and social distancing, to 35,000 a day if the outbreak was uncontrolled.
Modelling suggested 20 per cent of the population would become infected in the first wave - or 5.1 million people - and 1 per cent would die, adding to 51,000 deaths.
By Tuesday this week, just 7133 people had been infected,and 102 had died.
Liberal Senator James Paterson questioned Professor Murphy about the modelling on Tuesday, saying the government's policy had been predicated on it.
"On the basis of that modelling, governments envisaged that we would gave quite serious restrictions ... for up to six months," he said.
"Happily that now doesn't appear to be the case. We're now only two months in and they're being eased. So policy was predicated on six month restriction scenario is obviously going to be quite out of step for what ends up being a two month scenario isn't it."
Professor Murphy said Australia was doing much better than expected but there was "no clear model or path".
"We're all finding our way," he said. "We're all looking at the danger every day and reevaluating our position, in health as in all the other responses. So, it is a very uncertain time and we still don't clearly have the end game."
The modelling had been aimed at ensuring hospitals could cope and Australia could avoid the tragedy of places like New York. It had been calculated from the basis that Australia could not staff more than 7000 intensive care beds.
"So we looked at the modelling and said what do we have to do in the somewhat artificial situation of a community-wide outbreak to bring it down to that level," he said. "That was really the purpose of that modelling - we wanted to reassure governments collectively that we had the tools in our kit bag to manage down to within the health system capacity."

"Those countries that imposed restrictions late have had terrible devastation as they bring the pandemic under control and they still have not suppressed anywhere near the level we have," he said. "So moving early was clearly the right thing to do, I'm in absolutely no doubt about that."

Full text: The true number of people infected with COVID-19 in Australia is likely to be much higher than the official government tally, experts say, with one estimate putting the figure as high as 30,000.
There have been 6623 confirmed COVID-19 cases in Australia so far, but independent epidemiologists said that number was likely to be a significant underestimate.
An underestimate of the true spread of the virus might encourage false confidence in the timing of any government decision to relax Australia's lockdown, some experts warned.
A model developed by the Actuaries Institute suggested the true number could be five times higher than the official tally of diagnoses.
"There are a lot more people with COVID-19 than there are confirmed cases," said Douglas Isles, a member of the Actuaries Institute's COVID-19 working group. Actuaries are mathematicians and statisticians who often work in insurance forecasting customer risks. "The reported data is an order of magnitude less than the actual data."
The official government modelling, led by the Melbourne-based Doherty Institute, said Australia's testing system was picking up 93 per cent of all symptomatic cases.
This is despite Australia imposing tight criteria on who can be tested, restricting it to those who have been overseas or have had known contact with someone with COVID-19. These restrictions have recently been relaxed.
The calculation behind the "case detection rate" is based on another number called the "case fatality rate" - the number of people who are infected for every person who dies. The modelling assumes Australia will have the same case fatality rate as China: on average 138 people will die for every 10,000 who are infected.
"This is a brave assumption, and unlikely to be true," said Professor John Mathews, an epidemiologist at the University of Melbourne and a former senior adviser to the federal government. That figure is not adjusted for Australia, where people may be less likely to die from the disease. Australia's healthcare was not overwhelmed as China's was, and our population demographics are different.
Professor Mathews and Professor Catherine Bennett, chair of epidemiology at Deakin University, said our true case fatality rate was probably far lower. That would mean the number of people infected is far higher than 6623. "We may underestimate how much virus is still circulating, and how much natural immunity there may be, and so government may not get the timing right for the relaxation of restrictions," Professor Bennett said.
The University of Melbourne's Professor James McCaw, a member of the Doherty modelling team, agreed there was a reasonable chance Australia's case fatality rate was different from China's.
However, he stood behind the modelling. "National testing guidelines have always allowed for clinician discretion, so testing beyond the case definition has been occurring throughout the epidemic.

Warning on effects of lifting restrictions

Full text: Social distancing is holding new COVID-19 infection levels low enough to eliminate the virus from mainland Australia, new federal government modelling shows.
While the expert team behind the modelling has not estimated a date by which the virus could be defeated, they project it could be months away, rather than weeks.
Yet loosening social distancing restrictions will inevitably lead to it returning and cases rising, researchers say, which means we would need to maintain such measures to keep the virus at bay, rather than return to life as normal.
The model suggests that every 10 people infected currently spread the virus to five more people, on average. At that level, the virus would eventually be unable to circulate and would die out within Australia.
"Our epidemic is in decline," said Professor Jodie McVernon, director of Doherty Epidemiology, which led the team that built the model for the federal government.
"But it does not let us be complacent. If we were to release those measures now ... those 10 cases today would produce 25 new cases over the course of their infection, not five."
The number of new cases of COVID-19 diagnosed per day peaked at 460 on March 28 and has since fallen steeply. Just 38 new cases were diagnosed nationally on Wednesday.
The model is not considered accurate enough, however, to project when the virus would be eliminated in the community.
"And this virus has a habit of surprising us," said Professor James McCaw, an infectious diseases epidemiologist and member of the modelling team.
Modelling of the situation in Tasmania suggests it has not reduced infection rates enough to eventually eliminate the virus. However, due to the small number of cases in Tasmania this estimate has a high degree of uncertainty.
The modelling is being used to guide the government's response to the pandemic.
It focuses on Australia's R0, or reproduction number - a measure of the average number of people an infected person infects. If that number drops below one, the virus will eventually drop out of circulation in the community. It is currently close to 0.5.
However, if social distancing measures are loosened, the number will rise.
"It's the allure of life as normal," Professor McVernon said. "Because we're all susceptible to this, the virus will come back from somewhere. We cannot return to life as normal. We need to get that in our consciousness."
It is still not known how many people are infected but display no symptoms. International estimates are as high as 60 per cent.
"It definitely makes you very cautious about relaxing measures," Professor McCaw said.
Models can only reflect the assumptions modellers choose to put into them.
The Doherty model is still largely based on Chinese data. In particular, the model bases some of its estimates on the proportion of people who die from a COVID-19 infection.
That may be lower in Australia than China due to higher standards of healthcare, said Professor Catherine Bennett, chair of epidemiology at Deakin University.
If that is true, it would mean the model underestimates the spread of COVID-19 in Australia, says Professor Bennett, "especially the community transmissions that are now our greatest concern".
Professor McCaw earlier described the model's findings - based on three separate models, all which came to agreement - as very robust.
