Full text: Five million Melburnians will be freed from a months-long lockdown this week after the Victorian government accelerated the easing of restrictions, citing new modelling which has drastically cut projections for hospitalisations.
From Friday, restrictions on leaving home will be lifted, along with a curfew and travel limits within the city. Visitors will be ­allowed into homes, and pubs and restaurants will reopen.
Premier Daniel Andrews and state health officials said a surge in Covid-19 vaccinations had ­allowed the lockdown to end ­earlier than first announced – it had been initially expected to lift in late October.
“It is really extraordinary how we’re shooting up the global rankings in terms of our vaccination coverage,” Victoria’s chief health officer, Brett Sutton, said. “It will make a huge difference to the size and complexity of the outbreak.” The announcement came a day before NSW further eases remaining health restrictions after vaccination coverage hit 80 per cent.
From Monday, the number of vaccinated adult visitors allowed in a home in NSW will double to 20 and customers will no longer need to be seated in pubs. Masks will no longer have to be worn outdoors or in offices, and face-to-face teaching in schools resumes.
“I approach this day, tomorrow, with lots of confidence,” NSW Premier Dominic Perrottet said.
“I know that they will be some nervous parents and some nervous children. But lots of excited kids as well.” The accelerated road map in Melbourne follows new Burnet ­Institute modelling predicting ­almost 2000 fewer hospitalisations when Victoria’s Covid-19 ­infections peak than it forecast less than a month ago. It also forecasts almost 1000 fewer deaths between now and the end of the year.
The institute has pointed to ­increasing vaccination rates to explain the disparity, emphasising that it bases its modelling on actual data, rather than predictions of the impact of vaccination rates.
The new Victorian measures will apply from 11.59pm on Thursday, when the state is set to reach 70 per cent vaccination coverage for those aged 16 and over.
Further easing – involving the full reopening of retail, regional travel and indoor dining for up to 150 patrons indoors and 500 out – is expected approximately 10 days later, with the state currently on a trajectory to reach 80 per cent by October 31. As of Sunday, 88.05 per cent of Victorians had ­received a first dose and 65.02 per cent were fully vaccinated.
For Melbourne toddler Benjamin Sinkovic, born amid Australia’s first wave of Covid-19 in April last year, the reopening represents a rare chance for his extended family to enjoy meals together at each other’s homes. His mother, Kylie Else, said he was especially looking forward to spending time with his Croatian-Australian grandmother, Nella Sinkovic, who is in her 70s and lives nearby.
“He’s constantly talking about his ‘Baka’. They adore each other,” Ms Else said. “For him to see family will just be amazing. It’s been so long. The poor little guy has had very little contact with anyone outside his dad and me.” Announcing the new rules on Sunday, Mr Andrews said that while he could not rule out isolated lockdowns of small and particularly vulnerable communities in future, as per national cabinet’s agreed plan, the days of city or statewide lockdowns were over.
As of Friday, Melburnians will have spent 263 days locked in their homes since March 2020.
“Why did we have lockdowns? Because we didn’t have the vaccine. Why did we have rules and density limits and all manner of quite unimaginable restrictions on people’s lives? Because we didn’t have a vaccine. We now have the vaccine,” Mr Andrews said. “We’re not locking people down any more across the board. We are instead locking people out who have not got vaccinated.” From Friday, stay-at-home ­orders, and the 9pm-to-5am curfew and 15km travel limit, will be abolished for Melburnians, but a ban on travel between Melbourne and regional Victoria will remain. The government is also changing quarantine requirements for fully vaccinated, non-household primary close contacts of Covid-19 cases, who will need to isolate for seven days rather than 14.
Health Minister Martin Foley said those in a household with an infected person would still need to isolate for the full fortnight, given that on average 45 per cent of vaccinated household contacts are still contracting the virus.
Up to 10 people including dependants will be permitted to visit private homes, and public gatherings will increase from five people from no more than two households, to 15 people with no household limit in Melbourne, and 20 people in regional Victoria.
While hospitality was always expected to reopen to 50 fully vaccinated patrons outdoors, (100 in regional Victoria), an ­additional 20 will now be permitted indoors. Retail trade will only be permitted outdoors or via click and collect, and gyms will remain closed until the 80 per cent vaccination threshold is reached. Masks will also continue to be compulsory outdoors.
On September 18, the Burnet Institute predicted Victoria’s seven-day average number of Covid-19 cases would peak at a median of 4543 on about December 15. The updated modelling, dated October 15, has that number revised down to 3850 – a 15 per cent reduction – peaking just a day later on December 16, and compares with the current seven-day average of 1851 cases, and Sunday’s 1837 cases.
Hospitalisations were previously projected to peak at a ­median of 3150, but that figure has been revised down to 1166 – a 63 per cent reduction. As of Sunday, there are 777 people in Victorian hospitals with Covid-19. Of those hospitalised at the projected peak, 706 were expected to be in ICU, with that figure now ­revised down 55 per cent to 317.
The institute has revised the number of Covid-19 deaths it expects by the end of the year in Victoria down by almost 1000, or 45 per cent, from 2202 to 1212. So far 145 people have died as a result of the current outbreak.
The latest modelling predicts Victoria’s current wave of cases will peak between October 15 and 27, with a second peak in December resulting from reopening, which the Burnet Institute forecasts will see hospital and ICU ­admissions remain relatively flat rather than declining.
However, the modellers offer the caveat that “due to uncertainty about whether the epidemic growth rate will be sustained, seasonal impacts and vaccine efficacy parameters against the delta strain, updated projections are required as more data becomes available.” Opposition Leader Matthew Guy welcomed the easing of some restrictions, but added: “It doesn’t seem consistent to me that you can have 10 people at your house but you can’t have 10 people in a shop.”

'Extraordinary' jab effort eases health threat

Full text: Victoria's sharply rising vaccination rate, plus key modelling assumptions turning out to be pessimistic, have combined to slash predictions of a huge surge in demand for hospital beds - dramatically cutting the risk of overwhelming the healthcare system.
Modelling by the Burnet Institute, commissioned by the state government and released in September, predicted huge caseloads and an overwhelmed healthcare system as Victoria reopened.
The caseload projection was right - but the length of time sick people stay in hospital is much lower than expected, updated modelling released yesterday shows.
That modelling underpinned Premier Daniel Andrews' decision to bring forward the relaxing of some restrictions to Friday.
Modelling released on September 18 projected a peak hospitalisation demand of between 1950 and 4400 people, with a greater than one-in-two chance of overwhelming the healthcare system. Updated projections released yesterday are far more rosy. Peak hospital demand is now predicted to fall between 971 and 1460.
"With the very high vaccination coverage, our health system - which will continue to have significant challenges - it will cope," said Chief Health Officer Brett Sutton.
Peak demand represents the maximum number of Victorians needing hospital care for COVID-19 at any one time. Victoria has about 1500 beds available for COVID-19 patients.
Predictions on the number of Victorians hospitalised with the disease had been accurate, said Professor Margaret Hellard, co-author of the modelling, but they were staying in hospital for a much shorter time.
"First, we've got better information on the length of stay in hospital, which is shorter than was originally the case," she said. "Second, as people get vaccinated - and as they got vaccinated faster - the number of people who go into hospital goes down, and if you're vaccinated, the average length of stay in hospital also goes down."
The Burnet Institute's modelling of NSW's outbreak also predicted full hospital beds and missed the mark - also put down to vaccination rates increasing much more quickly than expected.
Its initial modelling predicted Victoria would reach 70 per cent double-dosed on or about November 1. The state is on track to do it almost a week and a half earlier than that, about October 21.
"It's really been an extraordinary story. We've gone from 0 to 35 per cent coverage in 150 days. The 35 per cent to 70 per cent is going to happen much, much faster than that," said Professor Sutton. Victoria was now vaccinating "faster than almost any other country in the world", he said.
Despite NSW benefiting from an influx of Pfizer doses from Poland, Victoria is only a couple of weeks behind the state on vaccination rates, Mr Andrews said.
The vaccines may also be more effective at preventing hospitalisation than hoped. The Burnet Institute's model assumes they are about 87 per cent effective; new data from Britain and the Netherlands puts this at closer to 95 per cent.
Asked why Victoria's case numbers were much higher than NSW's, Professor Sutton said lockdown fatigue probably played a role. "It is related to Victoria's experience with 2020. There is fatigue. There hasn't been the same level of compliance. That means our effective reproduction number is a little bit higher right through. I find that understandable - we're all human beings, we all struggle against some of those really difficult restrictions."

We need to talk about Christmas

Full text: Victorians must be prepared to slow the opening up if necessary so we can all enjoy the festive season.
We all want a good Christmas. But if we stick to road maps without being flexible, there is a risk that cases, hospitalisation and ICU admissions will peak at Christmas, turning the festive season into one of suffering for many patients and families as well as the healthcare professionals caring for them.
Christmas will be a super-spreader event in any state living with the virus. Just as night follows day, the Christmas we want will drive case numbers up.
What do we need to do now to achieve a decent Christmas without too much risk? We need to avoid finding ourselves in a bad position in mid-December, with case numbers high, leaving no headroom for the inevitable surge in numbers that will follow the festive season.
The decision yesterday by Premier Daniel Andrews to slightly increase the freedoms we get at 70 per cent double vaccinated are a little nerve-wracking. We are speeding up the opening, while daily case numbers are about 2000.
Burnet Institute modelling has (thankfully) warned off doing at 70 per cent double vaccinated what was planned at 80 per cent double vaccinated in the Victorian road map because the risk of too much morbidity and mortality, and overwhelming the health services, was too great.
It's true that at 70 per cent double vaccinated, there are many more people out there with one dose, providing partial protection.
Nevertheless, there is a real risk that case numbers could increase notably in two weeks - especially with 10 visitors to the home permitted. So, we - through our politicians and senior health officials - need to be adaptable and prepared to dab the brakes and slow down the opening-up if necessary.
Thinking ahead to Christmas, behind what we are saying is that at 80 per cent or even 90 per cent vaccine coverage, we can't guarantee a good Christmas.
For example, in the UK about 95 per cent of all adults have immunity to COVID-19 from natural infection and/or vaccination. And still the virus spreads. In Singapore, more than 80 per cent of the total population is vaccinated, and the city state struggling to open up as the virus is surging.
Why? Because this virus is so infectious, it does not need many unvaccinated people to spread easily. And vaccinated people can spread the virus (although they are much less likely to get serious illness).
Australia is emerging as a world leader in vaccination coverage. Shooting for 95 per cent seemed impossible months ago but is now within reach. Over 95 per cent vaccine coverage will mean we can avoid much of the mortality and morbidity other countries have endured, live a better life (read: less time in lockdown), and have a buffer in 2022 for the waning vaccine immunity we know is coming.
Higher coverage is possible - in the ACT and Portugal, there is virtually no one eligible left to vaccinate.
The COVID-19 Pandemic Tradeoffs modelling we have created at the Melbourne School of Population and Global Health provides an insight into what living with the virus will be like.
This modelling shows us that at 80 per cent of vaccination coverage of adults only, running a loose suppression strategy that keeps case numbers well within health services' capacity (i.e. restrictions, including lockdowns, are put in place if the healthcare system is overwhelmed), and assuming one vaccinated but undetected infected cross-border arrival a day, that over the full course of the year, there will be about 4000 people hospitalised.
That doesn't sound bad, but to achieve this we would spend roughly half the year in lockdown! We have to do better.
Including children at 80 per cent vaccination coverage and having light restrictions on all the time (e.g. density limits, working at home most days a week if you can), hospitalisations over the year would drop to about 1000 - but there is still an average of 14 per cent of time in lockdown. We have to do better yet - and we can.
Innovations such as ventilation and air filtration of buildings, use of mass rapid antigen testing when needed, wearing masks in enclosed public spaces - and going for over 95 per cent vaccine coverage - will reduce or even remove the need for lockdowns. That is, a Vaccine-PLUS strategy.
We need to wait for approvals to vaccinate children but achieving 95 per cent coverage of the currently eligible population by Christmas is achievable.
To have a good Christmas, we need to ensure case numbers are low (and preferably falling) in the weeks leading into Christmas. High vaccination will help achieve that.
We also need to be prepared to dab the brakes if necessary in November (or earlier) if case numbers surge too high, and be prepared to dab the brakes in late November and early December if necessary to ensure case numbers are - say - less than 1000 a day and preferably falling in the lead-up to Christmas.

NSW Freedom Day: Best reasons to enjoy the end of lockdown

Full text: GLOBALLY, DEATHS ARE DROPPING While Covid is by no means conquered, the seven-day average of global reported deaths from Covid is as low as it has been in 11 months. And a look at numbers also shows that while at this time last year deaths were trending upwards as the northern hemisphere entered the winter months, this year the trend is pointing decidedly downwards.

VACCINES ARE WORKING … Across the globe, heavily vaccinated countries that have opened back up have broken the link between cases and deaths. Iceland made headlines around the world when it experienced a surge of cases in August, despite having more than 85 per cent jabbed. Yet that “surge” was associated with only three deaths. Singapore is often pointed to as a warning as well, but despite a spike in cases – more than 3,000 per day – the country is experiencing fewer fatalities than locked-down NSW, with an average six deaths daily.
Daily Telegraph - News Feed latest episode

... WHILE RESTRICTIONS AREN’T A funny thing happened when Denmark (vaccination rate: more than 80% per cent of over-12s) recently declared that, as far as they were concerned, the pandemic was over and it was time to live with Covid as they do with everything else: cases dropped. On September 1, the day virtually all restrictions were lifted on Denmark’s 5.8 million citizens, the country was on 825 cases per day. As of Saturday, they were at a 7-day average of 500. Even better, the nation is suffering just one fatality per week from Covid, on average. Then again, there’s always Melbourne.

NORMAL IS POSSIBLE NSW medico Kerry Chant recently warned of a “new world order” going forward, but there is little reason we can’t get back to normal. Great Britain was one of the most Covid-ravaged nations on earth last year, and has since the pandemic seen more than eight million cases and 138,000 deaths. Yet, ever since Prime Minister Boris Johnson declared “freedom day” on July 19, Brits have been getting on with it.

MODELS ARE BROKEN … AND THAT’S A GOOD THING Around the world, supposedly expert pandemic modelling has proven itself to be needlessly alarmist, scaring both policy makers and whole populations into draconian restrictions – and Australia was not immune. At the start of the pandemic Deputy Chief Medical Officer Paul Kelly said that under a “best case” scenario, 50,000 Aussies might die. The real number has turned out to be closer to 1,000. Celebrity doctors like the ABC’s Norman Swan warned we were going to become a subtropical northern Italy as cases and deaths doubled. British epidemiologist Neil Ferguson, who predicted outcomes many times worse for the UK than they actually experienced, last week had to admit that his predictions of 100,000 daily cases after reopening was wrong – and said that future lockdowns were “unlikely” to be necessary.

ESPECIALLY IN NSW Public health groups such as Melbourne’s Burnet Instiute keep predicting that Covid disaster is just around the corner for the state – but happily, they seem to keep getting it wrong. Even before NSW began opening up, Burnet was predicting that as 3,900 patients might need hospitalisation at any one time in Sydney. But numbers peaked at half that and remain trending in the right direction.

ASTRAZENECA IS BETTER AND SAFER THAN WE THOUGHT If ever there was a reason to keep politics out of a pandemic, the saga of the AstraZeneca vaccine is it. Remember when Queensland CHO Jeannette Young said, ““I said I didn’t want 18-year-olds to have AstraZeneca and I still don’t,” citing a rare risk of blood clots? It turns out that the already minuscule risk turns out to be just one-fifth of what experts originally thought it was. And, there’s even some evidence suggesting that in the long run the cheap, locally made jab could be more effective than Pfizer.

Full text: Dominic Perrottet, in one of his first major acts as NSW Premier, on Thursday unveiled an accelerated easing of restrictions that will have students back in schools by October 25, and double the number of visitors allowed in a home from Monday.
Fully vaccinated NSW residents will be able to welcome 10 visitors to their home, up from a limit of five, and socialise in groups of 30 outdoors, up from a cap of 20, from Monday, under a revised road map that Mr Perrottet ­labelled “measured and sensible”.
Mask requirements in offices will be scrapped at 80 per cent vaccination, slated for October 18, rather than 90 per cent.
The moves come as new commonwealth data obtained by The Australian shows 63 per cent of children between 12 and 15 years old in NSW have already received one dose of Covid-19 vaccine, less than a month after that age group became eligible.
In Victoria, that figure is 59 per cent, while more than 80 per cent of children in the ACT have also had their first vaccination.
Those rates are considerably higher than the national average – 49 per cent – and more than ­double those of other major states, including Queensland and Western Australia.
As NSW reached its 70 per cent double-dose target, Scott Morrison on Thursday said the rising vaccination rates demonstrated supply challenges had been ­addressed and the country was “on the home stretch”.
“I believe Australia can achieve much higher vaccination rates than the 70 and 80 per cent that we’ve set out in the national plan and that will only give us greater confidence and enable us to move even more quickly as we open the country up,” the Prime Minister said.
The Australian Technical Advisory Group on Immunisation is on Friday expected to announce that the immuno-compromised should be given a third dose of the Covid-19 vaccine, following moves in the EU that approved an extra dose 28 days after the second.
A recommendation by ATAGI on third jabs for the wider population is unlikely until next year, as health authorities monitor overseas programs, with the US, ­Britain, Israel and France among those countries already offering boosters.
ANU infectious diseases physician Peter Collignon said the “brilliant” uptake of the Covid-19 vaccine in 12-15 year olds could lead to restrictions being eased earlier than anticipated.
“The more people we vaccinate from any age group the better, because it means we will see a much lower risk of people getting the virus and passing the virus on to others,” he said.
“Basically, if people are vaccinated, it’s safer for them, safer for everyone else and means we can open up sooner.”
Professor Collignon pointed to the fact that 12-15 year olds were not initially counted in the Doherty Institute modelling that would see Australia open up when 70 per cent of the population was vaccinated, with more freedoms being offered at 80 per cent. “Now that under-16s are getting vaccinated, it’s very possible we could see that road map moved forward because it means we may be able to relax things earlier.”
Mr Morrison said the new road map for NSW was beginning the process of opening safely and staying safely open, calling it “the light at the end of the tunnel”.
“That’s what the national plan is about. When you hit those vaccination rates, you can open with certainty again and you can open safely with certainty again and you can stay open,” he said.
The Australian’s Editor-at-Large Paul Kelly says the reopening of New South Wales is “fundamental” to Prime Minister Scott Morrison’s election strategy.
“We have passed the first major milestone for Australians getting their lives back.” Mr Morrison said residents now had the certainty to make plans and bookings for the months ahead.
“I want this to be a sign of hope to the rest of the country, partic­ularly those in Victoria, who I’m mindful of today, and here in the ACT, where the lockdowns continue.”
However, the NSW moves were criticised on Thursday by the Australian Medical Association for “the potential sidelining of public health advice” after the state’s chief health officer, Kerry Chant, was notably absent from the press conference announcing the changes to the road map.
“The AMA is very concerned at the apparent shift in approach to the management of Covid-19 in NSW announced today”, AMA president Omar Khorshid said, warning the move could lead to “avoidable deaths”.
“The changes to the road map have occurred at the 11th hour without the presence of the chief health officer Dr Kerry Chant at the announcement,” he said.
The AMA supported the gradual opening up of the economy, but it was critical to observe the impact of each step on transmission and case numbers, otherwise NSW would still see hospitals become “completely overwhelmed” despite high vaccination rates, he said. “NSW must not be reckless at this critical time. That would cost more lives, cause more suffering, and put the economies of NSW and the nation at risk.”
The move to bring forward face-to-face lessons for all students in NSW by October 25 comes despite estimates only 85 per cent of teachers are vaccinated, with November 8 set as the deadline.
NSW Teachers Federation president Angelo Gavrielatos said the low vaccination rate was because teachers had never been prioritised during the vaccine rollout.
“How do you intend to staff a school with all students present from October 25 when only 85 per cent of your workforce has been double-vaccinated?” he said.
However, Mr Perrottet was unapologetic: “It’s a major relief for parents and their sanity, and … I want to thank all the teachers who are there getting vaccinated to ensure we can open our schools as safely as possible.”
Sky News Political Editor Andrew Clennell says there were no arguments in this crisis cabinet meeting last night about easing restrictions earlier.

Full text: ANOTHER DAY, ANOTHER NEW AND DIFFERENT EXCUSE
LAGGING vaccination rates in poorer communities has become the Palaszczuk government’s latest roadblock to reopening under the national plan when 80 per cent of people are double-dosed.
In what was the government’s fifth different excuse for walking away from its pledge to reopen, Health Minister Yvette D’Ath raised the new jab concerns yesterday, just 24 hours after Premier Annastacia Palaszczuk claimed the state’s hospitals were not properly prepared.
Ms D’Ath also told Queenslanders they would need to wait for international travel to be trialled in NSW, though experts insist there is no reason why the Sunshine State cannot commit to reopening now. When asked if the state would reopen at 80 per cent, Premier Annastacia Palaszczuk’s office on Saturday said she was still waiting for “completed advice” from the Doherty Institute.
But that advice is done, with a federal government spokesman saying NSW, the ACT, NT and Victoria had released road maps.
“It is a matter for Queensland to articulate why they cannot make decisions based on the advice already provided to … other states,” he said.
Infectious diseases expert Paul Griffin said other states were implementing the same advice Queensland had.
“I don’t think we need to reinvent the wheel here in terms of questioning that ­advice too much,” he said.
Just days after Ms Palaszczuk contentiously asked why people would want to travel to India or Tokyo, Ms D’Ath on Saturday questioned why anyone would want to travel to Bali, which has had an average of 1900 cases daily for the past week.
“I have said continuously around the 80 per cent threshold that the Doherty Institute modelling is not just about percentage,” she said.
“It’s also whether, as a state, what’s the number of outbreaks you’ve got? Whether you are able to test, whether you are able to contract trace, whether you are able to isolate the virus and manage those things.
“I saw the reference to Bali … where people will be able to travel to Bali and back but may not be able to travel to Queensland. Can I say I don’t know if anyone wants to be travelling to Bali right now when they recorded 1693 cases two days ago.” It’s understood the Doherty Institute explained its update on the impact of Covid-19 spread if seven-day home quarantine was adopted during Friday’s national cabinet meeting.
The federal government spokesman said Doherty would continue to advise ­national cabinet in addition to the modelling that was ­finalised and adopted by all jurisdictions in September.
“Governments should hold up their end of the deal made with Australians, that if they get vaccinated they would be able to enjoy greater freedoms,” he said.
Assoc Prof Griffin said if Queensland delayed a decision there could be a “big lag” before it could be implemented.
“We do risk being significantly behind other states (in border reopenings),” he said.
Ms D’Ath said the government was not “closed off” to the idea of resuming international travel but the Commonwealth had to do more planning around what countries Australia opened up to.
Ms D’Ath said the 80 per cent vaccination rate figure was “one element” of the Doherty modelling.
She said the remaining unvaccinated 20 per cent “could be our remote indigenous communities, it could be our low-socio economic, it could be our multicultural communities that have a lower percentage of protection in their vaccination rates.”
LINES OF EVASION July 2 The plan The National Cabinet agreed to formulate a four-phase National Plan to transition Australia’s National Covid Response.
August 6 Scott Morrison says plan is agreed to: The National Cabinet agreed to adopt in full an updated National Plan, based on the Doherty Institute’s findings. This follows the National Cabinet’s agreement in principle to the updated National Plan on July 30.
August 16 A long way off the threshold that allows an easing of restrictions, the Premier said: “We are provided constantly with advice from the Doherty Institute and what (it) is saying is that 80 per cent national threshold is what we are aiming towards.”
August 17 Still discretion for specific lockdowns. Annastacia Palaszczuk said: “(The national cabinet plan) doesn’t say we are not going to have lockdowns, but that lockdowns will be minimised. That Doherty research starts from the premise that Australia is in a situation with very little Covid.”
August 24 Modelling predicated on different case numbers. Ms Palaszczuk said: “(The modelling used was) predicated on 30 cases across Australia, not 13,000. So I’m looking forward to seeing that modelling.”
August 28 Wanted “a look” at the new modelling. The Doherty Institute reiterated to national cabinet on August 27 that it would be safe to reopen the country once 80 per cent of over-16s were fully vaccinated – regardless of case numbers. A spokesman for Ms Palaszczuk said her government was yet to receive the paper and “looks forward to further discussions next week”.
September 1 Premier Annastacia Palaszczuk: “What’s going to happen to the children? We need to have further research done on what happens to the 0 to 12-year-old cohort as they remain unvaccinated.”
September 2 Worst case scenario Doherty modelling. Ms Palaszczuk said: “Doherty Institute modelling predicts that even with 70 per cent of the population vaccinated, 80 people will die each day from Covid once the outbreak reaches six months after it started. That is 2240 who will die each month.”
September 23 What freedoms or rewards would Queenslanders get? Ms Palaszczuk: “The national plan hasn’t been finalised, they’re still doing work. We’ve got another meeting next week so everyone can just hold off and calm down until next Friday.”
October 1 Hospital funding. Ms Palaszczuk: “I am not going to put Queenslanders at risk until ... a big injection of funds from the federal government into the states to make sure the hospitals are able to cope with the growth (in cases) that will happen.”
October 2 Vax rates. Yvette D’Ath said: “That 20 per cent ... could be our remote indigenous communities ... our low-socio economic ... that have a lower percentage of protection in their vaccination rates.”

Full text: Plenty of Covid-19 modelling paints a pessimistic outlook which is proving to be wrong EIGHT weeks ago, Premier Daniel Andrews consulted his virus model and hit Melbourne with its sixth lockdown. “I don’t want us to finish up like Sydney,” he said.
Congratulations, Premier. Melbourne today looks nothing like Sydney. It’s worse. Victoria’s infections are rising faster than Sydney’s ever did – 950 new cases on Wednesday, compared to 863 in NSW, a bigger state.
Melbourne also has the nastiest lockdown, plus curfew and mass protests, while Sydney is without a curfew and opening up. What’s clear is not just that Andrews’ lockdowns have been pointlessly cruel.
It’s also clear that the models Premiers cite to justify their lockdowns are little better than junk. They’re like the climate models which predict disasters that don’t happen. If these virus models — computer simulations of outcomes of various policies — were right, Melbourne would be free and Sydney the basket case.
But they’re not. Just two weeks ago, Professor Raina MacIntyre, a Kirby Institute epidemiologist, criticised the softer lockdown in NSW, warning “our model estimates there will still be numbers in the high thousands by middle of October”.
Instead, new infections in NSW have fallen to one tenth that number. That won’t deter MacIntyre, who remains a media favourite even though her scary models keep flopping. In March last year, she warned that “hundreds of thousands” of Australians could die of the virus. True death toll: under 1300.
She then warned that Christmas last year would be “a ticking time bomb” spreading infections through NSW, which “could be looking at 3000 cases by January 8”. True number of cases on January 8: just four.
But it’s not just MacIntyre who should chuck out whatever she’s using for her models. Right at the start of this pandemic, the Prime Minister’s advisers said their own models predicted at least 50,000 of us would die.
Another dud model, reported in the Medical Journal of Australia, warned in March last year that “Australia could run out of ICU beds to treat coronavirus patients in as few as 10 days”.
When those 10 days were up, with many hundreds of ICU beds to spare, Australia’s then Chief Medical Officer doubled down: “This is a horrendous scenario. A daily demand for new intensive care beds of 35,000-plus.” True number of Australians with Covid-19 in intensive care today: fewer than 300. Yet this farce continues.
The Burnet Institute two months ago urged a harder lockdown of Sydney, ­because unless new controls worked “our model projects that Sydney will have about 7700 cases per day four weeks from now”. Instead, the NSW Government eased its restrictions and infections never topped 1600 a day and are now half that.
The Burnet Institute, undaunted, now advises the Victorian Government, predicting up to 2900 daily cases a month from now — but note the critical difference. In Victoria, Premier And­rews seems to treat models as holy writ, either to cover his backside or maybe because they tell him what he wants to hear: go in even harder. In contrast, the NSW Government now takes such models with a pinch of salt.
On Tuesday, NSW Health Minister Brad Hazzard explained why: he said he well remembered being told that models showed 20,000 people in his state would die by last Christmas.
But why are these virus models ­always so pessimistic? Why are global warming models also so ludicrously catastrophic? Blame human nature. Which expert is safest and heard more eagerly: the one who predicts the worst and then is pleasantly surprised, or the one who says “don’t panic” and then gets scapegoated when governments are caught out unprepared?
I suspect some virus experts — like global warming academics — also know the kind of models their political masters often prefer.
They like ones that falsely predict ­catastrophe, so they can later take credit for saving us from horrors that were never going to happen.
Brett Sutton, Victoria’s chief health officer, has played that game. Already in April last year, he touted modelling by Monash University and the Doherty ­Institute to boast that the government’s lockdown had helped save up to 36,000 Victorians from death.
“Hundreds of thousands of Victorians would have been infected, if we just had isolation and quarantine,” he said.
That’s plainly crazy. Sweden, with twice Victoria’s population and no ocean moat to keep out the infected, had no hard lockdowns and now lives with no restrictions. Yet its death toll is 14,000. Sutton should file his models under “trash” and check the real word. As should we all.

Full text: PREMIER HOLDING OUT FOR MORE DOHERTY DATA QUEENSLANDERS may get no answers to what life looks like in a post-Covid world ­following Friday’s highly anticipated national cabinet, with Premier Annastacia Palaszczuk demanding answers that the federal government says she ­already has.
Ms Palaszczuk wants Prime Minister Scott Morrison to release “revised Doherty modelling” before Friday’s meeting and then publicly, which she says she needs to determine border reopenings and ongoing restrictions.
But a spokesman for the Mr Morrison’s office said Ms ­Palaszczuk already had all updated modelling of how cases would grow if the country opened up amid NSW and Victorian outbreaks.
The conflicting statements follow weeks of Ms Palaszczuk insisting she needs the further work to decide on border reopenings, the further lessening of restrictions and how to respond to future outbreaks in a 70 per cent or 80 per cent double-vaccinated society.
“I look forward to seeing the modelling before this week’s national cabinet meeting,” Ms Palaszczuk said when asked what she wanted to learn at ­Friday’s forum.
“In order to chart a course out of this pandemic and protect our way of life in Queensland, we must have the best, most up-to-date research.
“I encourage the Prime Minister to release the revised Doherty modelling before Friday’s meeting and then publicly,” she said.
Ms Palaszczuk’s spokesman said the Premier was expecting to receive an update to the modelling in order to understand what happens to Covid-19 spread at 70 or 80 per cent vaccination rates if the country opens up when a ­massive outbreak is already under way.
But a spokeswoman for the Prime Minister's office said national cabinet had been provided that “final sensitivity analysis” on higher case numbers and vaccinating children under 16 at their last meeting on September 17.
“Doherty is now undertaking complementary work that focuses on how to best manage high risk groups including Indigenous Australians and other cohorts such as schools, as Australia moves forward with the agreed plan to reopen the country,” she said.
The extra work being done by Doherty Institute researchers, to be presented on Friday with more to come in mid-October, includes how public health measures such as contact tracing can be enhanced or updated to work best when the country starts opening up at 80 per cent and tailoring health measures to best protect certain cohorts, including those with disabilities.
The Doherty Institute is also looking at what measures, such as home quarantine, will work best at reducing transmission of the virus when international travel resumes. The confusion comes as the NSW government gave the clearest indication of what living with Covid might look like, releasing its plan for when the state hits 70 and 80 per cent full vaccination levels.
At 80 per cent, vaccinated residents will initially be able to travel anywhere freely in NSW, stand to drink at a pub, welcome up to 10 visitors to a home, gather with 20 people outside, and have 200 people at a Covid-safe event and 500 at a ticketed and seated event.
Community sport will resume, venues will operate with a one person per 4sq m rule and there will be no limits on guests at weddings and funerals for fully vaccinated people.
The unvaccinated will be able to enjoy those ­freedoms later, when mask restrictions will significantly ease and there will be no limits on people gathering.
Queensland chief health officer Jeannette Young said businesses and residents should “prepare and hope” for borders to open by Christmas, but said it was too “simplistic” to commit to opening at 80 per cent.
“It would be wonderful to be able to know we’ve got to 80 per cent and something will happen,” she said.
“Unfortunately, it’s just not that straightforward.” Ms Palaszczuk said that she was “pretty proud of the life we have in Queensland at the ­moment”, but would love to see “as many people as possible ­reunited with their families”. “The Prime Minister is working on those countries where there can be a travel bubble into the future,” she said. Ms Palaszczuk’s spokesman said that the Premier agreed with the national plan that ­provided for more localised lockdowns at 70 and 80 per cent and pointed out Queensland was only closed to declared local government hotspots.

Full text: PREMIER HOLDING OUT FOR MORE DOHERTY DATA QUEENSLANDERS may get no answers to what life looks like in a post-Covid world ­following Friday’s highly anticipated national cabinet, with Premier Annastacia Palaszczuk demanding answers that the federal government says she ­already has.
Ms Palaszczuk wants Prime Minister Scott Morrison to release “revised Doherty modelling” before Friday’s meeting and then publicly, which she says she needs to determine border reopenings and ongoing restrictions.
But a spokesman for the Mr Morrison’s office said Ms ­Palaszczuk already had all updated modelling of how cases would grow if the country opened up amid NSW and Victorian outbreaks.
The conflicting statements follow weeks of Ms Palaszczuk insisting she needs the further work to decide on border reopenings, the further lessening of restrictions and how to respond to future outbreaks in a 70 per cent or 80 per cent double-vaccinated society.
“I look forward to seeing the modelling before this week’s national cabinet meeting,” Ms Palaszczuk said when asked what she wanted to learn at ­Friday’s forum.
“In order to chart a course out of this pandemic and protect our way of life in Queensland, we must have the best, most up-to-date research.
“I encourage the Prime Minister to release the revised Doherty modelling before Friday’s meeting and then publicly,” she said.
Ms Palaszczuk’s spokesman said the Premier was expecting to receive an update to the modelling in order to understand what happens to Covid-19 spread at 70 or 80 per cent vaccination rates if the country opens up when a ­massive outbreak is already under way.
But a spokeswoman for the Prime Minister's office said national cabinet had been provided that “final sensitivity analysis” on higher case numbers and vaccinating children under 16 at their last meeting on September 17.
“Doherty is now undertaking complementary work that focuses on how to best manage high risk groups including Indigenous Australians and other cohorts such as schools, as Australia moves forward with the agreed plan to reopen the country,” she said.
The extra work being done by Doherty Institute researchers, to be presented on Friday with more to come in mid-October, includes how public health measures such as contact tracing can be enhanced or updated to work best when the country starts opening up at 80 per cent and tailoring health measures to best protect certain cohorts, including those with disabilities.
The Doherty Institute is also looking at what measures, such as home quarantine, will work best at reducing transmission of the virus when international travel resumes. The confusion comes as the NSW government gave the clearest indication of what living with Covid might look like, releasing its plan for when the state hits 70 and 80 per cent full vaccination levels.
At 80 per cent, vaccinated residents will initially be able to travel anywhere freely in NSW, stand to drink at a pub, welcome up to 10 visitors to a home, gather with 20 people outside, and have 200 people at a Covid-safe event and 500 at a ticketed and seated event.
Community sport will resume, venues will operate with a one person per 4sq m rule and there will be no limits on guests at weddings and funerals for fully vaccinated people.
The unvaccinated will be able to enjoy those ­freedoms later, when mask restrictions will significantly ease and there will be no limits on people gathering.
Queensland chief health officer Jeannette Young said businesses and residents should “prepare and hope” for borders to open by Christmas, but said it was too “simplistic” to commit to opening at 80 per cent.
“It would be wonderful to be able to know we’ve got to 80 per cent and something will happen,” she said.
“Unfortunately, it’s just not that straightforward.” Ms Palaszczuk said that she was “pretty proud of the life we have in Queensland at the ­moment”, but would love to see “as many people as possible ­reunited with their families”. “The Prime Minister is working on those countries where there can be a travel bubble into the future,” she said. Ms Palaszczuk’s spokesman said that the Premier agreed with the national plan that ­provided for more localised lockdowns at 70 and 80 per cent and pointed out Queensland was only closed to declared local government hotspots.

Hopes for fall in cases as jab numbers continue rise

Full text: Victoria's latest data has improved hopes of curtailing the COVID-19 outbreak and avoiding the strain on hospitals predicted by government-commissioned modelling.
Fresh data shows Victorian contact tracers are performing optimally - better than their NSW counterparts - and vaccines have caused fewer COVID-infected Victorians to end up in hospital than in last year's outbreak.
Premier Daniel Andrews said he hoped cases would plateau when the state reached the 50 per cent double-dose mark, which he said was about when NSW's daily case numbers began to subside.
Epidemiologists Tony Blakely, who did modelling for the Andrews government, and Catherine Bennett said cases could soon trend downwards.
The Premier offered no guarantee that unvaccinated Victorians would be spared "lockouts" from restaurants and events in the foreseeable future, on the same day NSW Premier Gladys Berejiklian announced vaccinated and non-vaccinated people in that state would be subjected to the same set of rules from December.
Victoria recorded 705 new cases of coronavirus yesterday. Mr Andrews said case growth was at the slower end of the Burnet Institute's potential outbreak scenarios that underpinned last week's reopening roadmap.
"I think it's at the more positive end of the scale ... but it can change quickly," he said as the state neared 48 per cent double-dose coverage. "The 50 per cent double dose was a significant thing for [NSW], and you started to see some stability come to their numbers. We're not at 50 per cent yet, but we're getting quite close. To the extent that it was meaningful there, let's hope it's meaningful here, too."
The latest flashpoint in the public debate over mandatory vaccinations emerged yesterday when the University of Melbourne announced its staff and students must be inoculated to return to in-person learning in November.
Within minutes of that declaration, the university's National Tertiary Education Union branch joined a long line of trade unions opposing vaccine mandates, urging consultation.
"The branch committee calls on the university to NOT issue a vaccine mandate at this time, and to instead engage with staff and the NTEU about the full suite of safety measures," a union statement said.
NSW will begin winding back public health rules on October 11 after 70 per cent of its residents are fully vaccinated. In December, when it's hoped 90 per cent of people will have had two doses of the vaccine, unvaccinated Sydneysiders will enjoy the same freedoms as inoculated ones, with no limits on home visitors, and minimal density limits. Daily infections in the state continued to decline yesterday, dropping to 787.
Responding to the easing of restrictions for unvaccinated people in NSW, Mr Andrews said the government had not yet turned its mind to which rules would be eased as vaccine uptake surged beyond 80 per cent, but warned against loosening restrictions for those who chose not to be vaccinated.
"I do not want to be signalling to people 'well, don't bother; don't bother being part of the 80 per cent [because] there's no urgency, you'll only be locked out of the pub for a few weeks'," he said.
The proportion of Victoria's active cases in hospital is about 4 per cent, compared to 14 per cent in August last year when outbreaks were rife among Victoria's unvaccinated aged care residents.
Despite recording hundreds of cases for weeks, data from the federal Health Department's national COVID-19 metric database shows 100 per cent of people who test positive in Victoria are notified within 24 hours, which is a key marker of top contact-tracing performance. In NSW, two-thirds are being told within a day.
Professor Blakely said it was too difficult to predict exactly when Victoria's epidemic curve would start bending down, but he believed it would occur soon. He added the rate of spread among sub-populations in hotspots where the virus was spreading rapidly would determine whether the outbreak was curbed.
Professor Bennett said Victoria was beyond the vaccination rate of NSW when its outbreak started to turn, and might experience the same effect any time now.

Full text: The City of Latrobe will enter a seven day lockdown from 11.59pm on Tuesday night following a rapid increase in Covid cases in recent days.
Residents can only leave their home for essential goods and services, caregiving or compassionate reasons, authorised work or permitted education, exercise or outdoor interaction and getting vaccinated.
Locals are not permitted to travel to other parts of regional Victoria unless it is for those reasons.
Shopping, exercise and outdoor social interaction will be limited to 15km from the home for four hours each day.
Residents can meet with one other person, or up to four others from two households if all present are fully vaccinated.
Masks will also be mandatory for both indoors and outdoors settings.
While people can visit their intimate partner or single social bubble buddy, no other visitors will be allowed in the home.
Authorities are urging residents to abide by the health measures and get tested if they are experiencing any symptoms.
“If you’re in the City of Latrobe, please follow the lockdown restrictions, get tested if you have symptoms, and get vaccinated if you haven’t already,” Acting Chief Health Officer Professor Ben Cowie said.
“We’ve just seen the Ballarat and Geelong communities get through an outbreak so we know it can be done – it’s vital we protect the local community and the rest of regional Victoria from significant outbreaks.”
A rapid response team has also been deployed to the area to provide additional support testing, andboost capacity and extend opening hours.
There are coronavirus testing sites in Traralgon, Morwell, and Moe, while capacity will be boosted in Baw Baw and Bass Coast.
There are now 18 active coronavirus cases in the City of Latrobe Local Government Area.
73 per cent of the population has had at least one vaccination dose, while 44% are fully vaccinated.
867 NEW CASES ACROSS VICTORIA Victoria announced a record 867 new cases on Tuesday, but the number of active cases has risen by more than a thousand thanks to a data glitch.
A software error resulted in 149 cases not being counted over the past two days, with 140 of those missing from Monday’s count.
The number of new cases announced on Monday should have been 845, meaning Victoria had overtaken NSW for the first time since this outbreak started.
NSW Health announced they had recorded 787 local cases in the 24 hours to 8pm on September 26.
Meanwhile, NSW on Tuesday recorded 863 new local cases and seven deaths in the 24 hours to 8pm on September 27.
The Victorian government had previously welcomed Monday’s numbers as being slightly lower — initially reported as 705 — but they stressed it was too early to draw any conclusions.
A department spokesman said they became aware of the issue “late yesterday”.
“The department became aware that a number of Covid-19 test results were incorrectly recorded by a third-party software vendor supporting a private provider,” a Health Department spokesman said.
“These results included 9 cases reportable on 26 September and 140 cases reportable on 27 September.
“Those 149 cases are reported in today’s numbers – meaning today’s actual case number is 867.”
Health Minister Martin Foley said while the test results had not been reported to the Health Department’s central system, all people who had tested positive had been notified.
Four Covid deaths were recorded on Tuesday. Three of those were unvaccinated with the vaccination status of the fourth person, a woman in her 50s, not yet determined.
35,160 vaccine doses were administered in state-run clinics.
Data reveals 77.9 per cent of Victorians have had their first dose of a Covid vaccine, with 47.7 per cent fully vaccinated.
VICTORIA WON’T MOVE ON PFIZER GAPS Health Minister Martin Foley has shot down suggestions Victoria should halve the gap between Pfizer doses to speed up vaccination rates.
Mr Foley said the state’s main priority was to ensure enough supply for first-dose Pfizer jabs.
He said authorities needed to guarantee stock levels throughout October before considering cutting wait times from six weeks to three.
“We need to make sure that the vaccine first ring of protection is provided to everyone and that means as soon as we get to that point of protection, then the scheduling of the second dose might well be able to be brought forward,” he said.
“We’re doing a lot of work on that,” he said.
“We hope that the certainty of supply across all three platforms — GPs, pharmacies and state clinics over October — will give us that certainty which will then allow us to bring that gap back to less than six weeks for the mRNA Pfizer and Moderna vaccines.
“That should then bring forward that all-important double dose pictures of 70 and 80 per cent.”
It comes as federal Health Department boss Dr Brendan Murphy revealed the state had enough Pfizer doses to shorten the gap between doses.
Prof Murphy told a Senate committee on Tuesday morning there was now sufficient supply “to bring that forward”.
He said he was sure Victorian authorities were considering that after new supply levels were locked in last Friday.
Health Minister Greg Hunt said the six-week interval between Pfizer shots at state-run clinics was a matter for the Andrews government.
“There is enough supply for every person in Victoria — 100 per cent of people 12 and up — to be double vaccinated before the end of October,” he said.
“The formal TGA approval is for three weeks, the guidance from ATAGI is for three to six weeks.”
LATROBE VALLEY ON HIGH ALERT Rapid testing will be rolled out across Victoria’s Latrobe region after infectious people were found out in the community, including at a household gathering on the grand final weekend.
Authorities reported 12 new cases for the shire, with 16 total active cases across three households in Morwell and Traralgon.
A rapid response testing unit has been deployed to the Traralgon Basketball Stadium and more pop-up testing sites will be set up in coming days.
There are concerns that case numbers will continue to grow.
Health Minister Martin Foley said infected people had attended a “social gathering of a number of households” in the Latrobe Valley.
It is not yet known if the gathering was a grand final viewing party but authorities had expressed concern about a rise in illegal gatherings on the weekend.
Mr Foley would not rule out plunging the region into lockdown if case numbers continued to spike.
WHERE VICTORIA’S LATEST CASES EMERGED • 550 cases in Melbourne’s northern suburbs, including 270 in Hume, 125 in Whittlesea, 88 in Moreland, 43 in Darebin and 24 in Banyule
• 188 in Melbourne’s west including 55 in Melton, 51 in Wyndham, 54 in Brimbank and 28 in Moonee Valley
• 82 cases Melbourne’s southeast, including 45 in Casey, 20 in Port Phillip and 16 in Greater Dandenong
• 38 in Melbourne’s east, including 14 in Maroondah, 14 in Knox and 10 in the Yarra Ranges
• 28 in regional Victoria, including 12 in the Latrobe Valley, five in Mitchell Shire, two in Baw Baw, two in Geelong, one in Corangamite, one in Warrnambool, one in Horsham, one in Gannawarra Shire, one in Macedon and two cases in Shepparton
VICTORIA TRIALS ISOLATION APP Victorians isolating at home will take part in a pilot program to test a new check-in system.
The app matches selfies with location-based technology to confirm a person is at home, where they are meant to be.
“It will add to the tools to make sure that people are where they’re meant to be and when they’re meant to be,” Health Minister Martin Foley said.
“This will assist Victorians coming back from overseas sooner rather than later.”
AUSSIES TO TEST FOR COVID AT HOME Australians will soon be able to take a Covid-19 test from the comfort of their home after the federal government gave the green light for do-it-yourself tests to be made available from November 1.
The rapid antigen tests are already widely available for at-home use around the world, including in the UK and US, and provide a result in just 20 minutes.
Health Minister Greg Hunt welcomed the new at-home option, saying it would help Australians adapt to living safely with the virus.
But the Health Minister said it would be up to state and territory leaders whether they would allow at-home testing within their jurisdictions.
Victorian Health Minister Martin Foley would not be drawn on the government’s plan to roll out the tests but said they would be “an important additional tool in the public health response”.
“It won’t replace PCR testing but will give ... greater protection.”
He said the state government was already looking at whether to incorporate rapid antigen testing into its public health plan, and would “work with the commonwealth” before making a decision.

RETAIL TURNOVER FALLS AMID LOCKDOWNS The latest figures from the ABS highlight the impact of Victoria’s latest lockdowns on the retail sector, with turnover down 3 per cent for August.
Australia-wide, retail trade was down by 1.7 per cent month on month, with restrictions in Victoria and NSW (which recorded a drop of 3.5 per cent) pulling down the country’s figures.
Clothing, footwear and personal accessory retail saw the biggest drop (-15.7 per cent) across the country, followed by cafes, department stores (-10.2 per cent), restaurants and takeaway (-7 per cent) and household goods (-2.3 per cent).
Food retail, on the other hand, rose by 2.1 per cent.
Quarterly Economy Wide Surveys director Ben James said “Retail turnover continues to be negatively impacted by lockdown restrictions”.
“Each of the eastern mainland states (experienced) falls in line with their respective level of restrictions,” he said.
“In direct contrast, states with no lockdowns performed well with Western Australia and South Australia enjoying strong rises as physical stores were open for trade.”
Melbourne’s sixth lockdown began on August 5.
FEDERAL GOVT BACKS VIC ROADMAP Professor Brendan Murphy has backed the roadmaps released by Victoria and New South Wales.
It comes after Daniel Andrews and Glayd Berejiklian were slammed by the peak body for small businesses for ignoring the National Plan to reopen Australia.
NSW Premier Gladys Berejiklian on Monday detailed a new 90 per cent double-vaxxed target for opening up the state, despite the national plan that she and Daniel Andrews signed up to committing to a relaxation of most restrictions at 80 per cent.
In Victoria, Mr Andrews refused to even commit to matching NSW’s proposed freedoms at 90 per cent.
Small Business Australia executive director Bill Lang slammed the “glacial movement to opening up by the premiers”.
“Our political leaders need to understand that business owners and their staff cannot continue to wait,” Mr Lang said.
“Many have been unable to trade for 19 months.
“On behalf of small businesses in NSW and Victoria, Small Business Australia is urging both governments to allow fully vaccinated businesses to trade with those who are fully vaccinated.
“If it is safe for them to do so at 80 per cent, then why is it unsafe for them to trade with each other now?
“What we do not need is time wasted on trials, or goalposts shifting to 90 per cent before businesses can fully trade.
“There is an urgency here that neither Gladys Berejiklian, Daniel Andrews or their health bureaucrats seem to understand and it is time to follow the world by getting our businesses and our people freed – the time for waiting needs to be over.
Daniel Andrews hit back at criticism that Victoria’s recovery road map is out of step with the national plan.
NED-4588-VIC-road map-out-of-lockdown
“I’m not quite sure that people who are making that criticism have read the national plan,” he told 3AW on Tuesday.
“Our roadmap is a roadmap to deliver the national plan and why wouldn’t we do that, we helped write the national plan.
“What it says is that you’ve got to open slowly and cautiously because this is now a pandemic of the unvaccinated.
“The unvaccinated group is too big at the moment to open up fully. As that group gets smaller, then we can start to ease and open up, otherwise we’re going to finish up with our nurses given an impossible task.
“This is cautious, it’s measured, but we’ve got that clear plan, and it is absolutely consistent with the national plan.”
The Premier said Victoria would on Tuesday reach its 80 per cent single-dose vax target, two days later than projected, which would guarantee a modest easing of restrictions.
“We’ll get to 70 per cent double dose in just a few weeks time, then 80 only a couple of weeks after that, then lockdowns off, businesses are reopening,” he said.
“We can look to Christmas, 30 people at your house, something like a normal Christmas and look to 2022 with a sense of optimism, because this will be behind us.
“There’ll still be some rules, there’ll be masks in different places, but it’ll be a very, very different year.”
Under a three-stage plan, many freedoms will return for all in NSW on December 1 regardless of their vaccination status, when the state government expects more than 90 per cent of the eligible population to be double-dosed.
Only under that new stage will limits on household visitors and informal outdoor gatherings be scrapped and a one person per 2sq m rule across almost all settings be put in place.
Caps on patron numbers will be ditched and bosses will be able to require staff to return to the office.
Federal Health Minister Greg Hunt said both Victoria and New South Wales were working to the national reopening plan.
Mr Hunt said there were some differences and Victoria’s plan was “very cautious”.
But welcomed the moves to implement the national roadmap.
“I recognise some will proceed at more cautious rates. But all of these plans are about incentives to be vaccinated.”
Prof Murphy said the Doherty Institute modelling showed tighter public health measures needed to be maintained if vaccination thresholds were reached with higher active caseloads, and that it was understood that there would be variations between the states based on the epidemiological situation.
He said that while some states were “more conservative” than others, they had generally agreed to take “first steps” to reopen at 70 per cent and “more significant steps” at 80 per cent.
Appearing before the Senate Covid-19 committee, he said there was always an “element of artificiality” about modelling, and that health authorities were “learning from the real-world experience”.
He said the NSW situation — where high vaccination rates have curtailed the outbreak more quickly than expected — was “pleasing” and would be fed back into the modelling to assist other jurisdictions.
“This is an iterative process,” Prof Murphy said.
Chief Medical Officer Professor Paul Kelly said the national reopening was going “very well” and that the country was “well prepared”.
“Australians need to get used to living with Covid. Every single case is not a tragedy,” he said.
Asked why the Victoria-NSW border remained closed with similar outbreaks in both states, and if there was public health advice to support that restriction, Prof Kelly declined to comment and said the question should be directed to chief health officers in both states.
VIC vs NSW
While Small Business Australia condemned the NSW and Victorian premiers, other industry leaders said Mr Andrews should at least match NSW’s plan.
Victorian Chamber of Commerce and Industry chief Paul Guerra said many Victorians would be looking at the NSW road map with envy.
“Unlike us, restaurants, cafes, pubs and bars will not be subject to venue caps when they reach 80 per cent vaccination rates,” he said.
“It is crucial that these caps be removed from the Victorian road map to give the sector the best chance at bouncing back and making the most of the busy festive and summer season.
“Victorian couples and venues also want the same rules for weddings as NSW, where density caps will no longer apply once the 80 per cent double dose level is achieved.”
Under Victoria’s road map a number of restrictions will remain in force even after the state hits an 80 per cent fully vaccinated target, including a cap on visitors to the home, public gatherings, and limits at hospitality venues.
Vaccinate target chart
The Victorian government was heavily criticised for not fully consulting industry groups before releasing its road map this month.
But Restaurant & Catering Australia chief Wes Lambert said consultation between industry and the NSW government had been fantastic.
“NSW’s hospitality industry is on cloud nine today and we would like to thank the NSW government for their ongoing consultation during this period,” he said.
“This road map will give certainty in the most uncertain of times. Additionally, the news that weddings will no longer be capped once vax rates reach 80 per cent is a huge win for the industry.”
Under Victoria’s road map, weddings will be capped at 150 vaccinated people indoors and 500 outdoors.
Tim Piper, the Victorian head of the employer association Ai Group, said he would like to see as much conformity as possible between NSW and Victoria.
“They’re the two biggest states and make up for almost 60 per cent of the economy,” Mr Piper said. “Victorians are hanging out for being given the same sort of opportunities as NSW. If we can follow the NSW path, that’s what we should be doing.”
Mr Andrews said Victoria would not follow NSW’s lead.
“We haven’t even had a conversation about when (the vaccinated economy) might change and everyone might be on an equal footing,” the Premier said.
“Over the next few weeks we will be able to watch very closely and see what happens in New South Wales as they open up. What does it mean for their health system and their nurses and doctors? What does it mean for case numbers?”
Duke of Wellington manager Andy O’Brien said having density quotients instead of venue caps would boost profitability for big venues. “If it was regulated by one person per 2sq m we could have up to 488 people,” he said.
RESTRICTION CHANGES
TRUCKIE PROTEST FIZZLES OUT A planned truckie rally that promised to stop traffic on Tuesday morning has failed to materialise as last week’s protesters appeared to lose momentum.
Police pulled over a small number of trucks on the Tullamarine Freeway, but traffic delays are minimal.
Officers have stopped a small convoy inbound on the Freeway near Moreland Rd, a Transport Department spokesman said.
He said there’s only minor delays starting from Bell St with the speed limit lowered to 40km/h when cars drive past police.
“Police are in attendance (and) two lines are closed.”
After promising to turn out “every day”, protesters have shown up in smaller numbers, with police mostly arresting individuals before they could gather in larger groups.
Cops were not taking any chances, with a large presence at a service station near the West Gate Bridge on Tuesday morning.
Police have fined 15 people, after eight trucks were pulled over on the Tullamarine Freeway this morning.
There was a passenger in each truck and the vehicles were driving slow, a police spokesman said.
“Victoria Police is aware some individuals may be planning to participate in a protest on Melbourne’s roads today,” he said.
“Victoria Police will continue (to) have a highly visible presence in the area to maintain public safety, and to ensure any illegal protest activity does not impact on the broader community’s right to go about their daily lives.
“In addition to confirming the chief health officer’s directions are being followed, police will enforce the road rules as required, including the offence of ‘drive in procession’.”
Victorian Transport Association chief executive Peter Anderson condemned “drivers threatening to disrupt people going about their business through protest action today”.
“All disruption will achieve is to undermine already vulnerable supply chains and businesses just trying to survive,” he said.
“Reports suggest up to 10 truck drivers may have protested, but many thousands more have continued working – let’s keep this in perspective.”
CITY’S NORTH EMBRACES JAB One in three residents in a critical Covid-ravaged hot spot have had their first vaccine dose in the past month alone, amid a big surge in northern suburbs vaccination rates.
Residents across Hume in Melbourne’s north and Wyndham in Melbourne’s west have rolled up their sleeves in droves over the past four weeks with more than 120,000 first doses administered across both regions.
While first-dose rates had surged above 60 per cent in more than 40 Victorian municipalities – and even hit 86.9 per cent in Queenscliffe – Hume recorded just 40.80 per cent on August 27.
But those rates have rocketed to 73.8 per cent and one in three people aged over 15 are now fully vaccinated.
It comes after the Herald Sun revealed a push from multicultural community leaders in Melbourne’s north and west for an urgent increase in vaccine supply and ­clinics.
The areas have been the epicentre of Victoria’s third wave with Hume having the most active Covid cases, at 3077.
“What we’ve seen is the community respond and they have responded in overwhelming numbers and we’re so delighted to see that,” Youth Activating Youth director Ahmed Hassan, who was involved in the campaign, said.

“This is not only an increase in numbers, this is saving lives.”
Wyndham in Melbourne’s west has also recorded one of the state’s biggest gains over the past month, with a 33 per cent rise in first doses from 49.7 per cent to 82.8 per cent. The Herald Sun can ­reveal a pop-up clinic at the ­Islamic Museum of Australia in Thornbury will begin ­administering Pfizer and AstraZeneca vaccines from ­Tuesday.
Founder Moustafa Fahour OAM said four private cubicles would allow women and ­people with faith and cultural needs to have privacy while they received their vaccines.
“It is about providing places that are easily accessible, comfortable and from trusted community voices,” he said.
GPs and pharmacies across 11 Melbourne municipalities with low vaccination rates will also receive extra funding under a state government plan to turbocharge the rollout.
Grants of between $4000 and $10,000 will be on offer to eligible operators in Brimbank, Cardinia, Casey, Darebin, Greater Dandenong, Hobsons Bay, Hume, Melton, Whittlesea and Wyndham.
Premier Daniel Andrews said this would allow them to extend trading hours and see more patients.
“They can have more people go through the vaccination program that they are running,” he said.
Victoria is on the way to reaching its vaccine targets with 77.5 per cent of eligible Victorians receiving a single dose of a vaccine, while 47.4 per cent are fully vaccinated.
Victoria recorded 705 new Covid cases and one death on Monday, taking the total ­number of active cases to 8538.
The Royal Melbourne ­Hospital shut its Covid testing clinic on Monday as rising ­active cases put pressure on its emergency department.
A Royal Melbourne ­Hospital spokeswoman said the Grattan St free clinic, was “closed permanently”.
More than 360 people are in hospital including 75 in ICU.
National – 2021 – Covid Vaccination Stats
ANDREWS CONSIDERS CURFEW CHANGE Daniel Andrews hasn’t ruled out pushing the curfew back to allow Melburnians an extra hour in the sun once daylight saving kicks in.
With clocks to go forward on October 3, the Premier was asked on Monday if the curfew would be adjusted, as it was last year.
“With daylight saving coming, we might have to have a think about the hours of the curfew,” he said.
“I’m not announcing that, that’s not my decision.
“It’s a decision based on the advice from the chief health officer and I don’t have any, but that is a practical matter.”
Deakin University chair in epidemiology, Catherine Bennett said “the curfew can go”.
“It doesn’t change any risk and is affecting people in ways that aren’t often recognised,” Professor Bennett said.
She said the curfew stopped shift workers from shopping or exercising late at night — forcing more people to do these activities during the day.
She also said the curfew meant people visiting an intimate partner or single friend had to leave by 9pm, or stay until the next morning. “If they (the government) come back and say they’re constantly finding people out after 9pm, then maybe that’s justification for keeping it,” she said.
Vic Locally-acquired Covid-19
“But at this stage we’re yet to see evidence and there is a level of disruption and concentration of people’s activities out of work that is difficult to understand from an epidemiological perspective.”
Melbourne School of Population and Global Health head Nancy Baxter said the 9pm curfew would end — predicted to be about October 26 under the roadmap — when the sun still sets before 8pm.
“I would say that sunset really shouldn’t be setting the timing of the curfew,” she said.
“If it’s getting lighter later, one would think there would be more movement.
“And the whole point of curfew is to reduce movement.”
Melbourne School of Population and Global Health Professor Nathan Grills said the curfew should be scrapped.
“Curfews are a disproportionate measure which further limits already curtailed freedoms and unnecessarily increases community stress,” he said.

Opinion: Queensland’s own Three Stooges more of a tragicomedy

Full text: I don’t know who is writing their material but post-Covid-19, a career scripting comedy in Hollywood beckons.
My favourite Stooge is Steven, who had them rolling in the aisles when he announced that Scott Morrison “gave Delta to Sydney and now they’re trying to gift it to us”.
“I’ve been out a lot in Queensland and talking to Queenslanders, and what they tell me is that Delta is the gift they do not want from Scott Morrison,” he said. (WATCH ABOVE)
Just why the Prime Minister gave the virus to the unsuspecting people of Sydney, where his family lives, is unclear as are his motives in trying to gift it to Queenslanders.
Perhaps all will be revealed in an upcoming episode.
Steven might turn in some knee-slapping performances, but Anna has been giving him a run for his money, treating us to a hilarious performance in what is now known as The Gonna Episode .
“Where are you gonna go? Are you gonna go to India?“ she asked a perplexed media throng when questioned on the issue of Queenslanders travelling overseas, saying she couldn’t understand why anyone would want to do so.
To escape The Three Stooges, maybe?
Under the Palaszczuk government Queenslanders aren't free; they're just free range – they're still in the cage, according to Sky News host James Morrow.It comes as Ms Palaszczuk on Thursday was quizzed by a reporter if she supported overseas travel before the end of the year as promoted by the federal government. "Where are you going to go? Are you gonna go to India?," she said."In Tokyo, you have to sit in perspex screens with masks on and if you remove your mask, you can't talk while you're eating. Yes, in Europe, some people are travelling."I think the federal government needs to identify very clearly what are the countries that Australians can travel to, okay."Mr Morrow said the Queensland premier embodied the "worst sort of parochial mediocrity" with that response."It's a big insult to the millions of Australians and millions of Queenslanders who have families overseas they'd like to see."Scandinavia opening up, London is open and you don't have to wear a mask on the tube, New York is open – and I'm going to be going there for Christmas because you can go to restaurants."She thinks it's going to al be P95 masks and Perspex; it perfectly illustrates what somebody said the other day ... Queenslanders, they aren't free, they're just free range – they're still in the cage."
Viewers were left wondering just what particular Indian experience the Premier had endured which had caused her to suggest that it would be madness to entertain it as a destination.
A dodgy curry, perhaps.
India, then, is out which is a shame as the Taj Mahal alone is worth the trip but what of those Queenslanders wanting to travel to the UK, Europe, the USA and Canada where vaccinated and tested Aussies are now welcome? No comment on that one.
Then we had The Free Footy Episode . While Scott Morrison was allegedly trying to give away Delta with no takers, Yvette showed him what freebies were all about by offering free footy tickets to those being vaccinated.
The Three Stooges were great cream pie throwers and at this point, a metaphorical pie got Yvette right between the eyes when it was pointed out the such an inducement was illegal.
“It seems to be the better we do, the more we get criticised,” she moaned, “better” being one of the slowest vaccination rollouts in the country. Just why Health Minister D’Ath did not bother to check with the Therapeutic Goods Administration before hatching this bizarre scheme was not revealed.
Enter Stooge Steven, whipping out a pie and tossing it in the general direction of Canberra while declaring that the free footy ban was all part of a Scott Morrison conspiracy aimed at undermining the best efforts of him and his fellow Stooges.
“It seems to me the Prime Minister’s office’s campaign against Queensland and Queenslanders got truly bizarre yesterday, it jumped the shark,” he said.
Those unfamiliar with this piscatorial reference should note that it relates to television script writing and is when writers resort to desperate measures to maintain viewer interest.
The NRL is giving thousands of free finals tickets away in Queensland over the next few days and all fans have to do is get vaccinated.The deal is part of an effort by the Queensland government to boost vaccination rates.There are 2,000 tickets available to fans for the Manly Sea Eagles and South Sydney Rabbitohs game tomorrow if people get vaccinated today.Fans will need to go to the Brisbane Entertainment Centre in Boondall or the Pinkenba cruise terminal hubs.There are also tickets up for grabs for the Penrith Panthers and Melbourne Storm match on Saturday if people get vaccinated tomorrow.Fans wishing to secure those tickets will need to go to the Logan Entertainment Centre or Mt Warren Park sports centre hubs.
It comes as no surprise that the Deputy Premier is familiar with it, for when it comes to desperate measures, The Three Stooges have been jumping tanks full of great whites since the pandemic began.
Those unvaccinated persons who missed out on the free footy tickets will, we can presume, now remain unvaccinated and wait until the next government stunt – free beer, free cooked chooks, boxed editions of every episode of The Three Stooges autographed by Anna, Yvette and Steven? Watch this space.
Anna was the next Stooge to cop the cream pie treatment, this one hurled by the ABC when it fact-checked her claim that Doherty Institute modelling predicted that even with 70 per cent of the population vaccinated, 80 people would die each day from Covid-19 once the outbreak reached six months after it started. “That is 2240 who will die each month.”
Ms Palaszczuk’s claim, the ABC said, was misleading.
It was an extreme outcome with low probability, with the death toll figures unlikely even in extreme conditions, it said.
That any responsible person would deliberately misrepresent statistics in a way that was likely to alarm the population beggars belief.
Jumping the shark, anyone?
A friend announced last week that he and his wife had been granted an exemption to travel overseas.
“What reason did you give?” I asked.
“I said I had lost all faith in the political process in Australia and wanted to leave,” he said.
As I watch The Three Stooges, I know how he felt.

‘The cheap casualty’: David Littleproud slams Annastacia Palaszczuk’s Christmas closed border plan

Full text: Deputy Prime Minister Barnaby Joyce said Annastacia Palalszczuk was acting as if she “knew better” than the Doherty Institute, who’s modelling forms the basis of the national plan for reopening.
David Littleproud said Annastacia Palaszczuk’s “reneging” on the national plan was not only casting doubt on holiday plans, but was also continuing to cost the state’s tourism industry “billions”.
“When you look at the Gold Coast, a billion dollars will be lost in just this quarter,” Mr Littleproud told Today on Monday.
“They are the cheap casualty, according to the Palaszczuk government, of this Covid disaster.
“We need confidence and certainty, but we need leadership …
“We’re saying when you’re coming into the room (at national cabinet) and say you’re going to sign up to the plan, the Prime Minister needs to look to his left and right and know you’re there. Instead, Premier Palaszczuk has gone off in all sorts of directions.”
Mr Joyce told Sunrise it seemed that Ms Palaszczuk had decided she “knows better than the Doherty Institute”.
“I didn’t know she was an immunologist... I didn’t know her epidemiology was so up to speed,” Mr Joyce said.
“She’s prepared to put her views ahead of the Doherty Institute and sending business broke.
“Queensland is not locking people out anymore they’re locking their own people in. They’re locking in the opportunities, so businesses do not have the capacity to stand up at Christmas and ... recoup the losses.”
Mr Littleproud and Mr Joyce’s comments come off the back of Queensland Deputy Premier Steven Miles indicating that Queensland’s borders could remain closed for Christmas.
Currently, Queenslanders are enjoying some of the most relaxed Covid-19 restrictions in the country, and the state government does not want to “let Covid in for Christmas”.
“Scott Morrison gave Delta to Sydney and now they are trying to re-gift it to us, well we don’t want that, we want to stay open like we are now and we’ll continue to make our decisions on that basis,” Mr Miles said on Friday.
At the weekend, Mr Morrison said premiers couldn’t “stay in second gear” in the national plan to live with the virus.
“There comes a time when you (have) just got to move on and get on with it,” Mr Morrison told Weekend Sunrise.
In response, Mr Miles told reporters on Sunday that the Prime Minister should focus on the Covid-19 outbreaks in NSW and Victoria, and fixing diplomatic issues with France and China, instead of criticising Queensland’s borders.
Queensland recorded no new locally acquired cases on Sunday, and 60 per cent of eligible Queenslanders have had one dose of vaccine.
Just over 45 per cent are fully vaccinated.

Qld vaccine ad campaign fails to address reopening plans

Full text: It comes as Deputy Premier Steven Miles gave the strongest indication yet that Queensland’s borders will remain closed for Christmas.
The campaign urging people to roll up their sleeves hopes to assure those anxious or sceptical about the vaccine that the vaccines are safe, in order to help the state reach its 80 per cent target.
Just over 60 per cent of Queenslanders have had their first jab while almost 45 per cent of the state is fully vaccinated.
The advertising campaign started on Saturday and was filmed in locations across Queensland, including Ballandean, Toowoomba, Boonah, Brisbane, Cairns, Innisfail and Port Douglas will run across multiple channels including online, TV, radio and social media.
The Queensland Government has launched a series of ads encouraging citizens to be vaccinated for Covid-19.
At its current pace of vaccination Queensland is not expected to reach the 80 per cent threshold – the percentage on the national road map for when the country should open up – until December 7.
Mr Miles said Queenslanders were already enjoying far more freedoms than many of its southern counterparts – like Delta-ravaged New South Wales and Victoria – and did not believe that Queenslanders wanted to “let Covid in for Christmas”.
“A lot of this discussion about the Queensland border is pretty academic, because the kind of the people that you’re saying should be allowed across our border are currently locked down in their homes by their own state governments and so the Queensland border should be relatively hypothetical because most of the people in New South Wales and Victoria shouldn’t be travelling to Queensland anyway,” Mr Miles said.
The Queensland Government has launched a series of ads encouraging citizens to be vaccinated for Covid-19.
The Government has said it would wait until this week’s national cabinet meeting on Friday for updated modelling from the Doherty Institute before it made any decisions around whether Queensland’s borders would be open in time for the festive period.
Speaking on breakfast television on Sunday morning, Prime Minister Scott Morrison said it was within the control of state leaders to decide whether families could be reunited for Christmas.
“I think that puts the big challenge on the premiers … there comes a time when you’ve got to honour the arrangement you’ve made with the Australian people, and that is when you get to 80 per cent vaccination, it’s very clear that you can start opening up,” he said.
When asked at the press conference when Queenslanders could expect an answer on what percentage of the population would need to be fully vaccinated before borders would open Mr Miles accused the Prime Minister of attempting to “distract” from his own problems.
The Queensland Government has launched a series of ads encouraging citizens to be vaccinated for Covid-19.
“Frankly, I think the Prime Minister should be more focused on the health and wellbeing of people in New South Wales and Victoria, and on international affairs than what might happen in Queensland in a few months’ time,” he said.
“This bloke should focus on his job. You know, diplomacy is his job. International Trade is his job. Vaccination should be his job, but we’re doing it. Quarantine should have been his job, but we’re doing it. Keeping Covid out of New South Wales was his job and he failed at it.”
Queensland recorded no new cases of Covid-19 on Sunday.
Chief Health Officer Jeannette Young again assured Queenslanders that all three vaccines – Pfizer, Moderna and AstraZeneca – were safe to use and in plentiful supply across the state.
She pleaded with the vaccine hesitant to seek health advice from professionals if they were worried about getting the jab.

Potholes in road to re-election

Full text: Timing the economy to fit a pandemic federal election is tricky. The states must open up - but too soon would be a disaster.
So, with Scott Morrison pulling the new AUKUS pact out of his hat, will we be off to a khaki election? It would hardly be the first election conservative governments have won by promising to save us from the threat to our north.
But that's why I doubt it. For an issue to dominate an election campaign, it has to be in contention. National security is an issue that always favours the conservatives, so Labor won't be offering any objection to AUKUS or nuclear subs.
Similarly, an issue that should figure large in the campaign is whether the Coalition is too conflicted over climate change to be worthy of re-election. But that issue favours Labor, so Morrison won't want to take up that fight.
Which leaves? The economy, stupid. Until the end of June, the economy was looking in great shape, better than before the pandemic. But the arrival of the Delta variant means, right now, more than half the national economy is back in lockdown and looking mighty sick.
Does it surprise you that Morrison's so keen to see the south-eastern mainland states out of lockdown and the others opening their borders, and is pressing the premiers accordingly? He desperately needs the economy back looking trim and terrific by March - May at the latest.
Add to this the business community's pressure to get back to business - "don't bother me with all the COVID details" - and the public's impatience to get life back to normal. Sydneysiders have had enough of lockdowns; Melburnians have had more than enough - something even "Dictator" Dan Andrews can see.
So Gladys Berejiklian and Andrews have added their separate modelling by the Burnet Institute to Morrison's National Plan modelling by the Doherty Institute - not to mention the independent modelling by the Kirby Institute - and announced their "road maps" for opening up their economies progressively once vaccination rates have reached 70 per cent and 80 per cent of the eligible population, expected in mid-to-late October and early November.
NSW is projected to be only about a week ahead of Victoria, and the gap between 70 and 80 per cent only about two weeks.
Everyone's so pleased to be getting on with it that we risk losing sight of the high risks the two premiers are running. If all goes to plan, we'll be back to a new (still-masked) normal by early next year, and the economy will be humming in time for a March election.
But models, based on a host of unmentioned explicit and implicit assumptions, inevitably give politicians and punters a false sense of certainty. No model can accurately predict something as mercurial as human behaviour. And, as we've learnt, a new coronavirus knows nothing of models and is a law unto itself.
The risk Andrews and Berejiklian face is that so many unvaccinated people contract the virus that our hospital system is overwhelmed, leading to a number of deaths the public finds unacceptable. Whether they press on or turn back, the premiers would be in deep trouble.
The first risk comes from an ambulance and hospital system that, 18 months after the crisis began, is already at full stretch. The premiers tell us our wonderful health workers are coping; the message from ambos, doctors and nurses on the ground says they're close to collapse.
The next risk comes from the inconvenient truth that our vaccination targets of 70 and 80 per cent of people 16 and older turn out to be just 56 and 64 per cent of the full population. That's a huge proportion of unvaccinated friends.
Remember, too, that these are statewide averages. They conceal less-vaccinated pockets of vulnerable groups - the disabled, the Indigenous, for instance - and a city-country gap that leaves many rural towns hugely exposed, together with their limited hospital capacity.
Even the decision to move as soon as the 70 and 80 per cent targets are reached, rather than wait another fortnight for vaccines to become fully effective, carries a risk of higher infection.
Both the Burnet and revised Doherty modelling say starting to open up at 70 per cent rather the 80 per cent is likely to involve significantly higher infections, hospitalisations and deaths. Why take that risk just to avoid waiting another fortnight or so?
Morrison's national plan called for all states to open up together once all had reached the 70 and 80 per cent targets, but now NSW and Victoria are going first. This increases the risk that, despite the other states' closed borders, the virus will spread to them - where the lesser threat of catching the virus has caused vaccination rates to be much lower.
The risk for Berejiklian and Andrews is that they could be moving the Delta outbreak from the city to the country. The risk for Morrison is that, by pressing to open up early, he could be moving the outbreak from one half of the economy to the other.

Full text: Andrews announced significant changes for the state with many sectors to fully reopen once Victoria hits a vaccination rate of 80 per cent for those aged 16 or over.
Burnet Institute modelling suggests Victoria will hit the 80 per cent threshold on November 5, three days after the Melbourne Cup.
The government road map out of the Covid lockdown has all but ruled out crowds for the Caulfield Cup and Cox Plate for the second straight year.
However, Andrews said he would like to see crowds at the Melbourne Cup, which would be first major event in Victoria since the state’s Delta crisis erupted in June.
“It is the race that stops the nation. I want it to be held in as normal circumstances as possible,” Andrews said in his Sunday press conference.
“But 80 per cent is the marker that opens our state.”
Andrews did not give a figure on how many people would be able to attend, nor in what setting would be required for punters to be on track for the Melbourne Cup.
But he raised hope for the Victoria Racing Club.
“It would be great to think we could get it done before then and perhaps we can have a crowd of double vaccinated people,” Andrews said.
“But it’s too early for us to say that today.
“If we deliver 80 (per cent fully vaccinated in Victoria) by Cup Day or it’s really clear we are going to, we will have options to have a crowd there.
“I can’t say how big or all of that.
“It would be a great signal to the world, the rest of the country, that Victoria is open, we are back in the leading role of the major events capital, the sporting capital, racing capital for those that are taken by the sport of kings.”
The Victoria Racing Club welcomed Andrews’ comments, which chairman Neil Wilson said gave the club clarity in its planning for the 2021 Melbourne Cup Carnival.
“The 80 per cent target also gives the VRC confidence to continue to plan for crowds across the 2021 Melbourne Cup Carnival, which is a major event for Victoria and the nation,” Wilson said in a statement.
“The VRC team will continue to work closely with the Victorian Government to understand the implications for hosting a crowd at some or all four days of the 2021 Melbourne Cup Carnival and ensure that we are prepared for all potential scenarios.”

Full text: A system of home quarantine is essential to build the critical mass needed in passenger numbers to get airlines properly back in operation for international travellers. Freeing hotel beds occupied by quarantining citizens and visitors is another essential part of restarting the embattled travel sector. Qantas aircrew will take part in the NSW home isolation trial that will pave the way for the abolition of hotel quarantine for international arrivals. In total, 175 people will be allowed to stay at home for seven days, rather than in a supervised facility for 14. Location-based apps and facial recognition technology could be used to ensure compliance.
The home quarantine trial comes weeks after Qantas announced it would restart international travel in December, when double-dose vaccination rates reach 80 per cent. Qantas chief executive Alan Joyce has welcomed the home quarantine trials but said the airline would be looking for a further easing of restrictions before the expected reopening of international borders. Having confidence to make plans is critical for airlines and travellers. Travel-bubble arrangements have been beset by revisions and setbacks. On Friday New Zealand authorities extended the pause on quarantine-free travel within the trans-Tasman bubble for another eight weeks.
Ms Berejiklian said the NSW trial was the first step towards phasing out hotel quarantine and welcoming more travellers from overseas. “One of the things that we expect to occur at 80 per cent is to consider our international borders,” she said. “That’s Aussies returning home through Sydney Airport, but also our citizens having the opportunity to go overseas when previously they weren’t able to.” Only travellers who have had a Therapeutic Goods Administration-approved vaccine will be able to take part in the trial.
Managing Covid-19, even with high levels of vaccination in the community, will be a challenge. Henry Ergas wrote on Friday that the Doherty Institute report and the latest modelling by the US Centres for Disease Control and Prevention suggest the vaccinated are about five times less likely than the unvaccinated to catch Covid. The Business Council of Australia notes that vaccines dramatically reduce the risks of transmission and serious illness, so as we get closer to reaching our targets we have to lay the groundwork to reopen now. BCA chief executive Jennifer Westacott says the move to home quarantine will build much-needed confidence.
We agree that hotel quarantine has been a crucial first response to the pandemic. But as the number of fully vaccinated people increases, we should get rid of the bottlenecks that stop Australians getting home and critical skilled workers getting into the country. The longer we delay planning to reopen and reunite, the bigger the risk to our international reputation as a good place to live, to do business, invest, visit and create jobs.

Unpredictable lockdowns could be replaced with timed national shutdowns

Full text: Based on our current knowledge, it is a very reasonable assumption that this virus and its
consequences in the form of Covid-19 disease are going to stay with us for a long time. At least that seems to be our current knowledge of the potential impact of testing, tracing, vaccinations, masks and social distancing, as well as the nature of this virus and the various mutants we have seen so far.
The difficult question for Australia is what an acceptable “new normal” would be and how to get to it.
Let us be humble. Nobody has the crystal ball. I am always guided by that great philosopher Yogi Berra, who said “It’s tough to make predictions, especially about the future”.
But there are some things that we know: for example, the overall capacity of the Australian hospital system.
My other guiding principle in situations like this is the statement by the famous statistician George Box: “All models are wrong but some are useful”. The Doherty Institute model of the Covid-19 pandemic for Australia is useful.
The Treasury report based on that model provides an excellent analysis of potential future scenarios for Australia’s management of Covid-19 infections and, in particular, it extends the Doherty work to the economic impacts.
Most importantly, it hits the nail right on the head by not even considering scenarios that would imply exceeding the capacity of the current Australian healthcare system. Ignoring that constraint would potentially lead to death rates that could exceed even those, for example, in the US or UK: the latter has about 70 per cent vaccination of the population with second jabs, yet the daily new cases average almost 40,000 and, sadly, about 100 people a day die from Covid-19. Such numbers in Australia are unimaginable and I am sure most Australians would be prepared to take the tough steps to prevent them.
We can – and should – expand the capacity of the healthcare system but building new hospitals and ICU units, and finding well-trained staff for them, takes time. But that is not enough.
The Treasury report projects that with the current capacity of our hospital systems, some form of lockdowns would be necessary in future; as no vaccine is 100 per cent effective. Even if the vaccination rates reach 80 per cent plus, we will need lockdowns in the foreseeable future.
The modelling of the impact of the lockdowns in the Treasury report does not address one important and preventable factor – the consequence of the fact that the timing of these lockdowns is at present unexpected, unplanned and sudden.
That adds to the financial losses to industries such as hospitality, tourism and sports, or for anyone working with perishable goods. But it is also psychologically devastating for students and their parents, as well as anyone who cannot work remotely. We are ill-equipped for such dramatic twists in our personal and social life, as well.
Looking at the global pattern of the Covid-19 infection, the peaks and troughs in case numbers follow a similar pattern of two to four-month cycles. The amplitude changes – and in countries with successful public measure controls it goes down – but the periodicity remains.
Would it not be worth trying to plan regular nationwide lockdowns? For example, two weeks of strict lockdowns every two months? These would enable each one of us as individuals, communities and a nation to plan our activities in advance.
It would probably also give rise to new enterprises that could provide the much-needed extra goods and services when lockdowns are under way, for example, extra educational materials for children. The catering industry could refocus on home delivery of meals, particularly for those in greatest need. And one could think of many others that already exist but as the need for them comes and goes irregularly, they are under-utilised, such as physical exercise classes for home, music or language lessons, or gaining extra qualifications to expand our employability.
Virtual reality technology could become a real reality of our planned lockdowns,
What if a particular locality were to get a massive outbreak of Covid-19 outside such regular lockdowns? The state governments could always start a reactive lockdown if things got out of hand but the chances are good that ultimately these regular nationwide lockdowns would reduce the case numbers during the peaks that the country could cope with.
Of course, the lockdowns could be relaxed, or made less frequent as we find new ways to deal with this infection and expand our healthcare capacity.

Home quarantine for returned overseas travellers ‘months away’

Author: Priest, Evin

Publication info: News.com.au ; Sydney, N.S.W. [Sydney, N.S.W]. 14 Sep 2021.

Full text: Jane Halton, chair of the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations, and commissioner of the National COVID-19 Commission Advisory Board, said a pilot program would still be underway at the time the border opened - meaning the option would not be available for everyone.
“We have to get the vaccination rates (to) at least 80 per cent before we get the borders open and then we have to find some way to run the sequencing, but I am very hopeful that we will have the pilot program up and running in the next couple of months,” Ms Halton told Sunrise.
“When the border starts to open, we will have other options for people.”
Ms Halton was then asked why home quarantine was needed if Australians were fully vaccinated.
She pointed to the Doherty Institute’s modelling, which national cabinet was using for its plan to come out of the pandemic.
“If you look at the national program, it tells us we need to continue to manage Covid, and the amount of Covid we have in our communities, because as we know, we will have to learn to live with the virus for some time to come,” she said.
“We will need to keep the amount of Covid in our communities low. That's important, because we have to keep the pressure off a hospital system.
“Remember there is still a possibility if you have had the vaccine that you might still catch the disease, it won't make you sick, it won’t make you at risk of severe disease I doubt, but it‘ll mean that you could potentially (give it to) somebody else.”
Ms Halton’s warning comes despite a South Australian government trial of an ultra-strict home quarantine app running smoothly.
The South Australian trial began with 50 travellers from interstate last week and then included 90 returning from overseas this week.
Returned travellers, instead of entering a medi hotel upon arrival from overseas, must download the government's home quarantine app, which uses geolocation and facial recognition software to track those isolating.
The app contacts people at random, asking them to show proof of their location within 15 minutes.
If a user’s location can’t be identified, SA Health will notify SA Police to conduct an in-person check on the person in home isolation.
Ms Halton said it would be “better than what we have had with hotels”.
“The South Australian app is fantastic, it does face recognition, it can tell where you are and if you don't answer within a certain amount of time, the geolocation says you’re at home or in your backyard, not next-door,” she said.
“If we have to send our police forces checking everyone is where they are meant to be, it would be very expensive.”
South Australia’s home quarantine app trial has faced criticism domestically and internationally for being intrusive.
Premier Steven Marshall said returned travellers should not be concerned about their information being shared.
“We don’t keep any of the data, we are certainly not tracking people going around the house but when they do receive a call on the up they need to basically show their face and there needs to be a connection to where they should be and at that time,” he said.
Australians stranded overseas continue to be given bad news.
Several airlines have been cancelling flights due to Australia’s cap on international weekly arrivals.
The number was halved from 6000 a week to 3000 on July 14, before being NSW cut it again this month from 1500 to 750 a week.

Home tests 'key to living with COVID'

Full text: Rapid antigen tests at home will be a key part of a more sustainable way of dealing with the pandemic in the coming months, but the head of the Doherty Institute says there is still potential for the coronavirus to throw more curveballs at the world.
Australia will also be a two-tier country for a while with COVID-zero and COVID positive states taking different measures to control the pandemic, Doherty Institute director Professor Sharon Lewin says. "There will be unexpected challenges that we would not have anticipated - just like we didn't really anticipate Delta."
Yesterday, Professor Lewin convened a conference to bring together leading health experts and researchers to discuss the future of COVID-19. The conference, run by the Australasian Society for HIV, Viral Hepatitis and Sexual Health Medicine (ASHM), will hopefully be the first of many to unite scientists, clinical researchers and the community to discuss the latest research about the coronavirus, she said.
Professor Lewin said over the next six to 12 months she expects to see better treatments for people with the disease and more innovation in COVID-19 testing.
"Home tests can make a big difference. We've been doing it for pregnancy forever. And we now do it for HIV."
The Doherty Institute produced the modelling being used by the federal government to guide the national recovery from the pandemic, and that research informed the 70 and 80 per cent double vaccination targets set by national cabinet for restrictions to begin easing.
Professor Lewin said home testing was an important tool to include in the pandemic response.
"We're relying really heavily on vaccines, relying still really heavily on public health measures. But if we can use some of these other approaches, it will make a big difference," she said. "There's a whole lot of ways at-home testing can really help in testing people that would not normally be tested. So we've got a long way to go on that in Australia."
The move to living with the coronavirus once vaccination targets are reached will be a big shift for the country. Professor Lewin says the shift will not be uniform across the country.
"We might see Australia as a two-tier country, with COVID states and non-COVID states. We might have that for quite a while," she said.
In non-COVID states, Professor Lewin expects to see intermittent lockdowns as cases leak out of quarantine, while states with COVID will focus on risk reduction and managing the impact on the healthcare system. "I do really understand that zero COVID's a very nice place to be, but it's a really tough thing to hang on to indefinitely."
Twenty months into the pandemic, Professor Lewin said the advances have been pretty spectacular.
"As difficult as things are in Victoria and in NSW right now, it's very different. 2021 is not 2020 when we were in lockdown last year and really didn't know what was at the end, because we had nothing, there was no vaccine," she said.
ASHM chief executive Alexis Apostolellis said everything the organisation has learnt over the last 40 years of the HIV response was informing its work in the pandemic.
"We are pleased to be able to facilitate such important discussions on COVID-19 science and we hope this will be a model for bringing global scientific communities together to talk about COVID-19 into the future," he said.

Full text: Sky News host Peta Credlin says the Berejiklian government has shown it is finally prepared to lead by committing to end stay-at-home orders for the fully vaccinated once the double-jabbed rate reaches 70 per cent.
By and large, NSW consistently has met this challenge, and it is demonstrating leadership once again with its road map to easing restrictions in line with rising rates of vaccination. One blind spot is education, where not enough is being done to get children back to school. The loss of contact with peers and missed quality time in the classroom with teachers continue to be heavy prices to pay for young people, who statistics show would suffer the least health impacts from contracting the virus. It is unreasonable to say citizens can go to pubs before kids can return to the classroom. The most important people in society are those incapable of caring for themselves. Children under 16 are in that category and deserve special consideration. Kindergarten and year 1 students will return to school on October 25. But years 2, 6 and 11 will have to wait until November 1, and years 3, 4, 5, 7, 8, 9 and 10 until November 8. HSC exams, wisely, have been delayed until the second week of November. But with so much time lost, there is a good case, especially for some non-government schools due to finish on December 3, to extend the term. Government schools finish on December 17. Schools in regional areas coming out of lockdown will be allowed to reopen next week.
Sky News host Paul Murray says the details on New South Wales' reopening plan are "pretty good".
NSW Premier Gladys Berejiklian did not follow the lead of British Prime Minister Boris Johnson in setting a “freedom day” as such. But she said restrictions would ease considerably across the state on the Monday after vaccination rates hit 70 per cent. As part of the government’s road map, fully vaccinated residents will be permitted to access pubs, clubs and restaurants, as well as retail shopping and ticketed public events. The government also will permit access to hairdressers and beauticians. Gatherings in homes and public spaces will be permitted with up to five visitors allowed in a home where all adults are vaccinated (not including children 12 and younger). Up to 20 people will be allowed to gather in outdoor settings. Businesses will be required to produce a Covid-19 safety plan adhering to reduced capacity, mandatory mask-wearing, compulsory QR check-in and proof of vaccination.
Thursday’s announcement represents a faster timetable than health advisers had wanted. But Ms Berejiklian has been able to see the bigger picture and has done what good leaders do, which is accept responsibility and its attendant risk. The NSW government began laying the groundwork for reopening when it changed the focus away from the daily rollcall of case numbers towards hospital admissions and vaccination rates. The long lead time is designed to encourage as many people as possible to get vaccinated so they can participate fully in the greater freedoms that are planned. There are certain to be teething problems as citizens get used to the idea of a vaccine passport and other intrusions that would have been unthinkable before the pandemic struck. But if the evidence from Britain is any guide, once freedoms have been restored the public quickly will move on and get on with life.
More than one million residents in Victoria are enjoying loosened restrictions after lockdown was lifted for all regional areas except Greater Shepparton.
Like Ms Berejiklian, Victorian Premier Daniel Andrews must be congratulated for recognising that a Covid-elimination strategy is no longer possible with the Delta variant. Like NSW, Victoria has eased restrictions for rural residents and is working on a plan to open more broadly when vaccination thresholds are reached. To his credit, Mr Andrews has long said that once everybody has had the opportunity to get vaccinated he is not going to lock down the state to protect those who won’t protect themselves.
Scott Morrison has backed NSW’s reopening plan, describing it as a “careful and safe” road map that is in line with the recommendations of the Doherty Institute modelling to reopen the country. The Doherty Institute has said it will be safe to open the country once vaccination rates reach between 70 and 80 per cent. Currently, 40 per cent of Australia’s eligible populations are vaccinated against Covid-19, with the pace of coverage increasing quickly. Certainly, the federal government has had its challenges with the vaccine rollout. But continued petty squabbling over the detail of early negotiations with Pfizer must be seen for the partisan politics that it is. The federal government is showing leadership with its plans to reopen the nation to the outside world. The Prime Minister has made clear that international borders will open and the ability for citizens to travel will be restored once vaccination rates hit 80 per cent.
Western Australia's Premier Mark McGowan has revealed the state's hard border could be in place until April next year.
All in all, with a pathway to post-Covid life becoming clearer, this is a great moment for our country and an example of good leadership at both a state and federal level. It is also a great celebration of the human spirit where individuals have faith in their leaders at times of crisis. Experience shows that all communities will do what their leaders make them feel comfortable doing. This is what makes it so depressing when lesser leaders trade in the politics of personal opportunity and fear, rather than in hope.
It is understandable that premiers in states where there are no Covid-19 cases would want to preserve that for as long as possible. But once the two biggest states are out of lockdown, with open borders and a focus on health outcomes rather than case numbers, it will be only a matter of time before the citizens of the smaller states of Queensland, South Australia and Western Australia demand their leaders follow suit.

Full text: The current wave has hit young people hard in case numbers and sacrifices, but they lack a voice in the crisis, writes BLAIR WILLIAMS.
Young people have been largely left out of the conversation throughout the pandemic. It was not until ACT Labor senator Katy Gallagher revealed that her teenaged daughter had contracted COVID-19 at Lyneham High School that political attention turned to the experiences of children and their exclusion from the vaccination rollout. Senator Gallagher stridently critiqued the federal government for its failure to "ensure a prompt, efficient rollout of vaccines ... [leaving] children completely vulnerable to COVID-19".
There has recently been a lot of talk from the NSW and federal governments about "living with COVID" and "opening up" once we hit 70 and 80 per cent double vaccination rates, based on Doherty Institute modelling. Yet these figures only include Australians over the age of 16. Children are not included in these national targets, despite the Australian Technical Advisory Group on Immunisation approving the Pfizer vaccine for those aged 12-15 in late August.
The Doherty Institute modelling predominantly addresses the benefits of vaccinating over-16s. Professor Sharon Lewin, the Institute Director, notes that 'the additional benefits [of vaccination for] 12 to 15 year olds [are] much lower". However, other modelling currently in progress specifically examines the impact of the Delta strain for children, the best approaches for their protection, and strategies to ensure that these considerations are included. Until we know more, it is important to protect children as best as we can.
Due to the nature of COVID to date, it has made sense to prioritise vaccination for older and more vulnerable demographics. As such, young people have been patiently waiting their turn. Yet the queue has been moving at a glacial pace thanks to the federal government's many failures in the vaccination rollout - or stroll-out.
Nevertheless, Prime Minister Scott Morrison - who received his first Pfizer jab in February - has repeatedly told Australians that this is "not a race, it's not a competition". In June, Delta hit NSW and rapidly spread across the country, exposing both the unvaccinated to infection and Mr Morrison's laissez-faire attitude to much justifiable ridicule and scorn.
Young Australians are still waiting for vaccine appointments. It was only in late July that young people in hotspots gained restricted access to AstraZeneca, as per the ATAGI update, though many still found it difficult to secure a shot. While the ACT opened Pfizer bookings for those aged 30-39 at the start of August, those aged 16-29 could not register interest until the end of the month, with the first available appointments in mid-October. It is uncertain when those aged 12-15 will be able to book an appointment, and trials are still under way in children under 12. As of August 27, only 28 per cent of Canberrans aged 16-29 have received their first dose of either vaccine while children under 15 remain virtually unprotected.
Looking overseas, the Delta wave has become a pandemic of the unvaccinated. It's no surprise, then, that most cases in the ACT outbreak are under 40, including an alarmingly large number of school-aged children. Thirty seven per cent of cases are under the age of 17 while 46 per cent are in those aged 18-44. The places of most spread are frequented by young people: schools, sports centres, clubs, and pubs.
Though they're less likely to be hospitalised or die from the virus, this should not be our only measure. The Delta variant is leaving young people with long-term health issues, such as a greater risk of fatal heart complications, damage to other organs, as well as the threat of "long Covid". In the UK, there are an estimated 160,000 people under 25 living with this condition, of which 34,000 are under the age of 16 and 11,000 are 2-11 years old. While young people are more likely to make a speedy recovery from symptomatic illness, the risk of lasting health complications is a reality for many.
Young people are bearing the brunt of this current wave, not only in terms of case numbers but also in the sacrifices they're making. They've experienced a disruption to their education, whether primary, secondary, or tertiary, and are isolated from social groups at a critical stage in their lives. Mental illness and distress are increasing and so, too, are the wait times for mental health support. Almost one in 3 Australians aged 18-24 lost their job in 2020, with young women facing more COVID-induced job losses than men. Those who kept their jobs are more likely to work on the frontline, keeping our society fed, supplied, and cared for. Sixteen- to 29-year-olds make up 79 per cent of food preparation assistants, 68 per cent of checkout operators, and 41 per cent of child carers, and are overwhelmingly women.
Society is heavily reliant on young, casual, minimum-wage and predominantly unvaccinated workers who put their health and safety - and that of their families and housemates - at risk to keep society going. That they weren't prioritised for vaccination is another indictment of a government who have too often pushed the young under the bus. Professor Mary-Louise McLaws, an infectious diseases expert at UNSW and member of the World Health Organisation's COVID-19 response team, has been arguing since June that under 40s should be prioritised in the rollout. The Doherty Institute has also recognised this fact in its modelling and recommended that this would help reduce transmission and spread to vulnerable groups.
The rhetoric around lockdowns and vaccines has overlooked the living circumstances of young people. We're more financially precarious and less professionally secure. We're more likely to mix with a greater number of people, whether at work or in our social lives. We're also more likely to rent, rather than own, and tend to live in sharehouses with other young adults or apartments with no outdoor space. Many of us experience significant hardships, yet concerns are dismissed and support is lacking.
Children under 16 have even less of a voice. They've made sacrifices throughout the pandemic and are rightly worried about catching or spreading the virus. When children are mentioned in our national conversations, it's usually to discuss the trials and tribulations of home-schooling with endless debates about when face-to-face teaching should resume - to speak about them, rarely ever for them. There is a desperate desire to get children back in school, but little effort to ensure their safety once there with appropriate ventilation, vaccination, and space for social distancing. Opening the country once we hit the 70 and 80 per cent vaccination targets among those aged 16+ means that children will be exposed. We risk even more schools becoming super spreader locations.
This is just another in a long line of examples for the extent to which this government has ignored the interests of young Australians. Prior to the pandemic, schoolchildren were taking to the streets in vast numbers demanding action on climate change. Yet we have a Prime Minister who dreams of a "gas-led" recovery and refuses to commit to a target of net zero by 2050. The government has also failed young Australians when it comes to job security, the economy and affordable housing. The pandemic is further deepening the intergenerational divide between the haves and have-nots.
Not only do young Australians not have a voice, but we are also not politically represented. Currently, there are no MPs and only one senator, Jordan Steele-John of the Greens, in Federal Parliament aged 29 and under. According to the UN Youth Representative Consultation Report, only 7 per cent aged 12-25 felt represented in politics and only 13 per cent felt heard and respected more broadly. We are not the voting base of the Coalition. The vast majority of 18-34-year-olds voted for Labor and the Greens while only 15 per cent of 18-24-year-olds voted for the Liberals. Is it any wonder we feel politically silenced?
We need to include young Australians in the conversation instead of speaking for them or excluding them altogether. We need to listen to their fears and concerns and acknowledge the unique burdens placed on them if they are to receive the support they need.
It is also crucial that we include children in our vaccination targets. It's great to see ACT Chief Minister Andrew Barr stand up for young people, advocating for the need to vaccinate 12-15-year-olds at the national level before "big decisions are made" on easing restrictions. Mr Barr is walking the walk by using a 12+ metric instead of 16+ for vaccination targets - hopefully other premiers and the Prime Minister will take note.

NSW braces for surge in Covid-19 hospitalisations by October

Full text: The modelling, based on analysis by the Burnet Institute, was released as state health officials are bracing for a surge in Covid-19 hospitalisations, expected to hit before the effect of mass vaccination kicks in.
“I can’t emphasise enough how difficult and exhausting this is going to be for our staff,” said Dr Nhi Nguyen, clinical director of the Intensive Care Network NSW.
The modelling released by NSW Health showed the peak just before the beginning of November.
Premier Gladys Berejiklian said the number of Covid-19 patients in ICU was currently 177, while the number of people in intensive care without Covid-19 was usually about 400.
However, surge modelling released on Monday predicts up to 560 admissions from Covid-19 alone by November.
The state has capacity to treat a total of 1550 ICU patients at the same time.
“So just to give people that reassurance, we certainly don't want to have to use all those beds and staff, because we know what pressure that would put on the system,” Ms Berejiklian said.
“But I want everybody to be reassured that the capacity is there.”
The modelling, which was marked with a release date of August 25, shows the state overall is currently experiencing ”minimal” impact on ICU operations.
That‘s projected to change at the weekend, when there will be a “moderate” impact – meaning ICUs will be ”approaching maximal operational capacity”.
By October 9, the surge in Covid-19 cases is expected to have a “severe” impact on ICU operations.
“Overall demand for critical care (will be) exceeding ICU operational capacity”, the modelling predicts.
By the final week of October, ICU operations will experience an “overwhelming” impact, and demand for critical care services will ”significantly” exceed the capacity.
That pressure will persist until the second week of November, when demand on beds will ease a bit and ICU services will experience a “severe” level of impact again.
At the peak around the beginning of November, the modelling predicts 947 people could be in ICU, including those who need treatment for non-Covid reasons.
Four local health districts in Sydney – western Sydney, southwestern Sydney, the Blue Mountains and northern Sydney – have already begun experiencing “moderate” impact.
The majority of the current outbreak’s 29,253 cases have been identified in Sydney’s west and southwest, where a number of local government areas (LGAs) have been singled out as areas “of concern” and put under extra-tough lockdown rules.
“Within the LGAs of concern, cases are expected to continue increasing until mid-September (range of 1,100 to 2,000 per day), when sufficient vaccine-acquired immunity kicks in (alongside maintained restrictions),” the modelling document said.
“A peak in hospital and ICU utilisation will follow. It is anticipated that between 2,200 and 3,900 people will require hospitalisation.”
Dr Nguyen said NSW Health would treat all the state’s ICU beds as part of one big system, moving patients and staff around as needed.
“When you hear stories of patients needing to be diverted elsewhere … that’s actually a sign the system is working,” she said.
She said the health team had been updating surge plans since the start of the pandemic and that those preparations helped inform the response to the expected October-November peak.
But the workload for nurses, doctors and paramedics will be intense and many will have to work double shifts to keep up with the demand.
“Everyone is tired. We recognise that, and we check in and make sure everyone's okay,” Dr Nguyen said.
“We’re used to looking after critically ill patients. But our staff – the majority of them – will not be used to seeing the number of patients they’re seeing at the moment, and the numbers that are going to come through the doors.”
On Tuesday, there were 1,071 people with Covid-19 admitted to hospitals in NSW. Out of those, 177 were in intensive care and 67 were on ventilators.

Full text: State and territory health systems will withstand high Covid-19 case numbers with the support of ­private hospitals when lockdowns and restrictions ease under the national reopening plan, according to a report prepared for national cabinet.
A taskforce, led by Health ­Department secretary Brendan Murphy and counterparts across the country, will on Friday address the concerns of governments about health workers being furloughed during outbreaks and strains on public hospitals.
National cabinet leaders will be told state and territory public health networks can cope with higher caseloads, assisted by an additional 30,000 beds and 57,000 nurses across the private hospital system.
Detailed analysis to be presented at the national cabinet meeting will outline pressure points in the health system and potential gaps during outbreaks in regional and vulnerable communities.
Scott Morrison will face a divided national cabinet. Recalcitrant states and territories have ramped up attacks this week over vaccines for children and rising death rates when the country reopens after 70 per cent of the population is fully vaccinated.
South Australia on Thursday joined Victoria and NSW in strongly backing the national plan, as Covid-free states including Western Australia, Queensland and Tasmania baulked over easing border restrictions.
Writing in The Australian, Queensland Deputy Premier ­Steven Miles accused the Prime Minister of selling “false hope” in states with high Covid-19 case numbers that the nation could “live with the virus”. Mr Miles said the Doherty ­Institute modelling was “much more complicated than that” and would require a collective decision to be made about “how many people’s lives we risk and how we protect those who cannot be vaccinated”, including children, transplant recipients and cancer patients.
“Decide how many people should die and work back from there – what level of vaccination you need and what other public health measures need to stay in place,” he wrote. “That is the ­complex, difficult, life-and-death decision Scott Morrison tried to simplify down to a simple number and three-word slogan.” Health Minister Greg Hunt on Thursday accused Queensland Premier Annastacia Palaszczuk of “profound moral failure” after letting NRL staff and players’ families enter the state while shutting out thousands of others including children and cancer patients.
Health experts also attacked Ms Palaszczuk’s claims that children could become severely ill from Covid-19 and that 80 people would die each day from the virus when the country moved to stage two of the reopening plan.
Mr Hunt said national cabinet’s modelling projected 13 deaths across 180 days when Australia reached 70 per cent vaccine coverage and described Ms Palaszczuk’s comments as “selective misuse” of the Doherty Institute advice.
Ms Palaszczuk had earlier claimed that even after 70 per cent of the population was vaccinated, “80 people will die each day six months after the outbreak”.
“That’s 2240 who will die each month,” Ms Palaszczuk said. “I sympathise with people interstate enduring months of lockdown but my job is to protect ­Queenslanders.
Despite no country in the world vaccinating under 12s, and only preliminary work underway to trial vaccines in young children, Ms Palaszczuk demanded more information be provided to national cabinet.
Chief Medical Officer Paul Kelly said there was no evidence the Delta strain was more severe in children, with national data this year showing only three children under the age of 12 had been admitted to intensive care.
“There have been 134 hospitalisations,” Professor Kelly said. “Most of the kids who have been admitted to hospital have been for social reasons, not because they are particularly unwell. There have only been three children under the age of 12 that have been admitted to intensive care. Three out of 3815. That is way less than one in 1000. The disease in children is very different from what we’re seeing in adults.” The national cabinet agenda includes discussions around the transition plan, Doherty scenarios and indigenous vaccine surge strategy. Professor Murphy’s “optimising health system” briefing will discuss what test, trace, isolate, quarantine and public health measures will be required to support hospital and workforce capacity. Jane Halton will update leaders on her second review of the national quarantine system and the South Australian home quarantine trial.
Amid warnings from the Australian Medical Association on Thursday that hospitals were ill-prepared for a surge in cases, Mr Hunt said the private hospital network would bolster access to care and health professionals.
“It’s about the partnership ­between the public hospitals and the private hospitals,” Mr Hunt said. “In particular, it brings 57,000 nurses, over 30,000 beds, over 100,000 staff all up into that partnership, so to provide a massive surge capacity.” Mr Hunt said significant work had been done to prepare hospitals, including increasing ventilated beds from 2000 to 7500. He singled out the NSW government for boosting ICU capacity.
Professor Kelly said that, since January last year, the focus had been on preparing for Covid-19 spikes in hospitalisations and ICU admissions. “We’ve still got 4000 invasive ventilators in our national medical stockpile, as well as other treatments,” he said. “There’s an issue of workforce. We need to work through that. And we did last year and provided training to extra nurses at that time with an idea we would have had to surge last year.” Federal government sources said some states and territories “had been better than others” in scaling up hospital and staffing arrangements. AMA president Omar Khorshid said new modelling based on hospital and staffing capacity must be urgently undertaken. “Even pre-Covid, emergency departments were full, ambulances ramped, and waiting times for elective surgery too long,” he said.

COVID-free states told to be realistic

Full text: Leaders of COVID-free states have been told to vaccinate and prepare for the virus to spread and people to die as the country learns to live with the coronavirus once vaccination targets are hit.
Ahead of today's national cabinet meeting, Chief Medical Officer Professor Paul Kelly urged state and territory leaders to stick to the national recovery plan as Queensland and West Australia continue to threaten to go their own way.
"We have a national plan that everyone has signed up to. It's based on the Doherty modelling that shows every percentage that we get above 70 per cent coverage of vaccination changes things," he said.
"There will be people that die from COVID ... but we need to start recognising that's the case, particularly for unvaccinated people."
National cabinet will also be updated on how well the state and territory health systems will cope and what can be done to manage extra cases when restrictions ease, as well as get a briefing from the Doherty Institute on fresh modelling on the situation in NSW.
Across the country more than 20 million jabs have been put into arms. More than 36 per cent of the eligible population 16 and over, or 7.5 million people, is fully vaccinated.
Under the national plan, international arrival caps will be increased and home quarantine for the fully vaccinated will start to become widespread once 70 per cent of the eligible population has had two doses of a COVID-19 vaccine.
NSW Premier Gladys Berejiklian said she was expecting the federal government to provide a list of approved vaccines that would allow people who had received those brands of immunisations to enter the country once international borders ease. Australia's medical regulator has deemed the Pfizer, AstraZeneca, Moderna and Janssen vaccines safe, while the US regulator is yet to approve AstraZeneca.
There is no indication in the reopening blueprint when state lockouts could end. Prime Minister Scott Morrison has said that decision is ultimately up to the states, and Queensland and WA have indicated border closures may continue past the 80 per cent fully vaccinated mark.
When asked whether she would be comfortable opening the Queensland border to NSW or Victoria if the states still had COVID cases, Chief Health Officer Dr Jeannette Young said the important thing was to vaccinate as many people as possible aged 16 and over.
WA Premier Mark McGowan has also repeatedly defended his right to keep the borders shut against the coronavirus in the face of criticism from the federal government.
Responding to concerns from WA and Queensland, Health Minister Greg Hunt said the pandemic was here to stay. "That risk of incursion is not just real but it's inevitable. And so when it's inevitable, the fundamental thing to do is to drive those vaccination rates up," he said.
Victorian Premier Daniel Andrews on Wednesday accepted achieving "COVID zero" was not feasible, and Ms Berejiklian said all states must recognise living with COVID was the reality for everyone.

Anthony Albanese goes cold on Annastacia Palaszczuk’s push

Author: Brown, Greg

Full text: Anthony Albanese said there had not yet been a vaccine ­approved for children aged under 12 after Ms Palaszczuk said she would keep the state border closed “until I can get every child ­vaccinated”.
“I support the national plan,” the Opposition Leader said. “And what the national plan provides for is for a reduction in restrictions upon achieving the 70 per cent and 80 per cent full vaccination rates.
“At the moment, there aren’t vaccines … approved for people under 12. And we do need to open up when it is safe to do so.”
When asked whether Ms Palas­zczuk was “scaremongering” by raising the risks to young children posed by Covid-19, Mr Albanese said parents were “very worried about their children”.
He shifted focus to the need to vaccinate 12 to 15-year-olds, a step approved by the federal government. Mr Albanese said Labor was supportive of 12 to 15-year-olds being included in vaccination targets under the national plan. “The Prime Minister and the government need to outline what the plan is to vaccinate 12 to 15-year-olds, and whether those numbers should be included as part of those targets,” he said.
“Labor has said that is a matter for the national cabinet, although we are in favour of it.” However, Mr Albanese used a speech in parliament to call on the government to prepare for children younger than 12 to be included as part of the vaccination program.
Federal Labor MPs from Queensland were privately supportive of Ms Palaszczuk’s strategy, saying she was in touch with community sentiment on Covid-19.
One MP said criticism of state governments pursuing zero Covid cases was “Sydney-centric”, given it was a reality in Queensland, Western Australia, Tasmania and South Australia.
Labor MPs outside of Queensland were unhappy about Ms Palas­zczuk’s “ridiculous” attack on the national plan.
On Thursday, the Queensland Premier sent a tweet cherry-­picking data from the Doherty Institute modelling to claim there would be 2240 Covid deaths a month if restrictions ended when the population was 70 per cent vaccinated.
The national plan does not include ending all restrictions when the population is 70 per cent vaccinated but recommends an easing of lockdown measures.
Chief medical officer Paul Kelly said children did not generally get severe illness from the Delta strain of Covid. “There have only been three children under the age of 12 that have been admitted to intensive care. Three out of 3815. That is way less than 1 in 1000,” Professor Kelly said.
“While cases have been about 17 per cent of total cases notified this year, that hospitalisation rate and the ICU rate in particular and the fact that there’ve been no deaths in under 12s is very different to what we’re seeing in adults and older children.”

Full text: Western Australia and Queensland have grown increasingly defiant against the Prime Minister on domestic border policy as Australia edges towards its desired vaccination coverage threshold.
Both state leaders have cited the High Court decision which rejected Clive Palmer’s bid to prise borders open in 2020, with WA Premier Mark McGowan tempting the Morrison government to “bring on round two”.
The court favoured WA, with Chief Justice Susan Kiefel and Justice Pat Keane declaring the extraordinary measure to slam borders closed was a reasonable response given the potential of widespread deaths.
“There is no known vaccine, and no treatment presently available to mitigate the risks of severe medical outcomes or mortality for a person who contracts Covid-19,” the court found.
The Attorney General told NCA NewsWire the Morrison government had no plans to challenge state and territory leaders in the country’s highest court and “we will not do anything to jeopardise the staged National Plan to get us out of this pandemic”.
“But a lot has changed since November,” Ms Cash said.
“Both the AstraZeneca and Pfizer Covid-19 vaccines are registered for use in Australia and have been proven to be effective in preventing serious illness and death, as well as limiting transmission.”
Data released by the Doherty Institute, whose advice all state and territory leaders have agreed to follow, says border closures and lockdowns will no longer be needed once the population reaches 80 per cent vaccination coverage.
Scott Morrison is eager to reach this milestone and slowly repair shattered consumer confidence caused by the lingering threat of snap lockdowns, declaring “we can’t stay in the cave forever”.
But this development has been emphatically rejected by WA and Queensland.
Ms Palaszczuk last week hinted at a fight with her federal counterpart in the High Court, and this sentiment was reinforced by the state’s deputy premier Steven Miles on Wednesday.
“We have defended our borders against high court challenges from Clive Palmer and Scott Morrison before,” he told reporters.
“And if we have to again to keep Queensland safe, we will.”
Ms Palaszczuk also told parliament she wants more research into the impacts of Covid-19 on children and for this risk to be considered in the modelling.
“Unless there is an answer on how these young people are going to be vaccinated, you are putting this most vulnerable population at risk,” she said.
“You open up this state and you let the virus in here, every child under 12 is vulnerable.”
Mr McGowan also ridiculed legal threats over border policies, asking: “Why (is) the federal government doing this?”
“We had a High Court challenge last year and we won easily against Clive Palmer and the Liberal Party.
“If they want to bring on round two, let them.”

Annastacia Palaszczuk accused of refusing to agree to opening plan

Full text: Home Affairs Minister Karen Andrews delivered a fiery serve to the Premier on Wednesday afternoon, accusing her of “scaremongering” and “taking every opportunity” to plunge the state into lockdown.
“It is really time that the Queensland premier starts to focus on how she is going to reopen Queensland and not take every available opportunity to shut Queensland down,” she said.
“Queenslanders have started to speak out. They have started to make it very clear that they want their life back, they want their borders to reopen, they want to be able to move across the Queensland and NSW border.”
Ms Palaszczuk told parliament on Wednesday she wants more research into the impacts of Covid-19 on children and for this risk to be considered in the modelling preferred by national cabinet.
She also reinforced her intention to reserve the right to lockdown the state even when vaccination coverage reaches 80 per cent, defying advice from the Doherty Institute.
“Unless there is an answer on how these young people are going to be vaccinated, you are putting this most vulnerable population at risk,” she said.
“You open up this state and you let the virus in here, every child under 12 is vulnerable.”
This declaration invoked a furious response from the Home Affairs Minister, who accused Ms Palaszczuk of “scaremongering”.
“There is no country in the world that is vaccinating anyone under 12 years of age and Australia‘s Chief Medical Officer Paul Kelly has made that very clear,” she said.
The lashing from Ms Andrews was one of many furious responses from the Morrison government on Wednesday over the border policy stance, following a hint of a High Court challenge from Attorney-General Michaelia Cash and a serving from the federal Treasurer.
“The country needs to learn to live with Covid,” Josh Frydenberg said.
This comes after Ms Palaszczuk was forced to walk back her snap border closure for hotspot areas which meant the state’s own residents were locked out.
Ms Palaszczuk last Thursday ordered a two-week pause on arrivals from NSW, Victoria and the ACT, citing the hotel quarantine system was at capacity and at risk of posing a Covid-19 health risk.
But this pause will end five days ahead of what was originally flagged by the Premier after infuriating thousands and leaving the state’s own residents stranded.
She told parliament on Wednesday morning the state’s health department had approved 50 more places in hotel quarantine.
This easing of the unpopular policy will only allow less than 1 per cent of the hotel quarantine spots to be filled, however.
Ms Palaszczuk revealed last week that 5114 was the maximum health authorities were comfortable with accommodating.
“As of Saturday, Queensland residents can begin returning from interstate hot spots into hotel quarantine in Queensland,” Ms Palaszczuk said.
“The pause on intake has only just begun.
“Numbers in our quarantine hotels have only slightly eased so we can offer places to 50 as a start but we will add more places as rooms become available.”
The Palaszczuk government faced widespread fury over its decision to allow cricket and rugby league stars, along with family members, to enter the state despite the pause on interstate arrivals.
About 100 NRL partners, families and officials jetted into the state on charter flights on Sunday after being granted an exemption by chief health officer Jeannette Young.
The contingent are staying at a designated hotel for the NRL which is not managed by Queensland Health, but the move has infuriated thousands trapped outside the state, leading Opposition Leader David Crisafulli to blast the premier.
“If there’s room for sporting families, then there’s room for Queensland families,” he told parliament on Tuesday afternoon.

Queensland Premier Palaszczuk hasn’t ruled out High Court stoush with PM over NSW border closure

Full text: The strong stance comes after emboldened state leaders grew increasingly defiant against the Prime Minister as debate rages about domestic border policy, with Australia edging towards its desired vaccination coverage threshold.
Scott Morrison wants the borders open to return life, and the economy, to normal but premiers — specifically from Queensland and Western Australia — have stood firm.
The political stoush is well into its second year, but constitutional scholars say the messy conflict will be heightened when vaccine rates rise and it will be the High Court, not Mr Morrison, who would have the final say.
When asked if Ms Palaszczuk would be willing to defend her position in the highest court in Australia, a spokesman from the Premier’s office told NCA NewsWire: “The Queensland government makes no apologies for consistently following the health advice to keep Queenslanders safe”.
“Clive Palmer had the support of the Commonwealth when he challenged the Western Australian government and lost,” they said.
Data released by the Doherty Institute last week says border closures and lockdowns will no longer be needed once the population reaches 80 per cent vaccination coverage.
The Prime Minister is eager to reach this milestone and slowly repair shattered consumer confidence caused by the lingering threat of snap lockdowns, declaring “we can’t stay in the cave forever”.
Gladys Berejiklian agrees, desperate for her state’s soaring crisis to be saved by vaccine protection, but Queensland and WA both reserved the right to lock down residents even when jab coverage reaches 80 per cent.
Academics say the Prime Minister could, under the constitution through powers over the responsibility to quarantine Australians and the Biosecurity Act, override state laws and demand premiers and first ministers open borders.
But the High Court accepted the position of state leaders in the case between Palmer and WA, authorising the McGowan government to close borders for the purpose of protecting public health.
Professor Susan Harris Rimmer, Policy Innovation Hub director at Griffith University, said the “Commonwealth can’t, the High Court can” override state leaders.
“Under the Constitution there’s meant to be freedom of movement between the states for the purposes of trade but when Clive Palmer sued WA, the High Court considered border closures then and they said, essentially, that as long as it was proportionate to the health threat or a reasonable response, then the states could shut their borders under that section of the constitution,” she said.
Despite overwhelming public support, the professor said there was a “lot of debate among constitutional scholars” at the time about the extraordinary decision.
“Because that was right at the beginning of the pandemic, I think the High Court was willing to give a little bit of latitude,” Prof Harris Rimmer told NCA NewsWire.
“But now you might be able to say, ‘do they have to have hard closures if there’s only a few cases in one particular place or one particular part of the state?’
“So is it reasonable to close the borders to the whole of Queensland if there’s one case in Cairns? Those are the issues of facts that the High Court would have to think about.
“But if you think about it the other way, the Commonwealth also has the same problem because it is also meant to allow Australians to come and go and it doesn’t because it has decided, under the Biosecurity Act, to take a very hard line to shut the borders externally.”
Legal academic Anne Twomey cited similar powers at the disposal of the Commonwealth, explaining federal parliament has the power to “override” state laws with its own legislation on quarantine.
“Alternatively, it could rely on its external affairs power to legislate to give effect to a right of ‘freedom of movement’ as a means of implementing Australia’s obligations in human rights treaties,” she said.
“However, this might be difficult to do while simultaneously restricting the freedom of movement of Australians to enter and leave Australia.”
Spiking Delta outbreaks and the availability of vaccines have empowered state leaders to defend their borders in previously unseen ways - which constitutional scholars say could also spark a court battle.
Recently, WA announced it would restrict arrivals from states and territories recording 50 cases or more a day to only allow entry to those who have received at least one vaccination and who have returned a negative Covid-19 test in the 72 hours before travel.
The extraordinary measure will apply even to its own residents returning to the state.
“That is also extremely new and I think that would probably be challenged as well,” Prof Harris Rimmer said.
“We’re in the land of novelty here and it will be for the High Court to decide most of these things.”
If the stoush were to progress to the High Court, agreements and discussions from national cabinet about forecasting a vaccination threshold to resume life to normal could be used as an argument.
“All of that will be considered as evidence of a proportionate and reasonable response,” Prof Harris Rimmer said.
“The problem will be is that it is all quite speculative,” she said, considering the advice from the Doherty Institute was based on modelling.
“What we don’t have is something that definitely says 70 per cent vaccination rate is the most reasonable way to protect the population. We don’t actually know that as a fact.”
A spokesman for the WA Premier’s office refused to comment on the likelihood of a High Court challenge but said the national agreement was for states to be afforded the right to lock down and close borders even if the vaccine threshold is reached.
“We're just saying,” Mr McGowan told reporters earlier in the week. “If we get to those points in three or four months time, we retain the right to put in place measures that are agreed.
“But I just remind you all, this is a massive distraction, a massive smoke screen away from what is happening in NSW right now.
“We shouldn't be having this huge national argument about what happens in December, we should be worried about what’s happening in NSW in August because that is the risk both to the people of NSW and to the people of the rest of the country.”
The Prime Minister’s Office did not respond to multiple requests for comment.

“But if you think about it the other way, the Commonwealth also has the same problem because it is also meant to allow Australians to come and go and it doesn’t because it has decided, under the Biosecurity Act, to take a very hard line to shut the borders externally.”
Legal academic Anne Twomey cited similar powers at the disposal of the Commonwealth, explaining federal parliament has the power to “override” state laws with its own legislation on quarantine.
“Alternatively, it could rely on its external affairs power to legislate to give effect to a right of ‘freedom of movement’ as a means of implementing Australia’s obligations in human rights treaties,” she said.
“However, this might be difficult to do while simultaneously restricting the freedom of movement of Australians to enter and leave Australia.”
Spiking Delta outbreaks and the availability of vaccines have empowered state leaders to defend their borders in previously unseen ways - which constitutional scholars say could also spark a court battle.
Recently, WA announced it would restrict arrivals from states and territories recording 50 cases or more a day to only allow entry to those who have received at least one vaccination and who have returned a negative Covid-19 test in the 72 hours before travel.
The extraordinary measure will apply even to its own residents returning to the state.
“That is also extremely new and I think that would probably be challenged as well,” Prof Harris Rimmer said.
“We’re in the land of novelty here and it will be for the High Court to decide most of these things.”
If the stoush were to progress to the High Court, agreements and discussions from national cabinet about forecasting a vaccination threshold to resume life to normal could be used as an argument.
“All of that will be considered as evidence of a proportionate and reasonable response,” Prof Harris Rimmer said.
“The problem will be is that it is all quite speculative,” she said, considering the advice from the Doherty Institute was based on modelling.
“What we don’t have is something that definitely says 70 per cent vaccination rate is the most reasonable way to protect the population. We don’t actually know that as a fact.”
A spokesman for the WA Premier’s office refused to comment on the likelihood of a High Court challenge but said the national agreement was for states to be afforded the right to lock down and close borders even if the vaccine threshold is reached.
“We're just saying,” Mr McGowan told reporters earlier in the week. “If we get to those points in three or four months time, we retain the right to put in place measures that are agreed.
“But I just remind you all, this is a massive distraction, a massive smoke screen away from what is happening in NSW right now.
“We shouldn't be having this huge national argument about what happens in December, we should be worried about what’s happening in NSW in August because that is the risk both to the people of NSW and to the people of the rest of the country.”
The Prime Minister’s Office did not respond to multiple requests for comment.

Full text: Senior Cabinet Minister Grace Grace on Saturday said the state government wanted to have “a look” at the new modelling and determine what it meant for Queensland.
The Doherty Institute reiterated to National Cabinet on Friday that it would be safe to reopen the country once 80 per cent of over-16s are fully vaccinated – regardless of case numbers.
In a one-line statement, a spokesman for Premier Annastacia Palaszczuk on Saturday said the state government was yet to receive the paper and that it “looks forward to further discussions next week”.
He would not say if Queensland would no longer have lockdowns at an 80 per cent vaccination rate, or what changes would be made once 70 to 80 per cent of Queenslanders had received their jab.
It comes after the Premier last week wouldn’t rule out pulling out of the Doherty Institute plan until she saw the new modelling.
Ms Grace said it was appropriate that Queensland “has a look” at the remodelling to determine what it meant for the Sunshine State.
“I understand the Prime Minister also made comments that hospital capacity and workforce needs are also needing to be further looked at,” the Minister said.
“And I believe that will be available at the next meeting of the National Cabinet.
“Of course we will consider that modelling.”
Asked how long Queensland would take to consider the new modelling before making a call on it, Ms Grace said: “I think that’s up to the National Cabinet discussions and up to the Premier and us to discuss”.
“I’m sure that once we land on a position, that will be made known,” she said.
Before Friday’s National Cabinet meeting, Ms Palaszczuk had insisted that she would want to take the advice of the state’s chief health officer and discuss the modelling with senior Cabinet Ministers before making a decision on it.
National Cabinet was told that at a 70 per cent to 80 per cent vaccination rate, measures such as mask wearing, restrictions and contact tracing would still be needed.
Meanwhile, Queensland recorded no new community acquired Covid cases on Saturday, but there were four cases detected in hotel quarantine from overseas arrivals.
In locked down NSW, locally acquired case numbers surged by 1035, while in Victoria there were 64 new cases recorded.

Kids on brink of violent meltdowns during lockdown

Full text: Murdoch Children’s Research Institute (MCRI) mental health expert Professor Harriet Hiscock – who is director of the Health Services Research Unit at The Royal Children’s Hospital and a professorial fellow of paediatrics at the University of Melbourne – told the Sunday Herald Sun that repeated and lengthy lockdowns are damaging the mental health of children in Victoria.
“It’s things like pulling out hair, scratching and kids who start cutting themselves,’’ she said.
“We are seeing more kids getting angry, irritable, melting down and they can be lashing out at their families.
“Teenagers who are feeling frustrated, anxious or out of control, there are some who are becoming physically violent towards their siblings or parents.
“Some kids will withdraw, others will have a fight-flight response.’’
She said Victorian hospitals had recorded a 90 per cent increase in children with eating disorders, a 10 per cent increase in kids with anxiety and a 12.3 per cent rise in self-harm since 2019, before the pandemic began.
The MCRI figures also revealed a doubling in the number of teenagers contemplating suicide in Melbourne, where they have endured 208 days of stay-home orders and home schooling.
Cooped-up kids failing to cope with lockdown loneliness are showing up at hospital emergency departments in record numbers, with a 45 per cent increase in Victoria and 55 per cent increase in Sydney since the start of the pandemic.
A recent MCRI study found that one in five Victorian children thought about suicide during the first COVID-19 lockdowns last year – double the pre-pandemic rate of one in 10.
Professor Hiscock said children in Victoria were faring worse this year.
“Children have gone from feeling lonely and anxious and irritable last year, to it really intensifying this year,’’ she said.
Professor Hiscock said children in lockdown feel “lonely and disconnected’’.
“They just want to get back their life and mates and school and sport and drama,’’ she said.
“They miss structure – kids don’t know if it’s Thursday or Friday or a weekend, it’s all blurred – and everyone is exhausted.
“The best thing for kids is to get back to school.’’
One of Australia’s leading child psychologists told the Sunday Herald Sun he has never been more worried about the mental health of young people.
Dr Michael Carr-Gregg has joined a growing chorus of doctors and mental health professionals in calling for the state government to begin addressing the toll that repeated lockdowns have had on Victorian children.
As part of a new campaign, which has the backing of more than 75 doctors, Dr Carr-Gregg has demanded that schools and playgrounds are reopened as a matter of urgency, fearing Victoria’s already broken mental health system won’t be able to cope with demand in the coming years.
“We will not be able to vaccinate the mental health effects of these lockdowns away,” he said.
“Kids make up 20 per cent of Victoria’s population, but they’re 100 per cent of our future, and the longer this continues, the longer the effects will go on. This poses a substantial threat to the ongoing wellbeing of our young people.”
Dr Carr-Gregg, who is one of Australia’s highest profile psychologists, said kids needed four key things – to be at school, to socialise with friends, to spend time away from parents and to take healthy risks – in order to successfully develop.
“The current restrictions stop them dead in their tracks,” he said.
Dr Carr-Gregg said it was now time that a mental health expert was present in any future restrictions discussion between chief health officer Professor Brett Sutton and government.
“I am just absolutely at a loss that we’re not hearing from some of our mental health professionals,” he said.
Business and family groups have urged the state government to show Victorians a path out of lockdowns.
Paul Guerra, Chief Executive Officer at the Victorian Chamber of Commerce and Industry, said: “Businesses across the state are in crisis.
“The Doherty Institute modelling shows a clear path forward. We need a clear commitment from the State that they will follow that road map. Business need hope that these lockdowns will end and we can enjoy a bloody great summer.”
Georgie Dent, executive director of advocacy group The Parenthood, said the lockdowns were “extremely challenging” for children due to the lack of routine and structure.
“Kids pick up on a lot of stress and parents are stressed physically and emotionally, you can’t discount the cumulative toll of that,” she said.
Tim Piper, Victorian director of The Australia Industry Group, said devastation was particularly acute in the small business world.
“They are really struggling … irrespective of which area you are looking at, people are still struggling. It’s excruciating.”

Teenagers to be offered vaccine this year, health minister says

Full text: Every Australian family will likely be able to offer their child a COVID vaccine by the end of the year, the federal Health Minister says.
All Australian children aged 12 to 15 will be eligible for a COVID vaccine from next month, after Pfizer was given the green light by the Australian Technical Advisory Group on Immunisation (ATAGI).
But Prime Minister Scott Morrison rejected calls for teenagers to be included in the vaccination targets forming the basis of Australia's path out of COVID restrictions.
The federal government on Thursday accepted recommendations from ATAGI and COVID Taskforce commander Lieutenant-General John Frewen for Pfizer to be administered to all Australians aged 12 to 15. Bookings for that age range will open from September 13.

"We are in a position to ensure that all children and all families who seek their children to be vaccinated between the ages of 12 to 15, will be able to do so this year," he said on Friday.
Mr Morrison said state and territory leaders would be briefed on the decision at national cabinet on Friday, and discussions would centre on their participation in the scheme. The states would work through whether and when to open up their mass hubs to children.
"Principally I would see that happening especially through the GP network [initially]. That provides the opportunity for family vaccinations, for the family to go along together across those age groups," he said.
Pfizer was provisionally approved for that age range among immunocompromised children, Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander children, and children in remote areas earlier this month.
Australia's path out of COVID restrictions is based on Doherty Institute modelling, outlining new stages to be triggered at 70 and 80 per cent vaccination of the 16 and over population.
But the Prime Minister rejected suggestions 12- to 15-year-olds would now be folded into the national targets, despite pressure from some jurisdictions.
"The target is about the overall level of vaccination in the adult population, who are the primary transmitters of the virus. So that's the science of that," he said.
"There is no recommendation from any of our medical health advisors to [include children in the targets], and so I don't see the point of that. What I see the point of doing is vaccinating children."
His comments came soon after ATAGI confirmed it had granted provisional approval for the Pfizer vaccine to be administered to all children aged 12 to 15. Approval for another mRNA vaccine, Moderna, was also being worked through.
"Vaccination against COVID-19 is recommended for all individuals from 12 years of age, extending the current recommendation for those aged 16 years and older," ATAGI said in a statement.
"Recommendations on the use of Spikevax (Moderna) for adolescents will be finalised following the decision on provisional registration of Spikevax (Moderna) in this age group."
ATAGI conceded there was uncertainty over teenagers' role in transmitting Covid, but said the virus would increasingly target younger people with a higher proportion of adults vaccinated.
"Vaccinating adolescents is anticipated to contribute to a reduction in SARS-CoV-2 transmission in the broader population. Once a large proportion of adults are vaccinated, susceptible children and adolescents will account for a higher proportion of continued infections in the community contributing to transmission. This has been seen in countries such as Israel and the USA," it said.
ATAGI said a trial of 2000 children in that age range produced "high level evidence" Pfizer was effective against the virus.
That included an 100 per cent effectiveness against symptoms seven days after children received their second dose. The first dose proved 75 per cent effective, ATAGI said.
National cabinet was also expected to discuss exemptions available to vaccinated Australians in Phase B and Phase C of the Doherty plan. But Mr Morrison poured cold water on the prospect of arrangements being finalised on Friday.
"Don't anticipate any decisions on that today. There is still ample time to work through those issues, but a lot of work has already been done to consider the options are there. They will be discussed in a first-pass way today, and that will provide some direction to further discussions on that," he said.

Full text: The strong stance comes after emboldened state leaders grew increasingly defiant against the Prime Minister as debate rages about domestic border policy, with Australia edging towards its desired vaccination coverage threshold.
Scott Morrison wants the borders open to return life, and the economy, to normal but premiers — specifically from Queensland and Western Australia — have stood firm.
The political stoush is well into its second year, but constitutional scholars say the messy conflict will be heightened when vaccine rates rise and it will be the High Court, not Mr Morrison, who would have the final say.
When asked if Ms Palaszczuk would be willing to defend her position in the highest court in Australia, a spokesman from the Premier’s office told NCA NewsWire: “The Queensland government makes no apologies for consistently following the health advice to keep Queenslanders safe”.
“Clive Palmer had the support of the Commonwealth when he challenged the Western Australian government and lost,” they said.
Data released by the Doherty Institute last week says border closures and lockdowns will no longer be needed once the population reaches 80 per cent vaccination coverage.
The Prime Minister is eager to reach this milestone and slowly repair shattered consumer confidence caused by the lingering threat of snap lockdowns, declaring “we can’t stay in the cave forever”.
Gladys Berejiklian agrees, desperate for her state’s soaring crisis to be saved by vaccine protection, but Queensland and WA both reserved the right to lock down residents even when jab coverage reaches 80 per cent.
Academics say the Prime Minister could, under the constitution through powers over the responsibility to quarantine Australians and the Biosecurity Act, override state laws and demand premiers and first ministers open borders.
But the High Court accepted the position of state leaders in the case between Palmer and WA, authorising the McGowan government to close borders for the purpose of protecting public health.
Professor Susan Harris Rimmer, Policy Innovation Hub director at Griffith University, said the “Commonwealth can’t, the High Court can” override state leaders.
“Under the Constitution there’s meant to be freedom of movement between the states for the purposes of trade but when Clive Palmer sued WA, the High Court considered border closures then and they said, essentially, that as long as it was proportionate to the health threat or a reasonable response, then the states could shut their borders under that section of the constitution,” she said.
Despite overwhelming public support, the professor said there was a “lot of debate among constitutional scholars” at the time about the extraordinary decision.
“Because that was right at the beginning of the pandemic, I think the High Court was willing to give a little bit of latitude,” Prof Harris Rimmer told NCA NewsWire.
“But now you might be able to say, ‘do they have to have hard closures if there’s only a few cases in one particular place or one particular part of the state?’
“So is it reasonable to close the borders to the whole of Queensland if there’s one case in Cairns? Those are the issues of facts that the High Court would have to think about.
“But if you think about it the other way, the Commonwealth also has the same problem because it is also meant to allow Australians to come and go and it doesn’t because it has decided, under the Biosecurity Act, to take a very hard line to shut the borders externally.”
Legal academic Anne Twomey cited similar powers at the disposal of the Commonwealth, explaining federal parliament has the power to “override” state laws with its own legislation on quarantine.
“Alternatively, it could rely on its external affairs power to legislate to give effect to a right of ‘freedom of movement’ as a means of implementing Australia’s obligations in human rights treaties,” she said.
“However, this might be difficult to do while simultaneously restricting the freedom of movement of Australians to enter and leave Australia.”
Spiking Delta outbreaks and the availability of vaccines have empowered state leaders to defend their borders in previously unseen ways - which constitutional scholars say could also spark a court battle.
Recently, WA announced it would restrict arrivals from states and territories recording 500 cases or more a day to only allow entry to those who have received at least one vaccination and who have returned a negative Covid-19 test in the 72 hours before travel.
The extraordinary measure will apply even to its own residents returning to the state.
“That is also extremely new and I think that would probably be challenged as well,” Prof Harris Rimmer said.
“We’re in the land of novelty here and it will be for the High Court to decide most of these things.”
If the stoush were to progress to the High Court, agreements and discussions from national cabinet about forecasting a vaccination threshold to resume life to normal could be used as an argument.
“All of that will be considered as evidence of a proportionate and reasonable response,” Prof Harris Rimmer said.
“The problem will be is that it is all quite speculative,” she said, considering the advice from the Doherty Institute was based on modelling.
“What we don’t have is something that definitely says 70 per cent vaccination rate is the most reasonable way to protect the population. We don’t actually know that as a fact.”
A spokesman for the WA Premier’s office refused to comment on the likelihood of a High Court challenge but said the national agreement was for states to be afforded the right to lock down and close borders even if the vaccine threshold is reached.
“We're just saying,” Mr McGowan told reporters earlier in the week. “If we get to those points in three or four months time, we retain the right to put in place measures that are agreed.
“But I just remind you all, this is a massive distraction, a massive smoke screen away from what is happening in NSW right now.
“We shouldn't be having this huge national argument about what happens in December, we should be worried about what’s happening in NSW in August because that is the risk both to the people of NSW and to the people of the rest of the country.”
The Prime Minister’s Office did not respond to multiple requests for comment.

Full text: More than 156,000 vaccines were administered across the state in the past 24 hours, NSW Health Minister Brad Hazzard said.
There were also 129,182 tests conducted.
He said there two Covid-19 related deaths, a woman in her 70s from the Blue Mountains district and a woman in he 80s from western Sydney.
There have now been 83 deaths since the outbreak began on June 16 and the number of infections has climbed to more than 17,000.
Mr Hazzard announced weddings would again be allowed from this Friday, with five guests, plus the photographer and those officiating.
NSW Health’s Dr Jeremy McAnulty flagged half a dozen suburbs where the risk of spreading the virus is concentrated and urged residents to follow Covid-safe protocols.
“We continue to be very concerned about southwestern Western Sydney cases escalating, particularly in the suburbs of Guildford, Maryland, Auburn, Granville, Bankstown, and Greystanes,” he told the media on Saturday.
“So wherever we are in the State, of course, assume that you might be at the risk of Covid, but in those areas in southwestern Western Sydney, in particular, be very aware of the Covid safe behaviours to follow.”
VACCINE SUPPLY ISSUES
Young people in Victoria are flocking to get vaccinated but supply issues continue to frustrate the government and community as the state’s tally of active cases rises past 700.
There was another 64 cases recorded on Friday, with 15 unlinked to known clusters and 28 people infectious while in the community.
Health Minister Martin Foley told media 42 people were in Victorian hospitals, with 13 in intensive care and eight requiring a ventilator.
“And we send our very best wishes to those fellow Victorians,” he said, “who are battling in a really, really serious sense.”
There are now 701 active cases in Victoria, with only four of those acquired overseas.
Mr Foley said after more than 35,000 people were vaccinated on Friday, that 16 to 39-year-olds had come forward in droves to book their jabs.
He said the state government would continue to press for more doses of both AstraZeneca and Pfizer to meet a “really big demand”.
“And the thing that continues to hold us back in meeting those huge levels of demand is supply,” he said.
“What we really need is the supply to meet the demand and we will continue to ask for more supply, because we know that with every dose of Pfizer, with every dose of AstraZeneca, that will end up with more Victorians doing their part sooner to get us out of this pandemic.”
Queensland recorded no new cases on Saturday morning, after millions of Queenslanders in the southeast of the state had their restrictions lifted.
NSW LOCKDOWN COULD LAST FOR WEEKS
It comes after another 882 new cases of Covid-19 were ecorded in NSW and two people died on Friday as the state leader hinted that lockdown may not end for weeks.
More than 140,000 people got vaccinated in the last 24 hours, taking the total jabs administered to 6.4 million for NSW.
The two deaths included a man in his 60s from the Blue Mountains who died in Nepean Hospital where he caught the disease.
A man in his 90s from western Sydney died at Concord Hospital, having acquired his infection at Canterbury Hospital. Both had underlying health conditions.
The NSW Premier Gladys Berejiklian said more than 80 per cent of the cases were in Sydney’s west and southwest but there were some new areas of concern including Camden and Penrith.
“Health experts are telling us that there are more cases there than they would like to see and unless things improve their there could be a chance that those areas could be (flagged) as local government areas of concern,” she said.
Of the new cases 325 were from western Sydney, 265 from Sydney’s southwest, 82 are from inner Sydney, 60 from the Blue Mountains and 53 from Sydney’s southeast.
NED-4090-Greater-Sydney-Restrictions-map
Regional NSW is also of concern with 40 cases detected in the state’s west.
The figures came as the NSW Premier outlined a return to school plan for students across the state.
She said “if” any area in NSW comes out of lockdown before October 25 then those children will automatically return to school.
But setting the date for late October suggests NSW could be subject to strict stay-at-home measures for weeks to come.
“If health (officials) decide any part of NSW is coming out of lockdown before the October 25 date, that will obviously mean that schools can go back to face-to-face learning,” Ms Berejiklian said.
Ms Berejiklian said teachers, students and kids will start returning to the classrooms in October. The return will be staggered across year levels, and relies on mandatory vaccinations for school staff.

PFIZER JABS FOR KIDS

Australian teenagers aged 12 to 15 are set to join the Covid-19 vaccine rollout next month after health authorities approved the Pfizer jab for wider use in the age group.
The Australian Technical Advisory Group on Immunisation (ATAGI) had previously approved the use of Pfizer in children aged 12 to 15 who were Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander or who had an underlying health condition.
The Pfizer jab has now been extended to the wider teen population, paving the way for millions more to get the vaccine.
ATAGI said vaccinating the young cohort would help reduce the spread of Covid-19 in the wider population, warning children and adolescents would make up the bulk of infections once a large portion of adults had gotten the jab.
Prime Minister Scott Morrison said the government would open up the jab to teens aged 12 to 15 in mid-September, just days after the jab becomes available to adults aged 16 to 39.
The announcement comes as National Cabinet are set to meet this afternoon to discuss updated modelling from the Doherty Institute that shapes Australia’s road map out of Covid-19.
Mr Morrison said state and territory leaders would discuss potential exemptions that vaccinated people can look forward to in Phases B and C of the road map.
But he flagged that it’s likely no decisions will be made today.
“There is still ample time to work through those issues,” he said.
VICTORIAN OUTBREAK GROWS
Health authorities have named the western suburbs as their primary area of concern as the Victorian Covid outbreak continues to escalate.
State Covid-19 commander Jeroen Weimar said 60 per cent of Victoria’s 79 new locally acquired cases recorded on Friday were from the western suburbs.
He said of the 46 positive cases from the region on Friday, 12 were located in Wyndham and 11 in Newport.
There are now at least 150 of Victoria’s 660 active cases in the western suburbs, with 39 in Wyndham, 81 in Newport and 19 linked to the Newport Football Club.
Mr Weimar said the health department continued to work with leaders and agencies across the region to try and drive case numbers down.
He said there were multiple chains of transmission across the western suburbs that contact tracers were trying to track down.
Health Minister Martin Foley said the latest outbreak commenced in the western suburbs but that was no reflection on the people who lived there.
“This is where the incursions from NSW landed, and it has morphed as a result in the north and west,” he said.
“How particular communities geographically, or otherwise, interact within the restrictions and the five reasons, the western suburbs is disproportionately a community that is full of essential workers and permitted workers, they are out and about.
“That reflects the nature of demographics and work patterns as opposed to anything particularly described to the people of the west.”
Another area of concern for health officials is the cluster linked to the MyCentre Childcare in Broadmeadows that has seeded out into the wider community.
Mr Weimar said 94 cases associated with the childcare centre, including 15 staff and seven children.
“But it is really leaking out now to family cohorts and primary close contacts,” he said.
The state’s health department announced the new local cases just before 8.30am on Friday, which included another 16 mystery infections.
There was originally 26 mystery cases announced by the department on Friday but Mr Weimar later said 63 of the 79 new cases could be linked to existing outbreaks, meaning 10 more had been tracked down.
Mr Foley said only 19 cases were in isolation throughout their infectious period, but he expected that number to grow as more interviews were completed with positive patients.
Friday’s announcement is a bad sign for the end of the city’s lockdown, with a call on if it will be extended again due in just days.

COVID SCARE FOR SUNRISE
Sunrise has been hit with a Covid-19 scare as a crew member tested positive to the virus, forcing newsreader Edwina Bartholomew to self -isolate at home.
Bartholomew is a close contact of the positive case.
Channel 7 confirmed the employee tested positive on Thursday after working at Sunrise’s Martin Place, Sydney offices earlier this week.
The staff member, who is fully vaccinated and doesn’t live in a hotspot, was tested after they were identified as a close contact of another case.
Host Natalie Barr told viewers the offices were undergoing a deep clean and that all staff had been tested.
“Hello and welcome to Friday. A Covid scare of our own overnight, we join you after a staffer tested positive,” she said.
NEW MODELLING ON DEATH RATES
New modelling from the Doherty Institute finds lifting restrictions amid thousands of Covid-19 cases won’t lead to more deaths than waiting for cases to fall.
The updated modelling was given to states and territories ahead of Friday’s national cabinet meeting, where Prime Minister Scott Morrison is expected to hold leaders to easing restrictions at vaccination rates of 70 to 80 per cent, The Australian reported.
The new analysis modelled the number of fatality rates over 180 days based on a range of Covid cases from the tens to the thousands, and found there was no difference in the number of deaths.
6,000 CASES A DAY TO COME IN OCTOBER PEAK
The worst may be yet to come, however, with another study finding daily Covid-19 cases could rise to between 1,500 to 6,000 cases per day by early October under current restrictions.
That could blow out to 40,000 cases per day if restrictions are lifted once 80 per cent of people are vaccinated.
The University of Sydney modelling comes as NSW eases some restrictions for those vaccinated.
Professor Mikhail Prokopenko, Director of the University of Sydney’s Centre for Complex Systems, said more than half a million Australians could catch the virus in the month after restrictions are removed, even with continued testing, tracing, isolation, quarantine and international travel restrictions.
“We can expect to see a rapid increase in cases when we exit the lockdown. In fact, our modelling suggests the worst is yet to come if the restrictions are removed too soon and too abruptly,” he said.


National – 2021 – Covid Vaccination Stats
MORE BLOOD CLOTS LINKED TO AZ
Australia has recorded eight more cases of blood clots linked to the AstraZeneca vaccine.
The Therapeutic Goods Administration Covid-19 vaccine weekly safety report found two ‘confirmed’ cases of thrombosis with thrombocytopenia syndrome or TTS. They were a 34-year-old woman from NSW and a 68-year-old woman from South Australia.
The other cases were also considered “probable” and affected 27 and 69-year-old women from Victoria; 73, 74 and 75-year-old women from NSW; and a 83-year-old man from NSW.
The latest cases of severe blood clots linked to the AstraZeneca vaccine to 116 cases (67 confirmed, 49 probable) from nearly 8.8 million vaccine doses.
The TGA says in Australia, severe cases of TTS appear to be more common in women in younger age groups. Nearly half of the TTS cases in women required treatment in intensive care.
To date, six deaths have resulted from the condition – five of these were in women aged 34, 48 (two cases), 52 and 72. The other death was in a 44-year-old man.
Most cases have happened about two weeks after vaccination.
The TGA advises people should seek immediate medical attention if they develop any of the following symptoms after vaccination:
– severe or persistent headache, blurred vision, confusion or seizures
– shortness of breath, chest pain, leg swelling or persistent abdominal pain
– unusual skin bruising and/or pinpoint round spots beyond the site of vaccination.
The most common time period for onset of TTS symptoms is 4–30 days after vaccination.

PM’s bold gamble could lock in the election

Full text: Actually, it was always going to be hard to win, given the Coalition is seeking a fourth term while defending a paper-thin majority and facing an adverse redistribution, plus strong and aggressive Labor governments in the key states of Western Australia and Queensland. But by finally moving to take on the lockdown-addicted Labor premiers this week, the Prime Minister at last has given himself a fighting chance.
As Malcolm Turnbull discovered in 2016, elections are contests, not coronations. You don’t win by minimising differences with the other side and expecting to be rewarded for past achievements. You win only when you’re able to persuade voters that, on balance, their lives will be better with you and your party in government. Having invented the so-called national cabinet at the start of the pandemic to play himself into the formulation and co-ordination of public health policy, it’s understandable that Morrison felt obliged to minimise friction with the Labor premiers, even when they played fast and loose with national cabinet decisions.
In the acute phase of this crisis, voters would not have rewarded rank politicking, so he was right to build bridges, not burn them. But as the harm from lockdowns grew and the Covid cure became worse than the disease, giving up the mantle of national leader to become a mere chairman of a Covid co-ordinating council has come at a cost to Morrison’s standing in the polls and his character in the eyes of the electorate.
With close to 15 million Australians under virtual house arrest, and with everyone else’s lives subject to instant up-ending at the first sign of an outbreak, cynically opportunistic Labor premiers successfully have pinned the blame on Morrison (personally, not just the federal government) for not rolling out the vaccine fast enough. It’s not their fault people are locked up, they’ve said, but the Prime Minister’s for not giving them any alternative.
But with the vaccine rollout now gathering speed, and with NSW, especially, well on track to hit 70 per cent double-jabbed within two months, the Labor premiers may have overplayed their hand. Certainly, Anthony Albanese now fears that, hence Wednesday’s sudden conversion to the Doherty Institute’s formula for opening up. Provided he holds his nerve, Morrison has a window to change the contest from an argument over how well he has managed the rollout to an argument over who wants to keep us locked up more or less forever.
Don’t be surprised if the federal Opposition Leader goes to the election saying he wants the lockdowns ended as quickly as possible, even while Labor premiers continue to impose them. Labor is more than capable of playing a ruthless political double game, especially in those states that have had their elections safely out of the way – and blaming the PM for the confusion.
Until last weekend, it has been hard to tell that Morrison is a Liberal prime minister, at least from his handling of the pandemic.
In terms of the initial lockdowns nationally and the pre-vaccine Victorian second wave, he probably didn’t have much choice but to support restrictions and to pay for their economic consequences – despite the obvious clash with the normal Liberal instinct for smaller government and greater freedom.
But even after the national cabinet had agreed on a plan out of restrictions – essentially to end statewide lockdowns once vaccination reached 70 per cent and to end state border closures once vaccinations reached 80 per cent – Morrison stayed a lockdown supporter, with his initial response to the current NSW second wave almost falling into a tautology: “If you’re in a lockdown, the lockdown has to work.”
But that all seemed to change last weekend. Last Sunday, Morrison declared in a newspaper column that “a one-eyed focus on just case numbers overlooks the fact that (fewer) people are getting seriously ill, let alone dying” thanks to vaccines. He went on: “These lockdowns are imposing a heavy toll. They are sadly necessary for now … but they won’t be necessary for too much longer.”
Sky News host Peta Credlin says there has been a “real shift” in the COVID-19 messaging from Prime Minister Scott Morrison. “Gone now is the Armageddon language and the talk of caseload catastrophe,” Ms Credlin said. “In its place was a more balanced weighting of the risks of COVID against the ongoing harm of lockdowns.” According to Ms Credlin, Labor premiers are aiming to “retrofit” National Cabinet’s plan on vaccinations with a “new requirement” to also have zero COVID cases. “Well, earth to premiers, unless we stop every flight into this country, we won’t ever get back to COVID zero,” she said. “Scott Morrison needs to understand he won’t win support with rhetoric. “He has to drop his ‘softly, softly, let’s not upset the Labor premiers’ persona, and make the National Cabinet decision stick.”
Since then, with ever-greater clarity and vigour, he has been stressing that we will have to “live with Covid”, including some hospitalisations and deaths; and putting himself increasingly at odds with the Labor premiers who still insist that, for opening up, it’s necessary that the virus be “crushed and killed”.
It’s now pretty clear that in NSW at least, from the end of October when vaccination hits 70 per cent, businesses will reopen, some school classes will resume and restrictions will be minimal. Well before that, it’s likely that the double-jabbed will get some relief from stay-at-home orders. It’s also pretty clear that in Victoria, under the world’s harshest lockdown, where even sunset-watching is verboten, without a return to Covid zero there’ll be no release from house arrest until vaccination rates reach at least 80 per cent.
Given the Labor premiers’ fixation on Covid zero, unless NSW gets to 80 per cent vaccination and also eliminates the virus, it’s all but certain that Queensland, WA and Victoria will keep their borders shut tight.
In fact, the Labor states are trying to retrofit the national cabinet decision to add a new require­ment for opening up: not just 70 per cent-plus vaccination but zero Covid, too – even though the decision was based on Doherty Institute modelling that was quite specific that high levels of vaccination could not be expected to prevent more than 100 hospitalisations and more than 10 deaths a day on average due to Covid, around Australia.
The Labor premiers are obviously revelling in a spotlight that state leaders haven’t had for a generation. As long as they can maintain a sense of crisis, they keep their opposition marginalised and public concerns muted about all other policy failures and budget spending. They also know the federal government is held to a higher standard than they are.
It won’t be enough for Morrison to exploit the politics of this crisis as they have. He’ll have to fix it, even though so much of the politics of it is outside his control.
Sky News Political Editor Andrew Clennell says the “challenge” for Prime Minister Scott Morrison is to convince Queensland and WA to open up after vaccination targets are reached. “Scott Morrison knows he can push ahead with this opening up agenda and he has enough support for it, now that’s the case in NSW and Victoria, that’s understandable,” Mr Clennell told Sky News host Peta Credlin. “The research is showing that people are starting to get concerned in Western Australia and Queensland. “Morrison's really in campaign mode.”
The Labor premiers will continue to make opening up all about risks to health from Covid spreading through the community. By contrast, Morrison needs to make it all about risks to mental health and jobs from Covid restrictions staying in place.
But it won’t be enough for Morrison merely to side with voters increasingly demanding their lives back. As the country’s paramount leader, he will be expected to deliver; to make the national cabinet decision, for once, actually stick; and the only lever he has is financial.
Within a few months of the federal election, could Morrison credibly threaten Queensland and Western Australia with funding cuts if they don’t stick to the national cabinet plan for reopening? If it’s a matter of political life or death, maybe he could. That would require a level of steel from him not seen since, as Tony Abbott’s border minister, he helped to stop the boats.

Full text: ’Tis an ill wind
It’s the question you didn’t know you needed answered: can you catch Covid-19 from farts? The ABC’s omniscient Norman Swan told listeners to his Coronacast podcast that yes, you probably can. Hence why the government is testing our waste water for fragments of the virus shed in faeces. Swan warned flatulent Quiet Australians to avoid passing wind “close” to other folk, adding it was important “that you don’t fart with your bottom bare”. Solid advice, pandemic or no.
Presents accounted for
There’s certainly an art to looking a diplomatic gift horse in the mouth. Scott Morrison has decided not to keep the mere – a highly prized Maori weapon made of jade – he received during his whirlwind trip to New Zealand in May. The Prime Minister was officially welcomed to Queenstown by Ngai Tahu leader Edward Ellison at a ceremony where Kiwi official Martin Wikaira sang a rendition of Waltzing Matilda in Maori. Morrison was presented with the jade mere, a short flat club shaped like a large tear drop, as a sign of trans-Tasman “unity and togetherness”. It is traditionally used in close hand-to-hand combat … surely it would come in handy for the Liberal partyroom? ScoMo’s mere was valued at $1407.55 by NZ, and therefore exceeded Australia’s gift limit – $750 from government sources and $300 from private or industry sources. In order to keep it, he would be required to pay the dollar difference of $1218.31. Instead, the PM decided to consciously uncouple from the weapon and surrender it to his department, which will decide whether it should be added to the rotation of items on display in his Parliament House office (in case they ever visit) or disposed of. The PM does deserve some credit that the mere made it to PM&C. Over in Washington DC, there’s an “ongoing inquiry” into the disappearance of a $7860 bottle of whisky given to former secretary of state Mike Pompeo by then Japanese prime minister Shinzo Abe in 2019. Mysterious!
Trump up your sleeve
The PM obviously didn’t feel as attached to the Kiwi artefact as he did the silver bald eagle cufflinks from Donald Trump or the signed photographs of the Queen and Prince Philip , from QEII herself. He paid $355.30 and $33 respectfully to keep them in his personal possession. Jenny Morrison also forked out $264 to keep a “carved ivory pig tusk bracelet” from the first lady of Vanuatu, Estelle Tallis . Would a proud constitutional monarchist wear one’s bald eagle cufflinks with one’s everyday Australian flag face mask and pin? Or would they clash? Asking for a friend.
They’re fin love
Jacinda Ardern ’s North Island nuptials are on hold now that NZ is in a national lockdown. Beau-to-be Clark Gayford confirmed the pair, and daughter Neve , have put prep for the summer wedding in Gisborne on “the backburner”. When he’s not starring in Audible ads, NZ’s first fiance has been busy working on his book Fish of the Day, which captures his best travel tips and recipes. Apparently Ardern is actually pretty good with a rod in hand. “Her first cast she got a 14 pound snapper, her very next cast she caught this huge John Dory – and she thought that was what fishing was always like.” No wonder she’s hooked! “I’ve been teaching her how to soft bait and a style of fishing called speed-jigging and she’s very determined when she sets her mind to it.” What a catch!
Point of order
Could the farce that is question time sink any further than this? Government whip Rowan Ramsey was two sentences into reading his Dorothy Dixer for Small Business Minister Stuart Robert when he realised something was amiss. “I have asked the wrong question,” Ramsey declared. He was meant to quiz Education Minster Alan Tudge. Close but no cigar. “Sorry, no. You’ve asked the question,” Speaker Tony Smith interrupted. “Yes, it’s probably the clearest illustration that it’s not a question without notice, but anyway…” Laughter ensued. The surprise zinger of the day came from Trade Minister Dan Tehan, who thanked Liberal backbencher Warren Entsch for “asking the right question”. Talk about a low bar! Kudos also to Bob “I never use a computer” Katter , who asked his first remote query without a hitch. More than we can say for Health Minister Greg Hunt , who paused mid-answer and tried to probe Labor’s Tony Burke .
Like a Rolling Stone
“We know the member for Dawson wasn’t born in a crossfire hurricane but he’s got a touch of the cyclone!” Minister Keith Pitt on George Christensen.
Taters gonna tate
Here’s another fun QT fact. Nationals leader Barnaby Joyce revealed that Ken O’Dowd , the outgoing member for Flynn, once bought and renovated an old Rockhampton pub. He renamed it O’Dowd’s Irish Hotel before offloading it in 2004. It’s now known simply as O’Dowds, but one of Strewth’s spies found something called an “Irish Pizza” on the dinner menu. With a creamy white sauce, sliced potato, Irish sausage, mushrooms, chives, bacon and cheese … it’s a spudtacular steal for $12.
What are the chances?
Here’s a tweet that caught our eye from professor Peter Doherty : “My guess is we’re headed for a federal election very soon. Make sure you’re registered to vote, decide what policies are important to you, make the effort to find out the positions of the different parties & candidates & vote for the least worst alternative. BUT VOTE”. Sure … but where’s the modelling?

National cabinet unity fraying over vaccination targets

Full text: Australia's path out of lockdown has descended into a political squabble less than a month after it was unveiled.
The Doherty Institute modelling, which sees restrictions begin to ease at 70 per cent vaccination among Australia's 16 and over population, was agreed to by national cabinet in July.
But Delta's spread within and across NSW's borders has made the modelling a political flashpoint. National cabinet unity, tenuous at the best of times, is threatening to break entirely.
ACT Chief Minister Andrew Barr last week demanded Australia's leaders admit that 70 per cent will not be a "Freedom Day", and restrictions will linger after Doherty's targets are met.
But amid talk of states walking away from the target, the federal government says economic support will be yanked from those reneging on the deal.
Prime Minister Scott Morrison is urging them to stay the course. He told colleagues on Tuesday the Doherty Institute "stood above the noise" of day-to-day politics. His deputy Barnaby Joyce says the government needs to be frank: people will get sick and die once reopening begins, but perpetual lockdowns are not a solution.

The Doherty Institute says it's unlikely we'll need generalised lockdowns once we hit the 70-80 per cent threshold. But it concedes that is dependent on effective "vigilant public health interventions" - testing, tracing, isolating and quarantine.
Sydney University infectious disease paediatrictian Robert Booy says exposure sites, like schools or shops where there's an outbreak, will face two-day shutdowns for deep cleaning.
He warns QR codes, social distancing, and mask use will continue to be a feature of everyday life even after high vaccination rates are achieved.
"When someone's got symptoms, they test. If someone's positive, they trace, they isolate, they quarantine. This is not a lockdown, this is just some sensible measures to keep us going," he says.
But if a state's tracing and isolating system is not up to scratch, Doherty concedes more moderate measures - capacity limits on events - would not be enough to keep an outbreak in check.
The aim is to keep the Covid's reproduction rate, the number of people an infected person passes the virus on to, under one. Doherty says lockdowns in Victoria and NSW are helping to achieve this.
Will there be extra freedoms for vaccinated people? Yes, but we're still light on detail.
Scott Morrison has confirmed there will be "special rules" for vaccinated Australians, saying making life easier for them is common sense.
Quarantine requirements for vaccinated Australians will be eased in Phase B, triggered at 70 per cent. Larger intakes of vaccinated Australians stranded overseas will also begin.
Outside of the agreed-upon plan, Tasmania, the NT, and Victoria have been tasked with working out how the lives of vaccinated and unvaccinated Australians will differ.
Exemptions from state border closures and access to large scale events are two ideas being considered. But the full details are still to be thrashed out.
Does the NSW outbreak change things? The Doherty Institute says no, but is at loggerheads with some states.
Doherty assumes a small number of cases will be active when Australia hits 70 per cent, not the 11,000 currently seen in NSW. But it insists a higher caseload would not alter its projections entirely.
But Professor Booy warns modelling is "only as good as the assumptions that go into it".
"Assumptions are not fact. So if you start placing all of your decisions on modeling, you're not looking at the full picture," he says.

The states are referencing the same modelling, but their interpretations seem markedly different.
The Delta variant has forced NSW Premier Gladys Berejiklian to abandon hope of returning to zero cases. She says Australia will have to learn to live with the virus once it hits 80 per cent vaccination.
Barr says NSW's approach will expose the rest of Australia to the highly contagious Delta strain, and the ACT will need assume the virus would be constantly travelling across the border. He insists the capital territory will push for "much more" than the agreed-upon vaccination targets, including the 12 to 15 age range not included in Doherty's model.
Victorian Premier Daniel Andrews says reaching zero Covid remains the goal, but will be extremely difficult while cases in NSW remain high.
But WA and Queensland are threatening to walk away from the targets altogether.
WA Premier Mark McGowan, who has already threatened to keep border restrictions in place after 80 per cent is reached, wants a rethink. He claims no cases in a number of states - WA, Queensland, SA and Tasmania - proves NSW's justifications are "self-serving".
Queensland Premier Annastacia Palaszczuk says the "goalposts have changed" because national cabinet adopted the Doherty modelling before NSW recorded over 800 cases in a day.
How do we keep the states together? Each leader has their own political imperatives.
The federal government has been more reticent to criticise Berejiklian than Andrews. McGowan and Palaszczuk's hardline approach paid dividends at the ballot box.
Berejiklian has been critical of their approaches, championing her record of avoiding lockdowns. But she's faced criticism after Delta skipped NSW borders, with Andrews on Tuesday claiming he would like to send the strain back to "where it came from".
And premiers have been quick to point out a lack of vaccine supply, purview of the federal government, when they come under pressure.
Professor Booy suggests a novel idea to end the bickering: adding all opposition leaders, including from the states and territories, to national cabinet.
"It would would reduce political acrimony. Then we can focus on the virus and not each other. Whether [Covid] is causing trouble in ACT or WA, we need to be trying to work together," he says.

Death seems to be hardest word for Morrison

Full text: When Scott Morrison chose to start the week by telling us to adjust our mindset, prepare to leave our cave and get back "our freedoms" once 70 per cent of eligible Australians have been vaccinated, he used a lot of words in his prepared remarks: by my count, 1139 of them. But one word didn't make it.
He said that at above the magical 70 per cent mark, cases of COVID-19 would not be the issue: "Dealing with serious illness, hospitalisation, ICU capabilities, our ability to respond in those circumstances: that will be our goal and we will live with this virus as we live with other infectious diseases." You might have expected the word "deaths" to be in that list, because when you open up a society with more than one in four "eligible" people unvaccinated, some are bound to die from the virus. Treasurer Josh Frydenberg acknowledged this last week.
But from Morrison deaths didn't get a mention. On his telling, it's all upside because the national plan is relying on modelling by the Doherty Institute and the best possible scientific, medical and economic advice in the world. The Doherty modelling, embraced to varying degrees by the states and territories, is now treated as holy writ.
The message being sold is that happy days are around the corner: once we hit the 70 and 80 per cent mark of vaccinations, there will only be "common sense" rules.
We're still a fair way from 70 per cent, but the PM is trying to get out well ahead, setting himself up as the man who will lead us out of lockdowns, and away from chicken-hearted state dictators.
Is it guaranteed to work? The world doesn't need another journalist play-acting as an epidemiologist, but my reading of the Doherty modelling is that even with 80 per cent vaccination coverage, if conventional health measures built around track and trace are at even mildly reduced efficiency because of high COVID caseloads, the community would spend 31 per cent of its time under strict lockdowns. I hope I've misread it, but I note mathematical epidemiologist Allan Saul, from the Burnet Institute, made a similar point in an interview on the ABC's Health Report this week.
The practical problem with Morrison's rah-rah talk about opening up and "living with the virus" is when it's overdone, as on Monday, it risks encouraging too many people to assume that soon they can go back to the way they lived in 2019. "Common sense" is a ridiculous term because it carries the suggestion we can make up our own rules. With the Delta variant, we're still going to need rules based on science, not how we feel.
And as for the Prime Minister's rhetorical avoidance of the mortal consequences of reopening when so many Australians will still be unvaccinated: just take a break from spruiking and be straight with us of your own volition. Daniel Andrews publicly acknowledges that people will die. So does Gladys Berejiklian.
We need only look at Britain to see what can happen when a reopening is subject to too much boosterism. Boris Johnson, who admittedly foreshadowed a rise in deaths, encouraged the English to see July 19, when many restrictions were lifted, as Freedom Day. When Freedom Day came, 68 per cent of UK adults had been fully vaccinated, and there were 40,000 new cases and 31 deaths. Since then, the death rate has climbed, despite the sort of vaccination coverage we're aiming for - now, 87 per cent have had their first jab and 76 per cent two jabs. In the UK at the end of last week, the seven-day average was 98 deaths a day and 31,336 new daily cases. In Australia, the pro rata daily equivalent would be 37 deaths and 11,907 new cases. I'm not suggesting the outcome would be the same here, but the numbers are sobering.
Morrison has made it plain he will be railing against lockdowns once the 70 per cent vaccination target is reached because he says they will be doing more harm than good.
It's a shame he didn't accompany this unilateral declaration with a pledge to expedite the vaccination of Australians under 16, initiate a speedy program to help states and territories improve ventilation in schools, and deliver a genuine legislative solution to enable employers to mandate vaccinations for employees. And told us how vigilant we'll have to be about warding off the virus once our freedoms return.
Running right through the pandemic has been the question about what our society is for and how much we should sacrifice for each other. Soon we're going to find out how many of our people we're willing to surrender to the mortuary or the horrors of long COVID so the rest of us can live outside our "cave". We could use a national leader to help us with that.

Full text: Also at stake is the trust between levels of government and a creeping loss of community respect for those who are supposed to serve them. The national cabinet was created as a measure to cross party divides and bring together all states and the federal government. But, rather than create cohesion and promote co-operation, the national cabinet has exposed the limits to federal authority and highlighted the hubris and excesses of state leaders who default to state of origin politics over genuine leadership.
With the nation’s two most populous states in lockdown, businesses shut and workers on government emergency support, the evidence is that, rather than coming together, political opponents are moving further apart. Victorian Premier Daniel Andrews is blaming NSW publicly for the rising number of Covid cases in his state. “If we could send it (the virus) back to NSW we would,” he said on Tuesday. Queensland and Western Australia, where case numbers are low, are questioning the strategy already agreed at national cabinet to lift restrictions once the number of vaccinations reaches 70 or 80 per cent.
As leaders squabble over border closures and the way ahead, the public is starting to show where it stands. A survey by the Institute of Public Affairs shows that 37 per cent of people want restrictions ended as soon as possible and a further 34 per cent want them ended when vaccine thresholds are met. Just 10 per cent of people think we should stay in lockdown until everyone (including children) is vaccinated. The research found only 13 per cent of respondents believed Australia should continue to pursue a “Covid zero” eradication strategy, and 62 per cent believed it was unlikely Covid-19 would ever be permanently eradicated in Australia.
The federal government is using Doherty Institute modelling to build the case to reopen, arguing elimination is a failed strategy. On Monday, Doherty Institute director Sharon Lewin said reopening with the large case numbers was still valid at 70 to 80 per cent vaccination rates. In a separate statement, the institute said: “Once we reach 70 per cent vaccine coverage, opening up at tens or hundreds of cases nationally per day is possible; however, we will need vigilant public health interventions with higher caseloads.”
Former Labor leader Bill Shorten made a welcome intervention on Tuesday, expressing a personal view that there couldn’t be a return to zero Covid-19 cases after lockdowns were lifted and nominating an 80 per cent vaccination rate as a threshold for reopening. Incumbent Labor leader Anthony Albanese is still indulging in the politics of blame, criticising the government for the slow vaccine rollout. But opposition health spokesman Mark Butler says the federal ALP supports “the idea that we get vaccination rates up to a point where we can see life starting to return to normal. Australians need an end to these constant debilitating lockdowns.”
Citizens are voting with their feet, and arms, with vaccination rates of 215 a minute. As Dennis Shanahan wrote on Tuesday, after weeks of damaging attacks for the delayed vaccine rollout, criticism from both extremes about liberty and freedom, and facing blame-shifting from the premiers for outbreaks, Scott Morrison is seizing the relative recent success of vaccinations accelerating and the proximity of reaching target vaccination levels of 70 and 80 per cent to launch his own campaign. Shanahan says it is a pivotal political moment for the Morrison government and the fate of the national economy. As Paul Kelly writes on Wednesday, the transition will be high risk but the Prime Minister and Josh Frydenberg must lead the country away from a futile hermit island fate. All leaders must rise above politics to make a decision on how we are going to move forward as a nation into the post-lockdown world.

Scott Morrison snaps at Albanese for undermining national vaccination plan

Full text: Amid pressure from his state counterparts, the prime minister has sought to rewrite the narrative and put the national focus on the plan to progressively reopen the nation once a 70 per cent vaccination target is reached.
But in question time on Tuesday, Opposition Leader Anthony Albanese was keen to remind the prime minister of his vaccine rollout blunders.
“Isn’t the reason vaccination rates are not higher is because the prime minister failed to order enough vaccines when it counted and failed also to fix national quarantine?” Mr Albanese asked.
“It is so important that people stand up for the plan rather than standing in the way of the plan, Mr Speaker, like those in the Labor Party seem intent on doing,” Mr Morrison replied.
The niggling between the two leaders continued, but Mr Morrison finally snapped when asked if he had failed his job as prime minister.
“Would Australia be closer to reopening if the prime minister had not failed his two jobs on vaccine and quarantine?” the Labor leader asked.
“Anyone who thinks the prime minister of this country only has two jobs isn’t up to the job,” he hit back.
“I can say that because those of us who have been dealing with one of the most serious situations that we have had to address during our time in government and that is to seek the evacuation of what has almost been 1700 people out of Kabul right now.
“They would understand that a prime minister at any given time has more than two jobs.”
His answer resulted in the intervention of Speaker Tony Smith, who chided the prime minister and cautioned him to stick to the topic of the question.
Before returning to the dispatch box, an inaudible interjection from Mr Albanese caused the prime minister to bite back.
“I note the aghast by the leader of the opposition with his interjection, Mr Speaker. This is a leader of the opposition who always hopes for the worst,” he said.
Australia’s road map to Covid-19 normal has come under threat after Western Australia and Queensland expressed their concerns with the modelling undertaken by the Doherty Institute.
Both Mark McGowan and Annastacia Palaszczuk have indicated they intend to keep their borders shut to stop the virus from seeping in from NSW.
The prime minister, facing a splintering of national cabinet, has turned his attention to warming Australians to the idea we must live with Covid-19, not in fear of it.
“The national plan provides the safety for Australians to move forward, out of the lockdowns,” he told parliament.
“It enables them to see their ability to live with the virus in the future … We need to support and stick to that plan, not stand in the way.”
Earlier, the prime minister issued a rallying cry to his coalition colleagues in a joint party room meeting.
He said he supported lockdowns as long as they were required, but once Australia reached the next phase of the national plan, lockdowns would do more harm than good.
Deputy prime minister Barnaby Joyce echoed Mr Morrison, telling the room the government needed to be honest with the public and acknowledge people will die due to Covid-19 when the nation reopens.

Mystery cases hit Victoria's hopes

Full text: A fourfold rise in mystery COVID-19 cases in the past week and hundreds of infected children are dimming any prospect of restrictions being eased on schedule early next month as Premier Daniel Andrews rules out a NSW-style plan to vaccinate the state's way out of lockdown.
In the past seven days, almost 70 Victorians have been infected without knowing how they picked up the virus, up from 17 the previous week.
Some of these cases were linked after further investigation, but epidemiologists believe that the number of cases not immediately able to be connected is a sign of an uncontrolled outbreak.
A state government source, speaking anonymously so as to make predictions, said it was highly probable the lockdown would extend beyond September 2 because the numbers of mystery cases and of cases not in isolation were both rising.
Fewer than 45 per cent of the 381 cases recorded in the past seven days were infectious in the community, compared with about 51 per cent of the 133 cases recorded the previous week. Mr Andrews has consistently said almost all new cases need to be in isolation before a lockdown can be eased.
Authorities are also increasingly concerned about the number of young children being infected. More than a fifth of Victoria's 494 active cases are aged under 10 and 100 more are between 10 and 19.
Victoria's COVID-19 response commander, Jeroen Weimar, said yesterday that a coronavirus-positive child vomited and collapsed at school. "And then we go to the house and we realise a number of people in the household are positive ... It's a very, very young age profile," he said.
Despite the outbreak becoming more unwieldy by the day, Mr Andrews yesterday affirmed his commitment to driving down the number of cases infectious in the community to as close to zero as possible. He also poured cold water on the prospect of Victoria, like NSW, shifting its focus from zero cases and towards vaccination as the path out of lockdown.
Mr Andrews said he did not favour an option put forward by University of Melbourne epidemiologist Tony Blakely to move to a lighter lockdown with slightly more freedoms in acknowledgement of the difficulty of reaching zero.
Professor Blakely's modelling on the proposal, which he said would ease the mental health strain on Victorians, estimates cases would rise to about 400 a day, but vaccine coverage would curtail the spike by mid-October.
The Premier said it was unclear whether there was enough supply of vaccines to inoculate the population quickly enough for the strategy to work.
"The notion of Delta bubbling [at a controlled level] is really hard unless you've got really tough rules on. So, you start to open up and it won't be bubbling, it will be raging," he said. "The notion that we could vaccinate people as fast as the Delta virus infects people - that is not what the Doherty [Institute] modelling shows, it is not the national cabinet position."
Mr Andrews, a vocal proponent of the national cabinet reopening plan, said it was extremely unlikely lockdowns would be required when the 80 per cent vaccine target was reached, and health orders would probably only be used in specific localities.
Countries with high vaccination rates, such as Israel and England, continue to record high daily case totals as the virus reaches unvaccinated populations and vaccine immunity wanes.
NSW recorded 818 cases yesterday, the second day on which the new-case tally topped 800, and three deaths. About 700 cases had an unknown source and Premier Gladys Berejiklian announced her target of 6 million jabs by the end of the month would be beaten by a week.
Masks are now mandatory outdoors across NSW. People who live in 12 local government areas in Sydney's south and west have been placed under a 9pm-to-5am curfew and are allowed to leave home for only one hour of exercise a day.
Transmission of the more infectious Delta variant among children is a concern for health authorities given that hospitalisations are higher than for other variants globally.
But doctors say there is no robust evidence it is causing greater disease severity or higher rates of cases in intensive care or deaths in children. Data from Canada released two weeks ago suggests a 2.75 times greater risk of children aged under nine being admitted to hospital with Delta.
Asked about Mr Weimar's comments regarding an infected child collapsing and vomiting, infectious diseases paediatrician Robert Booy said parents needed "reassurance not alarm".
He said while COVID-19 was a respiratory disease, gastrointestinal symptoms such as nausea, diarrhoea and vomiting were common in infected children.
"It's a virus that can affect the whole body, so the occasional child will get sick and develop symptoms whether they be respiratory or gastrointestinal," the University of Sydney academic said.
Professor Booy said most children would signal their illness in the morning and be kept home from school or their parents would notice their illness. "Very few cases of coronavirus in children end up in hospital and very few need intensive care. Of the almost thousand COVID deaths in Australia, none have been children," he said.
"Parents are understandably anxious and we really need to be reassuring them about exactly how COVID behaves in children."
Authorities are urging Victorians to stop cancelling or not showing up to their vaccine appointments. About 10,000 of these incidents are occurring each day, with the cause believed to be Prime Minister Scott Morrison's announcement last week that the Pfizer vaccine would be available for people aged between 16 and 39 by the end of the month.
Of yesterday's 71 cases in Victoria, 14 were linked to the Shepparton outbreak, 10 were related to the Newport cluster, eight were associated with the MyCentre childcare centre in Broadmeadows and five were linked to the Royal Melbourne Hospital, where hundreds of staff have been sidelined because they were exposed to the virus.
Twenty-four staff at St Vincent's Hospital in Melbourne are now isolating after potentially being exposed to a patient with COVID-19 last week.
Mr Weimar said the virus had spread into areas including Essendon West, Camberwell, Thornbury, Fitzroy North, Maidstone and Sorrento.
He urged younger men in Newport, Altona and Altona North linked to local gyms and sporting clubs to get tested.
He was keen to give hope to Victorians that following the rules could lead to stay-at-home orders being lifted as planned on September 2, saying: "We have pulled down six, seven outbreaks now in the last eight months, so collectively as a Victorian community we can absolutely do that. We can cap rising cases and get it down."
But La Trobe University epidemiologist Associate Professor Hasan Vally said contact tracers were not ahead of the outbreak and authorities would probably not regain control by September 2. He said growing vaccine coverage would soon start to reduce the level of transmission but this would still be weeks away.
Professor Adrian Esterman, an epidemiologist from the University of South Australia, said it was too soon to tell if the state government had a handle on the latest outbreak.

Children are at risk from Delta

Full text: Questions of global equity were invoked to stall vaccinating kids even though this argument never influenced ours or anyone else’s vaccine procurement decisions. We know that the social, emotional and physical wellbeing of children is linked to in-school learning yet we are told that layered measures should be instituted, with vaccination conspicuously absent. Kids were poor transmitters, until a Canadian study performed pre-Delta showed otherwise, with very young kids 0-3 years more likely to transmit to household members than adolescents.
The Australian Technical Advisory Group on Immunisation was in lockstep with the UK in limiting vaccination to vulnerable kids on August 2, intending to rule on the rest in the “coming months”. Research on children has been biased by lower testing rates, often due to milder symptoms in them, cyclical lockdowns that have shielded them from infection and scientific judgment set like cement predating the emergence of Delta.
The deprioritisation of children meant that under-17s were excluded from the Doherty Institute modelling and the government’s four-phase roadmap out of Covid released on July 30. This is despite many high-income countries cracking on, vaccinating 12 to 17-year-olds, including the US, Canada, Israel, Singapore, Germany, France, Japan, Ireland plus Mexico and Indonesia.
However, the bellwether has sounded with Delta. The UK is seeing on average 53 children hospitalised a day coinciding with a surge in schools over July. The US reported the highest number of hospitalisations in 12 months (1902 as of August 14), with ICUs at capacity in big states. Experienced US paediatricians declare “I’ve never seen anything like it”.
In a sign of this evolving crisis, the American Academy of Paediatrics on August 9 urged the US Food and Drug Administration to fast-track vaccine approvals by shortening follow up from six to two months in the trials that are under way for children under 12. In fact, throughout the pandemic the highest rate (per 100,000 population) of hospitalisations has been in very young children 0-4 years compared to 4-17-year-olds, possibly reflecting an abundance of caution in not sending sick littlies home. The pandemic of the unvaccinated is the pandemic of the innocent. What happens to the children in Australia when we open up with 70 or 80 per cent of the adult population vaccinated?
Pre-Delta, Covid in the majority of children was mild but 0.14 per cent (about one in 700) will develop a severe illness that affects multiple organ systems. Called Multisystem Inflammatory System in Children (MIS-C or PIMS-TS in the UK), it lags two to four weeks after a bout of Covid, and has affected 4404 children in the US (until July 30), with half aged five to 13 years. White children account for 30 per cent of cases while non-white children dominate, suggesting that structural disadvantages (the “same storm, different boats” analogy) are a factor, a pattern mirrored in the UK. A detailed report of 46 children (median age 10) from London’s Great Ormond Street Hospital is a harrowing read. Ventilatory and blood pressure support was needed in 35 per cent and 48 per cent of cases, respectively; heavy-duty immune modifying medications in 87 per cent. At six months, most organ dysfunction had resolved, 98 per cent were back at school but with significant deconditioning. Nearly half could not walk for six minutes.
Long Covid in kids has attracted considerable study, but yielded no breakthrough treatments. UK guidelines define it as persistent symptoms lasting four weeks or more after the acute infection. Early evidence suggested it affected 8 to 10 per cent of children but it may be lower at 4 to 5 per cent. A recent study of 1734 children aged 5-17 years in the UK (pre-Delta, March 2020 to February 2021), found a prevalence of one in 20 or 4.4 per cent. The most common symptoms were fatigue, headache and loss of smell reported by four in five. Resolution by eight weeks was reported in 98 per cent, which sounds reassuring, right? However, the most recent survey by the UK’s Office for National Statistics suggests that a staggering 34,000 children (a third being 2-11-year-olds) have long Covid and it affects daily activities in 22,000 – hardly rare or trivial. In the UK, long Covid has spawned a consumer-led advocacy group with nodes in Ireland, the US and Canada; an announcement of 100 million pounds ($190M) towards 15 long Covid paediatric clinics and $US1 billion in research investment by the US National Institutes of Health. Experts can split hairs over its true prevalence but the verdict is in, Covid is serious in children with lifelong impacts unknown.
What we know about Covid is growing but it pales next to what we don’t know. The first report of a 14-year-old girl with easy fatigability and a markedly raised heart rate in response to mild exercise, seven months after Covid, uncovered micro-sized blood clots and inflammation in her lungs needing prolonged treatment with potent anti-inflammatory drugs and blood thinners. What about long-term neurocognitive or behavioural problems?
A national study in the UK of children and adolescents (median age nine, pre-Delta) found a remarkably high incidence of neurological or psychiatric manifestations (for example, seizures, movement disorders, psychosis, Guillain Barre-like disorders) affecting four in 100 hospitalised kids - four times higher than in hospitalised adults. One third were discharged with a disability. Experts now hypothesise that a chronic smell deficit may be a harbinger of long-term neurodegenerative disease because nerves in the nose are an entry point for the virus to the brain.
A landmark study analysing the brains of eight adults who died of Covid revealed features of neuronal distress and impaired signalling in the cortex, responsible for decision making, memory and reasoning, similar to Alzheimer’s and Parkinson’s disease. The researchers postulated that body-wide inflammation was tripping off inflammation in the brain and this may explain the neurocognitive problems of long Covid-like brain fog, memory deficits and inattention seen in both children and adults.
Infections in kids correlates with high community transmission so suppression is a priority until we get reliable vaccine supply for kids. When it comes to vaccination, children are antibody factories generating high responses in the Pfizer and Moderna trials. Since its approval on May 10, Pfizer has been administered to nearly nine million US adolescents 12-17 years. Heart inflammation (i.e. myocarditis, pericarditis, myopericarditis) is more common in boys than girls at 62.8 vs 4.2 cases per million after second doses, but runs a benign course according to the US CDC. For boys 12-17 years, the CDC concluded that for every million second doses, 56-69 cases of heart inflammation are expected but vaccination prevents 5700 infections, 215 hospitalisations, 71 ICU admissions and two deaths, notwithstanding commensurate reductions in long Covid and MIS-C.
Throughout this pandemic risk has been conflated with likelihood when it is actually a combination of likelihood and impact. Furthermore, low risk is not no risk. Parents implicitly understand this, which is why millions have consented to vaccinating their children, balancing the short, medium and long-term risks, known and unknown, of Covid against vaccination. They also understand that mortality and non-mortality outcomes akin to death and disability in children carries an intergenerational trauma that reverberates through time – a bereavement of no return.
This is a vaccine-preventable disease. The government needs to give parents and children certainty and articulate how they intend to make schools safe. Children have agency, so should be engaged in this dialogue with parents, providers and policy makers. Like adults, they have endured the direct and indirect effects of lockdowns with lives interrupted and facing a legacy that is unwritten. Lets not add the complications of Covid to their ledger.

Full text: The nation’s chief medical officer says a surge in Covid-19 cases should have little impact on the road map out of the pandemic as Queensland became the latest state to threaten to keep its borders closed even when the 80 per cent vaccine target was achieved.
Initial advice to chief medical officer Paul Kelly from ­experts at the Doherty Institute shows high case numbers in NSW and growing infection levels in Victoria should not derail the national recovery road map.
National cabinet will this week be given updated modelling from the institute’s researchers about how reopening plans will be ­affected by record infections – 830 on Sunday – in NSW and rising case numbers in Victoria.
Josh Frydenberg said lockdowns could not continue indefinitely, and a rapidly increasing vaccination rate should ease restrictions.
“I have taken many a call from state and territory treasurers wanting commonwealth economic assistance as they endured lockdowns … every time we have been forthcoming providing income support,” the Treasurer said.
“But our emergency economic support is not indefinite and nor should lockdowns be. This is why all governments must stick to the plan agreed at national cabinet.” Mr Frydenberg’s comments come amid a deepening row ­between state leaders and the federal government over the easing of restrictions and an exit from lockdowns once the vaccination rate reaches 80 per cent.
Under the Doherty Institute road map, lockdowns would be less likely but possible and restrictions would be eased on inoculated residents once vaccination coverage reaches 70 per cent. At 80 per cent, there would only be “highly targeted lockdowns”, it says.
Queensland and Western Australia, however, have distanced themselves from the targets, blaming the rise in NSW case numbers since the modelling was first made public late last month.
“We’re signed up and committed to the plan that national cabinet endorsed, but that was a plan that was endorsed before the NSW outbreak,” Queensland Deputy Premier Steven Miles said, adding the border with NSW would not necessarily reopen even if vaccinations reached 80 per cent.
Scott Morrison on Sunday said it was “highly unlikely” Australia would ever see the end of new cases. “You can’t live with lockdowns forever, and at some point you need to make that gear change. And that is done at 70 per cent because that’s where, we’re advised from the medical science, that you can make that gear change,” Mr Morrison said.
“Once you do that, then you can move into focusing on the public health issues of hospitalisation and serious illness. Case numbers are not the whole story.” Dr Kelly said he had discussed the rise in cases with the Doherty Institute’s lead researcher, Jodie McVernon, who indicated there would be no need for a major rewrite of the road map.
“The model itself remains the same, it is a tweak to the assumption. Does this need to go back to the drawing board? Absolutely not,” Dr Kelly said.
He said the modelling had factored in the potential for the exponential spread of the virus, and its research was being updated to ­reflect a starting point with high rates of transmission. “They are doing that modelling again now, but on first principles, that same effect you have at 70 and 80 per cent would be the same ­effect, it would minimise the number of people in ICU particularly and in hospitalisation,” Dr Kelly said.
However, Professor McVernon, the director of epidemiology at the Doherty Institute, warned it was not possible to have a “freedom day” with high caseloads. She told Sky News restrictions would need to be eased gradually.
“We were set up for a situation where caseloads would be small, that any outbreak would be ­managed; obviously, we were not envisaging shifting from Phase A to Phase B from a situation of lockdown, which is where we are now,” she said.
Professor McVernon said the institute was undertaking “parallel” work to learn how public health measures could be eased in an environment with high vaccination rates and high Covid-19 transmission.
There were 196,000 doses administered on Saturday, with 1.4 million vaccinations over the past four days. Queensland is not the only state to have broken ranks by disputing the national plan that requires an end to lockdowns when vaccination rates reached 70 to 80 per cent.
ACT Chief Minister Andrew Barr on Sunday said lockdowns may still be necessary at 80 per cent and he would personally aim for much higher vaccination rates for Canberrans.
“We need to be very clear this broadbrush language of opening up should not be taken to mean there will be no public health directions, no public health settings and nothing in place to support the unvaccinated,” he said. Mr Barr warned the 70 to 80 per cent target was put in “as an important protection” against NSW “at the request of a number of states and territories” to prevent the Berejiklian government from opening up “ahead of the rest of the nation”.
The Palaszczuk government stepped away from easing border restrictions when national vaccination rates reach 80 per cent, declaring the figure was agreed to before the latest NSW outbreak.
WA Premier Mark McGowan has also accused NSW of failing to get its case numbers under control.
“There’s an Australia outside of NSW and we’re all doing our best to keep the virus out, and we’re following the national plan … Victoria is doing everything it can to crush and kill the virus, the ACT is doing everything it can to crush and kill the virus,” he said.
But NSW Health Minister Brad Hazzard said restrictions and border closures were not a long-term solution to dealing with the coronavirus.
“Delta has shown itself to be capable of getting into every nation and part of every nation across the world. At some point, that will occur,” Mr Hazzard said on Sunday.

Steven Miles says deal to ease restrictions and lockdowns endorsed before NSW outbreak

Full text: Deputy Premier Steven Miles says Queensland may not open its border to NSW even when vaccination rates hit 80 per cent, while he insisted the four-stage plan for easing restrictions based by vaccination rates was “endorsed before the NSW outbreak”.
But Prime Minister Scott Morrison said a zero-Covid Australia was “highly unlikely” and insisted the number of cases in the community, particularly NSW and Victoria, had no bearing on the plan Premiers agreed to on easing restrictions on Australians.
National cabinet will receive an updated briefing from Doherty Institute this Friday, with federal government sources saying Premiers were misinterpreting the modelling.
A Federal Government spokesman said the findings were clear about what would happen when the nation reached 70 per cent and 80 per cent vaccination rates.
“We can move forward with our reopening plan because there will be far less serious illness for our health system to manage,” he said.
While the modelling used 30 Covid cases in an outbreak in its projections, the exponential growth of the virus spread means that having an outbreak with hundreds of cases a day will have limited impact on the overall outcomes.
Announcing another day of zero cases for Queensland, Mr Miles said the states had agreed to a relaxation of rules under the Doherty research at a time when case numbers were very different.
“We’re signed up and committed to the plan that national cabinet endorsed but that was a plan that was endorsed before the NSW outbreak,” he said.
He said people who interpreted the Doherty research as meaning that the whole country would open up at 80 per cent vaccination were verballing that research.
“Nobody signed up to that plan,” he said.
“We signed up to a plan that said at 70 per cent lockdown would be much less likely, and at 80 per cent they would likely only need to be very targeted.”
But Mr Morrison said lockdowns were not a sustainable way to deal with the virus.
“As we go forward, once you get over 70 per cent and particularly over 80 per cent, lockdowns do more harm than good,” he told the ABC.
“At 80 per cent, we know from the work that you can start treating Covid like other infectious diseases with those other basic precautions in place. That‘s what living with the virus looks like.”
Doherty Institute researcher Jodie McVernon said the Doherty report did not specifically address the NSW situation, where a state would be coming down off high caseloads.
“What our modelling found that as vaccination coverage increases vaccination does much more of the heavy lifting of the public health response,” she said.
“We’re also saying very clearly that unless those targets are achieved at some population level … if we have patchy uptake or we have groups who are left behind, then we will continue to see outbreaks.
“In that situation, public health response teams will need to do what keeps the population safe.”
Queensland’s Deputy chief health officer Dr James Smith said vaccination rates weren’t the only thing authorities would monitor.
“We do need to dial up and down in terms of restrictions in place, because it‘s not all about vaccinations, even though vaccinations are very important and vaccination is the biggest tool in our shed really,” he said.
Meanwhile, Opposition Leader David Crisafulli called for a greater push to dispel anti-vax messaging in the community and online.
He said all of the state government advertising has focused on promoting the past or the economic plan.
“I’m not sure we’ve spent enough focusing on the importance of vaccines and the importance of why we need to be on a path to get back to normality. That’s the sort of advertising campaign I want to see.”
He said there was a “certain element of people spreading mistruths”.
“Let’s push back and let’s show why vaccines are safe, let’s show why vaccines are important,” Mr Crisafulli said.
“Let’s use every channel we can, let’s use every sensible voice we can to get the message out.”

Full text: THE PANDEMIC An Insider's Plague Year Peter Doherty Melbourne University Press, $32.99
Australian Nobel laureate and viral immunologist Professor Peter Doherty is the David Attenborough of the COVID-19 pandemic. His knowledgeable, humble, passionate, honest and frequently humorous commentary in the media, on social media and online has been the narrative so many needed to make sense of a world in turmoil.
To read Doherty's latest book, An Insider's Plague Year, is to absorb that narrative in condensed form. It bundles together the articles Doherty has typed from his Melbourne home since SARS-CoV-2 first reared its spiky head in December 2019, organised into a roughly linear thread that finishes in February 2021.
It's an odd feeling as a reader because we are reading his questioning, prophesying words from a future that Doherty speculates about - pretty accurately too - but that at the time had not yet come to pass.
What makes this a fascinating read is that Doherty is not just an eminent scientist whose career-defining achievement was to discover how a type of immune cell called a T-cell eliminates virus-infected cells (for which he won a Nobel prize); he's also a great communicator, prolific writer, and has a genuine and infectious love of all knowledge.
Doherty had a unique vantage point during the pandemic. At the end of 2019, he had planned to fade quietly away from the scientific front line, which he says is the best thing an "eminent old scientist" can do. Then COVID-19 happened.
But instead of inserting himself back into the laboratory, Doherty felt he had more to offer as a science communicator, to help take the pressure off the working scientists at the Doherty Institute. So he started a new career as a "junior journalist", participating in regular meetings with the institute's front-line scientists and working with the communications and media team.
The book ranges widely across history (of science, of course), science (immunology and vaccinology in particular), society, politics and even climate change, as Doherty explores not just the science of the pandemic, but the context in which it is taking place and the future it will shape.
The book is organised into three sections. The first short section looks at the start of the pandemic, from late 2019 to March 2020, and how the groundwork was laid for the Doherty Institute to become the leading scientific reference point for government policy - a role it still plays, as evidenced by the recent modelling report that has informed the government's latest road map to a post-COVID Australia.
The second section, which makes up most of the book, is a collection of weekly columns he wrote - and continues to write (he's up to his 69th column) - for the Doherty Institute website, under the title Setting it Straight. These columns are the narrative of the COVID-19 pandemic: Doherty applying his in-depth understanding of infection and immunology to a problem that is evolving. Some columns are much more technical than others. Even as someone who has reported in depth on this pandemic, there are some deep dives into immunology that require the intellectual equivalent of a deep-sea submersible.
Thankfully, Doherty has a knack for quirky metaphors, which he employs to help walk the reader through the complexity of the immune system and its interactions with the SARS-CoV-2 virus.
These columns could be described as "everything you ever wanted to know about immunology but were too afraid to ask". They have the detail of a textbook, but are far more engaging and relevant in how they tie back to the virus that has dominated our world for more than 18 months.
There are also excellent chapters on vaccine development and on how drug-regulatory systems work, which could hopefully allay some concerns about the speed of development and deployment of these life-saving innovations during the pandemic.
The final section is a short collection of essays and articles written about the future, the importance of science communication, and a biography of the Doherty Institute during the pandemic that feels like an attempt to name and give credit to the many staff who have worked tirelessly throughout.
Doherty is a hero to many. So, who are his heroes in this world-changing event? The dedication reveals who he holds in the highest esteem - "the front-line healthcare professionals across the planet who have given their all through this pandemic".

These columns are the narrative of the COVID-19 pandemic: Doherty applying his in-depth understanding of infection and immunology to a problem that is evolving. Some columns are much more technical than others. Even as someone who has reported in depth on this pandemic, there are some deep dives into immunology that require the intellectual equivalent of a deep-sea submersible.
Thankfully, Doherty has a knack for quirky metaphors, which he employs to help walk the reader through the complexity of the immune system and its interactions with the SARS-CoV-2 virus.
These columns could be described as "everything you ever wanted to know about immunology but were too afraid to ask". They have the detail of a textbook, but are far more engaging and relevant in how they tie back to the virus that has dominated our world for more than 18 months.
There are also excellent chapters on vaccine development and on how drug-regulatory systems work, which could hopefully allay some concerns about the speed of development and deployment of these life-saving innovations during the pandemic.
The final section is a short collection of essays and articles written about the future, the importance of science communication, and a biography of the Doherty Institute during the pandemic that feels like an attempt to name and give credit to the many staff who have worked tirelessly throughout.
Doherty is a hero to many. So, who are his heroes in this world-changing event? The dedication reveals who he holds in the highest esteem - "the front-line healthcare professionals across the planet who have given their all through this pandemic".

Full text: More than half the eligible population has now had one dose of Covid-19 vaccine, as Australia’s vaccination rollout picks up pace
Covid-19 vaccinations will be available to all Australians over the age of 16 from August 30, with 16 to 39-year-olds joining the rollout.
NSW hits new peak of 681 cases, and regional NSW lockdown is extended until Aug 28. Victoria has recorded 57 new community acquired cases of coronavirus. The ACT’s 16 new infections take their total to 83.
The Morrison government has written to every nursing home ­operator in Australia warning that it will not extend the September 17 deadline for all staff to be vaccinated, despite about 100,000 workers not yet having had a jab.

AFP 11.30pm: Biden will get booster shot
Joe Biden says he and his wife, Jill, will get a Covid-19 vaccine booster shot, with the extra dose becoming available to all US adults from next month.
“We’re gonna get the booster shots,” the US President told ABC News in an interview that aired on Thursday.
Noting that he and the first lady had received their original vaccine back around the start of this year, Mr Biden said “it’s past time”.
With fears that the coronavirus vaccines may be wearing off and even more infectious strains like the Delta virus emerging, Mr Biden earlier announced that all American adults will be able to get a booster shot eight months after their last vaccination.
The boosters will become available in the week of September 20.

James Madden 10.45pm: News chief urges bosses to champion the rollout
News Corp Australasia boss ­Michael Miller has penned an open letter to the country’s business leaders and owners, calling on them to champion the vaccination rollout as part of an urgent nationwide effort to “get Australia working again”.
Mr Miller, the media group’s executive chairman, warned that Australia was “falling behind”, with the country lacking a “clear path forward”.
“We have to urgently rediscover our Australian sense of purpose and unity, and show the world what a fully vaccinated, fully functioning nation can achieve,” he wrote in the letter.
“People who have already ­endured so much disruption and upheaval do not deserve to be kept in a state of isolation and uncertainty without a clear path forward. They, and the organisations they are part of, the schools they attend, the companies they work for, have to be able to get back to work as quickly as possible.
“Business is crucial to this success. The engine room of the economy cannot be stuck in suspended animation for a moment longer than necessary.”
Mr Miller said News Corp, publisher of The Australian, was actively encouraging and helping all its staff to get vaccinated as quickly as possible, adding: “We encourage all other businesses ­regardless of size or sector to take the same approach.

Greg Bearup, Paige Taylor 10pm: Regions pay price for city drug dash
Patient zero had form. It is believed the man who brought the pandemic to the NSW Central West – an outbreak that has grown to 169 – was a dealer returning from Sydney with a stash of drugs.
According to several sources in Dubbo, the man travelled to the Sydney suburb of Mount Druitt to pick up a package of amphetamines – where he was also infected with the virus – and that he then returned to Dubbo.
Early last week he was arrested in Dubbo on an outstanding warrant and taken to Bathurst jail, where he was held overnight. He was released the next morning and travelled 649km to Walgett on Monday, August 9, apparently stopping briefly at Dubbo along the way.
While he was in Bathurst jail he underwent a regulation Covid-19 test. The positive result was not known until after he was released from jail.
“If he’d not been arrested and tested things could be much, much worse than they are now,” a source in Dubbo said. “He could have been out in the community for many more days before it was discovered.”
As it is, things are bad enough. This one case has led to more than 60 children being infected and locked down regional NSW as cases spread west to Broken Hill and north to Bourke. Western NSW Local Health District chief executive Scott McLachlan said the majority of the new cases were infectious while in the community. However, as contract tracers do their work, the number of positive cases who were infectious in the community is declining each day.

Jess Malcolm 9.20pm: New Victorian exposure sites
Victorian health authorities have announced a string of new exposure sities after cases ballooned by 57 on Thursday.
A bus between North Williamstown Railway Station and Newport Railway station has been listed as a Tier 1 site after a positive case caught the bus on August 11.
A McDonalds and Shell Coles Express in Lilydale have been added as Tier 2 sites, along with the Pacific Werribee Shopping Centre car park in Hoppers Crossing. Soul Origin cafe and Sushi Jiro in the same suburb were also deemed Tier 2 sites.
A busy Woolworths and 7-Eleven store in St Kilda were listed as Tier 3 sites, asking visitors to monitor for symptoms and get tested if they arise.
The Laverton metro train line was also exposed between Newport Station and Southern Cross Station on August 11 as a Tier 2 site.
AFP 8.40pm: Iran deaths top 100,000
Recorded deaths from Covid in Iran passed the 100,000 mark on Thursday, the health ministry said, amid tighter restrictions nationwide to contain the spread of the virus.
In the past 24 hours, 31,266 people tested positive for coronavirus and 564 died, the ministry said. That brought total infections since the pandemic started to 4,587,683, and deaths to 100,255.

AFP 8pm: Pfizer declines faster than AZ: study
The effectiveness of the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine against Covid-19 declines faster than that of the AstraZeneca jab, according to a study published on Thursday.
“Two doses of Pfizer-BioNTech have greater initial effectiveness against new COVID-19 infections, but this declines faster compared with two doses of Oxford-AstraZeneca,” researchers at Oxford University said.
The study, which has not been peer reviewed, is based on the results of a survey by Britain’s Office for National Statistics that carried out PCR tests from December last year to this month on randomly selected households.
It found that “the dynamics of immunity following second doses differed significantly” between Pfizer and AstraZeneca, according to the university’s Nuffield Department of Medicine.
Pfizer had “greater initial effectiveness” but saw “faster declines in protection against high viral burden and symptomatic infection”, when looking at a period of several months after full vaccination, although rates remained low for both jabs.
“Results suggest that after four to five months effectiveness of these two vaccines would be similar,” the scientists added, while stressing that long-term effects need to be studied.
The study’s findings come as Israel is administering booster shots, after giving 58 per cent of the population two shots of the Pfizer jab.
The US is also set to offer booster vaccines to boost antibody levels following concerns over declining effectiveness of the Pfizer and Moderna vaccines.
The Oxford research also found protection was higher among those who had already been infected with the virus.
The study examined two groups of more than 300,000 people over 18, first during the period dominated by the Alpha variant, which emerged in Kent, southeast England, and secondly from May 2021 onwards, when the Delta variant has been dominant.
It confirmed that vaccines are less effective against Delta, which was first seen in India.
The AstraZeneca vaccine is the most widely offered in the UK, while those under 40 are offered Pfizer or Moderna due to blood clotting concerns.

Jess Malcolm 7.20pm: PM pledges a family Christmas
Scott Morrison has promised all Australians will be reunited by Christmas, despite suggestions some states would keep their borders closed even after high vaccination rates are achieved.
The Prime Minister said all states and territories had agreed to 70 and 80 per cent vaccination targets set by the Doherty Institute modelling. But WA Premier Mark McGowan has said the modelling would not necessarily change his approach.
Mr Morrison said WA had some “work to do” to get up to speed with the other states’ vaccination coverage, but insisted families would be together by the end of the year.
“That commitment was made by all the states and territories and when in your own state, if there are 70 or 80 per cent who are vaccinated, you are less of a risk to themselves and contracting the virus of transmitting it,” he told Nine’s A Current Affair on Thursday night.
“When they get to that level it is a very reasonable expectation that the leaders will follow through on the commitments they made. Let’s see what happens.”
Mr Morrison also said the federal government was leaving “no stone unturned” in its attempts to secure more vaccines, but celebrated the record high vaccination rates today.
“It really ramps up now over the next few months but we’re already achieving rates three times the number of people you can put on in the MCG in one day...That is an extraordinary outcome,” he said.
“It’s not how you start the race, it’s how you finish it and we’re finishing it very well.”

Jess Malcolm 6.38pm: Football stadium construction worker tests positive
The Sydney Football Stadium construction site at Moore Park has been shut down after a worker tested positive to Covid-19.
An Infrastructure NSW spokesperson said officials had been notified of a positive case on Thursday and made the decision to close the site pending further advice.
“We have been notified of a worker at the Sydney Football Stadium redevelopment site has tested positive to Covid-19,” an Infrastructure NSW spokesperson said.
“The worker is currently in isolation and we are working closely with John Holland and NSW Health to ensure the safety of workers and the community.
“As a precautionary measure, the decision has been made to close the site pending further advice.”
Chris Merritt 6.26pm: Melbourne curfew heading for the courts
When Premier Dan Andrews imposed this week’s curfew on Melbourne, barrister Vanessa Plain started receiving phone calls. Within days, it was clear that this curfew, like its predecessor, was heading for court.
Plain has received preliminary instructions for a legal challenge and it is easy to see why. Along with fellow barrister Jason Harkness she was part of the team led by Marcus Clarke QC that came close to victory last year when they challenged an earlier curfew.
They ran that case, known as Loielo v Giles, not because they wanted to imperil public health but for reasons that are hard to fault: during an emergency everyone needs to comply with the law.

Jess Malcolm 6.00pm: Fresh public health alert for NSW venues
NSW Health has issued a fresh public health alert for venues exposed to Covid-19.
Anyone who visited the Woolworths Raymond Terrace on Wednesday August 8 between 7.20am to 10.50am must get tested and isolate until they receive further advice from NSW Health.
Anyone who attended the following venues at the times listed is a close contact and must get tested and isolate for 14 days:
Summer House Backpackers Newtown on Thursday August 12 and Friday August 13 all day.
Burger Urge in Dubbo on Saturday August 14 between 6.45pm to 7pm.
Catie McLeod 5.45pm: BREAKING: Sydney unit block in hard lockdown
An apartment block in one of southwestern Sydney’s Covid-19 hot spots has gone into lockdown amid an outbreak.
Nine people from five different apartments have tested positive in the 12-unit block on Hill Street, Campsie, with all other residents ordered to quarantine for two weeks.
At least some of the positive cases have been transferred to hotels used by the Sydney Local Health District to isolate Covid-19 patients.
Healthcare workers and police are at the apartments where a pop-up testing clinic has been established for the other residents, all of whom have been deemed close contacts.
Jess Malcolm 5.30pm: AstraZeneca changes its name to Vaxzevria
AstraZeneca has changed its brand name to Vaxzevria after it was granted approval by the Therapeutic Goods Administration.
The company hopes the brand name change will help to smooth the pathway for Australians vaccinated with domestically produced AstraZeneca to travel internationally.
Vaxzevria is the brand name already in use in Europe and the UK, approved by the European Medicines Agency and the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) in the UK.
With CSL originally using the previous name “AstraZeneca”, there was concern some countries may not recognise the Australian-produced vaccine, or that it would be seen differently to the same vaccine made overseas.

Jess Malcolm 4.58pm: Health worker jab spots taken in fraudulent vax scam
NSW Police are investigating a fraudulent vaccine scam system which saw 60 people book vaccination appointments reserved for healthcare workers last weekend.
In a statement released on Thursday afternoon, police said the bookings were made through a NSW Health link circulating through social media application WeChat, with some users required to pay a fee before attending.
Minister for Police and Emergency Services David Elliott condemned those responsible for the scam.
“I find it breathtaking how heartless and soulless this kind of scam is: it targets those who are the most fearful of the current pandemic and exploits their fears,” Mr Elliott said.
“I condemn those who think up these scams and hope the community will work with police to identify those responsible.
“In Australia you do not pay for a Covid vaccine,” he said.
NSW Police have launched Strike Force Alioth to investigate the scam, and are appealing to anyone who may have used the link to come forward.

Adeshola Ore 4.20pm: Vaccine program opens up Pfizer for young adults
Covid-19 vaccinations will be available to all Australians over the age of 16 from August 30, with 16 to 39-year-olds joining the rollout.
Prime Minister Scott Morrison said the federal government’s vaccination rollout would now be opened up to an additional 8.6 million Australians in that age group from August 30.
People under 40 are currently able to access the AstraZeneca vaccine with informed consent, but the PM’s announcement means that from August 30, Pfizer will be made available to them.
Mr Morrison warned young Australians that they were not yet able to book for a Pfizer jab.
“I want to stress, do not make a booking yet,” he said.
He said the government would announce when bookings could be made within the next week.
More than 50 per cent of Australians have now had a first dose of a Covid-19 vaccine.
Mr Morrison also said the government was taking the issue of vaccinating children seriously.
“I anticipated the ATAGI advice in an interim level to be available very soon,” he said.
Jess Malcolm 3.35pm: Australia hits 50pc single jab milestone
More than half the eligible population has now had one dose of Covid-19 vaccine, as Australia’s vaccination rollout picks up pace.
There are now 10,359,796 people who have received one dose (50.2 per cent) and 5,815,832 people fully vaccinated (28.2 per cent).
A daily record of 309,010 vaccine doses were recorded across Australia yesterday, with NSW overtaking Tasmania in first dose coverage rates.
NSW, the Northern Territory, Queensland, South Australia and West Australia all broke record numbers of doses given in the past 24 hours.
NSW had the largest daily increase, recording 132,439 vaccines administered yesterday bringing its total number to 5,518,435.

Rachel Baxendale 3.15pm: Digging down into Victoria’s mystery clusters
In recent days Victorian contact tracers have consolidated as many as a dozen clusters with no identified source of acquisition into what stands as eight key groupings as of Thursday.
Of the key groupings:
– Eight cases are linked to a West Footscray-based cluster which first emerged in a Maribyrnong man in his 20s who works at a warehouse in Derrimut;
– Two cases have been linked to a delivery truck driver who lives in Wyndham Vale in Melbourne’s outer southwest, and does not drive interstate;
– Three cases are linked to a City of Melbourne father who works at the Royal Children’s Hospital, and his son who is in Grade One at St Michael’s Primary School in North Melbourne;
There have been no new cases in the West Footscray, Wyndham Vale or City of Melbourne clusters for about a week.
– Seven cases have been linked to public housing towers at 480 and 510 Lygon Street, Carlton, including one new case on Thursday;
– 255 cases, including 44 of Thursday’s cases, have been linked to a cluster which emerged in an Al-Taqwa College teacher in her 20s and her optometrist partner, who live in Newport in Hobson’s Bay in Melbourne’s inner southwest. The partner worked at Caroline Springs Square shopping centre and played football at the Newport Football Club. A smaller cluster linked to a Melton family, as well as the Glenroy West Primary School cluster, have also been linked to the Hobson’s Bay cluster;
– Eighteen cases, most of which have not been linked to one another, are linked to the St Kilda, Middle Park and Caulfield areas. These cases include:
A person who lives in Middle Park and visited the South Melbourne Market and a string of sites in Melbourne’s inner south and southeast, as well as a case in a cleaner who lives in the City of Greater Dandenong, in Melbourne’s outer southeast, and works in Fitzroy Street, St Kilda;
Nine cases linked to a mother and her adult son from East St Kilda who attended an illegal Orthodox Jewish community engagement party last week. Three of these cases are new on Thursday;
A sex worker who is not believed to have worked while infectious, but is socially linked to a case in a City of Melbourne resident;
A case in a St Kilda resident without clear links to other cases;
– Four cases have been linked to a cluster which emerged in a teenager who works at a pizza shop in Malvern East and lives in Glen Iris. Authorities had previously grouped this cluster with the St Kilda cases, but Covid logistics chief Jeroen Weimar said on Thursday contact tracers were exploring “other potential linkages” and were no longer connecting it with St Kilda.
– 12 other cases remain under investigation. These include six of Thursday’s new cases and six from previous days. Among the 12 are:
Two linked mystery cases in Altona North residents, identified in Wednesday’s numbers;
One case in a Glenroy resident, also identified in Wednesday’s numbers;
Three cases in Thursday’s numbers spread across three households linked to previous cases from recent days. No links have been established between these households;
Thursday’s three separate mystery cases in a Glenroy resident, an Ascot Vale resident and a Doncaster resident.

Rhiannon Tuffield 3.10pm: Engaged couple and family fined thousands for party
Police have fined the organisers of an illegal engagement party in Melbourne’s southeast, after it was revealed a Covid-positive person attended the event.
The Caulfield North event, which had 69 guests, received widespread public attention last week after footage of the party was leaked publicly.
Victoria Police chief commissioner Shane Patton said most of the guests would receive fines worth $5500 and revealed four people had already been fined.
“Two of those have been to the parents of the bride-to-be and two of those have been to the engaged couple as well,” Mr Patton said.
“The investigation is still ongoing, it’s obviously been hampered to a degree by the fact that they’re in isolation.”

Rachel Baxendale 1.55pm: Treasurers extend business support for Vic lockdown
Federal Treasurer Josh Frydenberg, his Victorian counterpart Tim Pallas and Industry Support and Recovery Minister Martin Pakula have announced yet another round of business support for yet another lockdown extension.
The latest package is designed to cover businesses from the expiry of the current one at 11.59pm on Thursday, until the same time on September 2 when the current fortnight-long lockdown extension expires.
The package is worth $807 million and jointly funded 50:50 by the Andrews and Morrison governments, with the vast majority of funds to flow automatically to more than 110,000 businesses which have qualified for previous rounds of support.
The latest commitment brings to almost $2bn the joint state and federal business support funding provided during Victoria’s sixth lockdown.
Commonwealth Covid-19 Disaster Payment arrangements for Melbourne workers and eligible sole-trader businesses have also been extended to September 2 in line with the new restrictions period.
Since 1 July, almost $450 million in Covid-19 Disaster payments have been made to 330,000 Victorians.
Mr Frydenberg said the Morrison government would continue to support businesses affected by extended lockdowns in Victoria.
“We have worked collaboratively with the Victorian government to give businesses as much certainty as possible during this challenging period,” he said.
“The extended business support builds on the more than $45 billion in direct economic support the Morrison government has delivered to Victorian households and businesses during the pandemic.”
The Victorian government has provided more than $9 billion in direct economic support for businesses over the course of the pandemic, including $1.5 billion in cash grants paid to more than
98,000 businesses since the May/June restrictions period.
Mr Pakula highlighted Victoria’s Small Business Covid package, worth more than $250 million.
“We know there are businesses that have fallen through the cracks; businesses that haven’t qualified for support in the past but have nonetheless experienced dramatic impacts due to the pandemic,” he said.
“The Hardship Fund will support up to 18,000 businesses across the state – regional and metropolitan alike. We encourage businesses that believe they meet the criteria to make an application for support.”
More information about the business support programs is available at business.vic.gov.au.

Rachel Baxendale 1.40pm: Breakdown of Victoria’s 57 new cases
As of Thursday, Victoria has 296 active cases of coronavirus, including 295 community-acquired cases, and one overseas-acquired case in hotel quarantine.
There are almost 12,000 primary close contacts, and 489 listed exposure sites.
Of 57 new community-acquired cases on Thursday, 44 were in people who had been in isolation for the duration of their infectious period, while a further 10 who spent time in the community while infectious are close contacts of cases identified in recent days, and three are mystery cases.
The 44 quarantined cases include:
– 38 cases linked to Al-Taqwa College;
– Three cases linked to Glenroy West Primary School;
– One case linked to Caroline Springs Square shopping centre;
– One case linked to the Newport Football Club;
– One case linked to the Newport community;
The 10 linked cases who spent time in the community while infectious include:
– One case in a close contact of a 510 Lygon Street Carlton public housing tower resident;
– Three cases linked to the St Kilda East Jewish Orthodox community;
– Three cases are household contacts of three other recently identified cases which are not linked to each other;
– Three cases are in close contacts of a teenager identified in Wednesday’s cases who worked at the Central Park Pizza shop in Malvern East.
The three mystery cases include:
– A Glenroy resident;
– An Ascot Vale resident;
– A Doncaster resident;
Covid logistics chief Jeroen Weimar said the was “fairly confident” the Glenroy mystery case would be solved quickly, with some “potential leads”.
Mr Weimar said there was geographic proximity between the Ascot Vale case and two other previous cases, but no obvious links, while there are no clear links at all between the Doncaster case and any others.

Rachel Baxendale 12.45pm: Authorities track clues from wastewater tests
Acting Victorian chief health officer Ben Cowie said health authorities were continuing to see unexpected detections of Covid fragments in sewage from a range of sites around the state.
“While the (wastewater) testing program isn’t necessarily a smoking gun, it does provide a good signal and another line of intelligence for us to follow,” Professor Cowie said.
He said an unexpected detection in wastewater from the public housing tower at 480 Lygon Street, Carlton earlier this week had alerted authorities to a cluster of cases in that building and the neighbouring one at 510 Lygon St.
Victoria has recorded its biggest rise in coronavirus cases this year with 57 reported over the past 24 hours as Melbourne lives through its 200th day in lockdown since the pandemic began. However, 54 of the new cases were linked to known outbreaks and 44 were in isolation which means there were only three mystery cases and 13 infectious in the community. The large number of cases can be attributed to day 13 tests from the Al-Taqwa cluster. Fatigue has begun to set in for Melbourne residents who are living in one of the most locked down cities in the world.
“Sometimes (wastewater detections) are the result of somebody who is shedding but no longer infectious. They have had Covid-19, cleared it, but we detect fragments of the virus in the wastewater,” Professor Cowie said.
“Sometimes, it is from a case that we know about who is safely isolating.”
“When we don’t know of any cases isolating in an area, that is when we call it an unexpected detection and we pay close attention.”
Victoria’s current unexpected detections include:
– Three repeat detections in Shepparton in north central Victoria between August 9 and 16;
– A detection in Lakes Entrance in Gippsland in Victoria’s far east, between August 8 and 11;
– Repeat detections in Ardeer, in Melbourne’s west, with a period of concern between August 11 and 16, and new detections in the nearby suburbs of Albion, Braybrook, St Albans, Sunshine, Sunshine North, Sunshine West and Tottenham with a period of concern between August 15 and 17;
– Three detections in southeastern suburbs including Dingley Village, Keysborough, Noble Park, Springvale, and Springvale South between August 11 and 17;
– Repeat detections in an industrial precinct in Sunshine West, where no one lives, but many people work, with a period of concern between August 8 and 17;
“We are at a point where, based on these repeat strong detections, it becomes more likely than not that someone who works in this area actually does have a coronavirus infection, and that is clearly of concern to get them tested not just so we can look after them and provide them with treatment, but to protect their colleagues and community,” Professor Cowie said.
Paige Taylor 12.35pm: Cases spike in western NSW towns
The number of people who have contracted Covid-19 in the western NSW outbreak has climbed to 169 after people in Dubbo, Mudgee, Gilgandra and Bourke received positive test results on Wednesday and early Thursday. There have been 27 new cases, 21 of them in Dubbo.
Dubbo MP Dugald Saunders said four people were ill with Covid-19 in Dubbo hospital. For the first time, a Covid-19 patient in western NSW is in intensive care. Dubbo hospital is also caring for four children who have not tested positive for Covid-19 but are staying at the hospital to be near a parent who has.
Mr Saunders spoke at a press conference in Dubbo as the Royal Flying Doctor Service, international medical response team AUSMAT and the Australian Defence Force helped with urgent efforts to test and vaccinate people across the region which includes large numbers of vulnerable Aboriginal people.
Western NSW district health boss Scott McLachlan said the majority of the new cases were infectious while still in the community. However, as contract tracers do their work, the number of positive cases who were infectious in the community is declining each day.
From Saturday, people who do not have a Covid-19 vaccine booking can get a first or second shot by simply turning up at Pioneer Park in West Dubbo. It will be Dubbo’s first walk in clinic after The Australian revealed the bizarre vaccine arrangements in Dubbo that turned Wiradjuri elder “Riverbank Frank” Doolan away at one clinic on Tuesday. When The Australian drove Mr Doolan to another clinic in Manera – it was a 45-minute walk away – he was told he needed to make a booking online even though he has no internet and no email address. Mr Doolan eventually got his shot when the nursing unit manager, Cath Raidaveta, helped The Australian’s reporter Greg Bearup to make Mr Doolan’s booking using Bearup’s phone.
Mr McLachlan said newly-arrived vaccines and vaccination teams were making it as easy as possible for people to get vaccinated. There was also a communications campaign to make sure people understood this.
Rachel Baxendale 12.25pm: Vaccination stats for Victoria’s cases
Acting Victorian chief health officer Ben Cowie said the state’s public health team had analysed the vaccination status of the 529 locally acquired cases between July 12 and August 18.
Of the 529:
– 80 were eligible to be vaccinated but hadn’t been vaccinated prior to infection;
– 45 had received one dose of vaccination prior to infection;
– 23 , or just under five per cent, were fully vaccinated at the time of diagnosis;
This means 461 of Victoria’s 529 coronavirus cases between July 12 and August 18, or 87 per cent, were in people who were not vaccinated.
It means that 381 of the 529 cases, or 72 per cent, were in people who were not eligible for vaccination prior to being infected.
Of 14 people currently in Victorian hospitals with coronavirus:
– Five were not eligible for vaccination prior to becoming infected;
– Nine were eligible but have not yet been vaccinated;
– None were either partially or completely vaccinated.
Professor Cowie said both Pfizer and AstraZeneca reduced people’s potential to contract and transmit coronavirus.
“The really critical point is that both AstraZeneca and Pfizer vaccines offer around 90 per cent protection against serious illness, hospitalisation and loss of life,” he said.
“That is for the Delta variant. These vaccines are so critical, so please make the appointment and get vaccinated as soon as you are eligible.”
Nicholas Jensen 12.15pm: New Zealand reports 11 new cases
New Zealand has recorded 11 locally acquired cases of Covid-19 in the last 24 hours, after health authorities identified a return traveller from Sydney as “patient zero”.
Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern said the case arrived in Auckland on a managed red zone flight on August 7, and returned a positive result two days later, with genome sequence showing the case is connected to the NSW Delta outbreak.
There are now 21 active Delta cases in Auckland, including two patients in hospital. The other 19 cases remain in Auckland’s central quarantine facility.
Health director general Ashley Bloomfield confirmed 12 of the 21 new cases have been confirmed as part of the so-called Auckland cluster.
NZ Health is investigating a further eight cases that are expected to be part of the cluster.
Two people have been taken to North Shore Hospital overnight, with one experiencing “worsening symptoms”, and the other admitted with underlying conditions. Health officials say the two patients – one in their 20s, the other in their 40s – are in a stable condition.
Rachel Baxendale 12.05pm: Premier Andrews criticises vaccine supply
Victorian Premier Daniel Andrews says that while vaccine supply “has been a real challenge” more and more vaccine is becoming available, with an additional 300,000 appointments announced over the past 10 days.
“In aggregate over the next week, we have some 26,000 bookings that are free, as I stand here right now,” Mr Andrews said.
“The split is 14,000 Pfizer, 12,000 AstraZeneca. There are appointments there, they are ready. The teams are ready to give you your jab.
“You just need to book and you can book with confidence.”
Mr Andrew said even more appointments would open up over the course of September with the arrival of further Pfizer supplies, and Moderna.
“But that is not a reason to delay. This is available now. Get online, book an appointment, turn up, and you will be processed as fast as possible.
“You will play a powerful part in keeping yourself safe, your family safe, and every Victorian safe. This is our way out in the long-term.”
Nicholas Jensen 12pm: Berejiklian set to outline state’s Covid plan
Ms Berejiklian said the NSW government will provide an update next week on the extension of lockdowns and “what September and October will look like” for Greater Metropolitan Sydney, adding that officials are still considering their approach to schools.
“But, suffice to say, until we hit 70 per cent double dose and 80 per cent double dose, life will be challenging for us. And while we get to those high vaccination rates, we desperately want to see the case numbers come down.”
Ms Berejiklian also warned that, soon enough, other states and territories across Australia will need to learn to live with the Delta variant, saying that NSW is the first to confront the challenge.
“Because of our situation we are confronting this earlier than what we had hoped. But the challenge is that every state has to live with the fact that once you get to 80 per cent double doses, and your population is allowed to live more freely, the Delta variant will creep in because we are so connected.”
Regarding the imposition of stricter lockdown measures, Ms Berejiklian said her government remains open to any health advice and would be willing to enact different lockdown settings.
“If at any time the NSW government gets advice on what to do of course we’ll take that into account … We have no fear in taking any decision that we need to get the case numbers down. But I also need to make it very clear that the Delta strain works in ways other strains of Covid do not.”
Adeshola Ore 11.55am: ACT records 16 new cases as outbreak hits 83
The ACT has reported 16 new Covid-19 cases, taking the total number of infections in the current outbreak to 83.
Of the new cases, 11 are linked to existing cases and five are under investigation. No cases in the ACT require hospitalisation.
ACT Chief Minister Andrew Barr said one of today’s new cases is linked to a childcare centre. Testing arrangements at the centre have been put in place.
Of the 83 total cases, nine are mystery cases that cannot be linked to other infections.
Mr Barr urged Territorians to stay at home or risk “living like Sydney for the rest of the year.”
“The lockdown needs to work, the restrictions need to stay as they are for the time being,” he said.
Mr Barr also welcomed the extension of regional NSW’s lockdown.
Rachel Baxendale 11.50am: New cases ‘high’ but most in isolation
Victorian Premier Daniel Andrews says that while the state’s daily case number of 57 on Thursday “seems a very big number”, the vast majority – 44 – of those people have been in isolation for their infectious period.
Of 296 people in Victoria with active cases of coronavirus, 14 have been hospitalised, of whom three are in intensive care, with one of the ICU patients also on a ventilator.
“That’s exactly what we want, that is the system working exactly as it should work, and it goes to that point we have made a number of times that the numbers, yes they are important but the story that sits behind those numbers is in fact more important than the numbers alone,” Mr Andrews said.
He said many of the 44 cases in isolation would have to spend up to an additional fortnight in quarantine as a result of their positive tests – many of which were detected on Day 13 of their isolation as existing close contacts.
“ (Covid logistics chief) Jeroen Weimar can speak more deeply to the breakdown of where those Day 13 tests have come from,” Mr Andrews said.
“I would just say that as you move through the outbreak and its different stages, these are principally Al-Taqwa (College) students and close contacts, close personal contacts from that school outbreak.
“There will be other parts of this that unfold over coming days so we may see further cases that are exactly the same as a result of Day 13 testing.”
Rachel Baxendale 11.45am: 1200 jabs delivered at new Melbourne clinic
Victorian Premier Daniel Andrews said 1200 vaccine doses had been delivered in the first seven days of the Melton clinic’s existence.
The new Broadmeadows site will be soft launched this Sunday by invitation only, and will open to the public for booked appointments from Monday 23 August.
The Sandown Racecourse clinic will be adjacent to the existing Sandown Racecourse indoor vaccination hub and will run an invitation-only soft launch on Friday. It will open to the public for booked appointments from Saturday, August 21.
Combined, these sites will have 36 bays for drive-through but have the capacity to be ramped up if needed.
The new site at the Eagle Stadium in Werribee will have room for both drive through and indoor vaccinations.
“We’ll be looking to open this site towards the end of this week once more details have been worked through,” Mr Andrews said.
In addition, a pop-up vaccination centre opened yesterday at Peanut Farm Reserve in St Kilda.
“It is a walk-in, no-booking site designed for locals who are eligible for the vaccine. It administered 170 doses in its first two hours,” Mr Andrews said.
The St Kilda vaccination clinic has been opened after a number of cases were detected in the area in recent days, including one linked to a local sex worker.
Rachel Baxendale 11.40am: Victoria settles on new drive-through vaccine sites
Victoria has determined the locations for its three new drive-through vaccination clinics announced last week.
The three add to the first drive-through clinic in Australia, which opened in Melton, in Melbourne’s outer northwest, on August 8.
The new ones will be located at the former Ford factory in Broadmeadows, in Melbourne’s outer north, the Sandown racecourse in Springvale, in Melbourne’s southeast, and Eagle Stadium in Werribee in the outer southwest.
Nicholas Jensen 11.35am: Bondi man jailed after repeat breaches
Deputy police commissioner Gary Worboys urged residents to abide by the restrictions and follow instructions from NSW Health, after NSW Police issued 671 penalties.
More than half of the infringement notices were issued to residents who were out of their home “without a reasonable excuse”.
“This is concerning when you think about the messaging you hear every day here and through the media about people staying at home and not leaving home unless it is for essential regions.”
Deputy commissioner Worboys said Police arrested a Bondi man who travelled to Sydney’s southwest on four separate occasions despite warning from authorities.
“He was arrested and was taken to the police station and charged with that offence. He will be put before the courts. And here is a person that on four occasions blatantly disregarded the public health order.”
Adeshola Ore 11.30am: ACT reports two cases near NSW border
Two new cases of Covid-19 have been reported in Queanbeyan, near NSW’s border with the ACT.
Deputy Premier of NSW John Barilaro said it is understood the two people work in the ACT but live in the regional NSW town.
Nicholas Jensen 11.25am: Majority of ICU cases unvaccinated
Deputy chief health officer Marianne Gale confirmed there are currently 474 cases being treated in hospital, with 82 patients in ICU and 25 requiring ventilation. Of the 82 patients in ICU, 71 are not vaccinated.
There have been 25 new cases recorded in western NSW, bringing the total number of active cases across the region to 167.
Five cases were also recorded in the Hunter New England area, with a total of 100 active cases in the area.
Dr Gale said it was pleasing that all five new cases could be linked to existing cases.
Nicholas Jensen 11.13am: Regional NSW lockdown extended to Aug 28
In response to rising case numbers in regional NSW, Premier Gladys Berejiklian announced the lockdown of rural NSW will be extended by one week to at least August 28.
Health authorities remain concerned as the Local Health District recorded 25 new local cases, with new cases emerging across Wilcannia and Dubbo.
“Things are settling down in other parts of regional NSW, which is positive, but concerns remain for western NSW,” said Ms Berejiklian.
Despite the new daily high in infections, Ms Berejiklian said she was pleased that NSW had administered 5.5m vaccinations, with the goal of 6m jabs opening the path towards more freedoms.
“I want to remind the people of this state that once we get to the end of October we expect 70 per cent of the population to be fully vaccinated. Once we get to mid November we expect 80 per cent of the population to be fully vaccinated,” she said.
“It gives enormous opportunities for greater freedoms than we have today.”
Nicholas Jensen 11.03am: NSW records new peak of 681 cases
NSW has recorded a new peak of 681 locally acquired cases with 59 infectious in the community. One man in his 80s has passed away at St George hospital.
Premier Gladys Berejiklian said the areas of Merrylands, Guildford, Auburn, Granville, Lidcombe and Greenacre remain key areas of concern for NSW Health.
Remy Varga 10.45am: Victoria Covid update at 11.15am
Victorian Premier Daniel Andrews, logistics chief Jeroen Weimar, acting chief health officer Dan O’Brien and Chief Commissioner Shane Patton will give a Covid-19 update at 11.15am.
Remy Varga 10.40am: Vic hospital staffers stood down after positive test
At least 40 staff members have been stood down at Footscray Hospital in Melbourne’s inner west after a medical professional tested positive for Covid-19.
Western Health Executive Director of Operations Natasha Toohey confirmed on Thursday that a staff member who worked in the hospital’s medical imaging department on Monday has since tested positive.
“All patients who attended appointments during the potential exposure period are being contacted,” she said.
“At this stage 40 Western Health staff have been furloughed in relation to this exposure.
“Western Health has an extensive range of measures in place to protect patients and staff in line with Department of Health guidelines and as advised by our specialist infectious diseases and infection prevention staff.”
Contact tracing is underway and the source of the COVID-19 infection is not yet known.

Nicholas Jensen 10.35am: Sydney tradies fined over Kiama worksite
NSW Police have issued infringement notices to eight tradesmen, after authorities found they had left LGAs of concern in Sydney and attended a worksite in Kiama.
Earlier this week, Lake Illawarra Police were notified of workers from Sydney who were staying in Kiama.
Police attended the address and spoke with the occupants, who were part of a construction team building an apartment complex in the area.
Thirty-three workers were present on the building site when police arrived to speak with project managers. Authorities issued eight infringements to construction workers who were found to be in breach of the public health orders.
NSW Police says these workers lived in declared LGAs of concern, including four from Bayside, two from Fairfield and two from Blacktown.
The infringements come after more than 730 penalty notices were issued by NSW Police on Tuesday.

Rachel Baxendale 10.15am: Vic mystery clusters in six key groups
On Wednesday, Covid logistics chief Jeroen Weimar said as many as a dozen clusters with no identified source of acquisition had been consolidated into six key groupings in recent days.
There are three new cases among Thursday’s 57 which are yet to be linked to a source of acquisition.
Victoria has recorded its biggest rise in coronavirus cases this year with 57 reported over the past 24 hours as Melbourne lives through its 200th day in lockdown since the pandemic began. However, 54 of the new cases were linked to known outbreaks and 44 were in isolation which means there were only three mystery cases and 13 infectious in the community. The large number of cases can be attributed to day 13 tests from the Al-Taqwa cluster. Fatigue has begun to set in for Melbourne residents who are living in one of the most locked down cities in the world.
Of the six key groupings:
– At least 211 cases (and likely many of Thursday’s 57), are linked to an Al-Taqwa College teacher in her 20s and her optometrist partner, who live in Newport in Hobson’s Bay in Melbourne’s inner southwest. The partner worked at Caroline Springs Square shopping centre and played football at the Newport Football Club. A smaller cluster linked to a Melton family, as well as the Glenroy West Primary School cluster, are also among these cases;
– Eight cases are linked to a West Footscray-based cluster which first emerged in a Maribyrnong man in his 20s who works at a warehouse in Derrimut;
– Three cases are linked to a City of Melbourne father who works at the Royal Children’s Hospital, and his son who is in Grade One at St Michael’s Primary School in North Melbourne;
– Two cases have been linked to a delivery truck driver who lives in Wyndham Vale in Melbourne’s outer southwest, and does not drive interstate;
– Six cases have been linked to public housing towers at 480 and 510 Lygon Street, Carlton;
– Fifteen cases, most of which have not been linked to one another, are linked to the St Kilda, Middle Park and Caulfield areas. These cases include:
A person who lives in Middle Park and visited the South Melbourne Market and a string of sites in Melbourne’s inner south and southeast, as well as a case in a cleaner who lives in the City of Greater Dandenong, in Melbourne’s outer southeast, and works in Fitzroy Street, St Kilda;
Six cases linked to a mother and her adult son from East St Kilda who attended an illegal Orthodox Jewish community engagement party last week;
A sex worker who is not believed to have worked while infectious, but is socially linked to a case in a City of Melbourne resident;
A case in a St Kilda resident without clear links to other cases;
A case in a teenager who works at a pizza shop in Malvern East and lives in Glen Iris;
“We have within that cluster accountants, we have architects, we have a sex worker, we have members of the Orthodox Jewish community and a pizza guy who works in a pizza shop (in Malvern),” Mr Weimar said of the 15 St Kilda cases on Wednesday.
“It is a very broad and disparate range of people. The only thing that connects them at this point in time is some association particularly in that St Kilda area.”
On Wednesday there were an additional two mystery cases in Altona North residents, and one in a Glenroy resident, although it was suspected that these would be linked to the greater Hobson’s Bay/Glenroy cluster.
It is not yet clear where Thursday’s three new mysteries fit in.

Lydia Lynch 10.10am: Qld records zero local cases
No local cases have been detected in Queensland on Thursday, Annastacia Palaszczuk has confirmed.
“I think everyone knows when I have a smile it means good news,” she said.
“Well done Queensland, keep up the good work.”
There are 190,000 people on Queensland’s vaccine waitlist after another 90,000 people joined the line overnight.
More than 14,000 tests were conducted overnight and 1800 people remain in home quarantine.
Nicholas Jensen 10.05am: ADF deployed to NSW-Qld border to limit spread
More than a hundred ADF personnel will be deployed across the NSW-Queensland border in a bid to prevent the spread of the Delta farther north.
The decision comes shortly after officials said they would further limit the number of people who could cross the border.
Premier Annastacia Palaszczuk, who requested the deployment last week, said she was pleased with the response from the federal government.
As it stands, only critical essential workers, including doctors, nurses, defence personnel, freight and aircrew, are permitted to cross.
Earlier this week, QLD Police said more than 10,000 people crossed the border checkpoints from NSW, with 1000 turned back.
The deployment is expected to begin next week.
Nicholas Jensen 9.50am: ‘Don’t blame people doing it toughest’
Labor frontbencher Tony Burke has attacked comments made by NSW Police Minister David Elliott, saying he does not understand how residents in Sydney’s southwest are struggling to cope during the current outbreak.
“The minister (Mr Elliott) was boasting about how good things were going in the Hills District and claiming that there was some sort of lawlessness in the areas that are doing it tough,” Mr Burke told Sky News this morning.
“We are the home of essential workers. I don’t know who he thinks does the aged care work, fills the shopping shelves, drives the heavy vehicles into the Hills District (where Mr Elliott lives), but most of those people don’t live in his part of Sydney.
“What we have in my part of Sydney is an area, disproportionately full of essential workers, who can’t do their jobs from a laptop, and they are going into harm’s way every day.”
Mr Burke said authorities needed to adopt a more balanced approach across different Sydney LGAs rather than disproportionately focusing its efforts on one particular community.
“Yes, I want everyone to obey the rules, but I do not want people from state or federal governments to be blaming the people who are doing it the toughest.”

Nicholas Jensen 9.15am: Dramatic jump in NSW cases ‘possible’
Deakin chair of epidemiology Catherine Bennett says it is difficult to say whether infections will jump significantly in NSW in the coming days, amid fears case numbers could reach into the thousands.
“We are seeing this pretty consistent 30 per cent increase every incubation period, every four-to-five days which shows that it is actually under control,” Professor Bennett told the ABC this morning.
However Professor Bennett warned the current spike in cases means a weekly jump in infections could be possible.
“We don’t know when this is going to start to turn around. When the vaccination levels, particularly in those areas where the spread is concentrated, start to really kick in and give you that balance … we should see the numbers stabilising.”
“We’re all waiting for that vaccination sweet spot to happen,” she said.
Professor Bennett said daily cases numbers hinge on household compliance and the movement of essential workers over the next few weeks, adding that health officials must “sever the ties between networks”.
Regarding Melbourne’s outbreak, Professor Bennett said the focus should remain on the mystery cases rather than the daily cases numbers.
“If you’ve got people who are testing positive but they’re safely in isolation for their entire infectious period, they’re not adding to that wider spread. But the signal coming from those cases that we can’t tie back in is the concern.”
“It tells us that there are other cases out there and there could be other chains of transmission.”
Rachel Baxendale 9.00am: New cases follow lockdown extension
Thursday’s 57 new cases follow the Andrews government’s imposition on Monday of a 9pm-5am curfew on Melburnians and an extension of the city’s lockdown for 14 days to September 2nd, as well as other tougher measures including bans on the use of playgrounds and on drinking ­alcohol in public.
Melbourne has reached 200 days in lockdown since the pandemic began which makes it one of the most locked down cities in the world. The Herald Sun has reported Victoria is set to record at least 40 cases of Covid -19 today, which will be the biggest spike in cases since the second wave last year. However, most of the cases are expected to be from day 13 tests from the Al-Taqwa cluster and should be in isolation. The city’s sixth lockdown is scheduled to lift in under two weeks.
The latest cases come after 24 cases on each of Wednesday and Tuesday, 22 cases on Monday, 25 on Sunday, 21 on Saturday, 15 on Friday, and 21 locally acquired and two interstate acquired cases last Thursday.
The outbreak peak so far was 29 on August 7, just three days after short-lived celebrations of zero on August 4 – the day before the state’s sixth lockdown was announced.
Of 309 cases linked to Victorian outbreaks which have emerged since August 4, 156, or 50 per cent, have been in quarantine for the duration of their infectious period, including 44 in Thursday’s numbers, 18 in Wednesday’s numbers, 14 in each of Tuesday and Monday’s numbers, 12 in Sunday’s, 11 in Saturday’s, eight in Friday’s, and 15 in last Thursday’s.
There are currently 296 active cases, including one active case acquired overseas.
As of Wednesday, there were 12 people in Victorian hospitals with coronavirus, two of whom were in intensive care – up from six in hospital on Monday.
The latest cases come after 49,607 tests were processed on Wednesday, up from 39,832 on Tuesday, 31,519 on Monday, 29,986 on Sunday, 32,286 on Saturday, 33,675 on Friday, 40,737 on Thursday and 45,408 last Wednesday.
Victoria’s testing record is 59,355 tests on July 20.
Rachel Baxendale 8.48am: Vic records 57 new local cases
Victoria has recorded 57 new community acquired cases of coronavirus in the 24 hours to midnight on Wednesday.
It is the highest daily case number recorded since the state’s deadly second wave, and almost double the previous peak since, of 29 cases on August 7.
Of the 57 cases, 54 have been linked to known outbreaks, leaving three mystery cases.
There are also 13 cases among Thursday’s numbers in people who were infectious in the community, with the remaining 44 isolated for the duration of their infectious period.
The Australian understands the vast majority of the 44 are close contacts of earlier cases linked to Al-Taqwa college, who returned Day 13 test results on Wednesday.
Rachel Baxendale 8.30am: Vic to record at least 48 new cases
The Australian understands at least 48 locally acquired coronavirus cases will be confirmed to have been recorded in the 24 hours to midnight on Wednesday when Victoria’s numbers come out later on Thursday morning.
Victoria’s previous peak since the state’s deadly second wave last year was 29 on August 7 – just under a fortnight ago.
Thursday’s number had already passed 40 by 7pm on Wednesday night – largely off the back of Day 13 tests in close contacts of the Al-Taqwa College outbreak.
This is not entirely surprising, given the significant number of large families who have been isolating under the same roof over the past fortnight.
Provided quarantine rules have been followed, these cases should not pose a risk of onward transmission.
However, authorities are also very concerned about spread within Victoria’s homeless community, which is also expected to be reflected within Thursday’s numbers, after a case in a St Kilda sex worker was confirmed on Wednesday.
Nicholas Jensen 8.25am: AMA: Vaccinate all before booster jabs
Australian Medical Association Vice President Chris Moy has urged Australian health authorities to focus on the vaccination of all its citizens before contemplating the prospect of booster jabs.
Following the WHO’s announcement this morning that booster shots were unnecessary for fully vaccinated populations, Dr Moy told Sky News the best protection against the spread of the virus globally was to ensure all countries recorded strong vaccination rates – not just developed countries.
“The US decision (to introduce boosters) is based on evidence, particularly from Israel, that the immunities seem to drop against the Delta variant, and that there seems to be increasing symptomatic infections and also some increase in hospitalisation in those over 65.”
However, Dr Moy warned the evidence of its effectiveness remains unclear.
“Even the data from Israel is showing that there’s still really good protection from serious disease and death (from two doses), so don’t view this as a negative.”
“This is something that we don’t have to contemplate for a while,” he said.

Nicholas Jensen 8.05am: WHO lashes US booster shots plan
The World Health Organisation has rejected claims booster shots are necessary for populations already fully vaccinated against Covid-19, urging global leaders to prioritise vulnerable countries with low vaccination rates before they consider a “top-up” approach.
It comes days before the US government prepares to make its booster shots widely available to all Americans from September 20.
WHO chief scientist Soumya Swaminathan told a press conference in Geneva that the present evidence on booster shots does not indicate they are needed, adding that the most vulnerable people should be fully vaccinated before high-income countries “deploy a top-up” approach.
WHO senior adviser Bruce Aylward also told reporters: “There is enough vaccine around the world, but it is not going to the right places in the right order’.
“Two doses should be given to the most vulnerable worldwide before boosters are administered to those fully-vaccinated … We are a long, long way from that,” he said.
Nicholas Jensen 7.35am: Warning over new alerts in western NSW
With NSW recording 23 cases in the state’s far west on Wednesday, health officials have registered a clutch of new exposure sites across Dubbo, including a minimart, a fitness centre and a spa.
Residents who attended the Myall St Minimart on Friday August 13 from 2.15pm to 2.30pm are considered a close contact and must self isolate for 14 days since their exposure.
Additionally, residents who attended Snap Fitness on Darling Street on Tuesday August 10 from 5.30pm to 6.30pm and Itty Bitty Spa on Macquarie Street on between 9.30am to 5.30pm on the same day have also been instructed to self isolated for 14 days.
https://twitter.com/NSWHealth/status/1427922561396973572/photo/1
Several new casual contact venues have also been added across Bourke, Broken Hill, Dubbo and Albion Park.
The additions follow a decision by NSW Health not to list every exposure site across the state but focus on key venues of concern.

Nicholas Jensen 7.20am: Victoria braces for spike of 40 new local cases
Victorian health officials are expected to announce a spike of 40 new cases today, as contact tracers attempt to pinpoint more than a dozen mystery cases across Melbourne’s inner south east.
The rise in infections is partly connected to Al-Taqwa College in Truganina, outside of Melbourne, where students and staff are currently in isolation, the Herald Sun reports.
Health authorities are concerned about the spread of the virus amongst Melbourne’s homeless community, with hospitals reportedly on standby for a major outbreak.
Investigations are also continuing into the exposures sites linked to a sex worker, who worked in St Kilda and other areas of the city’s south east.
The St Kilda cluster has now grown to 15 cases across Melbourne’s inner southeast, which include accountants, architects, members of the Orthodox Jewish community and a teenage pizza shop employee.
Fears of a spike in case numbers come as Melburnians wake to their 200th day in lockdown since the beginning of the pandemic.
The Andrews government has yet to confirm if the lockdown will be lifted, as planned, on September 2.

Nicholas Jensen 6.45am: ‘We haven’t seen worst of this in NSW’
As more than 13 million Australians wake to another day of lockdown restrictions, contact tracers across NSW, Victoria and the ACT continue to battle the spread of the Delta variant.
After NSW recorded 633 infections, the state’s highest daily case number since the beginning of the pandemic, Premier Gladys Berejiklian warned that “we haven’t seen the worst of this”.
With 4000 unlinked mystery cases in NSW, a leading epidemiologist has warned cases are likely to rise above 2200 within a month.
James McCaw, who advises the federal government, told the Sydney Morning Herald: “Our models show the possibility of increases and decreases, but I think it’s more likely to be well over 1000 and up to 2000 within a month or so.”
Three more people died in NSW, including an unvaccinated man in his late 60s and two men in their 70s – one of whom one was fully vaccinated, while the other had received one dose.
In regional NSW, 23 local cases were recorded, with 17 infections detected in Dubbo, as well as further cases in Mudgee, Narromine and Gilgandra.
In the state’s far west, Bourke and Broken Hill each recorded one case, while Wilcannia recorded three cases.
Under mounting pressure, Ms Berejiklian defended the state’s current lockdown settings, saying they were clear, but too many residents were breaking rules.
“Every person is passing on the virus to more than one person which is driving case numbers upwards,” she said.
In Victoria, 24 new infections were detected, as health officials continue to investigate more than a dozen mystery cases across Melbourne’s south east suburbs, concentrated in the St Kilda area.
“I have to stress, there are no known linkages between the 15 individuals I’ve called out in the broader St Kilda area at all,” said Covid-19 response commander Jeroen Weimar
“We have accountants, we have architects, we have a sex worker, we have members of the orthodox Jewish community, and we have a pizza guy who works in a pizza shop.”
Meanwhile, the ACT recorded 22 locally acquired cases, with all new infections linked to known cases.
Despite no mystery cases, Chief Minister Andrew Barr instructed residents to remain vigilant and get tested.
“Anyone who looks at the NSW numbers today, and what has been occurring there, would be very clear that now is not the time at this stage of our outbreak to be easing restrictions,” he said.
More than 500 frontline health care workers are among the some 10,000 Canberrans currently isolating.
In the Northern Territory, after recording zero local cases on Wednesday, Chief Minister Michael Gunner said he was confident but “not certain” that the snap lockdown of Greater Darwin and Katherine will end, as scheduled, on Thursday.
“We are confident we have caught this thing in time. We are confident we have trapped the risk and we are confident that our tracing efforts have been successful.”
The number of close contacts from the NT outbreak has now reached 93 residents, with health officials establishing two vaccine hubs in central Katherine and at the Katherine District Hospital.
Darwin and Katherine are expected to exit lockdown after the Northern Territory recorded no new cases of COVID-19 on Wednesday.

Stephen Lunn 5.10am: ‘Get vaccinated or don’t work’: jab deadline looms
The Morrison government has written to every nursing home ­operator in Australia warning that it will not extend the September 17 deadline for all staff to be vaccinated, despite about 100,000 workers not yet having had a jab.
From Monday, it will begin publishing staff and resident vaccination rates in individual nursing homes in a bid to accelerate inoculations in the sector.
Health Minister Greg Hunt and Aged Care Services Minister Richard Colbeck wrote to providers on Wednesday advising them that nursing homes would be held to the cut-off date, after which unvaccinated staff would not be permitted to work.
National cabinet agreed on June 28 that all aged-care workers in nursing homes must have at least one dose of a Covid-19 vaccination by September 17 as a condition of work, given the extreme vulnerability to the virus of those in their care. With less than a month to go, the trajectory of vaccinations among the 278,000 carers and other staff in the sector falls significantly below that required to meet the deadline.
This has put the federal government, which committed in February to fully vaccinating its residential aged-care workforce as a priority by April, and vaccination task force leader Lieutenant General John Frewen under significant pressure.

Natasha Robinson 5am: Spike in vaccinations at Covid-19 hot spots
The rate of vaccination in hotspot suburbs in Sydney’s southwest and west has been increasing 50 per cent faster than the statewide rate, as mosques and churches are converted into makeshift vax hubs and people flood pharmacies and walk-in clinics to get a jab.
There has been a major community effort aimed at addressing the barriers to vaccine access and misinformation about vaccines that was holding back many from getting their shots in the early stages of the vaccine rollout in Sydney’s west, and now the surging rates of vaccination in hotspot zones is seeing NSW deliver more than 100,000 vaccines a day, well ahead of Victoria’s 63,000.
Figures published by NSW Health show Fairfield, Punchbowl, Lakemba and surrounding suburbs had only between 10 and 19 per cent of people with a first dose of vaccine a month ago; now 40-49 per cent of people in those suburbs have had a first dose.
Rates of vaccination have also climbed by 30 per cent in the southwest Sydney suburbs of Cabramatta, Campsie and Bonnyrigg, as well as suburbs in the west of the city including Caddens, Glenmore Park, Currans Hill, Mount Annan and Eagle Vale.

Paige Taylor 4.45am: Entire town told to stay home, get tested
The entire town of Wilcannia has been ordered to get tested for Covid-19 after an infected person travelled to the remote community for the funeral of a young ­Aboriginal man and spread the virus to other mourners.
Health authorities held serious concerns for the 745 residents of the river town in western NSW and turned the local football oval into a makeshift testing centre on Wednesday. Locals were being told to get tested and to isolate at home.
The western NSW outbreak had infected 142 people by Wednesday morning, 67 per cent of them Indigenous.
Contact tracers have established that a person with Covid-19 drove six hours from Dubbo to attend the funeral service at St John the Apostle in Wilcannia on Friday last week.
The Australian has been told the church was full and about 30 mourners spilt outside. A local Aboriginal man and woman and their youngest child have since tested positive.

Full text: Victoria announced late last night that New Zealand is now a “red zone”, making nonresident travellers banned from the state. Victorians, meanwhile, require travel permits, testing and a 14-day quarantine on arrival from New Zealand.
Tasmania also declared New Zealand a “high-risk” area late on Wednesday, placing border restrictions on anyone – including Tasmanians – considered non-essential travellers, as well as quarantine restrictions for anyone granted essential traveller permits.
The move comes after New Zealand Prime Minister placed the country in a snap lockdown after a single case she says was transmitted from NSW.
Anyone who arrived in Victoria from New Zealand after 4 August is required to self-isolate until receiving a negative test result.
On NSW’s northern border with Queensland, soldiers are on their way to secure checkpoints following a request from Annastacia Palaszczuk.
A spokeswoman for Defence Minister Peter Dutton said in a statement the 100 troops will be strategically placed along the border from next week to help the Queensland police.
NSW’s WORST DAY YET AS NZ LINK CONFIRMED Earlier, New Zealand Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern has confirmed there is a link between a NSW Covid-19 case and the one which sparked the outbreak, as heath officials fear infections will grow.
At a press conference on Wednesday, Ms Ardern said genome sequencing had shown the outbreak is the highly-contagious Delta strain, and that it had come from NSW.
“Our case has originated in Australia,” Ms Ardern said.
She did not say how, where or when the transmission occurred.
Two new Covid-19 infections were reported in New Zealand on Thursday, brining the total number of cases in the community to seven.
Ms Ardern said she was “anticipating more cases”, and data modelling showed there could be between 50 to 120 cases linked to the outbreak.
“The key is to find them as soon as possible,” director general of health, Dr Ashley Bloomfield, said.
Everyone over the age of 12 is now required to wear a mask when visiting essential stores that remain open during the lockdown, which was announced on Wednesday and will run for at least three days.
NSW RECORDS 633 NEW CASES, 3 DEATHS New South Wales has recorded 633 new locally acquired cases of Covid-19, premier Gladys Berejiklian has revealed.
Concerningly, at least 62 of those were active in the community while infectious while southwest Sydney continues to be the biggest contributor to rising daily cases, she added.
Ms Berejiklian also said “we haven’t seen the worst of this”.
“At the moment, according to the data we have, every person who has the virus is spreading it to at least more than one person,” she said.
“Now, for us to know that we have reached our peak, that can’t continue. So what the data is telling us in the last few days is that we haven’t seen the worst of it.”
Of these locally acquired cases, 158 were linked to a known case or cluster – 145 were household contacts and 13 were close contacts – and the source of infection for 475 cases is still under investigation.
NSW Health has been notified of the deaths of three people who had COVID-19 in the 24 hours to 8pm last night.
Of the 633 cases, 224 were from southwest Sydney and 216 were from western Sydney.
There were 54 from Nepean Blue/Mountains, 52 were from Sydney, 24 were from southeast Sydney, 23 were from western NSW, 15 were from Hunter/New England, six were from northern Sydney, four were from Illawarra Shoalhaven, four were from the state’s far west and 11 cases were yet to be assigned to a region.
NSW chief health officer Dr Kerry Chant begged with the state’s residents, particularly Sydney, to minimise their movements.
“I can't express enough my level of concern at these rising numbers of cases; we are continuing to see case numbers increase,” she said.
“Whilst that vaccination will be essential for us getting to a point where we can live safely with Covid, our vaccination coverage at the moment is far too low.
“We need to push that up as much as we can but in the meantime, we also need to do everything we can to not come in contact with anyone, to minimise our movements and to continue to get tested and isolate if you have the most minimal of symptoms.”
Disappointingly, there were 736 penalty infringement notices were handed out across the state for breaches of public health orders.
There were more than 102,000 tests recorded until 8pm on Tuesday night.

‘SERIOUS SITUATION’: ACT CASES SPIKE Canberra’s lockdown has been extended for an extra two weeks after 19 new local Covid cases were recorded.
The national capital’s outbreak has now grown to 28 cases.
With the two week extension, the ACT’s lockdown is now set to end on September 2 instead of August 19.
The new cases included a student from Lyneham high school and a worker from the Greenway Views retirement village in Tuggeranong.
Chief Health Minister Andrew Barr said the retirement village was now in full lockdown.
The worker who brought Covid-19 into the facility had received her first dose of the vaccine and was unknowingly infectious during her shift.
“This is a serious situation. We do not want to see the numbers continue to grow and we do not want to see exponential growth as we have seen in other jurisdictions,” he said.
Mr Barr said there was also “particular concern” for attendees at the University of Canberra High School Kaleen last Monday, urging anyone who were there at that time to get tested and quarantine immediately.
“This is a serious situation. We do not want to see the numbers continue to grow,” Mr Barr said on Monday.
Mr Barr urged Canberrans to continue following lockdown rules.
QLD TO EASE RESTRICTIONS EARLY Restrictions will ease across southeast Queensland two days earlier than expected after the state recorded no new coronavirus cases on Wednesday.
Speaking from the Breakfast Creek Hotel in Albion, Premier Annastacia Palaszczuk said restrictions, which were slated to ease at 4pm on Sunday, would now ease at 4pm Friday.
From that time, in the 11 local government areas of southeast Queensland, community sport will be allowed to recommence, and up to 30 visitors will be allowed at homes and in public spaces.
Weddings and funerals will be allowed 100 attendees, with 20 people allowed to dance at weddings.
Indoor and outdoor events and stadiums can have 75 per cent ticketed and allocated seating capacity.
While masks will no longer be required outdoors, southeast Queenslanders will need to continue to carry it and wear it in settings where social distancing is not possible.
High school students and teachers will need to continue wearing their masks in the classroom for another week.
There will be restrictions on density at hospitality settings for another week.
“We’ll review that at the end of the week. If we can continue to get those zero cases … hopefully in a week’s time we’ll be able to stand here before you and say there can be increased capacity,” Ms Palaszczuk said.
“We’re asking Queenslanders to please be patient for one more week.”
Ms Palaszczuk said in order to further ease restrictions next week, the Queensland/ NSW border would needed to be further tightened, after NSW recorded 633 cases on Wednesday.
“There are too many people crossing the border,” she said.
“It takes just one person crossing the border with Delta, and we’re into a lockdown.
“I don’t want that and I know Queenslanders don’t want that. That’s why we have to have these restrictions for the southeast for the next week.”

VICTORIAN OUTBREAK GROWS Almost half of Victoria’s active cases of Covid-19 are young people aged below 19, health officials have revealed.
Victoria recorded 24 new locally acquired infections on Wednesday, with four of those mystery cases.
But Minister health Martin Foley warned of the 246 active cases across Victoria, 111 of them were among the state’s younger population.
He said 56 cases were aged below nine years old and 55 were under the age of 19.
A total of 24 new local cases on Wednesday was the same as Tuesday’s figure.
The Department of Health said 20 of the 24 new cases could be linked to existing outbreaks.
A total of 18 Covid-19 positive people were in isolation during their infectious period – four more than Tuesday’s figure – in a strong sign for the state.
At least 17 mystery cases have been reported in the past five days as contact tracers face a race against time to determine how Melburnians are acquiring the virus.
It comes as several bayside suburbs in Melbourne’s southeast emerged as the new Covid-19 hot spots.
On Tuesday there were five mystery cases which had cropped up across Port Phillip, Glen Eira, Bayside, and particularly the suburb of East St Kilda, with health authorities concerned the virus was circulating unchecked.
The outbreak first started after a teacher taught while infectious at a school in Truganina, in the city’s outer west.

BIG CHANGE COMING TO ASTRAZENECA The AstraZeneca vaccine is set to undergo a name change in Australia to make it easier for people who’ve received the vaccine to travel overseas.
In Australia the original name is still used, and AstraZeneca is in the process of registering the brand name Vaxzevria, which is now used in Europe.
“This minor difference, which will soon disappear, may have created misperceptions that the vaccine is not the same,” the pharmaceuticals manufacturer said in a statement on its website.
“For vaccines produced in our global supply chain that are using the original name Covid-19 Vaccine AstraZeneca, we are currently in the process of registering the trade name Vaxzevria, which is used in many other markets, including the EU.
“This will facilitate travel for people who have received AstraZeneca’s vaccine from anywhere in the world.”
The company said the difference in the name could have created confusion that the vaccine was not the same and might not be valid for European travel.
However, it said the AstraZeneca Covid-19 vaccine is the same product wherever it’s made, including at CSL in Australia.
“All manufacturing around the world is conducted using the same stringent manufacturing process, and each batch passes over 60 quality tests as part of our global robust quality assurance process,” the company said.
“The vaccine has also received emergency authorisation from the World Health Organisation.
“As such the vaccine made by CSL is a valid vaccination for travel to Europe.”
The vaccine was originally known as Covid-19 Vaccine AstraZeneca and then updated to the brand name Vaxzevria.
In Europe, the brand name Vaxzevria (previously known as Covid-19 Vaccine AstraZeneca) already has European Medicines Agency approval.
The company said more than 750 million doses of the Oxford-AstraZeneca Covid-19 vaccine have been released for supply to 170 countries in less than 12 months.
AUSSIE SENATOR IN QUARANTINE, ICU BED SHORTAGE FEARS Shadow Finance Minister Katy Gallagher is in mandatory isolation after her daughter became one of 17 positive Covid cases in Canberra yesterday.
The Labor Senator revealed her daughter Evie is “feeling pretty unwell and understandably worried about what this means for her and for the rest of her family”.
“Our household remains in strict quarantine until ACT Health advises us that we don’t need to isolate anymore,” Ms Gallagher said in a statement posted to Twitter.
“The rest of our family, including myself, have all returned negative tests. I am lucky as I am fully vaccinated. Unfortunately too many Australians have not had that opportunity.”
Ms Gallagher, who as chair of the Senate’s Covid-19 Committee has been highly critical of Australia’s response to the pandemic, did not indicate how her daughter was exposed to the virus.
“Here I sit tonight, where after doing everything right for 18 months, like millions of other families right around Australia — I am left with my children completely vulnerable to Covid-19,” she added.
FEARS OF ICU BED SHORTAGE IN NSW Almost three-quarters of NSW’s available staffed intensive care beds are full, with Covid-19 ­patients making up 10 per cent of total ICU admissions, The Australian reports.
Rising Covid case numbers have lead to a significant spike in hospitalisations, and doctors are increasingly concerned at the pressure on the state hospital system.
There are 69 Covid patients in ICU in NSW, with 25 on ventilators.
The state has 844 staffed ICU beds available, and 608 of them were occupied on Monday.
Covid cases place significant pressure on the ICU system because they require one-on-one case, and stay much longer than most other patients.
AUSTRALIA BUYS 1M PFIZER DOSES FROM POLAND Poland has sold one million Pfizer Covid vaccine doses to Australia as part of a “responsible policy of solidarity”, the Polish health minister said on Sunday.
Health Minister Adam Niedzieslki said that Poland’s vaccine purchases “allow us to meet the needs of our citizens and support others in need”.
Polish ambassador to Australia Michal Kolodziejski said: “In these tough times for our Australian friends, Poland has decided to share with Australia one million doses of Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine, with immediate delivery”.
Prime Minister Scott Morrison announced the major boost to Australia’s vaccine rollout, as
415 new cases of Covid were recorded in NSW on Sunday and four more deaths.
He said the vaccines were arriving “later tonight” and throughout the week. “In days, these jabs will start going into the arms of Australians,” Mr Morrison said at a press conference.
Mr Morrison said the new one million Pfizer doses will be targeted at Australians aged 20 to 39 years of age as they were identified in the Doherty modelling as peak transmitters for Covid-19.
“Five-hundred-and-thirty thousand of these doses will be prioritised for express delivery to the 12 Sydney local government areas where the COVID-19 outbreak continues to grow.”
Mr Morrison said the rest of the doses would be allocated to the other states and territories on a per capita basis.
“This allocation is based directly on the advice I received from the chief medical officer, Professor Kelly, his advice is based on the Doherty modelling and other work they have done about the transmissibility of the virus in those most affected areas and how they can be addressed through these additional doses,” he said.
“This will give everybody aged 20 to 39 in the 12 LGAs the opportunity to be vaccinated.”
Poland has fully vaccinated around 55 per cent of its population, but the rate of vaccinations has slowed sharply in recent months and many vaccination centres have been closed due to low demand.
Opinion polls indicate that up to a quarter of Poles are either opposed to vaccination or hesitant about getting one.

Full text: As in Australia, supply problems and isolation from the worst of the pandemic overseas have left New Zealand behind much of the world on vaccines. Only 21.5 per cent of eligible Kiwis are fully vaccinated (compared with 24.3 per cent of Australians) and about 35 per cent of Kiwis (and 46 per cent of Australians) have had one jab. But also as in Australia, the pace is picking up across the Tasman. From the beginning of next month, every New Zealander aged 16 and older will be eligible for a Pfizer shot – the only Covid vaccine approved for use in the country.
Experience overseas in the US, Britain, parts of Europe and Israel shows Ms Ardern is correct when she says opening up too early in the vaccine rollout process can result in significant Covid breakouts. Striking a balance is vital. But little is certain in dealing with Covid-19 or managing recovery. Nations can make their own decisions only based on local considerations while drawing on overseas experience. New Zealand will look at opening quarantine-free travel to vaccinated travellers from low-risk countries from the first quarter of next year.
But unlike Australia, New Zealand is not linking different phases of opening up with particular levels of vaccination coverage. Guided by modelling advice to the national cabinet from the Doherty Institute, Scott Morrison has linked the next phases of relaxing restrictions in Australia, including opening up travel, to achieving targets of 70 or 80 per cent vaccination.
While Ms Ardern’s goal is for her nation to remain Covid-free and stamp on any outbreaks quickly, even a single case can have dire consequences, especially with the highly infectious Delta strain. The ACT now is locked down after three new cases of the virus were reported, taking the territory’s total to four. Three cases were confirmed late on Thursday. The three were close contacts of a man in his 20s from Gunghalin in Canberra’s north.
Despite ongoing vaccine hesitancy, one of the few certainties is the efficacies of vaccinations. Of 62 people requiring intensive care treatment in NSW after contracting Covid-19, 57 were not vaccinated, NSW deputy chief health officer Marianne Gale confirmed on Thursday. The remaining five had one dose of AstraZeneca or Pfizer. Three of the 62 people are in their 20s, seven are in their 30s, five in their 40s, 13 in their 50s, 13 in their 60s, 19 in their 70s and two in their 80s. On the positive side, a new vaccination record was set in NSW on Wednesday with 106,000 people receiving jabs, a figure Premier Gladys Berejiklian said gave her hope. But the outlook is still grim, with 345 cases of community transmission recorded overnight on Wednesday.
After almost seven weeks, the lockdown is having a devastating economic impact on parts of NSW. But in the middle of the stubborn outbreak, Ms Berejiklian, in contrast to New Zealand’s inward-looking approach, is looking ahead, offering NSW residents the prospect of some restrictions being relaxed when 50 per cent of the population has been vaccinated. Rejecting the idea she is offering false hope, she understandably is looking to provide an incentive: “If you are fully vaccinated you might be able to undertake an activity which you can’t now; well, that is a positive. I think most people would appreciate that.”

When Sydney lockdown was recommended revealed

Author: Nilsson, Anton

Publication info: News.com.au ; Sydney, N.S.W. [Sydney, N.S.W]. 10 Aug 2021.

Full text: Chief health officer Kerry Chant told a parliamentary hearing on Tuesday that “with the benefit of hindsight”, it would have been better to lock down sooner.
“With the benefit of hindsight, I think it’s easy to say there was a greater risk of a seeding event in southwestern Sydney than was appreciated at the time it emerged,” she said.
She was referring to a superspreader birthday party in western Sydney, which Health Minister Brad Hazzard said was the single event that put the city on a path to locking down.
The hearing began just over an hour after Dr Chant announced the state’s worst-ever daily coronavirus numbers, with 356 new local cases, and more than six week after the Sydney lockdown began.
She revealed that after the spread of the Delta strain of coronavirus was first discovered in Sydney’s eastern suburbs on June 16, she waited nine days before advising the government to lock down the area.
Dr Chant said she advised the government to lock down parts of the city and the eastern suburbs on June 25, advice that the government followed the same day.
The following day, the entire city was locked down, again on the advice of Dr Chant.
The top doctor said she provided the Sydney lockdown advice in written form, but that there had been verbal discussions of locking down earlier than that.
Mr Hazzard said the initial spread in the eastern suburbs appeared to have been successfully suppressed.
But locking down became an inevitability when authorities discovered the virus was spreading fast in the city’s west after a Bondi resident went to a birthday party in West Hoxton on June 19.
The extent of that spread started emerging on June 23, but health officials believed they had the situation under control, Dr Chant said.
“The initial intelligence was that the West Hoxton party was effectively controlled (and) everyone immediately contacted within the timeframe,” Dr Chant said.
The hearing at times got testy, with Mr Hazzard complaining the committee had asked them to give testimony while he and Dr Chant were busy dealing with the outbreak.
At several points, he called questions asked to him and Dr Chant “silly” and even said one question by committee chair and Greens MP David Shoebridge was “wrong, out of order, and a waste of time”.
Mr Hazzard frequently jumped in to reply to questions that were directed at Dr Chant.
“I’m the minister, and I’ll answer,” Mr Hazzard said in reply to one question directed at Dr Chant.
At another point in the hearing, Mr Hazzard appeared to get annoyed at Labor MP Courtney Houssos for interrupting him.
“Let me finish my answers or I’m not going to bother,” he said.
He also told Mr Shoebridge it was “inappropriate” of him to challenge Dr Chant’s health advice, which led Dr Chant to respond: “It is appropriate”.
Dr Chant said that in her opinion, the state needs to have at least 70 per cent of its population vaccinated against Covid-19 before authorities can even begin having a “discussion” of easing restrictions.
Her comment came in response to a question about modelling prepared for national cabinet by the Doherty Institute.
“I can’t speak for the Premier, but certainly I’m very committed to the issues around getting our vaccine coverage up, but very much recognize that we need that 70 per cent before we have too much of a discussion about what easing restrictions look like,” Dr Chant said.
NSW Premier Gladys Berejiklian has previously said that “additional options as to what life looks like” would become available after the state has ensured at least half the population has had their shot.
Dr Chant said it appeared to her Ms Berejiklian had “very much understood” the Doherty Institute modelling and that the state’s focus was on driving community cases down.
“But obviously I acknowledge the government balances, you know, as (Mr Hazzard) has said, mental health – you know there are other health risks, and I think there is the role for government to balance those range broad range of risks.”
Mr Hazzard said the discussion about easing restrictions at a 50 per cent vaccination rate was about trying to give a “sense of hope to the community”.
“I think it's fair to say that the Premier is trying to give a sense of hope to the community and trying to drive up, also, vaccinations because once we get to that point of about 50 per cent, what we’re thinking is that we can ease back on some, some restrictions,” he said.
“But we really just need to know a lot more, we’re taking advice obviously from the entire public health team on that, so I think that the Doherty one is the crucial one obviously.”

Full text: Getting 70 per cent of the eligible population vaccinated should not be difficult over the next few months. But preventing ongoing, crippling lockdowns will be a bigger challenge.
That will rely on near-perfect handling of any increases in coronavirus cases, and as other countries show, vaccines are far from a panacea when it comes to the highly transmissible Delta variant.
The government last week fleshed out its four-phase road map towards COVID-19 normal, based on Doherty Institute modelling that found restrictions could start being wound back once 70 per cent of eligible Australians - or some 14.4 million of the 20 million Australians over 16 - had received two vaccine doses.
Prime Minister Scott Morrison has said he is confident of achieving this milestone in coming months.
Hitting the 70 per cent target would shift Australia from the initial "suppression" phase of the roadmap to the "transition" phase, with eased restrictions on vaccinated people, caps lifted on international returns and fewer lockdowns.
But this hinges on the assumption that 70 per cent coverage is enough to prevent the highly transmissible Delta variant from getting out of health authorities' control.
The Doherty modelling shows "optimal" testing, tracing, isolating and quarantine systems
- as NSW had during its
Christmas outbreaks - is key to staying open. With partially optimal measures, modelled on those seen in Victoria during its August outbreak, lockdowns become more likely.
In NSW, which reported a record 319 cases on Saturday and 283 yesterday, those systems have begun to slip. Premier Gladys Berejiklian acknowledged reports of people waiting up to a week to find out they had attended an exposure site and needed to isolate but said those cases were exceptions to the state's strong contact tracing.
"If we need further resources we will make sure it happens, but there is no doubt that the more cases you have, the more the challenge," she said on Friday.
The state has requested assistance with contact tracing, and its testing capability has been stretched. So far, 46.2 per cent of NSW's eligible population has received one dose and 23 per cent has had two.
Australia-wide, 44 per cent of the eligible population has received one dose and 22.5 per cent is fully vaccinated.
Vaccination rates are still well below the percentages modelled by Doherty to prevent ongoing lockdowns, but the experience overseas shows there may be no magic number.
Israel has been one of the most successful countries so far on the vaccination front, with about 62 per cent of its population fully immunised.
But that has not stopped a large increase in cases. Israel dropped almost all public health measures in June, when 60 per cent of the population was covered by one dose and coronavirus cases were in the single digits. Cases began to pick up later that month and have now swelled to well over 2500 a day, according to Our World in Data, leading the nation to reinstate some public health measures.
In Canada, 72 per cent of the population is covered by at least one dose. Cases there dropped dramatically from highs in the 8000s in April and May to fewer than 500 a day in June and July, but have again begun to rise.
Australia's initial target of vaccinating 70 per cent of eligible over-16s means 56 per cent of the total population will be covered, which the modelling shows will inevitably lead to a rise in cases. The question is how long the country's protective measures would be able to withstand the strain before a lockdown was needed.
The Doherty modelling forecasts the 70 per cent target will be reached by the start of November, and 80 per cent coverage before the end of that month, triggering a further easing of restrictions.
But Health Minister Greg Hunt did not want to play that guessing game last week.
"In terms of the 70 and 80 per cent targets, that's a challenge
for all of us, so we're not putting a time frame on that," he told reporters last Monday.
"The goal that we're setting is to ensure that every Australian who seeks to be vaccinated can be vaccinated this year."
Reaching the vaccination targets also relies on receiving consistent supplies of vaccines.
The rollout was bolstered yesterday with news the medical regulator had approved Moderna's vaccine, with the first million doses to arrive next month. But while CSL is producing 1 million doses of the AstraZeneca vaccine a week in Melbourne, and shipments of Pfizer have continued to increase, the deliveries are not set in stone.
As one public health expert noted recently, the only certainty in this pandemic is uncertainty.
All this suggests lockdowns
and restrictions will continue for some time.

Full text: Residents in the 11 local government areas released from an eight-day snap lockdown on Sunday afternoon will have to wear masks at all times in high schools and workplaces, even when social distancing is possible.
It comes as Premier Annastacia Palaszczuk warned the state should get used to months of rolling lockdowns, warning people to be “under no illusion” there won’t be more outbreaks.
As southeast Queensland came out of lockdown, Cairns residents were ordered to stay at home for three days to deal with a troubling case of a taxi driver who had been contagious in the community for 10 days.
Infectious diseases specialist Associate Professor Paul Griffin said people should not be waiting for a “freedom day”, like that celebrated in the UK, but should get used to continuing restrictions to deal with the Delta strain.
The warnings came as Queensland recorded 9 new cases, 7 of which were linked to the Indooroopilly cluster.
An eighth was a mystery case in Cairns that has plunged that city into lockdown and a ninth was a Gold Coast case that is under investigation after one positive test and two negatives.
Ms Palaszczuk said southeast Queenslanders should be “very pleased” to be leaving lockdown and be going into a fortnight of continued, but lessened, restrictions.
Under the new restrictions, people must continue to wear masks at all times unless a person is alone or in their household group, exercising vigorously, or seated and eating.
They must also be worn at all times at workplaces, even when social distancing is possible, unless in an office alone, and by all teachers and high school students.
Groups of up to 10 are allowed to gather at homes and parks, and 20 people are allowed at weddings and funerals.
NED-4196-QLD-Restrictions-lifting
Businesses and venues are capped at 50 per cent capacity.
“I think Queenslanders should be under no illusion that we just don’t know when the next outbreak is going to be,” the premier said.
“So that’s why it’s absolutely imperative to wear your mask, if you’re sick go and get tested and, when it’s your turn, go and get vaccinated.”
In a piece for The Courier-Mail today, Ms Palaszczuk said Delta’s rapid escalation had “brought misery and death across NSW and seen the return to lockdown in Victoria”.
“These are examples to us of what we don’t want to happen and what we must strive to prevent.”
Ms Palaszczuk’s comments came as she completed a two-week hotel quarantine after she and Brisbane Lord Mayor Adrian Schrinner travelled to the Tokyo Olympics to secure the future Games for Brisbane.
chief health officer Dr Jeannette Young said lockdowns would be needed for as little as one community case when the risk was high enough, with leaders agreeing the measure was the best one to quash the virus until vaccination rates reached a 70 per cent target.
That’s expected to be reached in about November, but will depend on vaccine supply.
Dr Young said her decisions around lockdown would always depend on factors, but said the virus had changed since last year, and tougher measures were likely here to stay for several months yet.
Asked what other levers she could pull in the case of an uncontrolled outbreak in Queensland, she said she had already instituted the toughest lockdown to date last week in the southeast where no visitors were allowed.
“So it’s not really about us having levers to pull, it’s about people complying with the levers we’ve got and people did comply and you can see that (with the results),” she said.
Dr Griffin said people should realise that there wouldn’t be a return to normalcy in the current environment.
“I don’t think there‘s going to come a day where we’re going to see a freedom day,” he said.
“I think that’s unrealistic to expect.
“I think that concept of returning to complete normality is one that is not realistic or safe or ideal in any way.”
He said people would need to ensure their alert levels remained high, and that complacency didn’t creep back in.
“It’s easy to dismiss the snotty nose in kids but at the moment we have to assume it’s Covid rather than the other way around (and get tested),” he said.
NED-4301-Qld locally acquired Covid-19 cases
Operation Covid Shield boss Lieutenant-General JJ Frewen has said it will be “mathematically” possible for the nation to reach 80 per cent coverage by the end of the year.
“I think we‘ll have the supply. We’ll have the distribution notes, but it really is about people in Australia coming forward and coming forward with some urgency to get vaccinated,” he said.
There is a significant increase in the vaccine rollout planned from next month, informed by modelling from the Doherty Institute, as more supplies become available.
The Doherty Institute modelling expected 80 per cent of the population to be vaccinated by the end of November.
Mass workplace vaccinations, drive through facilities, jabs offered at shopping centres and places of worship and even school programs are expected from December.
The modelling revealed that even if an 80 per vaccination rate is met, about 1300 people would die over six months in an out-of-control outbreak with minimal restrictions.
Federal Health Minister Greg Hunt said, pending Therapeutic Goods Administration Approval, 1 million doses of Moderna would arrive in September, then 3 million a month for October through December.
“That‘s on top of the very significant increase, the effective doubling of Pfizer from the million (doses) a week towards the 2 million a week,” Mr Hunt said.

Vaccination levels pave way back to work

Full text: With 4.4 million jabs administered in NSW, the Premier insisted on Sunday that some restrictions could be eased at a threshold of 50 to 60 per cent of the population vaccinated – much lower than the 70 to 80 per cent target set by the Doherty Institute modelling for the federal government released last week.
But Gladys Berejiklian denied suggestions her targets were at odds with Scott Morrison’s, saying that the federal target applied to pre-lockdown level restrictions.
“We are currently in lockdown, and lockdown plus some level of easing of restrictions is possible once we get to 50 or 60 per cent rates of vaccination,” she said. “It doesn’t mean you get to what you would ease if you are at 70 per cent, but there are certainly opportunities for us to look at what we can ease in September; so long as we hit our vaccination targets, we can look for opportunities as to how we live in the month of September.”
About 40 per cent of people across NSW have received at least one jab, with the government ­organising special weekend mass vaccinations for groups of essential workers.
A “Super Sunday” vaccination was held at Sydney Olympic Park for supermarket workers, cafe and restaurant staff, with 5000 doses on AstraZeneca on offer. A similar event will be held for 8000 construction workers next Sunday.
The Premier discounted the prospect of mandatory vaccinations but again suggested incentives would be offered for people to get jabbed in exchange for greater freedoms such as the ability to work.
“I urge people now to come ­forward and get vaccinated, ­especially if you are in a job which traditionally has a lot to do with people, if it has face-to-face contact,” she said.
“We encourage you to get vaccinated as soon as possible, so that we have options moving forward into September about how we can move forward more freely.”
An indication of how that might play out came with the ­announcement that construction workers from the worst hit local government areas would be able to return to work sites provided the locations remained at half ­capacity – and that the workers were vaccinated. From Wednesday workers from those LGAs will have to be able to show proof of immunisation or of a negative Covid-19 test result. Rapid antigen testing is likely to be approved soon to speed up the process.
Harsh lockdown restrictions were extended into large parts of Penrith on Sunday, as the Covid-19 outbreak spread from its current Canterbury-Bankstown cluster.
With case numbers only marginally down – 262 new cases ­reported, with fewer than a third isolating while infectious – the government said it had no choice but to extend the lockdown to 12 suburbs close to the eight LGAs ­already subject to the harshest restrictions.
Residents in those 12 suburbs must stay in their local government area and can leave only for work if they are an essential worker.
Health authorities are concerned by the large numbers of new cases that were infectious while out in the community. At least 72 of the 262 new cases ­ were not in isolation during all or part of their infectious period, with the isolation status of a further 104 still under investigation.
There are now 362 cases in hospital, with 58 in intensive care and 24 cases needing ventilators to breathe.
An unvaccinated woman in her 80s from the Wyoming Nursing Home in Summer Hill, in Sydney’s inner west, died at Royal Prince Alfred Hospital on Saturday.

UNMASKING THE PATH TO FREEDOM

Full text: The road map out of lockdown is far from clear, but this is what we know for sure With 16 million Australians fighting the Delta strand in lockdown and hardship, the emotional and policy dilemma only becomes inescapable – the nation cannot live in this way yet it is doomed to ­suffer periodic lockdowns until the 70-80 per cent vaccination ­target is reached.
Australians face a grim four-month period until November. Personal trauma and economic pain will intensify. There is no sign of progress for NSW in its protracted lockdown. Victoria has entered its sixth lockdown. Southeast Queensland may get a reprieve this week.
Apprehension is deepening across the country. For many in lockdown each day resembles a reoccurring misery.
The frustration arises from the lack of progress, the sense the Delta strand is outpacing our health resources. Politicians fight and medical experts pontificate. There is no immediate escape – but there is an escape.
Things will get better. This view is founded in science not just hope. The problem is that things may get worse before they get better. And when they get better the virus won’t be gone. The fight against Covid will merely take a new form with the public far better protected, in full vaccinated armour.
There are no certainties. But the best way to understand the coming trade-offs remains the pathway endorsed by national cabinet based on Doherty Institute modelling and Treasury analysis released this week.
Here are some relevant questions and answers.
Q: What vaccination rate delivers assured herd immunity?
A: As Professor Jodie McVernon from the Doherty Institute said, there is no “magic number”, no ­binary cut-off that delivers “life as normal”. This is not the way to think. Vaccination coverage is a continuum. Every person vaccinated helps to reduce transmission. Doherty modelling suggests having rates at 70-80 per cent means the need for long, stringent measures and lockdowns will be “substantially reduced”.
McVernon told Inquirer: “With Delta and the vaccines that we have we never get to this magic number where the reproduction number or transmission potential is one or less, meaning that outbreaks would not take off. But we can still significantly restrain the spread of the virus with vaccination. It is definitely our pathway out of the cycle of lockdown.” The point is that all these ­options are suboptimal. That’s the reality. “The vaccines we have are good but no vaccines are perfect,” McVernon said.
How long before the 70-80 per cent double dose rates can be achieved? Scott Morrison expects to reach 70 per cent later this year, perhaps by November. Program co-ordinator, Lieutenant General John Frewen said there was a “really good opportunity” to hit 70 per cent and even “potentially” 80 per cent this year. Government research suggests 77 per cent of people have no problem with vaccines. Above this, it gets harder.
Frewen said 80 per cent demands a “concerted effort”. Doherty modelling had 70 and 80 per cent reached at November 1 and 22. With lockdowns operating as incentives, an 80 per cent target should be feasible this year – a bonus from current hardship. One problem is lagging states, notably Western Australia.
What happens at 70 and 80 per cent coverage?
The virus is not beaten. But at this point the main trade-off kicks in: because the rates of severe ­infection are reduced, stringent measures and lockdowns can be reduced.
At 80 per cent, the plan is that lockdowns would not be needed for entire states and extended areas, though localised, targeted lockdowns could still be needed.
But the Doherty modelling reveals the ongoing importance of the “test, trace, isolate and quarantine” (TTIQ) capability.
This stays as a permanent feature of our health system, public policy and social life. It is vital for public ­protection. Vaccination alone ­cannot solve the problem. Thinking that it can will lead to failure. Vaccination is necessary but not sufficient.
“There is no one fix to this virus,” McVernon said.
“We are ­relying on the synergies of intervention to support each other. We have to keep going with the public health TTIQ response and vaccination will markedly assist that.” Vaccination is “a very big part of the answer but it is not the whole answer”.
How significant is the difference between 50-60 per cent vaccination and 70-80 per cent?
This difference looms large in the modelling. It suggests that opening up at the 50-60 per cent range would be dangerous folly. This is a stark warning to politicians, ­notably to NSW Premier Gladys Berejiklian who earlier in the week was talking about some easing of restrictions at August 29 when, she hopes, NSW reaches 50 per cent coverage (yet that is just one dose).
“At 50 and 60 per cent we anticipate rapidly growing outbreaks that would be very difficult to control and would require stringent social measures,” McVernon said. By that she means Victoria’s phase four lockdown from 2020. Can you imagine the devastating impact if half the population was vaccinated but a massive lockdown was still required?
Two conclusions flow from this. Vaccination cannot be Sydney’s solution before November, hence the need for its lockdown to work. And the entire country faces the prospect of “on and off” lockdowns for the next three to four months.
Even assessing the 70 per cent vaccination scenario, McVernon said the public health (TTIQ) response would be vital to ensure what might “otherwise be a bushfire” was kept to a “controlled backburn”. The Doherty modelling opening-up scenario had infections running four times as great at 50 per cent compared with 80 per cent and deaths running about seven times as great.
What does the modelling say about the demands from conservatives and libertarians for the current lockdowns to be abandoned or seriously eased at this point?
It suggests the risks would be enormous, bordering on the reckless. Obviously, no premier would ­contemplate such action for the obvious reason – the vaccination coverage is not high enough. Any such action would run counter to all the official health advice.
How great is the change in public mindset required to move from the lockdown to vaccination phase?
It is significant and won’t be easy. Morrison’s language now is that we must “learn to live with the virus”. His hope once phase 3 is reached – the 80 per cent phase – is that the public will perceive this as “not unlike living with an infectious disease like the flu”. This involves a dramatic shift in outlook, but one Australians must make.
Chief Medical Officer Paul Kelly said the transformation involved moving from the current phase – suppression designed to eliminate any community transmission – to a new phase where “we need to accept” hospitalisation, ICU admissions and deaths, accepting them as part of living with the virus and seeking to limit its impact. It means moving away from the goal of eliminating any community transmission.
How can the vaccine rollout be geared to minimise transmission of the virus? The Doherty modelling is strong on this point. It shows the way people are vaccinated is critical. The peak spreaders of Covid-19 are people in the 20-39 years age range. They bring it home either to their children or their parents. McVernon said the original road map – targeting the older and most vulnerable – was correct. We had been right to focus on risk reduction as the priority.
But from this point, the recommendation is to focus on transmission. “Immunising younger people and reducing transmission is critical to maximising the gains of a whole population program,” McVernon said. The aim is to bring forward vaccination of the 30-39 age group to the start of September and the 16-29 group to early in ­October. By the time of any shift to stage 3, the vaccination rate for those aged 60 years and older should be 90 per cent.
How can Australia try to “normalise” the battle against the virus going into 2022?
The essential means is by vaccination. This is the road towards a new normal. There is a possible stumbling block – the demon of another more transmissible variant. Yet further vaccination boosters will continue to be rolled out in 2022 and 2023. Morrison uses the context of the flu to seek a path ­towards normalisation and to ­prepare the public for the renewed debate about hospitalisation, ICU admissions and death rates.
Average annual deaths from ­influenza over 2016-19 were 642. Comparisons with flu can work providing the combined impact of all interventions succeeds in limiting community transmission. The “sweet spot” in the Doherty modelling shows that by combining a “transmission-reducing” vaccine rollout with an effective TTIQ public health capability and a high vaccination target, the health outcomes could be improved around 100-fold or more.
They key is to get right the three key policies – the high vaccination coverage, the strong TTIQ health response, and the vaccine rollout. It is interventions working together that matter.
Is the government pledged to giving special exemptions to those Australians who get vaccinated?
Morrison is pledged to this principle but he believes its implementation rests with the premiers, business and various institutions. The PM said the national road map from phase 2 (the 70 per cent trigger) provides for exemptions for vaccinated people. Presumably this will apply before the end of 2021. Such exemptions will only become far more prominent under phase 3 (the 80 per cent trigger).
The justification is clear: the vaccinated are a lower public risk. There is a public interest and ethical basis for exemptions. Majority public support can be assumed. But Morrison’s initial response is that these public health issues lie within the realm of the states.
The federal government has no plan to pass new laws on the subject of exemptions. Morrison said on Friday Australia has no mandatory vaccination policy and businesses and institutions need to make their own judgments.
Obviously, business must ensure it acts on a legal basis in whatever actions it takes.
What incentives might be given to encourage people to be vaccinated? Decisions on this are still awaiting. Frewen said this week that “demand is still exceeding supply”, while Morrison said late Friday the vaccine rollout has turned the corner there are still supply issues. Morrison and Frewen say the main incentive for vaccination is the practical impact of people doing the right thing, protecting their health and safeguarding their ­family and friends. Frewen said down the track a range of options will be assessed, including cash and lotteries. But Morrison drew a line in the sand this week. He savaged Opposition Leader Anthony Albanese’s $300 cash payment for anybody getting vaccinated. Morrison declared this a vote of “no confidence” in the integrity of Australians. He will fight it and seek to hang this idea around Labor’s head.
Does the Doherty report have any relevance for the ongoing ­debate over the type of vaccine, AstraZeneca versus Pfizer?
Its findings are dramatic and deserve great publicity. Full AZ vaccine coverage is comparable to full Pfizer coverage in reducing death and hospitalisation. In terms of reducing hospitalisation, AZ rates at 86 per cent compared with Pfizer at 87 per cent. On the ICU admission measure they also compare at 86 per cent to 87 per cent. On deaths AZ reduction effectiveness is 90 per cent compared with 92 per cent for Pfizer. “We have two highly effective vaccines,” McVernon said.
What can Australia learn from the current overseas experience? McVernon said she felt the current northern hemisphere experience validated the argument being put to national cabinet: “When we look at countries that have reopening to this Freedom Day concept, the Netherlands within two weeks was going back to restrictions in bars, nightclubs and restaurants because even at a reasonable high level of coverage – but lower that we are aspiring to – they saw ongoing social measures were needed to rein in the virus.” The point is Australia rejects totally any idea that freedom is possible by abandoning the testing, tracing, isolating, quarantining and some social restrictions that have defined the past 18 months. The modelling shows these capabilities are essential and Australians need to understand this point.
What happens over the next several months before we reach the 70-80 per cent targets?
The national cabinet has agreed that during this “suppression” phase the response must be “early, stringent, short lockdowns”. This is now the universal view among Australian governments held by the PM, premiers, the Doherty ­Institute and Treasury.
Morrison has changed his stance on lockdowns because the Delta variant has changed everything. While Morrison backed the initial reluctance of Berejiklian to lock down, he now warns that ­lockdown is the “primary tool” in Sydney. Morrison will support ­premiers, such as Victoria’s Dan Andrews, resorting to the short, tough lockdown. Morrison’s message is that while the suppression phase lasts, it is the premiers who will take the decisions and carry the responsibility for lockdowns – yet nobody will forget it’s all still a function of the delayed vaccine rollout.

Full text: The NSW Opposition says it will support tougher lockdown measures to try to reign in the state’s spiralling Covid crisis, after 319 new cases on Saturday marked the state’s darkest day this year.
Five weeks into the current Greater Sydney lockdown, NSW Health Minister Brad Hazzard revealed a third of Saturday’s new cases were out and about in the community while infectious, despite daily pleas for people to stay home.
Five more deaths - including three linked to a ballooning cluster at Liverpool Hospital’s geriatric ward sparked by an infected nurse - have pushed the death toll from this outbreak to 27, with authorities citing a growing number of young people left desperately ill with Delta and requiring ventilation in intensive care.
Meanwhile, a new epicentre of the virus is emerging in the Canterbury-Bankstown local government area. Mr Hazzard said general compliance with public health orders as well as the region’s reliance on manufacturing and distribution industries were behind the spread there.
“The NSW government must hold to the strategy of bringing community transmission to zero or close to zero,” Labor leader Chris Minns told The Daily Telegraph.“If the CHO and NSW government think that more measures are needed, NSW Labor will support them.”
More than 340 people are now in hospital in NSW with coronavirus, 56 of them in intensive care. Of those, four are in their 20s, four are in their 30s, and three are in their 40s.
“So this disease is infecting people of all ages,” Deputy Chief Health Officer Jeremy McAnulty said on Saturday.
“Of the 56 people in ICU, 51 were not vaccinated at all, four had received the first to dose of AstraZeneca vaccine, and one has received the first dose of the Pfizer vaccines.”
Premier Gladys Berejiklian was criticised on social media for not attending Saturday’s press conference, instead leaving it to Mr Hazzard, who announced the 319 figure and a seven-day lockdown in regional Armidale after cases were detected there.
Victorians were also dealt a blow, with 29 new cases - the state’s highest daily increase in this second wave - casting doubt over the likelihood of lockdown 6.0 lifting next by week.
Premier Daniel Andrews conceded mystery cases were behind two separate outbreaks in the city’s west, with genomic testing pointing to a link with NSW’s Delta outbreak.
Cormac Pearson 9.00pm: ‘Knife’s edge’: QLD Health Minister’s plea
Queensland Health Minister Yvette D’Ath has called on Queenslanders not to “undo all the hard work” after footage showed people mingling at a popular market in Brisbane this morning.
Footage showed groups of people sitting together at the Jan Powers Farmers Markets at Brisbane Powerhouse in New Farm which is classified as essential, with some seemingly without masks.
“With southeast Queensland on a knife-edge, we’re asking everyone to stay home and not leave their front door unless it’s absolutely necessary,” Ms D’Ath said.
“Now is not the time to undo all our great work, and eating out at the markets can probably wait.
“The purpose of allowing food stalls is for people to get essential groceries or takeaway food.
“If you go out, mask-up and socially distance – that’s what will get us through this.”
People took to social media in anger at the scenes with a decision on the end of the lockdown looming on Sunday.
Staff writers 8.30pm: Construction workers in hotspots to return to work
The NSW government has announced unoccupied construction sites across Greater Sydney will operate at 50 per cent capacity from this Wednesday with enhanced COVID safe measures.
Deputy Premier John Barilaro said next week unoccupied construction sites will resume work with new worksite capacity limits and minimum vaccination requirements for workers from the eight affected local government areas (LGAs) including Blacktown, Campbelltown, Canterbury-Bankstown, Cumberland, Fairfield, Georges River, Liverpool and Parramatta.
“We want workers back on the tools, but we need to continue to keep this virus at bay, and so by opening unoccupied worksites at 50 per cent capacity and vaccinating workers from within those affected LGAs, we can achieve both,” Mr Barilaro said.
“Construction workers from the affected LGAs will be added to the list of authorised workers allowing them to work on unoccupied construction sites in Greater Sydney if they meet the vaccination conditions.”
Construction workers from affected LGAs must provide evidence that they have received:
· two doses of a COVID-19 vaccine, or
· one dose of a COVID-19 vaccine at least three weeks before attending work, or
· one dose of a COVID-19 vaccine and, if less than three weeks since that vaccine was administered, a negative COVID-19 test in the previous 72 hours.
Staff writers 7.30pm: Labor will support tougher measures: Minns
NSW Labor leader Chris Minns said the State opposition would support further measures to bring the current outbreak under control should chief health officer Dr Kerry Chant suggest they were needed.
“The NSW Government must hold to the strategy of bringing community transmission to zero or close to zero,” he said. “If the CHO and NSW Government think that more measures are needed, NSW Labor will support them.
“We’re six weeks into this lockdown. Workers and businesses can’t afford months of rolling lockdowns. The people of NSW want the Government to get on top of the outbreak now.”
It comes after Australia’s most senior health official delivered a blunt assessment of the worsening Covid-19 situation in NSW as case numbers continue to soar.
Dr Paul Kelly said there were still worrying signs in Sydney in terms of unlinked cases, new chains of transmission, new exposure sites and geographic spread.
“There is clearly a need for a circuit-breaker. I’ve had many discussions with my colleague in NSW around that.”

Rhiannon Down 6.30pm: NSW regional train route listed as exposure site
The regional train line from Broadmeadow to Armidale has been added to NSW’s list of exposure sites as the town in the state’s Northern Tablelands heads towards a one week lockdown starting at 5pm today.
Anyone who travelled on the XPT Regional Train from from Broadmeadow
to Armidale via Werris Creek on Thursday July 29 from 11.40am to 5.30pm has been asked to isolate and get tested.
It comes as reports of panic buying emerged from the regional centre, after the town became the third seeding event of the virus from Sydney, with Newcastle also in lockdown after a major infection scare.
Belmore Physiotherapy and Sports Injury Centre and Commonwealth Bank in Burwood both in Sydney have also been added to NSW’s list of exposure sites.
Rebecca Urban 5.30pm: HSC students told to get jabs
Year 12 students in Sydney’s tightly locked-down west and southwest have been urged to come forward to get vaccinated after the state government ordered them to continue to learn from home for the “foreseeable future”.
A flexible operating model for schools across Greater Sydney was announced on Friday, requiring all HSC exams to be conducted remotely but paving the way for HSC students to attend campus for learning or wellbeing support deemed “essential”.
The plan does not equate to a return to full-time schooling, with only small groups of students allowed on-site at a time and for no longer than two hours a day.
The proposal also does not extend to students living or learning in the eight local government areas of concern – Blacktown, Campbelltown, Fairfield, Canterbury-Bankstown, Cumberland, Georges River, Liverpool and Parramatta – with a return deemed too risky.

Rhiannon Down 4.00pm: Vic tops 100 exposure sites, amid flight warning
A string of venues across Melbourne’s west have been added to Victoria’s list of exposure sites, as the number of hotspot venues reaches 100.
The new venues include Liquorland, United Chemists and The Lott at Taylors Hill Village Shopping Centre as well as multiple outlets at Caroline Springs (CS) Square Shopping Centre including Caroline Springs Pharmacy, with the full list available on the Department of Health website.
It comes after Victorian authorities raised the alarm about possible exposure which took place on a flight on July 15, after two family members of a Maribyrnong case who had just been released from Sydney hotel quarantine before travelling to Melbourne tested positive.
Victoria’s Covid-19 Response Commander Jeroen Weimar said the two people were “one of a number of possible leads” as to the source of the Melbourne outbreak.
The flight has not yet been added to Victoria’s list of exposure sites.
Victorian Premier Daniel Andrews confirmed this morning that the travellers was one of several “lines of inquiry” being investigated.
“We’re not running a commentary on NSW hotel quarantine or anything like that,” Mr Andrews said.
“But it is of sufficient concern that Jeroen has given out the flight number and we anticipate contacting each and every person who was on that flight.
“Not just because they might be a risk to public health now, but… they might fill in some of the blanks if you like as we look backwards and look up the stream, which is very important as well.”
Natasha Robinson 3.30pm: Novavax booster doses to soon join stockpile
Novavax will apply for approval for its Covid-19 vaccine in Australia “within weeks” of making a similar application to regulators in Britain next month.
Although the company confirmed it would begin shipping doses to select countries by the end of August, the vaccine is not expected to begin arriving in Australia until after October, later than expected because of manufacturing delays.
The company has again delayed its application to the Food and Drug Administration for approval of its vaccine, with doses not expected to be supplied to the US until year’s end, but it has progressed with its first applications to regulators in India, Indonesia and The Philippines, and will begin shipping the first 100 million doses of its protein-based vaccine to those countries at the end of August.
Novavax expects to increase production to 150 million doses a month by the end of the year, and some of those doses will be shipped to Australia.

Frances Vinall 3pm: Qld police reveal photo of quarantine escapee
Queensland Police have released an image of a woman who they say escaped from hotel quarantine on Tuesday night.
A spokesperson said the 24-year-old woman absconded from a Gold Coast quarantine hotel on August 3 and it is believed she may currently be in the Caboolture or Narangba area.
She was ordered into 14 days of isolation at the Sofitel at Broadbeach on Monday.
But the following night she forced her way through a glass door to escape and remains on the run, police say.
The woman was tested on Tuesday which returned a negative result but a police spokesperson said further testing was required to confirm her Covid-19 status.
She had been placed into quarantine after she had travelled from the declared hotspot of New South Wales.
She was intercepted on July 31 at a border control check point by Queensland Police, a police spokesperson said.
“She left all her property behind, only taking her phone,” they said.
“Numerous inquiries have been made with friends and family but she has not been located.”
Police are urging anyone who may have seen the woman pictured or know of her whereabouts to contact Policelink or Crime Stoppers.

Angie Raphael 2.35pm: State gets major Pfizer boost
Victoria will soon have access to 150,000 more doses of the Pfizer vaccine after striking up a deal with the Prime Minister.
It comes as Victoria recorded 29 new cases on Saturday during the state’s sixth lockdown since the pandemic started.
Premier Daniel Andrews revealed more Pfizer jabs would soon be delivered to the state.
“Last night, I was very pleased to be informed by the Prime Minister ... that we will receive just under 150,000 additional doses of Pfizer,” he told reporters.
Mr Andrews said the decision came after a request had been made by the national cabinet and at an officer level before that.
The doses have been reallocated from a delivery planned for September.
“We’ll have announcements to make about where those extra doses will go and whether there’s any change to the way that the vaccine will be rolled out because we’ve got that supply,” Mr Andrews said.
“I do stress ... it’s not 150,000 we were never getting. It is a bring forward. It will all even out over time.”
More than 22,000 jabs were administered on Friday.
Mr Andrews also said the government would have more to say “quite soon” about making AstraZeneca vaccines available for people under the age of 60 at state-run vaccination hubs.
Younger Victorians can currently only get the AstraZeneca jab through GP clinics.

Rhiannon Down 1.53pm: Geriatric ward a major site of infection
Liverpool Hospital has emerged as a major site of infection after 29 patients from the geriatric ward and four staff contracted Covid-19 from staff members who unknowingly worked while infectious.
It comes after four of today’s five deaths were revealed to be linked to the hospital.
“Condolences go out to those families for those people who have died,” NSW Health’s Dr Jeremy McAnulty said.
“The hospital take this very seriously, this is a tragedy to occur, and everyone is working very hard at the facility, and across NSW Health to protect patients, and staff members, so there were are a range of measures that take place when we have cases, or exposure to cases in hospitals or other health settings, of which we have had many of this outbreak.
“Added to that is a careful review of infection control, and making sure that people who have been exposed are given the right information about what they need to do in terms of isolation, and further testing.”

Rhiannon Down 1.30pm: NSW Health backflips on Year 12 plan
NSW Health has backflipped on it’s proposal to bus Year 12 students in Sydney’s west into the Qudos Bank Arena to receive their Pfizer jabs to enable them to complete the HSC.
Health Minister Brad Hazzard said the decision was made not to transport the students due to issues surrounding supervision, and they would now have to make their own arrangements.
“Education did their bit, trying hard to work with health on the buses but let’s just say the staff apparently weren’t that keen to be supervising the education staff,” he said.
“In the end it was decided that a lot of the kids, young people have their own licenses anyway and their mums and dads have indicated they will be more than happy to take them so it is just a reasonable way to do it.
NSW Health's Dr Jeremy McAnulty says Canterbury-Bankstown is the "number one LGA for cases" following the state recording 319 new locally acquired cases.
“As long as we get the young people along, and thank you for the opportunity to say a link has been sent to all 24,000 young people.”
The vaccination drive for Year 12 students will begin on Monday August 9.

Rhiannon Down 1pm: Eight test positive in Melbourne public housing tower
The residents of a Flemington public housing tower will undergo testing after eight people within one family living in the building tested positive for Covid-19.
“Those eight positive cases relocated two days ago and last night,” Victoria’s Covid-19 Response Commander Jeroen Weimar said.
“One group left two days ago and one left last night. They are now in alternative and safe accommodation.
“We will undertake full testing of the rest of that housing building. That work is underway.
“Residents have been informed this morning and will continue to work over the coming days as we always do with complex apartment buildings, we will provide food and welfare support for the community.
“They will complete isolation, get tested and do the right thing.”

Frances Vinall 12.50pm: Minister ‘sorry’ as virus escapes to the regions
Armidale in regional NSW will go into lockdown from 5pm on Saturday after two Covid-19 cases were detected in the area.
NSW Covid-19 Public Health Response Branch executive director Jeremy McAnulty said the cases were a woman who recently travelled to Newcastle and one of her household contacts.
The Armidale Local Government Area will go into lockdown for one week with the same rules as Sydney and Newcastle, NSW Health Minister Brad Hazzard confirmed.
“(That) includes the major city of Armidale, that is about 25,000 people,” he said.
“On the advice of a public health unit, and Dr (Kerry) Chant’s team, Armidale LGA will have to be put into a lockdown,” he said.
“I’m sorry to that people of Armadale local council area, I would say to you... this is been out of care and concern for your area.”
Mr Hazzard said the woman who travelled from Newcastle to Covid-free Armidale had “possibly” broken the rules with investigations ongoing.
“At the moment our focus is not on the punitive side, it is on trying to talk to the individuals.”
The seven-day lockdown from 5pm would allow a health team to get on top of the situation, he said.
“If I were living in the area I would not be going out of the house today, I would be staying at home,” he said.
Authorities are also concerned about another regional area, with sewage detections of Covid-19 in Dubbo.
Dr McNulty said there were no known cases in Dubbo and urged residents to get tested.
“Take it very seriously,” he said.
“If there is a case there, we need to find it to ensure the community is safe.”
In the Hunter New England region including Newcastle, six new cases were detected on Saturday.

Rhiannon Down 12.36pm: Victorian outbreak believed linked to NSW
Victoria’s latest Covid-19 outbreak is believed to be genomically linked to the NSW Delta outbreak, though an “absolute match” has not yet been found.
Victoria’s COVID Response Commander Jeroen Weimar said the Hobsons Bay strand had been confirmed to be linked to the Delta variant.
“We haven’t found a match to existing clusters here in Victoria or anywhere else in Australia but we are doing ongoing matching with other Australian rates,” he said.
“It is very closely associated with the NSW cluster and with the City of Hume and other clusters we have worked on here in Victoria there is a close commonality of the Delta strain and those clusters but more genomic work is being done.
“We don’t yet have an absolute match.”
Victorian Premier Daniel Andrews said the source of the outbreak was “definitely NSW” and “definitely Delta”, though genomic tracing was yet to reveal the full picture.
“The question is, to what extent is it actually linked,” Mr Andrews said.

Rhiannon Down 12.16pm: New Victorian cases spread across two growing clusters
Victorian contact tracers are racing against the clock to contact 5520 close contacts linked to the latest outbreak, which plunged the state into a week-long lockdown on Friday.
The Victorian Premier has also continued to ram home the importance of getting tested at the first sign of illness, as the state recorded its biggest daily spike in infections on Saturday.
All of the 29 new cases today were out in the community during their infectious period.
“It is non-negotiable, you cannot wait one hour, cannot wait one afternoon,” Daniel Andrews has told a press conference.
“If you’ve got symptoms, a little cold and flu, the doctors tell us, in the community, that you have got to assume that you have got Covid, so please come to get tested.”
“That is how we shut this down, that is how we get lost just running alongside these cases, that is how we get out in front of it.”
Testing Commander Jeroen Weimar said Victoria now had 95 active cases in the community.
“Thirty of the active cases are associated with the Hobson’s Bay cluster,” he said.
“Eight active cases are with the city of Maribyrnong cluster. We have a total of 5520 primary close contacts. Three and a half thousand are associated with those outbreaks.
“We have 82 public exposure sites but those sites will continue to evolve over the coming days as we complete our contact tracing discussions with the new cases.
“In terms of the new cases reported today, four of those cases are family members in the City of Maribyrnong cluster. That was at four yesterday and at eight now. In terms of all other cases, all the other 25 today are associated with the Hobson’s Bay cluster.”

Rhiannon Down 11.50am : Delta epicentre moves to Canterbury-Bankstown area
NSW Health authorities say the epicentre of the virus has now shifted to the Canterbury-Bankstown area in Sydney’s west.
It comes after 92 cases were recorded in the LGA in the past 24 hours, while case numbers have declined in the Fairfield LGA.
“This is now the number one LGA for cases with 92 cases from yesterday from the Canterbury-Bankstown location,” NSW Health’s Dr Jeremy McAnulty said.
A voucher scheme is being considered in New South Wales to boost vaccination rates.
“We have had 489 cases in the last week so that is the most prominent LGA.
“People in the Canterbury-Bankstown LGA, please take extreme caution and follow the stay-at-home roles, follow all the rules for authorised workers, and keep each other safe.”

Christine Kellett 11.44am: Five now dead linked to Sydney hospital cluster
Of the five Covid-related deaths in NSW announced today, the youngest was a man in his 60s.
NSW Health Jeremy McAnulty said the others were a woman and two men in their 80s, and man in his 90s. Three of them died at Liverpool Hospital, which is at the centre of a growing outbreak.
So far four staff and 29 patients have been infected at the hospital, with five people dying as a result of the cluster.
Dr McAnulty said the hospital was reviewing its infection control procedures.
“Condolences go out to those families for those people who have died,” Dr McAnulty said.
“The hospital take this very seriously, this is a tragedy for this to occur, and everyone is working very hard at the facility, and across New South Wales Health to protect patients, and staff members.”
“There have now been 27 Covid-related deaths during the current outbreak, and 84 since the beginning of the pandemic,” Mr McAnulty said.

Rhiannon Down 11.28am: Growing alarm over Hunter region cases
Six new cases have been recorded in the Hunter-New England region, bringing the region’s total case numbers to 13, as health authorities issue a warning for the Hunter Hospital emergency department.
Anyone who attended the emergency department between August 5 between 8.40pm and August 6 at 1.50am has been designated as a close contact and must get tested and isolate for 14 days.
It comes as the Delta strain makes further incursions into the regions after the virus was detected in the sewage system in Dubbo in the state’s far west.
“We have seen sewage detections in Dubbo and don’t have any known cases there,” NSW Health’s Dr Jeremy McAnulty said.
“We urge the community in Dubbo to come forward for testing with even the mildest of symptoms. Take it very seriously.”

Rhiannon Down 11.02am: NSW records 319 new local cases | WATCH LIVE
NSW has recorded 319 new locally acquired cases of Covid, 194 of them with no known link. Five more people have also died, none of them vaccinated.
The current outbreak death toll stands at 27.
Hospitalisations are also surging, with 345 people in hospital, 56 of them in intensive care.
On the bright side, Health Minister Brad Hazzard said the vaccination rate was up.
“The great news today is our doses for the first dose on population of 16 and above have reached almost 50%, so that is a very positive step forward,” he said. “For those who are fully vaccinated, we are to almost 22%, and we are going up at about 5% per week, so can I say to everybody out there, we’re not going to beat this virus until unless you get under journey with us.”
For rolling coverage watch Sky News Australia on Foxtel or visit www.skynews.com.au.
Meanwhile, Armidale in the NSW Northern Tablelands will be plunged into lockdown from 5pm today, after two cases were recorded in the regional city.
Mr Hazzard said the lockdown would last for one week as health authorities work to establish how far the virus has spread into the community.
“I’m sorry to the people of Armidale local council area, I would say to you this has been out of care and concern for your area,” he said.

Rhiannon Down 10.38am: Arrests, fines as Queensland tip-offs surge
Queensland Police have made four arrests and issued more than 100 penalty infringement notices, as authorities urge the community to abide by health restrictions.
Deputy Commissioner Steve Gollschewski said 42 people had been intercepted by authorities and issued with infringement notices for not having a valid reason to be out in the community and 60 more had been fined for refusing to wear a face mask.
“To those people, do the right thing,” he said. “Stop the behaviour.”
“What is going to happen is we will continue our operation until lockdown ceases.
“Once it does eventually cease and we see these restrictions ease, we will continue to make sure those resections are abided by as well because this is about stopping the spread of the very dangerous virus… we do not want to hand out fines to people.”
Deputy Commissioner Gollschewski said the figures included two people in Noosaville who refused to check in to a venue or wear masks, before getting into an argument with police and allegedly resisting arrest.
Police received 96 tip-offs about potential lockdown breaches, including one that two people were travelling to Mackay from Brisbane to attend a party who were since issued with $1378 fines.

Rhiannon Down 10.02am: Queensland records 13 new cases, cluster grows to 102
Queensland has recorded 13 new cases of locally acquired Covid, all of them linked to known outbreaks and all but one of them isolating while infectious.
The number of cases linked to the Indooroopilly State School cluster now stands at 102.
“Two are household contacts of a known case at the Indooroopilly karate class,” Mr Miles said.
“One is a close contact from the karate class, five cases are household contacts of Ironside State School and four cases are household contacts of Indooroopilly High School.
“One is a close contact at Brisbane boys Grammar School.”

Deputy Premier Steven Miles said it was a good result for the state, and Chief Health Officer Jeannette Young said a decision on whether the current lockdown would lift would be made based on tomorrow’s numbers.
“Great work Queensland. Keep staying home, get tested if you are unwell and get vaccinated,” Health Minister Yvette D’Ath said. “Yesterday we recorded the second day in a row of the highest vaccination rates across the country.”
Queensland Premier Annastacia Palasczuk will return to work tomorrow after serving out her quarantine period and testing negative after her trip to Tokyo for the Olympics.

Anton Nilsson 9.10am: Officials lock down entire Liverpool apartment block
An entire Sydney apartment block has been put under police watch with strict orders for all residents to stay at home for two weeks after more than a dozen people caught Covid-19.
The apartment building on Campbell Street in Liverpool was locked down on Friday after 14 cases were confirmed, the South West Sydney Local Health District said.
“South Western Sydney Local Health District is working with the residents and building management to assess the situation and, in collaboration with other agencies, is implementing measures to address infection control and the health and welfare of residents,” a spokeswoman said.
“All residents of this block have been determined to be close contacts and are required to isolate for 14 days and undergo repeat testing.
“Testing of residents will be done in their apartments, as they cannot leave during their isolation period.”
Police officers and private security guards have been posted by the building.
Residents will get food and other services delivered, and officials will check on their welfare daily.

Rachel Baxendale 8.36am: Victoria records 29 new cases, none isolating
Victoria has recorded 29 locally acquired coronavirus cases in the 24 hours to midnight on Friday — the highest daily case number since the state’s second wave.
All of the cases are linked to known outbreaks, but none were isolating during their infectious period.
That brings to 97 the number of active cases in the state.
More than 43,000 tests were conducted in Victoria yesterday and 22,335 vaccine doses administered.
The latest cases come after the Islamic College of Melbourne, in Tarneit in Melbourne’s west, issued a press release late on Friday notifying the school community that Victoria’s health department was investigating “a confirmed case of coronavirus that attended the college during the month of July”.
The first two cases to emerge from Victoria’s current as yet unlinked community clusters were a teacher in her 20s from fellow Islamic school Al-Taqwa College in nearby Truganina, and a man who lives in Maribyrnong and works in a Derrimut warehouse.
The 29 cases on Saturday follow six cases on Friday, six on Thursday, short-lived celebrations of zero on Wednesday, four on Tuesday, two on Monday, four on Sunday, and the previous outbreak peak of 26 on Thursday July 22.
There have now been 261 community acquired cases since two incursions from NSW sparked Victoria’s fifth lockdown last month, and 41 cases since the most recent outbreaks sparked a sixth lockdown on Thursday.
There are currently 97 active cases, including up to three active cases acquired overseas.
At least 161 of those infected during the current outbreaks have recovered, and more are expected to do so in coming days.
As of Friday, there were six people in Victorian hospitals with coronavirus, including two in intensive care on ventilators.
The latest cases come after 43,618 tests were processed on Friday, up from 29,631 on Thursday, 27,279 on Wednesday, 30,117 on Tuesday, 22,217 on Monday, 21,417 on Sunday and 25,779 on Saturday.
Victoria’s testing record is 59,355 tests on July 20.

Patrick Commins 8.30am: The economy can defy Delta: RBA
The Reserve Bank is optimistic higher vaccination rates will free Sydney from its current lockdown by October and a sharp bounce back will return the economy to its pre-Delta trajectory as soon as March next year.
With more than 15 million Australians under stay-at-home ­orders, RBA governor Philip Lowe also told a parliamentary committee it was “quite unlikely” the country would plunge into a double-dip recession over the second half of this year.
However, he couldn’t “rule out two quarters of negative growth if the health situation deteriorates”, and forecast “further brief (and less severe) restrictions” throughout the December quarter and limited lockdowns into 2022.
“We’ve got to traverse a difficult few months … but the experience here and elsewhere is that once the health situation is brought under control the economy bounces back quickly,” Dr Lowe said.
The RBA governor said he was “optimistic about next year”, noting that the RBA’s economists had pencilled in 4.25 per cent GDP growth in 2022 – faster than the 3.5 per cent rate estimated in May.
The bank’s “central scenario” underpinning its latest set of forecasts – released in Friday’s Statement on Monetary Policy – assumed “some limited lockdowns next quarter and some next year” as increased vaccine take-up ­allowed the country to operate more openly with Covid.

Mackenzie Scott 8am: More pharmacies recruited for vaccine rollout
Getting the Covid-19 vaccine in southeast Queensland has been made easier, with more than 100 pharmacies granted permission to administer vaccines.
The state’s excess AstraZeneca supply has been redistributed across 113 pharmacies in a move expected to boost vaccination ­levels. The new sites join the 181 locations already operating in rural and regional areas across Queensland where there are gaps in the vaccine rollout.
Acting president of the Pharmacy Guild of Australia’s Queensland branch, Chris Owen, said the addition of new jab locations would be “a big shot in the arm” to the rollout. “The most important thing is that we have to have more access points with more available ­appointments,” Mr Owen said. “When there’s a surge in demand, if you don’t have enough access points, then they’re just gonna lead to a log jam.”
The number of pharmacies included in the Queensland rollout is expected to balloon to 800 by the end of this month.
“To be able to have that many more access points, all with vaccines available, all with vaccinators with vaccine rooms that were previously under-utilises. It can only be a good thing for the rollout,” Mr Owen said.

Sharri Markson 7am: Lab mishap ‘infected scientist’ with Covid-19
A Beijing laboratory director was infected with Covid-19 in a lab accident in early 2020, explosive emails have revealed, showing an inadvertent leak of the highly contagious coronavirus is far from a conspiracy theory.
A senior scientist at a prestigious laboratory, the National Institute for Viral Disease Control, allegedly contracted Covid-19 in his laboratory in early 2020 while researching the virus, prominent virologists say.
The virologists discussed the infection in an email chain obtained by the US Right to Know group.
China’s failure to disclose this laboratory accident has raised questions about whether health authorities would have disclosed a lab accident in Wuhan months earlier.
Ohio State University director of viruses and emerging pathogens Shan-Lu Liu wrote in an email dated February 14, 2020: “We were from the same lab where my former director has now been infected by SARS-CoV-2! Very sad but he’s doing OK!”
Scientist Lishan Su , then at the University of North Carolina, replied: “Your former colleague was infected with sars2 in the lab?”
Shan-Lu Liu responded: “Yes, he was infected in the lab!”

Olivia Caisley 6.45am: ‘Encourage your grandkids to get vaccinated’
Former governors-general are calling on Australia’s youth to get vaccinated in the fight against Covid-19 after Doherty Institute modelling showed deaths and hospitalisations would be nearly halved under a strategy to vaccinate all adults as opposed to older people first.
As NSW recorded a record 291 cases, of which at least 50 were ­active in the community, Peter Cosgrove said jabs were the pathway back to normality.
“There is no doubt the best way we can protect one another and get back to normal is through vaccination. So my advice is that everybody should get both vaccinations and thus protect their families, their communities and all Australians,” Sir Peter said.
“In particular, I send this plea to younger Australians: you’re our nation’s future so get vaccinated.”
Quentin Bryce echoed the call, declaring vaccinations an essential protection. She said older generations knew the power and importance of vaccinations and encouraged them to share that ­information with their grandchildren.

Rachel Baxendale 5.15am: Regional lockdown based on ‘false information’
A key piece of information used by Daniel Andrews to justify locking down 1.6 million regional Victorians turns out to have been false.
The incorrect information about Covid sewage detections in the Premier’s home town of Wangaratta came as Victoria recorded six new locally-acquired cases in the 24 hours to Friday, all of which were in close contacts of the two mystery outbreaks detected on Wednesday and Thursday.
On Thursday, the Premier highlighted the recent detection of virus fragments at a wastewater treatment facility in Wangaratta, 240km northeast of Melbourne, just off the Hume Highway, in seeking to explain why he had chosen to make Victoria’s sixth lockdown statewide, despite no known coronavirus cases outside Melbourne.
Victoria has recorded six new coronavirus cases on the state’s first day of its sixth lockdown, with all cases infectious in the community.
But on Friday morning, Wangaratta mayor Dean Rees told The Weekend Australian he understood from North East Health that there had been one positive detection a week ago, followed by two negatives, indicating there were no ongoing infections in the area.
“We feel that Dan (Andrews) has accidentally been given the wrong information and has portrayed that,” Mr Rees told The Australian.
“I don’t think they’d give us false information purposely, but it’s clear it was false information.”
Mr Rees called for the lockdown of regional Victoria to be reconsidered.
“It sounded like it was the basis for putting us into lockdown, so I think a reversal would be fair and reasonable,” he said.
Victoria has entered its sixth lockdown just nine days after leaving the previous one and Premier Daniel Andrews is now calling on the federal government to provide the state with more Pfizer vaccines.

Sharri Markson 5am: PM’s plea to US to obtain excess vaccine doses
The Morrison government has made urgent appeals to the Biden administration for access to its ­estimated 26 million vaccine doses that are sitting unused in warehouses and about to expire.
The Weekend Australian has spoken to three high-level sources involved with the negotiations ­between Australia and the US and it is understood Australia has “made representations” over the course of several weeks for access to America’s excess Pfizer ­vaccines.
All of Australia’s requests have so far been unsuccessful.
A senior Australian government source said the representations were continuing.
Leading Republicans are pushing the Biden administration to provide Australia the excess doses of Pfizer, Moderna and Johnson & Johnson vaccines – some of which expire this month.

Yoni Bashan 4.45am: NSW’s change of tactics to keep up with cases
Health officials tracing Sydney’s Covid-19 outbreak are delaying their long ­interviews with ­people who test positive for the virus, with shorter questioning being used ­instead in a bid to keep pace with rising case numbers.
There was a record 291 positive cases in the 24 hours to 8pm on Thursday, with 98 of them infectious in the community. But data released by NSW Health shows a fall in the number of people receiving a full contact tracing interview within one day of testing positive, dropping from 93 per cent of cases to 74 per cent in a week.
New South Wales Premier Gladys Berejiklian says the state has recorded 291 new local cases of COVID-19 with at least 50 of these infectious within the community.
The department has attributed the percentage decrease to the use of shorter interviews “to ensure timely response”. It said preliminary interviews confirmed the ­patient’s result, their welfare and medical needs, and were used to identify a list of close contacts.
With the lockdown unlikely to ease substantially beyond August 28 for retail, hospitality, tourism and other critical industries, Premier Gladys Berejiklian convened a crisis meeting with ministers on Friday to address failings with the rollout of her government’s JobSaver financial aid package and Covid-19 business support grants.

Josh Frydenberg: Why Victorians can be confident about their future

Full text: It was heartfelt and heartbreaking.
As a young person, he said “each lockdown hurts me more than the last,” creating “a massive toll on my mental health”.
Disillusioned and concerned, he’s not alone.
Many Victorians, young and old, while remarkably resolute and resilient throughout this pandemic, are now in lockdown number six, fatigued and weary.
But we must stay the course as there is light at the end of the tunnel.
Every day, tens of thousands of our fellow Victorians are getting vaccinated, with the program rapidly gaining pace.
Recent days have seen a record number of doses delivered, including more than one million in the past six days.
This is a stark contrast from just months ago, when it took 45 days to deliver the first one million doses.
More than 40 per cent of the eligible population have received their first dose, and more than 80 per cent of those aged over 70.
Our focus on suppressing the virus and vaccinating the most vulnerable has helped save 30,000 lives, and seen Australia avoid the fate of other nations.
In Canada, more than 26,000 people have lost their lives, and in Britain about 130,000.
The focus from here must be on vaccinating as many people as possible, as quickly as possible, with modelling from the Doherty Institute identifying a 70 per cent vaccination rate as a key threshold to reach.
At this point, it says, lockdowns become less likely and the transmissibility of the virus reduces, as does the chance of serious illness for those who are vaccinated.
Just as the health outcomes improve, so do the economic ones, with Treasury analysis estimating the cost to the economy from moderate restrictions and early action to get on top of outbreaks less than a fifth of that incurred by longer and more severe lockdowns.
This is why everyone must get the jab, to not only protect the health of themselves and their loved ones, but also the security of their jobs.
The reality is that until we reach a 70 per cent vaccination rate, we are likely to see state governments respond to outbreaks with short and sharp lockdowns, as we’ve just seen in Victoria.
Where these lockdowns occur, the Morrison government is quick to provide support.
This includes payments to individuals in Victoria of up to $750 a week for those who have lost work.
Applications can be made through Services Australia and, in some cases, are processed in under an hour.
The federal government has also agreed to jointly fund a $400m support package for small and medium-sized businesses in Victoria, including for sole traders.
It builds on a $400m package that we announced for Victoria just last week.
Gyms, hairdressers and cafes are among the nearly 100,000 eligible businesses, with grants of up to $20,000 to be made to larger hospitality venues disrupted by the lockdown.
The federal government is also working with the banks to see that their customers are provided with relief on loan repayments as a result of hardship caused by the lockdowns.
Similarly, I have spoken to the Australian tax commissioner who through the ATO is seeking to be flexible and practical in assisting taxpayers during this difficult period.
As was the case last year during the height of the pandemic, it will take a Team Australia effort, government and business working together towards the one goal of helping our fellow Australians get through Covid.
I am confident that despite the challenges we face today, we will be stronger on the other side.
As recently as June, unemployment in Victoria had fallen to 4.4 per cent, and the national unemployment rate was at a 10-year low.
Business and consumer confidence was up, job advertisements were at a record high, and employers spoke of their desperate need to get more workers.
Australia, ahead of any advanced economy in the world, had more people in work, and an economy that was bigger than before Covid-19 began.
This proven ability of the Australian economy to bounce back from the lockdowns should give Victorians confidence about their future.
As the governor of the Reserve Bank of Australia said on Thursday: “There is a pathway out of the current difficulties”.
“Australia’s experience is that once restrictions are lifted, spending recovers strongly,” he said.
And the bank is forecasting a “return to strong growth in 2022’’.
There is no doubt this is a difficult time for Victorians, as it is for the nation. But we must stay strong, we must stay safe, and we must look after one another.

Price of 'living with COVID' must be understood

Full text: Poor political decisions can have disastrous consequences. In August 1914, before World War I began, politicians on both sides assured their peoples that the conflict would be over by Christmas.
Instead, the maelstrom - unleashed by incompetent risk analysis - developed into a grinding stalemate that killed or maimed 40 million people. In 1918, the exhausted powers fell into an armistice but not before creating the conditions that brought on the great influenza pandemic that killed another 50 million.
Similarly, while nature created the coronavirus, poor political decisions created the COVID pandemic. Now, as we contemplate what to do about the pandemic by Christmas, Australians are being asked to abandon hard-won freedoms secured under zero-COVID for the greatly inferior, if not illusory, liberty of "living with COVID".
The federal government wishes to link a specific vaccination coverage rate of the "eligible population" to the opening of Australia's borders. Whatever the target rate, using the "eligible population" formulation means that the actual number of the entire population protected by vaccines will be considerably lower. And focusing on numbers vaccinated at any level avoids the real driver of Delta infection, which must be the numbers of people either unvaccinated or susceptible to infection.
In Australia, vaccine coverage varies widely according to income, with some less affluent suburbs and regional and remote centres still largely unvaccinated. Opening our borders before all are vaccinated will exact a disproportionately high price on the poor, vulnerable and remote.
Doherty Institute and Treasury modelling is a welcome contribution to the debate, but all modelling reflects the assumptions provided by those who commission it. And much of this analysis began before the full dimensions of the Delta crisis became apparent.
Abandoning the genuine freedoms and prosperity achieved under COVID zero will affect the lives, livelihoods and futures of all Australians. Democratic principle demands that such consequential changes be put to the Australian people before, and not after, they are undertaken.
With increased vaccination rates finally in prospect, the Morrison government wishes to lay down an urgent timetable for dissolving the goal of a COVID-free Australia. But Australians should be asking "why rush to irrevocably join the ranks of COVID-endemic countries?"
The supposed upside is "freedom". But if there is one thing we have learned about this disease, it has never failed to disappoint on the downside.
By October 2020, the mobilisation and commitment of the Australian people, public health advisers along with the premiers and chief ministers delivered a sustainably COVID-free Australia. Most Australians therefore enjoyed a long and prosperous golden summer from October 2020 until June 2021.
The freedoms of zero-COVID Australia disappeared when inexcusably lax NSW government administration of Sydney Airport quarantine let Delta into an almost unvaccinated country.
The federal government now insists that this hard-earned status be traded-in for a much less satisfactory future of "living alongside COVID".
Australia runs the risk of responding to last year's COVID, not this year's Delta.
Delta, which can be transmitted by the fully vaccinated, is trashing the optimistic assumptions made by countries that believed some elevated level of inoculation coverage would put the worst of the pandemic behind them. Delta is driving a global resurgence of cases and deaths, with a worsening situation emerging even in countries with much higher vaccination rates than Australia.
The almost certain consequence of allowing fully vaccinated Australians to travel abroad before Delta-proof quarantine is built and all Australians are fully vaccinated will be to import a significant and ineradicable caseload of Delta with increased numbers of cases, hospitalisations and deaths.
The Doherty Institute modelling that details the health, economic and social consequences of "living with COVID" has been published. Its underlying assumptions and scenarios should now be subject to the most rigorous analysis.
The aspiration of the Australian people is not to "live with COVID" but to protect themselves from the worst effects of the pandemic.
In their wisdom, a fully informed Australian people may conclude the price of committing to Christmas with COVID is not worth paying.

Path out: tracing and quarantine

Full text: Australia's proposed path out of harsh restrictions depends on optimal quarantine systems, contact tracing and social distancing - and lockdowns will probably still be needed.
Modelling commissioned by the Doherty Institute for the federal government found the country could move to phase B of the national road map out of the pandemic once 70 per cent of the eligible population was fully immunised.
It also shows opening up the COVID-19 vaccine rollout to all eligible adults rather than continuing to focus on vulnerable Australians will boost the level of community protection.
"At 70 per cent, we're at a position where the light, low public health and social measures ... [and] an effective and well-preserved public health response could help to turn what might otherwise be a bushfire into more of a controlled backburn, and keep case numbers low," the Doherty Institute's Professor Jodie McVernon said yesterday.
But the Grattan Institute's Stephen Duckett said the modelling came with a large caveat.
"To what extent do we think our test, tracing and isolation is 'gold standard'?" he said. "If you think it is not, when there is lots of virus circulating, according to [the Doherty Institute], somewhere between 18 and 39 per cent of the time we'd have to be in hard Victorian-style lockdowns."
The Grattan Institute last week published its own modelling, saying the country could move to phase B of reopening only when 80 per cent of the population was immunised. Dr Duckett said at that level, the government would not have to worry about the effectiveness of testing, tracing or quarantine systems.
The Doherty modelling found Australia could move away from economically damaging, tough restrictions with 70 per cent of eligible adults vaccinated, but only if testing, tracing, isolating and quarantine measures remained at the optimal levels seen in NSW during the Christmas and new year outbreaks.
If cases grew and stressed the health system to a point where testing and tracing lagged, similar to Melbourne's experience in August last year, strict level-four lockdowns would be needed about 22 per cent of the time, it said.
UNSW epidemiologist Professor Mary-Louise McLaws said the Doherty modelling "really pulled its punches", as the 70 per cent target would not leave enough Australians protected.
"That's 56 per cent of the total population. That means one in two people are not protected," she said.
Without going for an "aspirational herd immunity" target, Professor McLaws said the modelling left governments relying too heavily on the success of public health measures.
Chief Medical Officer Professor Paul Kelly said COVID-19 would circulate in the community once restrictions began to ease as more people were vaccinated.
Prime Minister Scott Morrison said he remained confident the 70 per cent target could be reached by the end of the year.
Professor McVernon said it had been important to focus on the most vulnerable groups first, but now, to reduce transmission, younger adults needed to start getting immunised.
The modelling is based on a hypothetical case of uniform national vaccination coverage, but regional data shows stark differences across the country.

Full text: A male in his 20s died from Covid at home in south-western Sydney on Tuesday night, Premier Gladys Berejiklian has revealed, adding he was not vaccinated. He was a confirmed case and was isolating at home.
A woman in her 80s from the inner-west died at the Royal Prince Alfred Hospital on Tuesday after testing positive to Covid on July 27.
The premier said the young man’s death “demonstrates again how this disease is lethal, how it affects people of all ages.”
“Unfortunately the gentleman wasn’t vaccinated, hadn’t had any dose of the vaccine. As we understand the death happened quite suddenly,” Ms Berejiklian said.
The state’s chief health officer Dr Kerry Chant said Covid-19 can bring on sudden death.
“I think that is important to understand that your health status can deteriorate and you can have sudden death with Covid infection,” she said.
She revealed the young man was living with another person who is now in hospital.
“That person also had Covid and that person has been hospitalised and offered all care. You can imagine how traumatic such an event was,” she said.
Dr Chant said she is “very concerned” about sewerage detection in the Newcastle system, from the Shortland and Burwood Beach plants, as well as a lower detection in the Belmont plant.
“It is critical that we can get those testing levels up to really understand as soon as possible whether there is any undiagnosed cases there so we can make the best public health decisions,” she said.
The numbers are going up because there are a number of people infectious in the community, she said.
“The numbers are going up because we are still having mixing with households.
We are still having a small number of people that are not isolating effectively and are not isolating after a positive test,” she said.
On Tuesday, NSW recorded 199 cases of Covid and 50 of these were infectious in the community.

17 NEW CASES IN QLD Queensland is in the grips of the most significant Covid-19 outbreak it has faced since the beginning of the pandemic, after 17 new local cases were recorded on Wednesday.
Of the new cases, 16 are linked to the Brisbane schools cluster, which began last week when an Indooroopilly State High School student tested positive. The 17th case has been confirmed as a fully vaccinated reef pilot in Cairns.
Health authorities say he is not linked to the Brisbane cluster, and most likely acquired the virus while on the job.
Deputy Premier Steven Miles said in less than a week, Queensland had gone from one case to 63 local cases.
“This outbreak means this has become our biggest outbreak since the first wave last year,” he said.
Authorities still don’t know how the cluster began. Genomic sequencing has linked the cases to two travellers who returned from overseas on June 29, but how the school student came to contract the virus remains a mystery.
Of the new cases on Wednesday, four cases are linked to Ironside State School including one teacher, two cases to Indooroopilly State High School, one case linked to Brisbane Boys Grammar and nine cases are close contacts or family members of previously identified cases.
Two of the new cases were in isolation throughout their entire infectious period.
A record 51,479 tests were carried out on Tuesday, well above the previous record of 35,357.
Mr Miles said it was imperative the testing rates stayed high and that people stayed home if it was not essential.
“We hope that this is just five more days, but every time someone leaves their home they increase the risk that this lockdown may need to go longer,” Mr Miles said.
The state recorded 16 new cases on Tuesday.

ZERO CASES IN VICTORIA Victoria has recorded no new locally acquired Covid-19 infections on Wednesday.
The state’s health department announced zero new local cases about 8.30am in an astonishing sign the Delta outbreak has been quashed, as Victoria emerges from its fifth lockdown.
Just 3000 of more than 20,000 primary close contacts from the state’s latest outbreak remain in isolation as hundreds are freed back into the community each day.
Chief health officer Brett Sutton said 536 people were cleared as primary close contacts on Tuesday as the number of exposure sites also continues to dwindle, and had fallen to 45 on Tuesday morning.
No new exposure sites have been added since Saturday.
Victorians also set a new daily record for QR code check-ins over the weekend, with 6.1 million people scanning in at venues on Saturday.
It beat the previous record of 5.6 million on July 15, which was just before the state’s fifth Covid-19 lockdown.
Almost 11 million people checked in across both Saturday and Sunday.
Victoria has recorded 220 cases linked to the two outbreaks that jumped the border from Sydney’s deadly Delta cluster – one from a team of Sydney removalists who transited through the state and the other from a family who returned to Melbourne’s north from a NSW red zone.
No new cases were recorded in hotel quarantine, with the number for active infections in the state falling to 99 – down from 124 on Tuesday.

PM’S COVID CRACK TEAM PLAN Prime Minister Scott Morrison has another part to his Covid-19 battle plan — a vaccination unit targeting infection outbreaks.
According to the National Covid Vaccine Campaign Plan for Operation Covid Shield, The Australian reports a new crack National Response Option “is an opportunity to increase vaccination capacity when and where required” in the event of an outbreak.
The new unit will be sent out nationally and be on call to move quickly.
The co-ordinator general of the National Covid-19 Vaccine Taskforce, Lieutenant General John Frewen, said “while there are many factors involved in reducing the spread of Covid-19, vaccination is the most effective means we have to build nation resilience”.
The new unit would support the “states and territories in achieving or exceeding targets either by reinforcing success or addressing delay in extraordinary circumstances”.
“Once we reach threshold vaccination rate levels, we will be able to live with this virus and begin our recovery,” the plan said.
“The National Response Option will be dedicated solely to the task of administering vaccinations and will maintain a high level of readiness in the event of a call-out, being dispatched to the location directed to provide between 2000 and 3000 additional vaccinations daily over the course of a two-week campaign.”
It comes as carparks at major sporting stadiums could reportedly become vaccine hubs as early as next month.
The federal government is considering the move to help get the Pfizer Covid-19 vaccine to Australians aged 30 and over, Nine News reported on Tuesday.
While Westfield is already on board to give jabs nationally, other shopping centres will also reportedly be involved in the drive-through plan.
“Flying squads” of nurses will reportedly go to workplaces to vaccinate employees as early as October.

PM LASHES CASH FOR JABS; NEW MODELLING REVEALED Scott Morrison has dismissed Labor’s cash for jabs proposal, describing it as “a vote of no-confidence in Australians”.
Labor Leader Anthony Albanese put forward the $6b plan on Tuesday to give Australians fully vaccinated by December 1 $300 in cash. But Mr Morrison distanced himself from cash incentives.
“This is a serious public health crisis, it is not a game show,” the prime minister told reporters on Tuesday.
“So if they do have hesitancy about vaccine, I am not going to pay them off.”
The prime minister was taking questions following the release of the Doherty Institute’s modelling for Australia’s National Covid-19 response.
In an opening speech, Mr Morrison praised the nation’s handling of pandemic saying 30,000 Australians or more would be dead if we had not responded the “Australian way”.
“I have great faith in the Australian people to get this country vaccinated,” he said.
The modelling shows vaccinating 70 per cent of the population aged 16 plus may allow Australia to transition to phase B of Australia’s response.
At 70 per cent, the number of strict lockdowns would be significantly reduced.
Fifty to 60 per cent doesn’t come anywhere near enough reaching that point, the modelling shows.
The prime minister noted: “When you get it down to 80 per cent, the sort of death hospitalisation and infection rates is what you expect to see with something like a flu.”
NED-4305-Vaccine-effectiveness-estimates
As vaccine rates increase, less stringent public health and social measures will be needed.
Allowing vaccinations for under 40s offers the greatest potential to reduce transmission now that a higher proportion of vulnerable Australians are vaccinated, the modelling shows.
We need to increase the uptake of AstraZeneca to combat the challenge the Delta strain presents.
“What we are delighted to see and what really supports the use of both of the vaccines that we have in Australia is both the Pfizer and AstraZeneca doses are highly effective at reducing severe disease outcomes following two doses,” the Doherty Institute’s Professor Jodie McVernon said.
“For Pfizer, reduction in hospitalisation is 87 per cent, ICU admission 87 per cent, mortality 92 per cent. For AstraZeneca, corresponding numbers are 86, 86 and 90.
“We have two very highly effective vaccines and this work really encourages their best strategic use.”
NED-4150-Pathway-out-of-pandemic
Treasurer Josh Frydenberg said the key economic message out of the modelling is that until we get to 70 per cent and above vaccination rates the economic imperative is that governments need to move fast to get on top of those cases.
“If they don’t, we see lengthier and more severe lockdowns which have a much more significant economic cost,” he said.
He said early interventions, short, sharp lockdowns, are the most cost effective way to handle the virus.
Mr Frydenberg said at 50 per cent vaccination rates, if governments are getting on top of those early cases, it’s costing the economy $570 million a week. At 60 per cent vaccination rates, if governments are getting on top of the cases early, it’s costing $430 million a week. At a 70 per cent vaccination rate it’s costing the economy $200 million a week. And at 80 per cent vaccination rates it’s costing the economy $140 million a week. And that’s base
line-type restrictions, light or moderate restrictions.
COVID-19 Stats – Horizontal with Lazy Load

PM’S VACCINE PUSH Scott Morrison will offer Australians non-cash incentives for the jab under the national cabinet’s four-phase reopening plan, it’s been revealed.
Research commissioned by the federal government found cash payments and lotteries have had “little to no impact on longer-term vaccination rates”, according to The Australian.
Based on the advice received by the government last week, the government is more likely to partner with businesses to give discounts and frequent flyer point bonuses.
It comes as Labor leader Anthony Albanese put forward a plan to give every Australian fully vaccinated by December 1 a $300 cash payment to boost vaccination rates.
Mr Albanese will unveil the $6bn plan on Tuesday.
If an election is held before December 1, a new Labor government would deliver the payments, but Labor would not send out the cash if elected at the poll that is more likely to be held next year.
“The government has failed on its two jobs this year, the rollout of the vaccine and fixing quarantine,” the Opposition Leader said.
“It needs to use every measure at its disposal to protect Australians and our economy.”
It comes as new modelling predicts daily cases in New South Wales will more than double by the end of the week.
The Burnet Institute forecasts that under the current restrictions, there will be about 570 new cases in a single day by Friday.
“This is the result of stable or falling daily cases in south west Sydney Local Health District (LHD) being exceeded by rising cases elsewhere,” the research concludes.
“It takes about a week before new controls have an effect, so we don’t expect new restrictions announced on 30 July to kick in until at least 7 August.”

HALF-PRICE PLANE SEATS EXTENDED The federal government has thrown a lifeline to the aviation sector as it struggles with the impact of worsening lockdowns, with the popular half-price fares initiative extended until the end of November.
The government will also enable airlines to access $750 weekly payments for 50 per cent of their pilots and cabin attendants, if the business has taken a hit of more than 30 per cent since the Sydney hotspot declaration was made.
The Domestic Aviation Network Support (DANS) and Regional Airline Network Support (RANS) programs would also be extended until the end of the year, Deputy Prime Minister Barnaby Joyce announced.
The half price seats initiative, which prompted a huge flurry of sales when it was announced in March, was being extended “to ensure travellers impacted by lockdowns or border closures can access these tickets and benefit key tourism regions as soon as possible,” Mr Joyce said.
Initially 800,000 half-price seats were offered to 15 destinations most impacted by the downturn in tourism.
Mr Joyce, who is also Minister Infrastructure, Transport and Regional Development, described the aviation sector as “absolutely seminal,” especially for the tourism industry.
“This is a crucial sector of the economy,” he said.
“It is crucial to keep a sovereign airline capacity, crucial that as soon as the economy opens up, this sector of the economy is up and running and able to deliver.”
“We are laser-focused on keeping the nation connected and supporting economically critical freight movements as we continue to manage the ongoing challenges of this global pandemic and move into a recovery phase.”
A spokesperson for Mr Joyce confirmed that while the half-price seats program was being extended, it was not an increase on the initial allocation of 800,000 seats, and the 15 destinations within the program were not being changed.
Tourism and Transport Forum CEO Margy Osmond welcomed the extended support measures, but said the tourism industry’s biggest challenges were the “devastating impacts of ongoing lockdowns and border uncertainty”.
She also called for timelines to be set against national vaccination targets, saying they would restore confidence to the industry.
Parts of the industry dependent on international arrivals had “effectively been in lockdown for 16 months,” Ms Osmond said, and the domestic sector “continues to be decimated by these extended lockdowns and border restrictions.”
PFIZER OPEN TO TEENS Health Minister Greg Hunt has announced more PPE will be sent to southeast Queensland after it was declared a Commonwealth hotspot, and the Pfizer vaccine will be made available to children aged between 12 and 15 who are immunocompromised.
This change in the vaccine rollout will occur on August 9.
“ … for 12-year-olds to 15-year-olds, as foreshadowed just over a week ago, the Pfizer vaccine will now be made available on ATAGI’s advice for immunocompromised children, or children with underlying medical conditions, indigenous children, and children in remote communities aged 12-15,” he said.
“Although, if any GP wishes to administer before then, then it is free for them, or states, to do so.
“But that’s the commencement of that program. They will be included under phase 1B, which means that they will have access as part of that program going forward.
It includes approximately 220,000 children who will be given access now as a consequence of that decision.”
Mr Hunt said this last week saw a record vaccination week with 1.18 million Australians coming forward, taking us to almost 12.4 million vaccinations.

HANSON SLAMS QLD LOCKDOWN Senator Pauline Hanson has criticised Prime Minister Scott Morrison claiming he had “lost control of Australia” as part of Queensland went into a three-day snap lockdown.
In a video posted online on Saturday, Ms Hanson described the lockdown as “bloody ridiculous”.
“Like a lot of Aussies I was out enjoying my weekend but now we are going to have to be locked down,” she said.
“It is bloody ridiculous for only six cases of Delta. I’m sorry this is over the top.”
“The prime minister said yesterday it would get no worse than what it is at this point, he’s supposed to guide us through this with the premiers.
“As I’ve said all along the prime minister has lost control of the country and the premiers are doing whatever they want to do. I feel sorry for small businesses.”
Ms Hanson went on to say lockdowns were being called “at the drop of a hat”.
“Give people clear direction and what’s going on,” she said.
It came after Mr Morrison explained Australia’s four-step road map out of Covid-19 lockdowns on Friday, where he said Australia had to get to a vaccination target of 70 per cent before restrictions would ease.
He also said premiers had agree to this in principle, with international travel to open after the country had achieved a vaccination target of 80 per cent.
On Saturday, Mr Morrison delivered a pointed reference to wild conspiracy theories during an interview on talkback radio as he pleaded with Australians to follow scientifically supported medical advice – not fake experts on Facebook.
The odd remark comes after the Prime Minister revealed lockdowns would be discouraged and international borders would begin to reopen once 80 per cent of eligible Australians are fully vaccinated against Covid-19.
Morrison said he hoped the agreement on the target would encourage the population to get the jab as vaccine hesitancy persists and disenfranchised citizens take to the streets in anti-lockdown protests.
“By getting vaccinated, you're getting a step closer every single day to getting us back to about as normal as you can be when you’re living with Covid-19,” he told 2GB on Saturday morning.
When discussing the prevailing rate of vaccine hesitancy across the country, Morrison urged Australians to resist following views of conspiracy theorists and to “go and talk to your doctor”.
“If you are concerned, don't talk to Doctor Google, go talk to your doctor,” the Prime Minister said.
“Don’t talk to someone who’s going to tell you you’re going to turn into a magnet or, you know, don’t go on Facebook to listen to people who don’t know what they’re talking about.”
The bizarre magnet reference is likely in relation to the unusual theory among alternative communities who fear the substance of the vaccine, with some even believing it will allow the recipient to connect to the internet.
The theory originated because some mRNA vaccines, a new type of jab used to protect against infectious diseases, include a material called hydrogel, which is used to help disperse the vaccine slowly into the recipient’s cells.
The fear of being a vessel to connect to Wi-Fi is, of course, nonsense and flatly rejected by the federal Health Department.
“Bioengineers have used similar hydrogels for many years in different ways,” the health authority said earlier in the year. “For instance, they’ve used them to help stem cells survive after being put inside our bodies.
“Because of this, some people believe that hydrogels are needed for electronic implants, which can connect to the internet.”
But the Pfizer mRNA vaccine doesn’t even contain hydrogels as a component, instead using a piece of mRNA that is “coated in a lipid (fatty) droplet”.
“The lipid helps the vaccine enter our cells, as the membrane holding our cells together is also made mostly of lipid,” the Department of Health said.
“The vaccine and the membrane can fuse easily, depositing the mRNA inside the cell.”
According to the Centre of Disease Control in the US, no ingredient in any Covid-19 vaccine is capable of producing electromagnetic force – at the injection site or anywhere else in your body.
“COVID-19 vaccines do not contain ingredients that can produce an electromagnetic field at the site of your injection,” official advice states.
“All COVID-19 vaccines are free from metals.”
Morrison said he was ambitious the threshold for vaccinations would be reached by Christmas so the country can attempt to return to normalcy by 2022.
“There’ll be enough vaccines,” he said in regards to 80 per cent of the population being vaccinated by the end of the year.
“There’ll be enough pharmacies, enough GPs, enough clinics, enough of all of that to achieve that.
“So it’s all up to all of us now.”

Full text: Scott Morrison announced on Friday that Australians could look forward to a life without lockdowns once 80 per cent of the nation’s adult population was vaccinated.
But South Australian independent senator Rex Patrick has warned this figure could be too low.
“We’ve seen already criticism in relation to what’s being put out. Where the Prime Minister says 70 per cent and 80 per cent, others are pointing out that needs to be the entire population,” he told Sky News.
“When you translate those numbers back into the entirety the population, including children, you get to numbers like 56 per cent, which is way too low compared to other jurisdictions.”
Mr Morrison’s plan to open the nation up again hinges on having 80 per cent of the eligible population vaccinated. The eligible population does not include individuals under the age of 16. If it did, that figure would sit at just under 65 per cent of all Australians.
Phase B, which kicks in at 70 per cent, would equate to just 56 per cent of the population.
Senator Patrick said Mr Morrison should release the data immediately.
“We’ve got a lack of transparency here and that needs to be fixed,” he said.
“The Prime Minister has failed miserably at that.”
The Doherty Institute was commissioned by the government to model what would occur when a certain percentage of the population was vaccinated and what impact further outbreaks would have on the health system at that rate.
It is understood the government will release the modelling later this week.
His comments follows reports that four Labor MPs — Victoria’s Julian Hill, Queensland’s Anika Wells and Western Australia’s Patrick Gorman and Anne Aly — had backed the call for a royal commission into the government’s handling of Covid-19, despite it not being Labor policy.
A senate inquiry into the government’s handling of the pandemic is ongoing, but Senator Patrick said a formal inquiry was “inevitable”.
“I think the whole point of a serious royal commission into such an event is to basically be able to examine all aspects of the response, including the vaccine purchase, including aged care and how we dealt with that,” he said.
“I think it's inevitable … I think, eventually, over time, we‘ll get the support of the Labor Party and we’ll put pressure on the Liberal Party to do this.”

Full text: • VIRGINIA TRIOLI ON WHY WHEN GREG HUNT SAYS ‘WITH RESPECT’ HE REALLY MEANS ‘I HATE YOU- OR WORSE
While on the topic of the apparent unwillingness of some senior Coalition figures to appear on some leading ABC news and current affairs programs – thanks to the avid Melbourne reader who drew Media Watch Dog ’s attention to the interview between Virginia Trioli and Health Minister Greg Hunt on ABC Radio 774’s Mornings with Virginia Trioli last Friday.
Towards the end of the interview, La Trioli lectured Minister Hunt that Prime Minister Scott Morrison must always follow the advice of the members of ATAGI (Australian Technical Advisory Group on Immunisation). Greg Hunt responded that the government was doing so – but made the reasonable point that the Morrison government’s job “is to ensure we are seeking continuous review” of immunisation issues. Quite so – especially in view of the COVID-19 pandemic.
Soon after, La Trioli opened the 774 phone line to listeners. Rusty from Springvale accused Greg Hunt of using weasel words and doublespeak. La Trioli then read out similar comments from several other listeners. No other view was heard.
Bruno objected to the tendency of Greg Hunt to use the term “with respect” in responding to activist journalists like La Trioli. To Bruno, this was a worn catchphrase. But not to La Trioli – who knew more:
Virginia Trioli: Bruno, I’ll disagree with you. When a politician says to you, in answer to a question, “with respect”, that is not without meaning. Let me tell you what the meaning is. I actually can’t say it on air because it’s a rude word. What it means is “Stuff you. Sit down. Shut up”. It actually means the opposite of “with respect”. It means “I hate what you’re asking, and I hate your guts right now”. So, that’s actually [laughing] what that phrase means. So, not meaningless – just, um, a different meaning.
And then it was off to the ABC 10am news. To some, the term “with respect” is frequently used by lawyers to make a courteous but dissenting point before a judge or in disagreement with a legal challenge. To La Trioli, when Greg Hunt said, “with respect”, he really meant “F—k you”, “stuff you” and “shut up”. And also “I hate your guts right now”.
In other words, Greg Hunt went on Mornings with Virginia Trioli and, after the interview, La Trioli verballed the Health Minister by claiming that he had really told her to f—k off and declared that he hated her guts. And activist journalists like La Trioli wonder why some senior Coalition politicians will not come on the program. Can You Bear It?
STOP PRESS
YET ANOTHER LEFT-WING Q&A STACK – WITH THE PRESENTER PART OF THE STACK
It was an official “So farewell then” to former Q+A presenter Hamish Macdonald on the program last night. After the final question had been asked and responded to, presenter Virginia Trioli announced what had been known for eons – namely that your man Macdonald had walked away from ABC TV. He’s gone back to the Network Ten’s The Project .
Media Watch Dog will miss Comrade Macdonald – and not only because he provided a lot of material. MWD embraced his appointment in early 2020 on the basis that a bloke who proclaimed that he did not watch television and did not own a TV set was ideally suited to present one of ABC TV’s key news and current affairs programs.
Hamish Macdonald has borne much of the blame for Q+A ’s declining ratings over recent years. It’s true that the program’s ratings have improved somewhat in recent weeks when presented by Stan Grant, David Speers and Virginia Trioli. But this coincided with an increase in lockdowns and, consequently, eyes for television. But the numbers are still significantly down on Q+A ’s early years when Tony Jones was the presenter.
Q+A has always been a left-wing program as befits the ABC as a Conservative Free Zone. But there was more political diversity on the program during Jones’ time. This partly reflects the unwillingness of some conservatives to appear on Q+A – while other conservatives are absent due to being de-platformed by the ABC.
The fact is that ABC programs like Q+A have been declining in audience in recent times due partly to the fact that some conservatives no longer watch ABC TV news and current affairs on account of the taxpayer funded public broadcaster’s lack of political diversity. Some have gone to Sky News where they are willing to pay a subscription fee to hear views that cannot be heard on the ABC.
Last night’ s Q+A illustrates the problem. The program reverted to its format of having two politicians. Labor frontbencher Chris Bowen turned up as did Liberal Party backbencher Senator Andrew Bragg. Both are good performers and both adapted well to a difficult environment.
The problem was that the panel was yet another left-wing stack. Senator Bragg had his government’s opponent Chris Bowen. Fair enough. But Bragg also had to respond to a trio of Morrison government critics. Namely artistic director/musician Deborah Cheetham, Sydney Lord Mayor Clover Moore and author Michael Mohammed Ahmad. All three opposed both the Coalition and Labor – from a left perspective. As did presenter Virginia Trioli, who also tackled Mr Bowen on Labor’s decision to junk the tax increase platform which it took to the 2019 election.
Ahmad, who appeared from his lockdown situation in Western Sydney in front of a photo of the Nation of Islam radical Malcolm X (1925-1965), predictably described the Coalition government in NSW as racist. He also declared that former prime minister John Howard was into racism denial and so on.
To repeat, Q+A was yet another leftist-stacked panel last night – much as it was when the Israel/Hamas conflict was discussed on Q+A on 27 May 2021. Re which see Issues 543 and 549.
As indicated, Andrew Bragg did well in attempting to prevail over four other panellists and the presenter. It seems that Virginia Trioli believes that Q+A viewers are interested in her views rather than expecting her to monitor the discussions and ask occasional sharp questions. Like so many other contemporary journalists, she herself is an activist.
Earlier in the discussion about the Sydney COVID-19 lockdown, La Trioli had tag-teamed with Comrade Cheetham in contesting Senator Bragg’s comments, including frequently interrupting him. Then, following a question critical of Andrew Bragg’s views on superannuation, the following exchange took place as the Liberal Party Senator attempted to defend his position that, at a time of economic problems caused by the pandemic, Australians should have greater access to their superannuation funds.
Virginia Trioli: Andrew Bragg, it seems, friendless, here on the panel tonight –
Andrew Bragg: [interjecting] I’m not surprised.
Virginia Trioli: Do you wanna have another go at defending it?
Andrew Bragg: Well –
Virginia Trioli: [interjecting] Well, I mean, I, I, I – you’ll have to make the case that it’s really necessary, the Government, as you noted, is, is pumping a lot of money into supporting people, and that’s been justly, you know, celebrated and that’s a good thing that the Government is doing that. But going one more to, to the superannuation after what history has already taught us about it?
Andrew Bragg: Well, because superannuation is the people’s money, it doesn’t belong to the superfund –
Virginia Trioli: [interjecting] But it’s –
Andrew Bragg: - managers –
Virginia Trioli: - for – it’s, it’s, it’s, it’s, -
Andrew Bragg: - or the unions –
Virginia Trioli: - the people’s –
Andrew Bragg: – or the banks.
Virginia Trioli: - it’s the people’s money for the future –
Andrew Bragg: [interjecting] It’s their money.
Virginia Trioli: - not for right now.
Andrew Bragg: But it’s, it’s their money and if they want to pay down their mortgage because, uh, having a house is more –
Virginia Trioli: [interjecting] So, it’s not superannuation then? It’s not super, it’s something else. It’s just a, it’s just a slush fund of money –
Andrew Bragg: Well, as you –
Virginia Trioli: - that you have there.
Andrew Bragg: - know, Virginia, I mean, fewer and fewer Australians will be able to afford a house and one of the things that can be done with super is for people to pay down their mortgage. So, that’s what happened last year, when we had early release, so I just think, if people want to do that, why would we deny them that opportunity? I mean –
Virginia Trioli: [interjecting] So, rather, rather than dealing with…
And so it went on and on. It was Senator Bragg taking on four fellow panellists plus the presenter.
And ABC management wonders why many senior Coalition ministers decline to appear on Q+A with its stacked panels (which are chosen by the program’s executive director) and activist presenters. Plus an invariably Green-Left audience when such is possible at a time of pandemic. Many conservative viewers who once watched Q+A have tuned out because they regard the program as a turn-off.
As to the highlight of last night’s panel. It was, surely, Malcolm X fan Michael Mohammed Ahmad who declared towards the end of the program: “I don’t think rich people should exist”. Not good news for ABC chair Ita Buttrose AO OBE, surely. This was a comment which presenter Trioli did not challenge or interrupt.
• BAZZA CASSIDY’S HUNGER GAMES WITH UBER
As avid readers only know too well, Media Watch Dog goes out at around Gin & Tonic Time on Fridays. Jackie’s (male) co-owner had advanced beyond G&T time to Pre-Dinner Drinks Time last Friday when he was shocked to read this tweet from Barrie Cassidy, sent out at 8.27pm:
Now Professor Cassidy (for, like Kerry O’Brien, a professor he is) lives in inner-city Melbourne – not far from lotsa restaurants. MWD would have suggested – if asked – that the learned professor drive or walk to the restaurant and collect his grub. Or order a taxi to pick up and deliver the goods. Or something like that.
Instead, the semi-retired, but still occasional ABC journalist, decided to whinge about Uber’s delayed deliveries on Twitter. Barrie Cassidy’s complaint seems to fit into the category of a First World (Media) Problem. In other words, Can You Bear It?
• ALAN JONES & DAISY COUSENS CHANNEL LAURA TINGLE IN THROWING THE SWITCH TO IDEOLOGY
In this time of pandemic with stress and all that, you don’t need to be a La Trioli to get all steamed up against Prime Minister Scott Morrison and the Coalition government.
Sure, it was Post-Dinner Drinks Time last night. But Jackie’s (male) co-owner is 103 per cent sure – give or take a numerical unit or two – that he heard Alan Jones equating the Morrison government with – wait for it – “Stalinism”. It took place on Sky News’ Alan Jones Show . Sure, the Soviet dictator Josef Stalin murdered many millions, but Mr Morrison wants some Australians to wear masks some of the time. Sounds a bit like Uncle Joe, don’t you think?
This was but eight hours after, from her base in Brisbane, Sky News contributor Daisy Cousens sent out this tweet:
Now here’s a [ MWD ] modest proposal. Ms Cousens, who believes that the Prime Minister is a “vile authoritarian”, should co-present a show with ABC TV 7.30 political correspondent Laura Tingle, who believes that the PM is into “ideological bastardry”.
Ms Cousens could bag the Prime Minister from the right and La Tingle could bag the PM from the left. On the other hand, to change tense somewhat: Could You Bear It?
DOCUMENTATION
•THE GRATTAN INSTITUTE’S (ATTENTION SEEKING) RUSH TO AN 80% VACCINATION RATE
Thursday saw the release of a new report by The Grattan Institute titled Race to 80: our best shot at living with Covid-19 . The release of the report seems to have been timed to pre-empt the presentation of modelling by The Doherty Institute to national cabinet today. As you would expect, the report received uncritical coverage from Nine newspapers, The Guardian and the ABC.
The report’s primary conclusion is that Australia should not open international borders and not cease responding to outbreaks with lockdowns until 80 per cent of the population is fully vaccinated. Note this is 80 per cent of the total population, including children. The Pfizer vaccine was recently approved for children as young as 12. The Grattan report’s optimistic scenarios for when Australia could reach 80 per cent vaccination assume children as young as 2 will be vaccinated.
Having 80 per cent of the population vaccinated is a lofty goal. This would place Australia well ahead of where even the countries with the most advanced vaccination rollouts currently sit.
The Grattan report also modelled scenarios where Australia opens up with only 50 per cent of the population vaccinated. Here its predictions are apocalyptic, with peak daily case numbers in the hundreds of thousands and a total death toll in the tens of thousands. It is interesting to note that these numbers are not currently being seen in countries with 50 per cent of the population vaccinated. Indeed, in the UK (55 per cent vaccination rate) case numbers have declined since “Freedom Day” when most Covid-19. restrictions were lifted.
The Doherty Institute modelling being presented to national cabinet is expected to break down vaccination rates by age with a focus on vaccination rates among older Australians.
The Grattan model makes assumptions about how the total vaccination rate will correlate with the vaccination rate among older Australians. For their 50 per cent total population vaccination scenario they assume an 80 per cent vaccination rate among 71-80 year-olds and a 90 per cent vaccination rate among people 81+. For their preferred 80 per cent total population vaccination scenario, they assume a 95 per cent vaccination rate among people 71+. However, in the UK, which currently has a total vaccination rate of around 55 per cent, the vaccination rate among people aged 71+ is already over 95 per cent.
The Grattan model assumes that UK levels of vaccination in the most vulnerable population are not possible until a much higher percentage of the total population is vaccinated. They do not test a UK-style scenario in which vaccination levels among older Australians are very high while vaccination levels among younger Australians remain lower. They then conclude that high total population vaccination rates are the only way to safely open.
Perhaps the magic number of 80 per cent total vaccination will become entrenched in the minds of some as a prerequisite to opening Australia’s borders and ending the use of lockdowns. But journalists would be well advised to look critically at the Grattan Institute’s model which seems unduly pessimistic when compared with available international data. If the Grattan Institute’s model were to be implemented, Australia could be in various stages of lockdown for years to come.
YOU MUST REMEMBER THIS
“You Must Remember This” is based on the chorus line in the song As Time Goes By which was popularised by the film Casablanca . It is devoted to reminding the usual suspects of what they and/or those they once supported or wrote or said or did.
IN WHICH PAUL BONGIORNO APPEARS TO FORGIVE NIKI SAVVA’S ONE-TIME CRITICISM
Media Watch Dog was moved, deeply moved, by this tweet which Paul Bongiorno – he of The [Boring] Saturday Paper – sent out on 24 June 2021 when news emerged that columnist Niki Savva was leaving The Australian :
It would seem that – united in opposition to such Liberal Party prime ministers as Tony Abbott and Scott Morrison – Bonge appears to have let bygones be bygones when it comes to Comrade Savva. In short, they now share a trench – so to speak – in the battle against the Morrison government and are intent on taking no prisoners (and other such cliches).
How times change. Jackie’s (male) co-owner recalls that Niki Savva was not so kind to Comrade Bongiorno in her 2010 book So Greek: Confessions of a Conservative Leftie . There Ms Savva wrote about the time she worked in the Prime Minister’s Media Office during the final weeks of the Coalition government as John Howard attempted (unsuccessfully as it turned out) to prevail over the Labor Party led by Kevin Rudd. Turn to Pages 267-268 to find out all about Bonge’s opposition to the Howard government at the time – according to the “insightful” Ms Savva:
The media was only too willing to take up anti-Howard stories and there were too many people willing to supply them. Paul Bongiorno, for example, was one of the senior people in the [Canberra Parliamentary Press] gallery who made clear his distaste for the government, and who couldn’t wait to see it booted out. Ten’s news menu always seemed to be laden with anti-Coalition government stories and its 2007 campaign coverage was, if anything, worse than in the past…
It was hard enough getting good people to spruik reliably on the government’s behalf, and in my view, there was little point in serving up ministers for [Paul Bongiorno’s] Meet the Press. Hardly anyone watched it, and people could make more headway with a doorstop on Sunday.
Bongiorno was furious that he was having trouble getting anyone senior on his [Network Ten’s Meet the Press] show, and worried about what his superiors in Sydney would think. He warned me that there would be “grief” if we did not field senior people for his program during the campaign….

So, once upon a time, the author of So Greek told readers that Paul Bongiorno was a vehement opponent of the Howard government who presented the Channel 10 Meet the Press program which hardly anyone watched. Yet nowadays Bonge maintains that Ms Savva is an insightful journalist. In any event – You Must Remember This.
[Yes, I do – very much so. It seems that in the Kingdom of Bongiorno not much has changed. Bonge is once again intent in ensuring that the Coalition government is booted out – while he writes a column for The Saturday Paper which hardly anyone reads. MWD Editor.]
YOUR TAXES AT WORK
JONATHAN GREEN ON THE FRYING AND TOPPING OF DUMPLINGS
There was enormous interest in last week’s Flann O’Brien Gong for Literary or Verbal Sludge which went to the Texas-based philosopher Timothy (I’m a They pronoun kind of person”) Morton for his interview with Jonathan Green on the ABC Radio National Blueprint program on Saturday 17 July 2021. It was one of those discussions when both the interviewer and guest are almost equally incomprehensible – but Dr Morton (for a doctor They is) prevailed and, consequently, won the gong.
After listening to this verbal sludge, Jackie’s (male) co-owner had little choice but to seek recovery by means of an early Gin & Tonic. After all, it was as late as 9.20am on a Saturday. This meant that Hendo did not hear the following interview – in which your man Green spoke to Chef Annie Smithers about, wait for it, dumplings. The matter was brought to Hendo’s attention by an avid reader. Here’s how the taxpayer funded public broadcaster described the occasion:
Chef Annie Smithers and Jonathan head into the kitchen to chat, cook and bake their way through the skills that will help make you a more confident home cook. This week on “Kitchen Rudimental”, Annie and Jonathan assemble and fry their dumplings.
This is how Blueprint (aka Blueprint for Living) commenced:
Jonathan Green: “Kitchen Rudimental”, a series here on Blueprint For Living, in which Annie Smithers will investigate the very basics of kitchen craft. Recently, on “Kitchen Rudimental”, uh, you’ll recall, uh, regular and dear listener, that the last time Annie Smithers – hello Annie.
Annie: Hi Jonathan.
Jonathan Green: - uh, made the filling for dumplings – which today we are going to complete. This is exciting, uh – Exciting and slightly intimidating. However, we’re going to give it a crack.
Annie Smithers: It’s not intimidating. I’m not the world’s best dumpling, former – um –
Jonathan Green: “I’m not the dumpling pleater –”
Jonathan Green and Annie Smithers in unison: - “I’m the dumpling pleater’s son”.
Groan. There followed a 13-minute or so discussion on dumplings which Jonathan (“Proudly the ABC’s Sneerer-in-Chief”) Green described as exciting and intimidating. The correct description was just plain boring – as the dumpler (Comrade Smithers) and dumpler’s apprentice (Comrade Green) constantly interrupted each other as they, er, dumpled together.
The pleaters went on and on and on. Listeners (if listeners there were) were expected to understand the talk about what was going on without being able to see what they were talking about. Then towards the end – after the music interval – the big question of our time was asked. Namely – what should a comrade eat his or her dumplings with? Let’s go to the transcript:
Annie Smithers: But we could, before they do cook, um – what do you like to eat your dumplings with?
Jonathan Green: Um, oh, a spot of soy or maybe some chilli or maybe some sweet chilli. And I know that anyone with any, uh, credibility out there will say that sweet chilli sauce is an excrescence – Annie is making such a face.
Annie Smithers: Yep. It’s not my favourite thing in the world, but if you like it.
Jonathan Green: What would you do?
Annie Smithers: Soy. Soy. Maybe soy with a bit of vinegar. Soy with chilli.
[music interval]

So there you have it. The ABC’s Fox Hunting Man is a sweet-chilli-on-dumplings kind of guy, despite the fact that sweet chilli sauce is an excrescence (whatever that means). And the paddock to plate chef is a soy-with-a-bit-of-vinegar plus chilli on dumplings kind of sheila. How frightfully interesting.
As The Friends of the ABC are wont to say: “What would Australia do without the ABC?”. To which MWD responds: Eat dumplings cold turkey.
Your Taxes At Work.
HISTORY CORNER
GEOFFREY ROBERTSON QC FUDGES BERT EVATT’S ROLE AS A CIVIL LIBERTARIAN
Media Watch Dog has yet to read, or even attain, a copy of Gideon Haigh’s The Brilliant Boy: Doc Evatt And The Great Australian Dissent (Simon & Schuster, 2021) – it being pandemic lockdown-time in Sydney. But Jackie’s (male) co-owner did read the review of Gideon Haigh’s 284-page tome by Geoffrey Robertson AO QC, the Australian-born patriot and republican, who is now said to enjoy dual Australian/British citizenship. Work that out if you can. By the way, the review appeared in The Weekend Australian on 17 July 2021.
Now as avid readers are aware, your man Robertson has an Epping accent. What’s an Epping accent? - MWD hears you cry. Well, it’s the kind of accent that a chap, who was born in the northwest Sydney suburb of Epping and educated at Sydney University, develops when he goes to London. You know, a fake upper-class British accent designed to disguise an Australian’s humble birth in humble Epping.
But MWD digresses. Gideon Haigh’s book focused on Bert Evatt’s dissent, when a High Court judge, in the 1939 C hester v Waverley Council case. This was a torts action following the sad death of 7 year old Maxie Chester who fell into an unprotected trench in the Waverley Council area in Sydney and drowned. Mrs Chester sued – unsuccessfully as it turned out, despite Evatt’s dissent in the High Court – for the mental injury caused by her son’s death.
In his review, Geoffrey Robertson recognised Dr Evatt’s failure, as Labor Party leader in the late 1950s, to hold the organisation together – which resulted in the disastrous Labor Party split of 1955. And he acknowledged Evatt’s sad mental decline in the 1950s and early 1960s.
However, as is his wont, your man Robertson goes over the top in his admiration of Doctor Evatt. For example, Robertson refers to Evatt’s appearance as a counsel before the High Court (when Opposition leader) “to eviscerate the Robert Menzies’s McCarthyite statute banning the Communist Party”. There was a good case for and against banning the Communist Party of Australia in 1951. But it was not an issue of the McCarthyite kind. The CPA at the time was an agent of the Soviet Union and some of its members were engaged in espionage for their communist masters in Moscow.
Many Australians agreed with Prime Minister Menzies at the time. The September 1951 referendum to ban the Communist Party of Australia at the time of the Cold War failed narrowly – with a nation wide 49.4 per cent for “Yes” and 50.6 per cent for “No” – with “Yes” obtaining majority support in Queensland, Western Australia and Tasmania. Around 50 per cent of Australians in 1951 were not followers of the American Joe McCarthy – despite what Robertson QC might believe.
By the way, Robertson had this to say about some of Evatt’s fellow judges circa 1939:

Chief Justice Latham had a second-rate mind as did Justice Rich (who was too lazy to use it), while Justice Starke was personally insufferable. Owen Dixon had the best legal mind in Australia (if not in the world) and on the occasions when it agreed with Evatt’s, the result could be incandescent – as when they tried to stop the hanging of an obviously insane killer. But both were difficult men at opposite poles politically, and Dixon was unavailable to sit on the Chester case.
That’s just abuse. Geoffrey Robertson provided no evidence that John Latham had a “second-rate mind”. The late Zelman Cowen, for one, did not believe so. As to Robertson’s assertion that Justice Starke was “personally insufferable” – that’s a bit much coming from the oh-so-pompous Robertson.
Also your man Robertson (and perhaps Haigh, pending a reading of his most recent tome) is somewhat naive in his depiction of Bert Evatt as a great civil libertarian.
When Attorney-General in the war time Labor government (commencing on 7 October 1941), Evatt acted as an authoritarian with scant interest in human rights. In the second volume of the official war history, The Government and the Peopl e (Australian War Memorial, 1970), Paul Hasluck wrote this about Evatt’s treatment, as attorney-general, of The Australia First Movement and its leader P. R. (Inky) Stephensen:
The detention of some of the 21 persons concerned was undoubtedly the grossest infringement of individual liberty made during the war and the tardiness in rectifying it was a matter of shame to the democratic institution and to the authorities concerned.
And then there is the matter of internment of aliens during the Pacific War when Evatt was attorney-general and his mate Bob Wake was involved in national security. Evatt presided over the brutal internment of Italians and German residents in Australia – the overwhelming majority of whom were not a threat to the war effort. As Dr John Fahey has written in Traitors and Spies about the outbreak of the Pacific War in late 1941 and after:
…This [the outbreak of the Pacific War] resulted in action being undertaken against possible Japanese sympathisers especially in relation to any Italians living in Australia. Queensland would see the highest number of internments in Australia as [Bob] Wake and his organisations stripped farms of their farmers and cane fields of their cane workers, to such an extent that shortages of sugar now afflicted Australia. There were also complaints from the protecting powers – that is consulates of nations charged to watch German and Italian interests in Australia – that the wholesale arrests had left stock-in-trade of shops, livestock, growing crops and personal property unattended and thus open to theft and misappropriation. When this was raised formally by Forde, Evatt didn’t comment at all.

Frank Forde was the Minister for the Army at the time. Robert Frederick Bird (Bob) Wake was in charge of Commonwealth security forces in Queensland in the early 1940s. He was a bitter anti-Catholic who disliked Italians – and an ally of Evatt. Evatt never attempted to stop Wake in his efforts to persecute Italians – especially in Queensland.
The idea that Evatt was a civil libertarian when he, as attorney-general, had the authority to act in accordance with civil liberties is a myth. Geoffrey Robertson’s attempt to present Bert Evatt as some kind of legal progressive is just, well, absolute tosh.

Full text: The state has the highest percentage of people aged from 40-59 years that have received a Covid-19 vaccine out of all Australian states.
The new data, released on Wednesday, comes as Scott Morrison said Christmas would look very different to what Aussies were experiencing now.
More than 11.5 million Covid-19 doses have been administered nationwide, with two-thirds of Victorians over 50 having had one dose.
Vaccine figures show one in two Victorians aged 50-59 have had at least one shot.
This is higher than New South Wales and Queensland, which are both yet to get half of that cohort immunised.
Almost 50 per cent of those aged 40-49 in Victoria have done their bit for the community, compared with one in three in NSW.
National cabinet will on Friday discuss modelling from the Doherty Institute that leaders will use to set targets for vaccination and easing of restrictions.
NED-3619-AstraZeneca blood clots-What we know
“I would expect by Christmas that we would be seeing a very different Australia to what we are seeing now,” the Prime Minister said.
“What we want to do is make sure we set these targets right.
“Then all of Australia, like our Olympians, we go for gold on getting those vaccination rates where we need to go.”
Mr Morrison said Australia now had the supplies, the distribution, pharmacists, GPs, and vaccination clinics in place to give a jab to everyone who wants one by the end of the year.
“We make a gold-medal run all the way to the end of this year, and the sooner we get there, the sooner we get there,” he said.

Full text: What will Australia's COVID exit wave look like?
It is a question that may not be front and centre for the nation as it deals with another crippling outbreak of the deadly virus, but Australia could get a clearer picture next week of how we hope to extricate ourselves from COVID's grip.
Scott Morrison has announced a four-phase exit plan which will probably include opening borders, vaccine passports and a staged easing of restrictions.
But the plan, and the likely exit wave which will accompany it, poses some unsettling questions for the Prime Minister, state leaders, health authorities and the community at large.
At what point do you expose the unvaccinated to a virus that could kill them? How many deaths do we regard as tolerable on the road to freedom? 100? 1000? 10,000?

The US Centers for Disease Control has started referring to COVID-19 as a "pandemic of the unvaccinated" as more than 99 per cent of virus deaths in the country are occurring in those who have opted not to receive the shots.
Even some Fox News hosts have started calling on their Trump-loving, intervention-hating viewers to get vaccinated as a country with 56 per cent of people aged over 12 fully inoculated stares down the barrel of another northern winter.
Fifteen of America's 50 states have fully vaccinated more than 90 per cent of those age over 65, but others have elderly vaccination rates as low as 69 per cent.
However, it is the United Kingdom which is about to provide Australia and the rest of the world with the most telling example of what an exit wave could look like.
Boris Johnson opened up the UK on Monday, removing most restrictions amid a surging wave of Delta variant cases. Football stadiums and nightclubs are heaving once again as the unmasked hordes pour in.
Britain and the rest of the world could have a clear idea by mid-August about the toll of this approach.
Australia has, of course, enjoyed these kind of freedoms for much of the past year, but not with coronavirus surging through the community.
Britain has fully vaccinated 54 per cent of its total population and about two-thirds of all adults. Almost 90 per cent of adults have had at least one dose, suggesting the proportion of fully vaccinated adults could end up being close to nine out of 10. But it isn't there yet.
Health secretary Sajid Javid, who has since contracted the virus himself, told the House of Commons two weeks ago that cases could reach 100,000 a day in the late summer, but he took solace that the vaccine was significantly lowering hospitalisations and deaths.
Still, modelling by the Imperial College London forecasts that every day 100 to 200 people could die and up to 2000 could be hospitalised as Britain pushes, hopefully, towards herd immunity.
This is what Britain's exit wave looks like. Maybe it will be better. Maybe it will be worse. There are many, many variables built into the modelling, including the efficacy of the vaccines, how people behave in the real world and how well the National Health Service copes.
The Imperial College team estimated that, depending on these variables, lifting restrictions amid a Delta outbreak could lead to between 9400 and 115,000 additional deaths by June 1 next year.
"Across all transmissibility and vaccine effectiveness scenarios explored, we estimate that lifting restrictions on 19 July in the context of [the Delta variant] could lead to a significant third wave of hospitalisations and deaths," they said.
To reach herd immunity, a population must either get vaccinated or get exposed to the virus until the rate of transmission falls below one. In other words, until everyone who has the virus is passing it on to fewer than one other person, on average. At this point the virus runs out of steam.
Here's hoping the virus does not mutate to get around the vaccine, or in a way that makes it more dangerous to children.
University of Newcastle clinical epidemiologist Dr Craig Dalton, an expert in how communicable diseases spread, said Australia was watching other countries closely as they removed restrictions with varying levels of vaccination in place.
"I think every country opening up with moderate levels of vaccination between the 70 to 80 per cent mark of adults will provide insight into what we might expect," Professor Dalton said.
Britain has recorded 129,000 COVID-19 deaths since the start of the pandemic, including 1800 a day in January. Many more of its citizens have been infected and survived, building up antibodies outside of immunisation.
Australia has experienced 916 COVID-19 deaths, and the population has been exposed to very little of the virus by world standards.
It is hard to believe that the nation's leaders, having been so careful and lucky to avoid tens of thousands of fatalities, will be anything but cautious when it comes to opening up.
But the dilemma remains the same: To return to normal, whatever that looks like, Morrison and state leaders must at some point agree to reopen Australia's borders, remove restrictions and let the virus circulate in a partially vaccinated community.
Using a very crude extrapolation of the Imperial College estimates based only on our relative populations, this could mean between 300 and 600 COVID deaths a week and up to 63,000 hospitalisations a week in Australia. That would be like Victoria's distressing second wave last year but on a national scale.
These numbers, though highly speculative, don't make comfortable reading for any government, let alone one facing an election before May next year, but there appears no escaping the reality that at some point the virus will spread and more people will die.
The community will not tolerate being shut up forever, even if many people remain unvaccinated.
"I think that would be hard for any country to contemplate, but with COVID we often arrive at points, decisions and epidemiological situations we haven't expected we'd arrive at," Dr Dalton said.
"The journey to that will be challenging but interesting."
The Doherty Institute in Melbourne is providing modelling to the government to help dictate the phased plan to open up, including advice on vaccination targets.
The institute said on Friday that it expected this modelling to be made public next week.
It appears as though the government is hoping to offer every adult the chance to receive the vaccine by Christmas. Once everyone has had that opportunity, it is only a matter of time before the nation expects its own Freedom Day.
Australia has 2.8 million adults fully vaccinated, or 11.5 per cent of the overall population.
In a radio interview this week, Mr Morrison referred to "65 to 70 per cent vaccination in this country", though it is not clear if this will become an official target. It is likely he and state leaders will remove various restrictions depending on tiered vaccination thresholds in each age group.
It remains to be seen whether Australia reaches an adult vaccination rate of 70 per cent or higher. The threat of a freely circulating virus which has killed 4.13 million people may be enough to convince some of the doubters.
If 30 per cent of adults remain unvaccinated when we open up, that's 6 million people. If we don't vaccinate children, that's another 6 million.
Victorian Premier Dan Andrews said recently when talking about abandoning lockdowns early next year after everyone has been offered the vaccine: "We wouldn't be having lockdowns to protect people who weren't prepared to protect themselves."
It is the closest an Australian politician has come to saying: If you catch COVID and die, it will be your fault.
However, the vaccines are not 100 per cent effective, and the Delta variant appears to pose more danger to younger people than earlier iterations. Outside of death, long COVID is having a serious effect on victims.
To what extent do governments have a duty to protect people from themselves? Australia does this in other ways, with seat belts, anti-smoking taxes and myriad other public health measures, but not at such expense to others.
These are thorny ethical issues we expect our leaders to navigate.
Last year, our COVID response and geographical isolation bought us valuable time to see how the rest of the world dealt with a raging pandemic, both in terms of restrictions and treatments.
The world focused too much on washing hands when it should have been wearing masks, but in Australia the slow realisation that the virus was circulating in the air did not lead to catastrophic loss of life.
Now, our tortoise-like vaccine rollout has granted us the unintended luxury of looking on while the UK rolls the dice.
Regardless of the outcome, the only visible way for Australia to get from Point A to Point B is through a tunnel. The more people we have vaccinated, the less scary that tunnel will look.

Rita Panahi: ‘Gold standard’ Gladys Berejiklian’s dramatic fall from grace

Author: Panahi, Rita

Full text: So much for a proportional, rational response to coronavirus. “Browsing is not allowed,” scolded Berejiklian. She was echoing the sentiments of chief health officer Dr Kerry Chant who said: “This is not the time for browsing.”
Like Victoria, the police in NSW have enthusiastically overstepped the mark, with assistant commissioner Tony Cooke warning the citizenry that officers will carefully scrutinise their shopping to ensure they have left home for an essential reason.
“The question will be … what’s your reasonable excuse for being here? You don’t need that pair of shoes today,” he said.
For more than 15 months Berejiklian was the sensible antidote to the hysterical bed-wetting from every other state leader, Labor and Liberal, but sadly she is now pursuing an eradication model that could see Sydney and surrounds locked down for many more weeks.
NSW reported 89 news cases on Tuesday, but 59 of these are household contacts. Surely, if we’re going to continue to be hysterical about each single case, then it would be prudent to send infected individuals to hotel quarantine (at the state’s expense) instead of home to infect the household.
Berejiklian claims the Delta variant is a “game changer”, but that has not been the experience in other advanced nations that have reopened or are reopening and doing so without reaching anything close to the vaccination thresholds being considered in Australia.
On Tuesday Premier Dan Andrews said even a vaccination rate of 75 per cent wouldn’t be sufficient to return to normality given that would leave millions unvaccinated.
“It’s a pretty big number of people, and if it runs through there – and a percentage of them get really unwell – then that’s the hospitals full,” he said.
Only that has not been the case in the advanced world. One look at Florida which has been open all year would dispel fears of hospitals unable to cope. Florida is known as “God’s little waiting room” for having the second oldest population in the US but despite being fully open for months the hospital system has not been overwhelmed nor has the death rate soared.
Even the states that locked down the longest and hardest, such as New York and California, have reopened. Indeed 48 US states are open for business despite less than 50 per cent of the country being fully vaccinated. The UK will lift remaining restrictions such as masks, social distancing, legal limits on gatherings on July 19 with 65 per cent of its adult population (around 52 per cent of total population) fully vaccinated, despite new daily cases of more than 30,000.
The surge in Delta variant infections is not reflected in a similar surge in hospital admissions and deaths thanks largely to the high vaccination rate of those at greatest risk of Covid-19.
And there is more good news from the UK, with the most comprehensive study of children with Covid concluding that the risk of serious illness or death is extremely low, far lower than influenza, with a survival rate of 99.995 per cent.
Australia is suffering from a failure of leadership, at both state and federal level, with our elected representatives relinquishing their power to unelected, unaccountable health bureaucrats.
Scott Morrison was listening to the “best health advice” when he began Australia’s vaccine program later than much of the world and he was dutifully echoing Brendan Murphy when he repeated the health department secretary’s line about the rollout not being a race. As I wrote back in March, the “it’s not a race” mentality was holding Australia back and was the product of a gutless political class and health bureaucrats who have a narrow focus of what constitutes success.
It is imperative the Prime Minister does not handball the most crucial decision about reopening the country to the health bureaucracy or the Doherty Institute, whose modelling has, at times, been wildly wrong including the prediction that under a best-case scenario, with strict isolation and social distancing, we’d need 5000 intensive care beds for Covid cases.
The Doherty Institute will provide recommendations to the PM and state and territory leaders on vaccine thresholds to be met for the four-phase reopening of the country. It would be politically expedient, though ruinous for the country, to set a benchmark of 80 per cent or more.
Targets for lifting Covid restrictions and fully reopening should be based on vaccine availability rather than the actual percentage of people immunised.
By now everyone who is in a high-risk category should be vaccinated, they’ve had since February to get their jabs. We cannot keep Australia isolated to “protect” people unwilling to be immunised.

Higher vaccination targets for over-70s before nation opens

Full text: Australia's plan to end COVID-19 lockdowns and begin reopening state and international borders will rely on at least 75 per cent of over-70s getting vaccinated but a lower proportion of younger Australians will need to have had the jab.
The Sunday Age has learnt there will be no move from phase one to phase two of the plan - which the government hopes to achieve by the end of 2021 - before the number of over-70s who are fully vaccinated has passed at least 75 per cent and probably higher. Currently, 72.9 per cent of people over 70 have had at least one jab.
The number of people who will have to be fully vaccinated in younger cohorts is expected to be broken down into three age groups - potentially 50-70-year-olds, 40-50-year-olds and 18-40-year-olds - which broadly reflects the current age groups of the rollout. Vaccination thresholds for younger Australians will be lower than for the over-70s before the move to phase two but will still be high.
Under the four-phase plan to reopen Australia agreed by the state and federal governments, phase two - dubbed the "post-vaccination stage" - would ease restrictions on vaccinated residents, mean lockdowns were imposed only in extreme circumstances, restore inbound traveller caps for unvaccinated people and allow more vaccinated travellers to return.
The federal government has asked the Doherty Institute to provide modelling on vaccination targets and that work is expected back at the end of July.
Health Minister Greg Hunt told The Sunday Age that "Australians are getting vaccinated and they realise it takes some time".
"Opening up is likely to be a graduated staircase, a series of steps. The message is clear - we have to ease off carefully and open up carefully," he said.
"Access to vaccines for the
40-59 group is about to open up significantly. And then we have a big population, about 7 million people, between 20 and 40 years of age and then about 1.3 million people between 16 and 20."
Mr Hunt would not comment on what the vaccination targets for different age groups would be, pointing out the Doherty Institute work had not yet even been finalised. Several other members of the ministry contacted by The Sunday Age were also shy given the sensitive nature of the work.
One minister, who asked not to be named, speculated the required vaccination rates could be 80 per cent for the vulnerable groups and over-70s, then 70 per cent and 60 per cent for lower-risk groups - but cautioned "that's a guess".
As well as protecting over-70s, who are more likely to get seriously ill or die from COVID-19, the tiered approach is expected to set higher targets for people who are immuno-compromised and Indigenous Australians, for example.
Epidemiology chair at Deakin University Catherine Bennett, Professor Sharon Lewin, who is director of Melbourne's Doherty Institute but not involved in the government modelling, and Burnet Institute infectious diseases expert Suman Majumdar all backed the move to ensure higher vaccination rates for older and vulnerable Australians before reopening.
Lieutenant-General John Frewen, who is leading the vaccine rollout, signalled last week that under-40s would finally be able to access Pfizer jabs from late September or early October as the number of doses arriving in the country rises to 1 million a week in late July and then up to about 1.2 million a week in August.
The final decision on what the percentage vaccination targets should be, however, will
ultimately be a decision taken by state and federal leaders and will take account of not just the
Doherty modelling but also the impact of closed borders and lockdowns on the economy and society more broadly.
The federal government is increasingly confident that every Australian will have had a chance to be vaccinated by the end of 2021 as supply of the Pfizer vaccine ramps up and as Moderna and then Novavax vaccines arrive onshore.
Professor Lewin said higher vaccination targets for older Australians "makes a lot of sense".
She suggested that reaching a high vaccination target for vulnerable groups could even be enough for Australia to progress to a new phase of the government's road map out of COVID-19 restrictions.
"But the most important thing is protecting those most vulnerable, with very high vaccination rates of people over 60," she said.
Professor Bennett said it made sense not only to have different vaccine targets for different ages, but also particular at-risk cultural groups and occupations, such as security guards and cleaners who moved between workplaces, aged care staff and meat workers.
"I think a lot of us have fielded the questions saying, 'What's the magic number?'," she said. "It's probably not going to be one. And it shouldn't be one."
Dr Majumdar backed higher targets for priority groups most at risk of getting very sick from COVID-19, as well as front-line and essential workers.
Australia reached the 9 million jab milestone yesterday and it's expected 10 million jab mark will have been reached within another 10 days. However, only a little over 10 per cent of people are fully vaccinated.

Full text: WHEN epidemiologist Tony Blakely describes the coming months as “bumpy”, he is being optimistic.
If we can squash the latest outbreak, and if people keep getting vaccinated, and if quarantine arrangements improve, the future will nevertheless be blotted with alarms, mistakes and misjudgments.
Blakely likens 2022 to a plane taking off, when the flight is buffeted by cumulus clouds before reaching cruising altitude. The ifs are myriad, and Blakely’s professional calling, a kind of scientific crystal ball gazing, is all about the ifs.
He applies the available information for his forecast.
AstraZeneca is vital to the fight, he says, but it has weaknesses. AstraZeneca is very good at protecting a person from serious illness, not so good (perhaps 50 per cent reduction in getting infected) at limiting transmissions.
Blakely hypothesises that if more than 70 per cent of the adult population gets vaccinated, decision-makers will look to open connections with other countries.
Herein lies his first point – the need for purpose-built quarantine facilities, such as those announced Friday. Their absence has cost Australia, and Victoria, again and again.
Lessons from aerosol transmission have been ignored, which explains why Melbourne is in its fourth lockdown.
Specialised hubs, which rate risks according to country of origin, could reduce quarantine breaches by about 90 per cent.
Under Blakely’s scenario, virus outbreaks, therefore, will continue from time to time. Contact tracers will be busy for years.
In some good news, Blakely is confident that contact tracing – once a particularly Victorian failing – can mop up spreads before they flourish.
But something in the projections continues to be overlooked, he warns. Children may be largely protected from the ravages of Covid-19. Yet kids still contract and transmit the virus.
Blakely turns to rough maths. If 70 per cent of the adult population is vaccinated, and if adults comprise more than three in four Australians, then about 50 per cent of the total population will be buffered from virus spread. The other half will be exposed to catching and spreading the virus.
Blakely foreshadows a national conversation that has yet to be had – to vaccinate our children.
“Kids will have to be vaccinated, in my view, or 100 per cent of adults, which we won’t achieve,” he says.
“Kids being vaccinated is going to be an interesting dilemma, because the kids don’t get much personal protection from it. Mum and dad are going to be sitting there going, ‘why should I vaccinate my kid?’ We will need to start talking about this in a couple of months’ time but we can start articulating it now a little bit.”
LIKE weather forecasting, epidemiology is the science of reading the clues, sorting them according to which will prevail or dim. Blakely likes a pinball machine analogy, a kind of scientific moving of the flippers to see what effect it will have on the pinball’s movement.
Epidemiology has never been so vital, its purview so immediate and urgent. As with weather people, Melburnians can now identify their favoured epidemiologists.
Bearers of wisdom, epidemiologists are also the bringers of bad tidings. Their unfettered judgments can double as the voices of reason. They are driven by the science, as opposed to the politics of policy making.
As it happens, Blakely lives in the next suburb, so we meet in a nearby park, a peculiarly Melbourne choice of venue in lockdown. Oaks soar above. Replica cannons – a preferred backdrop for Jeff Kennett press conferences when he was premier – stand nearby.
Older couples sip coffee amid the falling leaves, and so do not watch acting Premier James Merlino announcing a week extension to the current lockdown.
Blakely unhitches his bike helmet and starts talking – fast. He is hurry, hurry, as you might expect of a pandemic expert during a pandemic, and fond of words such as “bonkers” and “bollocks” to describe poor policy choices.
He rose to prominence last year. He modelled the road map which the Andrews Government applied to a second 111-day lockdown, though he emphasises that his work was based on science and not policy, a distinction that can often go unappreciated.
An “explainer”, as he fashioned himself, the University of Melbourne professor described the projected virtues and pitfalls of containing an entire population for months on end.
He was in “the right place at the right time”, he says. But it was fraught. Hate mail grew, and he was pilloried by some in the media. He was cast as a “puppeteer”, and blamed for an at times demoralising elimination strategy which relied on a sustained lockdown.
He was untethered to political imperatives, unafraid of the “E-word” (elimination), which he came to advocate, not as an ideal so much as a consequence of an aggressive suppression approach.
For a time, Blakely deliberately stepped back from public pronouncements. But it was short-lived, perhaps a few days. He felt compelled to tell Melburnians why this or that was happening and extrapolate what might happen next.
This public perch can be “nerve-racking”. Yet Blakely has been unafraid to identify sustained failings, such as contact tracing in Victoria last year, or the continuing failures of hotel quarantine, to apply his analysis of the past, present and future scenarios.
He happily admits when he has got it wrong. Last year, he tended to favour a 10-case-a-day trigger for the easing of Melbourne restrictions. The Andrews Government went with a higher bar – and subsequently longer lockdown period – of only five cases a day.
“I was surprised the government went for five a day, I expected 10 a day, but they were right,” he says. “Allen Cheng and Brett Sutton made a brave call, we’ll go for five, and obviously what was in the back of their mind was the good chance of elimination. Their foresight and bravery at holding at five cases a day deserves accolades.” Accused of being “Dan’s Man”, to his amusement and frustration, Blakely also finds plenty to criticise about last year’s approach. He is cautious about accepting the current government line of the super-infectious virus variant.
Instead, he suspects that contact tracing last year was so cumbersome – largely because the Health Department was so under-resourced – that investigators can now make connections in virus chains they once could not.
BLAKELY lucked in with the timing of his long-hoped for move to Melbourne, from New Zealand. His marriage had broken down; his now partner also works at the University of Melbourne.
He arrived in January, 2019. Within 12 months his diverging professional interests, including tobacco use, obesity and diet, were whittled to the one subject that all of Melbourne could not ignore.
He was an outsider – on the inside.
Early in his career, a former New Zealand prime minister working on behalf of the tobacco industry, publicly called out Blakely’s research. It can be “tricky”, he says in describing an occupational hazard, when modelling and estimates are only as reliable as the information to hand.
New information has shifted Blakely’s view on the virus origin. He now tends to think, after reading recent studies of the virus’ genetic make-up, that the spread was more likely to have leaked from a lab in Wuhan than through an intermediary animal host.
Natural evolution seems unlikely to explain the genetic changes. Tests on 80,000 animals between the bat population and Wuhan itself show no evidence of intermediary hosts.
“What does it mean for us right now?” he asks. “Not a lot. What does it mean for us going forward? Well, it means we have to relook at our lab biosecurity.” Blakely marvels at the political pointscoring that drives so much of the Australian pandemic discourse. There will be more pandemics, he says. They are inevitable.
“There are some big lessons from this and one is that human beings sense of self-sanctimony, that we are somehow different to the animal kingdom,” he says.
“No, we’re not, we’re part of the same ecology, and infections spread between animals, and that will happen again in the future.” More immediately, we need to keep refining our responses to the current crisis. “What struck me when the pandemic took off was the people with most expertise to help the public with understanding were essentially gagged,” he says. “They were on committees in which they basically couldn’t speak up. I think that’s part of that silo research here (in Australia), that there’s not enough generalist research activity.
“Because I was new to the country, and wasn’t on committees like that, I happened to be in a position where I could talk freely. And I did.” patrick.carlyon@news.com.au

Andrews pivot on COVID target

Full text: Victoria's COVID-19 response has retreated from an undeclared ambition of eliminating the virus before Christmas to a more pragmatic and achievable aim of suppressing its spread to levels the state can live with safely.
Senior epidemiologists say the government's conflicting public health message - Premier Daniel Andrews talking about 10 daily cases being the new five and five being the new zero - reflects unrealistic targets it set when the road map out of lockdown was set two months ago.
The government's inconsistency has confused many Victorians. It set and then abandoned its provisional dates for new stages of lockdown and changed its targets from set dates to case thresholds. It first defended the nightly curfew as necessary for police to do their work, then dumped it in the face of legal action. It retained the five-kilometre rule, while epidemiologists said there was no public health reason for it.
The overarching problem, say epidemiologists, is that the government was quietly pursuing an elimination strategy for the virus. The terms elimination and suppression - or "aggressive suppression" as the national cabinet and the Victorian government have preferred - can be confusing, but experts say there has been a clear change in approach in recent weeks.
The good news is that Victoria has already suppressed the spread of the virus to a point where, in the absence of another large-scale outbreak, the government is likely to move through the remaining steps out of the state's three-month lockdown and declare "COVID normal" in time for summer holidays.
While Mr Andrews has said the steps to be taken on Sunday would "not be as big as we hoped", he insists they would be "significant" and were still being considered. His language has shifted to acknowledge the social costs of continued lockdown and the pain of continued restrictions for business and citizens. On Sunday, it is possible that the five-kilometre rule may be scrapped as well as the loosening of some restrictions on social gatherings.
Professor James McCaw, a University of Melbourne epidemiologist who sits on the Australian Health Protection Principal Committee, the national cabinet's health advisory group, says the measures can't come soon enough.
"Up until now I had been concerned that we may have been on an unacknowledged elimination path which is not in my epidemiological view a sensible or justifiable one," Professor McCaw said. "Moving towards a genuine, aggressive suppression strategy ... is an incredibly welcome development.
"The sooner we start this process the better. We have to do it slowly, we have to do it cautiously and we have got to release the pressure in the system in a controlled manner. If we wait too long it will explode."
Professor Tony Blakely, an epidemiologist whose modelling informed the government's road map out of COVID restrictions, says there has been a clear "pivot" inside the Department of Health and Human Services.
"They are letting go of the chance of achieving elimination," he said. "We are doing aggressive suppression, which is where we try to get the numbers low. Ten is the new five is basically a shift away from elimination to living with the virus."
"It must be confusing from the outside because people are not using words like elimination, but it is quite clear what is happening,"
That shift happened this week, with Mr Andrews abandoning the stated aim of a 14-day average of five daily cases or lower required to move to the next step of lifting restrictions, suggesting it may be unrealistic to expect fewer then 10 daily cases.
Most epidemiologists define elimination as no new COVID cases recorded for a life cycle of the virus, usually measured at 14 or 21 days. Although this milestone has been achieved in Western Australia, South Australia. Tasmania and the Northern Territory, it is not the goal of national cabinet, which is aiming for zero community transmissions across all states and territories.
Mr Andrews has repeatedly denied that Victoria has an elimination strategy. In documents tabled to Parliament over the weekend to support an extension of Victoria's state of emergency, the state government confirmed its "aggressive suppression" actions were aligned with the national strategic objective.
Definitions aside, Victoria's apparent rethinking of its strategy should ease tensions with the federal government, which is concerned that Australia's second largest city is stuck in a socially and economically destructive lockdown.
It will also ease public frustration at having to endure some of the world's tightest COVID-19 restrictions at a time when daily case numbers have in recent days fallen below those of NSW.
Professor McCaw said Victorians had been compliant in following public health directives but this would need to continue with adherence to social distancing and the use of masks.
"One of the most important things we need is for the Victorian community to retain its faith in its leadership," he said. "We have got some people arguing to stay locked up, which puts the government at risk of losing community support, and we have people advocating for a complete relaxation of measures, which would also be very risky.
"In between is a safe, navigable path which I get the sense the government is moving towards."
Yesterday, federal Health Minister Greg Hunt said Victoria's average rate of new infections was now below the Australian Health Protection Principal Committee's definition of a COVID-19 hotspot, clearing the way for the state to follow NSW's path out of lockdown. Between July 18 and August 13, NSW managed an average of 15 new cases a day without triggering a further epidemic. Melbourne's 14-day average now stands at 9.6.
The consensus across senior government figures and public health experts is that Victoria's contact tracing, although overwhelmed at the height of the second wave epidemic, has significantly improved over the past two months and could be trusted to respond to and control future outbreaks.
"We should have more confidence in our systems now they have been rebuilt and those systems detach us from the need for strict lockdown," Deakin University epidemiologist Catherine Bennett said.
Victoria's road map released by the Andrews government on September 6 required the 14-day, statewide case average to fall to five and an average of zero cases to trigger the final step towards a "COVID normal". At the time, several senior epidemiologists said the targets were unrealistic. In the weeks since, the signposts along the road map have frequently changed.
Professor McCaw said when the road map was first released the case thresholds were unachievable and unnecessary. Since then, he has reported regularly to the AHPPC on Victoria's progress.There was a "brief period of time" about three weeks ago when it looked as though Victoria had a 50-50 chance of achieving its targets. Those odds have drifted since the Chadstone shopping centre outbreak, so far linked to 43 cases including eight in regional Victoria.

ONCE IT WAS DISTANCE, BUT A NEW TYRANNY IS ABROAD

Full text: Experts have been in charge during this pandemic and what a carry-on it has been Just as we were getting over the tyranny of distance, another has emerged to make life incredibly difficult for ordinary folk: the tyranny of experts.
When the pandemic first emerged, some high-profile journalists rejoiced that so-called experts were now in charge. At last, experts were dictating policy and this principle must be extended to climate change policy — we listened to the experts on coronavirus, it’s time we heard them on climate change.
But the so-called expert opinion when it comes to COVID-19 is just a motley mess of differing views often using inappropriate modelling and silly assumptions. The carry-on by local epidemiologists has made economists look good. And don’t forget that you can lay all the economists in the world head to toe and they still won’t reach a conclusion.
It’s not just the howlers, such as the Doherty Institute mixing up total number of hospitalisations with intensive care unit admissions and thereby frightening the pants off governments.
It turns out the figure of 36,000 was not the number of ICU beds required — there were only 4000 ICU beds at the time — but the maximum possible number of people with the virus requiring hospital care at any time.
It also is not just the fact many epidemiologists and, for that matter, state chief health officers have zero clinical experience, including in infectious disease management. For many it’s simply a mathematical game and cranking the handle of their preferred models. But the public exposure, if not adulation, is a plus many have enjoyed.
The tragedy is that our political leaders, particularly at state level, have insufficient nous to see through what is served up by “experts” while meekly claiming the “science” has made them impose the unbearable draconian restrictions, particularly where restrictions can be marketed in ways that make them politically attractive as well. The process may be coming to an end in Victoria, but there is no doubt Daniel Andrews initially found no problem wrapping up frightening “expert” opinion with the image of a strong leader solely concerned about the welfare of his people.
When it comes to the epidemiologists, there clearly are large divisions among them, particularly in relation to the elimination-versus-suppression strategy, the appropriate modelling approach and the need to take into account the wider effects of any measures imposed, including on other health outcomes and the economy.
There’s the sky-is-about-to-fall gang and the more measured group. University of Melbourne professor Tony Blakely, commissioned by the Victorian government to undertake the latest modelling underpinning the highly contested future road map, is in the first group. Australian National University professor Peter Collignon is much more measured, seeing the bigger picture.
Then there is Stephen Duckett of the Grattan Institute, who calls himself a health economist — he is definitely not an epidemiologist — who has argued for zero COVID-19 cases irrespective of the economic consequences. This is notwithstanding other Grattan staff arguing for even more government spending to counter the negative economic consequences of the restrictions. Go figure.
A key problem with the modelling exercises undertaken to justify harsh actions by governments is that underlying assumptions are unclear. There also seems to have been little learning from the course of the disease. Initially, it was fair enough to paint the worst-case scenario in which our hospital system might be overwhelmed and act to increase our ICU capacity, purchase personal protective equipment and other items, and ensure adequate staff.
We have learned much since. The virus is highly infectious though not very lethal, but it remains a problem for older people and those with certain comorbidities. This points to targeted, more nuanced approaches than those undertaken by state governments.
The modelling underpinning the Victorian government’s latest policy proposals is based on a core assumption not supported by the facts. As University of Toronto professor Josh Gans notes, the model assumes that everyone, directly or indirectly, eventually runs into everyone else. If we look at the geographical incidence of the virus and known patterns of movement by Victorians, this is just wrong. The alternative susceptible, infected and recovered individuals modelling approach would yield different policy implications, including the need for local hotspot identification and graduated local responses.
Not that the tyranny of experts is confined to Victoria. In Queensland, justification for closed state borders becomes more ridiculous as the weeks pass. But the “intimidated but I won’t be intimidated” Premier, Annastacia Palaszczuk, blames the Chief Health Officer. This person has no expertise in infectious diseases, almost no clinical experience and has been in the job almost two decades. Her capacity to justifiably demand state borders be closed to protect public safety must surely be open to question. And her excuse for allowing some into the state — AFL royalty, celebrities, the wealthy — is laughable. According to this faux economist: “We need every single dollar in our state.” The mind boggles — how many more dollars does she think have been forgone by the border closures?
What governments should have requested after the first phase of the pandemic, and when appropriate resources were in place, was analysis from epidemiologists and economists working together to manage the virus at the lowest cost. And note the economic damage wrought is already substantial, long-lasting and uneven in impact.
Instead of our governments managing the virus relatively well — with the exception of Victoria — at a high economic cost, there was an alternative of managing it at a much lower cost. When a politician says experts are in charge or the “science” made them do it, be suspicious. These experts don’t speak with one voice and many are peddling values they hold dear; as true with COVID-19 as it is with climate change. Politicians are elected to govern us all; this requires judgment about the trade-offs that inevitably exist with all policy decisions. The tyranny of experts needs to resisted. They may have a role to play but not in an uncontested way. And when you hear the term “evidence-based policy”, bear in mind it’s generally policy-based evidence.

Full text: Falling COVID-19 case numbers should lead to a sensible rethink on reopening Melbourne.
The divide between regional Victoria and metro Melbourne deepens. The "ring of steel" around Melbourne is to be strengthened as the regions open up. What is the public health message for metro Melbourne then? The Premier tells us this is "proof positive that the strategy is working".
Yes, we all get it that we have to "get the numbers low to keep them low". But the question is not whether a sledgehammer will crack a walnut, it is whether a nutcracker will suffice.
Should Melbourne be happy that regional Victoria is hitting its targets? Absolutely. This success is critical given Melbourne's target of five cases for step three is statewide. The "mystery" case count is also statewide for Melbourne's step three target and, given there is often a few weeks' lag to closing off on these, it is not clear how long we must wait for the final classification of cases under investigation. The steps remain complicated and operationally unclear.
But all this might change. There has been increasing emphasis on "common sense" in the Victorian press conferences, corresponding with widespread pressure to explain the modelling. The University of Melbourne believes the modelling has been "misrepresented", and argues for more realistic targets.
The response from the Department of Health and Human Services is that modelling formed only part of the policy process, though a "significant and core input". The Premier tells us the model is being continually updated with actual case data. I am not sure how this helps if it is not then used to reset the numeric targets and dates. Hopefully it will.
By far the clearest message last week was in actual case numbers - only 41 new cases reported yesterday, fewer than seven cases per million. But the public health message is that this number is still too high and a resurgence looms. While the modelling is refined with new data and input from experts from the Doherty and Burnet institutes, can we learn anything from our past?
In May, Victoria was opening up to allow visiting friends and family (gatherings of up to 10 outdoors and five in the home), even though Melbourne was still battling the Cedar Meats outbreak.
The genomic profile of the virus associated with this outbreak, or circulating in Melbourne in the months prior, is not found in Victoria now. Our contact tracers contained the outbreak and community transmission was eliminated.
This success was supplanted by the second wave as the hotel quarantine outbreak quickly spilled into the community. The hotel quarantine inquiry reported last week that within just a few generations of transmission, the virus may have found its way into aged care via a household contact of a quarantine guard.
It is also suggested that contact tracing in aged care had a focus on residents but not staff. If there is a link, this does raise the possibility that transmission into the community, and between facilities, may have slipped under the contact-tracing radar, and therefore could explain how the second wave got away from us.
There has been a lot of talk about the modelling this past week, with the consensus among experts that it is not designed for Victoria's complexity (regions and workplaces with differential risk, etc.). The modellers themselves recognise their contact tracing parameters underestimate the current public health response. We can "beat the model", Professor Tony Blakely told us, and shorten the time to reach targets. But the real question is whether we need to get down to such low targets to safely move to step three. This weekend Blakely went further and suggested the step three targets themselves should also be reconsidered.
Importantly, case numbers now are low enough to work with actuals, not modelling. The contact-tracing teams have proven what they are capable of, when given a fair fight. We can be optimistic knowing how our public health response has beaten outbreaks before, and that this can only get better with recent enhancements: smart IT supports, regional hubs and invaluable experience.
Our confidence in reducing numbers and keeping them low is affirmed by the effectiveness of localised contact tracing in the rapid containment of the Colac outbreak, even when accelerating towards 30 cases within two weeks.
Common sense must guide us on this road map, and will allow a shift in focus to the important business of evidence-based prevention, early warning systems and testing strategies, backed up by contact tracing and outbreak response readiness. Whether we achieve elimination of local transmission after this wave is neither here nor there; we need to be ready for more cases, whether from residual silent transmission or the virus being reintroduced. We no longer have to fear this, we just have to be ready.

Lockdown hope: state on track for new lows

Full text: Victoria is on track to record about 30 new daily cases of COVID-19 at the end of the stage four lockdown, according to projections by a leading epidemiologist.
University of Melbourne epidemiologist Tony Blakely said the numbers were now low enough to enable contact tracers to get on top of their caseload, as the federal Health Department secretary Brendan Murphy said Victoria's response had been overwhelmed by the rapid spread of the virus.
As Premier Daniel Andrews expressed optimism about the daily coronavirus count falling to its lowest levels in five weeks, new modelling by Professor Blakely has shed light on the number of new daily cases we can expect to see within a few weeks.
"We are falling at a crackingly good pace," he said.
There are some limitations to Professor Blakely's projections, which use COVID-19 trends over the past 10 days to predict what the next few weeks might look like before stage four restrictions are set to end on September 13.
Professor Blakely said the virus might continue spreading among essential workers in hospitals, aged care and distribution centres, slowing the rate of decline. In addition, the slowdown in new cases in regional Victoria might be less dramatic, because residents are living under stage three restrictions.
But there is a flipside that could counter these potential hurdles.
"We have gone below 200 new daily cases. We are just starting to have a sweet spot for contact tracing," Professor Blakely said.
"The contact tracing workforce has fewer cases and they can start getting their arms across it."
Victoria recorded 179 new cases of coronavirus yesterday, its lowest number since July 13. There were nine deaths, taking the state's death toll to 385.
Chief Health Officer Brett Sutton said he wanted daily case numbers to fall below 50 by the end of stage four restrictions.
But he flagged concerns about outbreaks in high-risk settings such as aged care, saying this could hamper efforts to hit this target. "I would sound a note of caution - we're going into a challenging phase in the next couple of weeks."
He confirmed that Victoria was aiming to eliminate community transmission of the virus.
But while Professor Sutton said case numbers were where he expected, Mr Andrews said the decline had been quicker than he had imagined.
"We can be hopeful about these numbers, we can be positive about these numbers, but that can't be accompanied by any sense of complacency," he told reporters, as he appeared before the media for the 50th day in a row.
The pair said it was too early to be discussing the lifting of restrictions.
Meanwhile, federal Health Department secretary Brendan Murphy took a swipe at Victoria's contact tracing efforts, saying the scheme had been "overwhelmed" by the rapid spread of virus during the state's second wave.
"This virus is incredibly infectious and unfortunately the Victorian public health response was unable to control the outbreaks in the way that NSW has done," Professor Murphy told the COVID-19 Senate committee hearing yesterday.
The Victorian Health Department data shows the number of new coronavirus cases in which the infection source cannot be traced - which have been dubbed "mystery cases" by the Premier - has also been decreasing this month.
Since the start of the pandemic there have been 3808 coronavirus cases in Victoria where the source of the infection cannot be traced, which make up about 20 per cent of all COVID-19 cases recorded in the state.
Yesterday, a total of 24 additional cases were added to this tally, the lowest single-day increase in weeks.
There are currently about 700 cases for which the infection source is still being investigated by the Health Department, which means the true number of these "mystery cases" may well be higher. Deakin University chair of epidemiology Catherine Bennett said getting on top of these mystery cases was key to driving down new cases to double digits.
While she warned against prematurely abandoning stage four restrictions, she said they could be modified to allow for low-risk activities if new cases continued to decline in coming weeks.
She said letting people exercise for longer, relaxing the rules around grocery shopping and allowing people to venture beyond five kilometres of their home could be options.
"We can see the light at the end of the tunnel," she said. "We know this is working."

Lockdown works or 500 cases every day

Full text: Locked-down Victoria will be hammered by up to 500 new cases of COVID-19 every day by the end of next week — with in­fections doubling every five days — ­unless the disastrous corona­virus outbreak is checked, exclusive modelling for The Weekend Australian shows.
The confronting scenario emerged on Friday as Victoria ­reported the biggest daily spike in cases since the pandemic erupted, with 288 more people testing positive to the virus.
Premier Daniel Andrews, who is already under pressure over the bungling of security at Melbourne quarantine hotels, said the latest surge in infections was of “great concern” and had not yet peaked. “We knew it would need to get worse before it got better, and that unless we took those steps we ­simply wouldn’t be able to bring a sense of control to this,” Mr Andrews said, referring to the reintroduction of Stage Three COVID restrictions.
“We would not be able to see a stabilisation and then a driving down of those numbers. At the same time, no one should underestimate how significant, how big a challenge it is that we all face. It is very significant, and that is why each of us (has) to play a part.” The modelling by mathematical biologist Deborah Cromer of the University of NSW’s Kirby ­Institute predicts the daily ­in­crease in new cases will hit 500 on Thursday and pass 1000 by July 21 if the disease continues to spread at the current rate.
She expects that case numbers will plateau next week as the re­instated restrictions take effect in Melbourne and the city’s surrounds, a prediction that was echoed by Victoria’s Chief Health Officer, Brett Sutton. If not, the modelling shows there will be 1349 new infections a day by the final week of July.
“This is community transmission, a really serious problem,” Dr Cromer said. “The lockdown is important. If nothing is done, then it will continue to take off, as we have seen elsewhere in the world.” While Friday’s jump of 288 new coronavirus cases in Victoria surpassed the previous state record of 212 posted in NSW on March 28 at the height of the first wave of infections, the virus is not spreading as quickly as it was when lockdowns began nationwide three months ago.
Backed by the premiers and chief ministers, Scott Morrison acted swiftly to control case ­numbers that were doubling every three days in mid-March, putting Australia on a trajectory similar to devastated Italy and Spain, the European epicentres of the pandemic at that time.
The Prime Minister said on Friday it was “very clear” that community transmission had taken off in Melbourne. He warned that all Australians were at risk, despite the success of other states and territories in containing breakouts.
Mr Andrews said the majority of new cases were “under investigation” — suggesting community transmission — which is in sharp contrast to the situation in March-April, when most infections were traced to international travellers who had been in hot zones overseas.
Nobel laureate Peter Doherty, namesake and patron of the University of Melbourne’s Doherty Institute for Infection and Immunity, said the rate of spread in Victoria was consistent with a basic reproductive rate of 2.5 for the virus.
This meant each infected person could be expected to transmit the disease to 2½ others.
“I have been asking this question over and over of the epidemiologists, whether they are seeing anything above that,” he said.
“And it does seem to be about 2.5, which makes it about as infectious as a bad flu, but infinitely less infectious than measles.” Dr Cromer’s modelling shows that the daily increase in new cases in Victoria would top 338 by Monday and 675 next Friday, July 17, unless the contagion was arrested. “The lockdown that is happening across Melbourne should work. In the past it did work,” said Dr Cromer, who has conducted COVID-19 modelling for NSW Health. “You would hope to see some impact next week in the slowing down of the numbers, somewhere between the 13th (of July) and the 18th.” Professor Doherty said Melbourne’s plight underlined how dangerous coronavirus was. “The lesson is this thing ramps up very, very fast,” he said. “When the word came out that we were ­coming out of lockdowns, I think people relaxed too fast.”

Full text: From COVID-19 to global warming, expert predictions of doom are proving wrong
Tony Abbott’s suspicion that climate change modelling was “absolute crap” soon will resonate more broadly - so spectacularly bad was expert modelling of the spread and lethality of the coronavirus, faith in all modelling must surely suffer.
Why trust the experts to forecast the climate decades into the future when they were so wrong about a disease related to the common cold?
Official coronavirus and climate change modelling share catastrophic predictions. Unfortunately for virus modellers, reality dawned a lot sooner and it has delivered an F for fail. The pandemic has damaged the credibility of “experts” and highlighted the limits of “the science” and the misplaced hubris of the political class.
On whatever measure you choose — deaths, infections, rate of transmission — the epidemiological models that convinced governments to take a sledgehammer to their economies, now mired in unrest, have proved scandalously pessimistic and out by orders of magnitude.
We were told the virus’s spread would be “exponential”. It wasn’t; transmission was falling before mandatory lockdowns scared the daylights out of people.
The infection fatality rate, we were told, would be about 1 per cent; it’s closer to 0.2 per cent, akin to a severe flu. Apparently, lifting lockdowns early would see cases surge; they haven’t. And we were all vulnerable — but most weren’t; the median age of death is well over 80. Driving is more dangerous. At least half of deaths globally have been in aged-care homes, which were already locked down. We understood you could catch COVID-19 again — also wrong. We closed schools and wore masks, but the evidence we needed to do so is scant.
The raw numbers speak for themselves. The death toll globally is on track to be smaller than the flu pandemics of the 1950s and 60s, when the world’s population was less than half that today.
Indeed, if you put the number of global deaths last year, this year, and next year (about 60 million each year) on a simple column chart you’ll struggle to see the ­impact of COVID-19.
Future historians will be shocked at the disproportionate response. At least they will chuckle at SAGE, the acronym for the Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies, the expert panel advising the British government, which has presided over the worst performance of any country.
But it wasn’t only the British. Experts in Sweden warned 100,000 would die by June if it didn’t lock down as the rest of Europe had, yet fewer than 5000 were lost. Experts said 420,000 might die in Japan without a hard lockdown. Fewer than 950 did.
Our own experts at the Doherty Institute said 5000 intensive care unit beds would be required, even with strict isolation and social distancing; fewer than 50 were needed. For anyone here who is worried about a second wave of COVID-19, we’re still waiting on the first one.
Climate modelling was struggling even before the pandemic, given the planet has warmed about half as much as forecast by the first Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change report in back 1990.
“Almost the entire alarm about global warming is based on model predictions. If you just look at the last 30 to 40 years of data, nothing spectacular has happened, there’s no sign temperature increase is accelerating,” says Benny Peiser, founder of the Global Warming Policy Foundation in London.
It’s remarkable we put so much faith in expert models, given their history of failure. The Club of Rome in 1972 notoriously forecast that growth would collapse as the world’s resources ran out, ignoring human ingenuity and the shale revolution.
Financial models failed to account for — indeed they probably facilitated — the global financial crisis. And as almost every utterance by a central bank governor since has reminded us, economists struggle to know what happened last month, let alone forecast the impact of a policy change tomorrow.
“In the late 1990s, models suggested the entire Great Barrier Reef would bleach every year by 2020, but in the last 15 years parts of the reef have bleached on only three occasions, with each event affecting only one-third of the reef,” says physicist Peter Ridd, a former professor of James Cook University.
It’s remarkable we put so much faith in climate modelling, given it is a far more complex task. “Climate sensitivity” — the size and speed of the response of global temperatures to a doubling of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere — is harder to predict than a spreading virus. Even if we knew it, drawing implications about future economic growth is even more heroic.
“The big mistake that’s clearly been made is the failure to systematically appraise the models that underpin policy with actual data,” notes Gordon Hughes, a former professor of economics at the University of Edinburgh, speaking on a panel about the pitfalls of mathematical modelling last month.
By April, we knew the coronavirus was not as dangerous as feared yet modellers and governments doubled down on the catastrophe narrative. It’s almost July and people in our capitals are wearing masks in their own cars.
How can we avoid the hysteria next time? It won’t be easy. All the incentives are stacked in favour of dodgy doomsday modelling; apocalyptic scenarios allow politicians to increase their power and appear caring. Public health experts enjoy more prestige. And some of the media naturally prefer models with horrifying forecasts to draw eyeballs. Humans have a natural tendency to focus on extremes — what psychologists call a “negativity bias”. Models are almost cartoons, highly simplified versions of reality. History has proved a better guide to the future. It’s a pity we’re wasting res­ources on a royal commission into the bushfires. How and why authorities have overreacted so much, and how we can avoid doing so again, would be a better line of inquiry.

PASSING THE TEST

Full text: As experts wonder if Australia has pulled off a miracle, there are small steps the nation must take to ease the lockdown, write Deborah Snow and Kate Aubusson.
Three hulking machines, each the size of a commercial pizza oven, dominate the laboratory at the largest COVID-19 test facility in NSW, based at Sydney's Prince of Wales Hospital.
Made of steel, plastic and glass, these machines have been reading the secrets of the deadly new coronavirus for weeks, extracting RNA (viral nucleic acid) from swabs taken at nearby clinics and feeding the figures into the daily national tally of confirmed cases.
Running the operation are two lab teams, one "blue", one "white", with colour-coded smocks and separate ablution facilities. The teams never overlap. That way, if one lab worker gets exposed to the virus, forcing colleagues into quarantine, the other group can step in.
The workload has been intense. This facility alone was running 2500 COVID-19 tests a day when transmission rates were at their peak. Senior medical virologist and director of the lab, Professor Bill Rawlinson, sounds almost affectionate when he talks of the machines and their "workhorse" capacity.
But while the rate of testing hasn't abated - indeed NSW is now ramping up to 8000 tests a day - the number of positive results has fallen dramatically.
Nationally, Australia had only 13 new cases in the 24 hours until early yesterday morning, for a cumulative total of 6675 cases, and 79 deaths. It's a stunning achievement.
Experts are wondering if we've pulled off a miracle. The talk is not just of suppression of the virus, but possible elimination of the scourge of COVID-19 altogether from parts of the country.
Internationally, we have become part of a small and fortunate club - including New Zealand, Germany and Norway - where suppression has worked so well that governments are looking for ways to take their foot off the brake, to ease the burden of lockdowns on their people and their economies.
This week, the national cabinet of federal and state leaders signalled small but sentinel steps towards that goal.
Some categories of elective surgery are to resume at hospitals. Sydney's most famous eastern suburbs beaches were partially reopened for swimming and surfing. Prime Minister Scott Morrison has floated the idea of allowing travel between Australia and New Zealand. In NSW, Premier Gladys Berejiklian wants students gradually returning to their classrooms from May 11, though in Victoria the preference remains for home-schooling.
Federal Health Minister Greg Hunt described the elective surgery decision as a "very important day on the road back", even as he and Morrison warned that remaining strictures would stay in place for at least the next three weeks.
Morrison has laid down several markers for easing social distancing measures. These include keeping the transmission rate for COVID-19 below one for each person infected (which is now the case for all states except Tasmania), broadening testing capacity, building up "industrial scale" contact-tracing, and having swift response plans for outbreaks. Yesterday, the national cabinet unveiled an even more ambitious testing program as part of what Chief Medical Officer Dr Brendan Murphy called a "pandemic intelligence plan", looking to expand tests to include asymptomatic people in a range of front-line occupations. "We want to be testing 40,000, 50,000 Australians a day if necessary," he said.
The lessons of Singapore and Tasmania are stark reminders of how quickly the virus can flare, says Monash University's Professor Allen Cheng, who sits on the peak Australian health protection principal committee that advises the national cabinet.
Singapore was initially held up as a shining example of how to contain the virus, but disease is now running rampant through migrant worker dorms. In Tasmania, despite the island sealing its borders against the mainland, a hospital outbreak linked to a returning Ruby Princess passenger plunged thousands into lockdown in the state's north-west.
Cheng says it's a reminder to keep a lookout for where our exposed "underbelly" might be. "Have we addressed all our vulnerabilities, things like remote Indigenous communities, or asylum-seeker detention facilities," he says. "We need to get [extra measures] in place so that if we relax, and something happens in some of these settings, we know how to respond really quickly to get on top of it ... It only takes one slip-up or chance event, and things can fall apart very quickly." Prisons and aged-care homes are also potential Achilles heels.
Yet like many other public health experts, Cheng is sensitive to the pressure for easing strictures. "We don't want to do more than we need to," he says. "All the public health people understand that having millions of people out of work is not good for [community] health or anything else. Everyone feels that pressure."
Tellingly, one of the nation's top modellers, Professor Jodie McVernon of the Doherty Institute in Melbourne, found herself challenged on ABC TV's Q+A this week about whether early and much more pessimistic modelling of the disease's progression in Australia had been wrong.
No, she shot back. The models had not been wrong. They had helped avert the horrors of makeshift morgues in the back of refrigerated trucks because "our government listened to these predictions at a time when many others didn't, and that is why Australia has not had go to through that".
Berejiklian said yesterday that case numbers would inevitably begin climbing again once people began mixing more freely. So too would hospital admissions for the virus. She has urged everyone in the state with even the mildest of symptoms to present for a test. Victoria is doing the same.
But the national cabinet decision yesterday will mean the net is now cast even wider - in what is called "sentinel testing" - to include categories of people who might be flashing no warning light for infection at all.
Another part of broad surveillance plans will be serological surveys, broad-scale blood testing to determine how far the virus has made its way silently through the community.
The first results from serosurveys in New York this week suggested as many as 2.7 million New Yorkers could have picked up the virus, vastly more than limited case testing has revealed.
Serosurveys detect antibodies, the defences manufactured by our bodies against viral invaders. They are particularly useful for identifying people who may never have fallen ill yet still, at some point in the past, became infected.
The Doherty Institute's Professor Deborah Williamson says serology is still "finding its way" in the battle against COVID-19 but predicts it will be "paramount" in getting a more accurate picture of the extent of infection in the community. That, in turn, will help shape decisions about negotiating the path out of lockdown.
Two leading epidemiologists, Professor John Kaldor of the Kirby Institute in Sydney, and Professor Kristine Macartney, of Westmead's National Centre For Immunisation Research and Surveillance, have now won funding from the National Health and Medical Research Council to start designing Australia's first COVID-19 serosurvey.
"The key issue to be decided is which populations and which tests," Kaldor says. "The most important thing is to set up a mechanism that is repeatable, so it can track changes in the community."
The work will involve looking for relevant antibodies in tens of thousands of Australians over the long term. "We know that a substantial proportion of people, particularly among the young, don't have symptoms and may never know they had the infection."
The survey will explore that story as well as indicate what proportion of the population might have acquired some immunity - though right now no one is sure how much immunity COVID-19 antibodies bestow, or for how long.
Federal Deputy Chief Medical Officer Paul Kelly says serology tests would start "pretty soon but I can't put a date on it". The serosurvey strategy would have to be large and representative of the national population, he says.
Researchers could test blood bank donations, or piggyback routine blood tests. GP clinics or shopping centres were other options, but Kelly says the most obvious sites for serosurveys were the COVID fever clinics already performing PCR [nose and throat] swab tests across the country.
"It's premature to speculate," Kelly says. "We'll have those discussions in coming weeks."
An even greater challenge is settling on which test to use. Many are now flooding onto the market that have a propensity for yielding false positives that can distort the true rate of underlying infection.
"Antibody tests have a false positivity rate in this area, often of 1, 2 or 3 per cent," says Professor Brendan Crabb, director of Melbourne's Burnet Institute. "That doesn't sound very much, but ... if you do a sero-prevalence survey with an error rate of 1 per cent and your [infection] prevalence rate is 0.1 per cent, you may be wrong nine out of 10 times."
One reason for false positives is when tests cross-react to antibodies generated by more common coronaviruses and not just COVID-19. Kelly says two laboratories, one at Westmead in Sydney and another at the Doherty Institute in Melbourne, are now running quality-control experiments for the government.
Crabb says the Burnet Institute is working on its own antibody test but he's confident that "whether it is our [test] or someone else's, in the next few weeks the country will have a really good sense of what we can use for which purpose, and what we can't".
The "when" to ease social controls is not about picking a specific date, he says. It's "when mechanisms are in place to track the virus in the community. Let's hope that is one week away, but it could be much longer than three weeks."
The federal government is urging millions of Australians to download the voluntary app that will warn people when they've been in close proximity to a known COVID-19 case. Other European countries are venturing down this road as well, following in Singapore's footsteps. In Norway they call it "Smittestop" - contagion stop.
Privacy advocates remain worried about the temptation to turn the app to other purposes. Federal Attorney-General Christian Porter has announced he will regulate to ensure law enforcement agencies are not able to access the data it generates.
Cheng sees the app as a necessary trade-off for relaxing some of the lockdown measures. "The thinking behind the app is to build up contact tracing," he says. "We have to do even better at that if we are going to relax something else."
In NSW, the marshalling of data to fight COVID-19 has another enthusiastic proponent in Customer Service Minister Victor Dominello. He recounted this week how he had called together top information officers from all major departments just two days after the State Emergency Operations Centre was stood up, ordering them to pool information to respond to the pandemic.
"All the major [data] dashboards from [departments] have now been drawn into one place," he says. The state Data Analytics Centre, which he set up five years ago, is using aggregated and anonymised data from a wide range of state agencies as well as from banks, telcos, Google and Apple to produce what he calls "mobility tracking".
Credit card information supplied by banks, for instance, can reveal whether people are spending in their neighbourhood, or 20 kilometres from home.
"If there are a lot of people in a given suburb moving around, that speaks to a higher risk of transmission," Dominello says.
"The health data is telling you whether there is a hotspot, but these other systems become relevant for telling you why a hotspot has developed." Or, indeed, where another might spring up.
Dominello has adopted the North American terminology of the "hammer and dance" to describe how the virus might be managed with localised lockdowns, should outbreaks occur once social distancing measures are relaxed. "You dance with the virus while it is in a suppressed state," he says, "but if it pops its head up, you hammer it down ... you have to do it fast, you have to do it hard, and you have to do it local."
Not using data in this way, he insists, is akin to undertaking surgery blindfolded. "We have got to start building this into future planning because to suggest there is not going to be a COVID-22 or a COVID-24, or whatever, is just reckless."
Brendan Crabb is still scratching his head over why Australia, thus far, has enjoyed such relative success. "We acted very early on our borders, that was good," he says. "Then we acted fast enough on our lockdown - two weeks later, and we don't know what would have happened. However, there may also have been something else we don't know about yet, about Australia and New Zealand. Is it because we are islands? Is it because we have fairly sparse populations? We don't know. But I suspect there is a third reason that one day will become a bit clearer as to why in this early stage we have been so successful."
Bill Rawlinson, surveying his domain at the Prince of Wales lab, is phlegmatic. "As a virologist, I know there will be another pandemic," he says.
He starts to quote Tommy Lee Jones' Agent K from the film Men In Black. "'There is always an Arquillian Battle Cruiser, or a Corillian Death Ray, or an intergalactic plague that is about to wipe out all life on this miserable little planet, and the only way ... people can get on with their happy lives is that they do not know about it.'
"Something else will come after this," he adds. It may be an isolated outbreak that affects a handful of people, it might be something worse. "But the point is, these things always come along. We expect it and we will expect others, and we need to be prepared."

He recounted this week how he had called together top information officers from all major departments just two days after the State Emergency Operations Centre was stood up, ordering them to pool information to respond to the pandemic.
"All the major [data] dashboards from [departments] have now been drawn into one place," he says. The state Data Analytics Centre, which he set up five years ago, is using aggregated and anonymised data from a wide range of state agencies as well as from banks, telcos, Google and Apple to produce what he calls "mobility tracking".
Credit card information supplied by banks, for instance, can reveal whether people are spending in their neighbourhood, or 20 kilometres from home.
"If there are a lot of people in a given suburb moving around, that speaks to a higher risk of transmission," Dominello says. "The health data is telling you whether there is a hotspot, but these other systems become relevant for telling you why a hotspot has developed." Or, indeed, where another might spring up.
Dominello has adopted the North American terminology of the "hammer and dance" to describe how the virus might be managed with localised lockdowns, should outbreaks occur once social distancing measures are relaxed. "You dance with the virus while it is in a suppressed state," he says, "but if it pops its head up, you hammer it down ... you have to do it fast, you have to do it hard, and you have to do it local."
Not using data in this way, he insists, is akin to undertaking surgery blindfolded. "We have got to start building this into future planning because to suggest there is not going to be a COVID-22 or a COVID-24, or whatever, is just reckless."
Brendan Crabb is still scratching his head over why Australia, thus far, has enjoyed such relative success. "We acted very early on our borders, that was good," he says. "Then we acted fast enough on our lockdown - two weeks later, and we don't know what would have happened. However there may also have been something else we don't know about yet, about Australia and New Zealand. Is it because we are islands? Is it because we have fairly sparse populations? We don't know. But I suspect there is a third reason that one day will become a bit clearer as to why in this early stage we have been so successful."
Bill Rawlinson, surveying his domain at the Prince of Wales lab, is phlegmatic. "As a virologist, I know there will be another pandemic," he says.
He starts to quote Tommy Lee Jones' Agent K from the film Men In Black: "There is always an Arquillian Battle Cruiser, or a Corillian Death Ray, or an intergalactic plague that is about to wipe out all life on this miserable little planet, and the only way ... people can get on with their happy lives is that they do not know about it.
"Something else will come after this," he adds. It may be an isolated outbreak that affects a handful of people, it might be something worse. "But the point is these things always come along. We expect it and we will expect others, and we need to be prepared."

Full text: Prime Minister Scott Morrison has suggested Australia could start to ease coronavirus restrictions in four weeks, after setting up "industrial capacity" contact tracing and boosting testing.
The current social distancing rules and closures would remain in place for four weeks, when they would be reviewed, Mr Morrison said, paving the way for an earlier-than-expected easing up.
He also foreshadowed the possibility that elective surgery would begin again as early as next week after leaders meet again on Tuesday, and he said parliament would return for a test run of normal business in May.
He was speaking as the government released new modelling showing Australia as a world leader in detecting symptomatic coronavirus cases, with an estimated 93 per cent of people with symptoms being picked up.
But the Doherty Institute, which did the modelling, also pointed out that the number of undetected "asymptomatic" cases, including those with mild symptoms, might be high. Overseas estimates suggest that anywhere between 40 and 80 per cent of all infections remain undetected.
Mr Morrison said authorities would use the next four weeks to establish more extensive testing, not only of people with coronavirus symptoms.
Contact tracing would also be beefed up.
The states and territories had "a team of Sherlock Holmeses out there at the moment". But, "we need to lift that to an industrial capability and do that using technology and we need to do that as soon as we possibly can", he said.
Australia has 6468 cases, with 63 deaths. On Thursday, 42 people were on ventilators.
There were just 21 new cases in the 24 hours to 3pm on Thursday, with authorities urging more people to front up for testing.
Chief medical officer Brendan Murphy said the numbers were encouraging but relaxing distancing measures would mean more outbreaks.
"Unless we are prepared as a nation to detect those outbreaks really early and get on top of them and control them and isolate the cases and quarantine the contacts, we could end up with large community outbreaks that could lead to situations like we've all seen every night on the nightly news in high-income countries with good health systems like the USA and the UK," he said.
"We can't afford to do relaxation until we have a public health system which is so finely tuned that it can detect and respond to any outbreak."
The Doherty Institute has used a new model developed by the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, which suggests Australia is detecting about 93 per cent of cases where people have symptoms.
All of the states are likely to be detecting more than 80 per cent of cases - at the lower end in the ACT and the higher end in NSW, Queensland and South Australia. The rate is well above other countries.

But Professor Murphy said while he could not be sure, the number was probably too high.
"It's pretty clear now there are some asymptomatic cases of COVID-19 that don't present for testing, but we have done some pretty broad scale testing," he said.
"If we had that level of undetected cases we would have found it by now but we're definitely broadening our testing and surveillance."
The Doherty Institute urges caution.
Director of Epidemiology Professor Jodie McVernon said at Australia's current transmission rate, every 10 infected people were passing the virus on to just five others, which was good news.
"It doesn't let us be complacent," she said. "The virus hasn't changed. It still has the same characteristics. And if we were to release those measures now, knowing that one case on average ... produces another two and a half cases, 10 cases today would produce 25 cases over the course of the infection, not five."
Physical distancing and reduced group sizes were set to remain part of the Australian landscape.
"Life as normal is not a real option because the virus will come back from somewhere," she said.
Professor McVernon estimated that anywhere between 40 and 60 or even 80 per cent of people with coronavirus might be undetected - because people have no symptoms, mild symptoms, choose not to present or could not be tested.
Antibody testing is likely to give a clearer picture, but antibody testing was "still a work in progress and not widely available", with the World Health Organisation now looking to evaluate different tests, and provide recommendations to countries on which ones are the best to use in different types of studies of immunity - such as tracking antibody levels in individuals over time, or to providing snapshots of immunity across whole populations.
Professor of Mathematical Biology Professor James McCaw said the potentially high number of undetected cases "definitely makes you very cautious about relaxing measures".
The national cabinet agreed on Thursday that mobile phone apps should be "wholly explored" to track contacts.
Restrictions would not be wound back without an assurance that the system would cope with any surge in cases, including the requirement for hospital beds, ventilators, protective equipment and staff, and until supply lines for equipment were assured.
While New Zealand is bent on an "elimination" strategy, the national cabinet is describing its strategy as "suppression/elimination".
Mr Morrison said that was the best path, given Australia's love of freedoms and the economic trade-off.
"The eradication pathway involves an approach which will see even more economic restrictions than are currently in place and that is not seen to be in our view a wise trade-off in how we are managing the two crises that we are facing, the economic one and of course the health one," he said.
"We are doing well on the health one and I want to do that on the economic one."
The restrictions were "rubbing at the edges a bit in parts of the country and that is understandable", he said.
"We like our freedoms, we like to be able to do what we want to do. We like having a barbecue, we like going out and we really miss it and we miss our kids being able to get together and go to school and be with their friends, we miss all of them. The suppression path is the best Australian path."

He was speaking as the government released new modelling showing Australia as a world leader in detecting symptomatic coronavirus cases, with an estimated 93 per cent of people with symptoms being picked up.
But the Doherty Institute, which did the modelling, also pointed out that the number of undetected "asymptomatic" cases, including those with mild symptoms, might be high. Overseas estimates suggest that anywhere between 40 and 80 per cent of all infections remain undetected.
Mr Morrison said authorities would use the next four weeks to establish more extensive testing, not only of people with coronavirus symptoms.
Contact tracing would also be beefed up.
The states and territories had "a team of Sherlock Holmeses out there at the moment". But, "we need to lift that to an industrial capability and do that using technology and we need to do that as soon as we possibly can", he said.
Australia has 6468 cases, with 63 deaths. On Thursday, 42 people were on ventilators.
There were just 21 new cases in the 24 hours to 3pm on Thursday, with authorities urging more people to front up for testing.
Chief medical officer Brendan Murphy said the numbers were encouraging but relaxing distancing measures would mean more outbreaks.
"Unless we are prepared as a nation to detect those outbreaks really early and get on top of them and control them and isolate the cases and quarantine the contacts, we could end up with large community outbreaks that could lead to situations like we've all seen every night on the nightly news in high-income countries with good health systems like the USA and the UK," he said.
"We can't afford to do relaxation until we have a public health system which is so finely tuned that it can detect and respond to any outbreak."
The Doherty Institute has used a new model developed by the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, which suggests Australia is detecting about 93 per cent of cases where people have symptoms.
All of the states are likely to be detecting more than 80 per cent of cases - at the lower end in the ACT and the higher end in NSW, Queensland and South Australia. The rate is well above other countries.

But Professor Murphy said while he could not be sure, the number was probably too high.
"It's pretty clear now there are some asymptomatic cases of COVID-19 that don't present for testing, but we have done some pretty broad scale testing," he said.
"If we had that level of undetected cases we would have found it by now but we're definitely broadening our testing and surveillance."
The Doherty Institute urges caution.
Director of Epidemiology Professor Jodie McVernon said at Australia's current transmission rate, every 10 infected people were passing the virus on to just five others, which was good news.
"It doesn't let us be complacent," she said. "The virus hasn't changed. It still has the same characteristics. And if we were to release those measures now, knowing that one case on average ... produces another two and a half cases, 10 cases today would produce 25 cases over the course of the infection, not five."
Physical distancing and reduced group sizes were set to remain part of the Australian landscape.
"Life as normal is not a real option because the virus will come back from somewhere," she said.
Professor McVernon estimated that anywhere between 40 and 60 or even 80 per cent of people with coronavirus might be undetected - because people have no symptoms, mild symptoms, choose not to present or could not be tested.
Antibody testing is likely to give a clearer picture, but antibody testing was "still a work in progress and not widely available", with the World Health Organisation now looking to evaluate different tests, and provide recommendations to countries on which ones are the best to use in different types of studies of immunity - such as tracking antibody levels in individuals over time, or to providing snapshots of immunity across whole populations.
Professor of Mathematical Biology Professor James McCaw said the potentially high number of undetected cases "definitely makes you very cautious about relaxing measures".
The national cabinet agreed on Thursday that mobile phone apps should be "wholly explored" to track contacts.
Restrictions would not be wound back without an assurance that the system would cope with any surge in cases, including the requirement for hospital beds, ventilators, protective equipment and staff, and until supply lines for equipment were assured.
While New Zealand is bent on an "elimination" strategy, the national cabinet is describing its strategy as "suppression/elimination".
Mr Morrison said that was the best path, given Australia's love of freedoms and the economic trade-off.
"The eradication pathway involves an approach which will see even more economic restrictions than are currently in place and that is not seen to be in our view a wise trade-off in how we are managing the two crises that we are facing, the economic one and of course the health one," he said.
"We are doing well on the health one and I want to do that on the economic one."
The restrictions were "rubbing at the edges a bit in parts of the country and that is understandable", he said.
"We like our freedoms, we like to be able to do what we want to do. We like having a barbecue, we like going out and we really miss it and we miss our kids being able to get together and go to school and be with their friends, we miss all of them. The suppression path is the best Australian path."

Full text: Experts are weighing up when to loosen restrictions, writes Dana McCauley.
As Australians spend Easter at home, pressure is mounting on authorities to indicate when heavy restrictions on social and economic activity will be eased.
People obeying the rules are skipping trips to the coast and family gatherings to help "flatten the curve" of the coronavirus pandemic - but social distancers want to know when the lockdown will end.
Health Minister Greg Hunt has said state and federal government restrictions - including border closures, large event bans and gatherings limited to no more than two people who don't live together - have been a success.
He says the behaviour of Australians over the Easter break will dictate how soon state governments can ease social-distancing measures.
But many are wondering when beaches, gyms and pools will reopen. And how soon parents can send their kids back to school.
A taskforce comprising more than 80 academics from Australia's Group of Eight universities is preparing advice for the National Cabinet on "the challenge of recovering from the current state of pandemic shutdown".
Experts are divided on what restrictions should remain and for how long, but most agree it would not be possible to stay locked down for 12 to 18 months until a vaccine is found.
University of Melbourne epidemiology professor Tony Blakely says which restrictions could be lifted, how soon and in what order remains uncertain, as no modelling has yet shown the impact of each measure:
"One of our tasks in the next week is to assemble that list, in priority order."
Allowing people to have a small number of visitors in their homes would be a "sensible loosening", he says.
Associate Professor Adam Kamradt-Scott, a health security expert at Sydney University, is advising the government and says public spaces such as beaches and gardens "are not problematic" and could reopen if social distancing rules are observed, while gyms and nightclubs were likely to remain closed.
Professor Jodie McVernon, director of epidemiology at the Doherty Institute - and on the panel of advisers - says people are still trying to unpick the contributions of measures such as school closures on curbing the virus.
"We're now closely observing what's happening in Australia to see what our measures are doing," she says.
Prime Minister Scott Morrison has repeatedly primed Australians for "at least six months" of disruption but recently spoke of easing restrictions in some jurisdictions on a trial basis, warning that the government's capacity to prop up the economy is "finite".
Corporate titan Richard Goyder, the chairman of Qantas, Woodside Petroleum and the AFL Commission, has called for a swifter relaxation, saying that health and economic concerns would be difficult to balance as the virus stretched Australia's budget.
Professor Blakely says the health impacts of relaxing social restrictions must be weighed against "all the costs of lockdown", both social and economic. "There is a real risk the societal cure we choose may do more harm," he says.
Not only do lockdowns damage employment and GDP, but these can feed into health impacts such as increased suicide and heart disease, he says. "We need to quantify that and weigh it up."
Mr Hunt says any strategy "needs to be very, very nuanced and carefully thought out" and "sustainable in the medium term" while research into treatments and a vaccine continue, while deputy chief medical officer Nick Coatsworth says the exit strategy is "weeks or months", not days, away.
NSW Premier Gladys Berejiklian is reviewing state restrictions each month and has said some rules could be loosened in May, while Victorian Premier Daniel Andrews says strict social distancing measures "are with us for the medium term".
Professor Blakely says the timing of any relaxation depends on "what our endgame strategy is". If it's to eliminate the virus - assuming that is possible - they could be lifted in four to eight weeks, he says. If the aim is squashing the curve to keep rates of infection "really low until a vaccine is found", "a very gentle easing" is possible after some weeks of "meticulous planning".
That would mean easing social distancing rules until the reproduction rate of the virus is about 1.0 but no more (meaning each infected person passes it on to one or fewer people), and holding restrictions at that level for 18 months or until a vaccine is available.
Professor Raina MacIntyre, head of the biosecurity research program at UNSW Sydney's Kirby Institute, says a "short, sharp lockdown" of four to six weeks would bring Australia's cases to a "very, very low baseline".
ANU Professor Peter Collignon says the current rules are too harsh and authorities have overstepped the mark by fining people for sitting on park benches as this could drive people to civil disobedience.
Professor Collignon says a ban on visitors at home is "not sustainable", but closing pubs, clubs, bars and restaurants "was a good idea" and they should remain closed "until at least September or October" as winter would be a danger period:
"What we put in place mid to late March - closing our international borders, quarantining high-risk people like returned travellers and close contacts - we're going to have to continue that for at least six months. We're going to have to keep the two-metre rule going for quite a while and limit the number of people you meet."
The NSW education union is pushing for a stated return to schools, saying year 12 and kindy should be first.
The prospect of achieving "herd immunity" by letting the virus circulate has been raised repeatedly, despite scientific uncertainty over whether people who recover are immune.
Professor Blakely says if governments pursue herd immunity, they will ease restrictions with the aim of a rate of spread that generates a "manageable" three-week ICU caseload.
Borders would need to remain closed for six months even under this plan, he says, and at least 18 months for either elimination or suppression.
Grattan Institute health economist Stephen Duckett says while the number of new cases is falling, the decrease has been driven by "regaining control of the borders" and the level of recorded local transmissions remains flat.
Dozens of new cases each day are still "way too many", he says. "You've got to get it really, really right down low before you can risk lifting the restrictions. Singapore were getting it down, then it rebounded. Because this is a highly infectious virus, it is easy to get out of control again."
The strategy of flattening the curve buys time while authorities learn more about how the coronavirus is behaving and build the capacity of the healthcare system, buying new ventilators and masks, training workers and finding more effective treatments.
Which way the nation goes will be scrutinised by a Senate committee, examining the government's response to the pandemic. Liberal senator James Paterson, the committee's deputy chair, says it will "consider the economic cost on the lives of ordinary Australians" and examine the "pathways available"..

Full text: A “RAPID and explosive resurgence” of coronavirus could occur if social distancing measures are relaxed, with specific modelling of the pandemic in Australia to guide the nation’s next steps still weeks away from being useful.
Prime Minister Scott Morrison said previously secret modelling released yesterday showed authorities had bought valuable time in the fight against COVID-19. But he warned that early gains must not lead to complacency.
“We are on the right track,” he said.
The modelling showed that in the “incredibly unlikely scenario” the virus spread without intervention, up to 23 million Australians could have contracted it – with 38 per cent needing medical care and 35,000 people needing an intensive care bed.
Experts from the Peter Doherty Institute, who prepared the modelling, warned relaxing current measures would result in a “rapid and explosive resurgence” of the virus.
University of Melbourne epidemiologist James McCaw said the number of new cases would decline as restrictions were enforced, but that the population was “still largely susceptible” to the virus.
Mr Morrison said the modelling was based on international data and did not predict how many Australians would contract coronavirus but it proved the theory of “flattening the curve”.
But the early “modest” success in Australia, with fewer than 6000 positive cases and low levels of community transmission, had so far provided researchers only limited homegrown data, which authorities need before they can begin considering any roll-back to social distancing rules and border controls.
“This type of work, particularly when we get more of the Australian case data incorporated into this modelling, it will help us plan the way out,” Mr Morrison said.
“For now, and certainly over the weeks ahead, though the lesson is simple and that is that we must continue to do what we are doing. That is how we get through this. But there is still quite a journey ahead. So we need to just continue to adjust and adapt.” The modelling has highlighted why the Government moved so aggressively on implementing the draconian social distancing measures currently in place. Leaders were being presented with dramatic evidence from overseas that the virtually uncontrolled spread of the virus rendered health systems helpless to treat the most critical patients with just 15 per cent of people requiring an intensive care bed able to get one.
Even a policy of quarantining confirmed cases and social isolation would likely overwhelm intensive care units, with just 30 per cent of those needing a bed able to get one.
But models that introduced social distancing vastly improved outcomes for patients and in the most extreme cases, such as measures in place in Australia, showed health systems could accommodate every patient needing intensive care.
A graph from Australia showed the “three-day rolling average” of growth in cases had peaked at about 30 per cent on March 23, meaning the national total of cases was doubling nearly every three days, but had dropped to below 5 per cent.
Chief Medical Officer Brendan Murphy said the graph showed the “impact of the wonderful uptake by the Australian community of social distancing and general hygiene measures”. “Some of those measures, I think will stay with us all forever even when this is over,” he said.
“I think the new approach to hand hygiene, personal hygiene has probably changed the way a lot of us think.” Another graph showed Australia had bent the curve well below global hot spots such as the US, China and Italy and even South Korea, which had been hailed as a model case of handling the virus.
Prof Murphy said it was a “very positive sign” that the curve was flattening. “Complacency is our biggest risk, we cannot be complacent,” he said, adding that crucial “real time” data from Australia, was still weeks away from being meaningful.
“There is no clear path, unlike pandemic influenza, where the strategy was to control and contain until the vaccine came because we knew the vaccine would come,” he said.
“We don’t know if and when a vaccine will come with this virus. If it does, that’s a beautiful way out, so we have to look at a range of different potential scenarios and we will be presenting them to the National Cabinet for the discussion but there is no single right answer.” Mr Morrison said it was crucial to base decisions on good data but the modelling was just “one of many tools that we’re using”.
“We are in uncharted territory and Australia is in a position that many countries would wish to be in,” he said.
“What we’ve got right now is important time. That’s what Australians have given us through their co-operation and the work that they’re doing that is giving our researchers, our scientists our doctors, our healthcare sector, all of us more time to be able to chart and plot the way out of this.”

Easter warning to stay at home

Full text: MODELLING
SOUTH Australians must stay home this Easter, or risk undoing the hard work already done to stop the coronavirus pandemic, Prime Minister Scott Morrison warns.
As the rate of new coronavirus cases falls faster than the Federal Government expected, modelling used to determine national Cabinet’s response to the health crisis was publicly released yesterday.
The Doherty Institute research predicted that without quarantine, isolation and social-distancing measures, an outbreak would have infected almost 23 million Australians.
The modelling, based on international evidence, predicted at its peak 35,000 Australians would have needed an intensive care bed – but hospitals would have only had room for just 15 per cent.
Mr Morrison said Australia had so far avoided the “horror scenarios” seen overseas, where major events and holiday periods had sparked significant outbreaks.
“But we must hold the course,” he said. “We must lock in these gains. We have bought valuable time but we cannot be complacent.
“This Easter weekend will be incredibly important. Stay at home. Failure to do so this weekend would completely undo everything we have achieved so far together, and potentially worse.” Australia is already flattening the curve at 5910 coronavirus cases, nationally. Chief Medical Officer Brendan Murphy reminded Australians the Doherty Institute modelling was theoretical, not based on Australian case data.
“The thing that worries us most of all is the more than 500 people who have acquired this virus from someone in the community that doesn’t know they’ve had it,” Dr Murphy said.
“That means that there are people walking around in our communities who could be transmitting this virus without knowing they’ve had it. That is why we cannot relax.
“If we, in any way, lose that rigour that the Australian community has embraced, particularly over Easter, it could all come undone.” As for when social-distancing measures could be reduced, Mr Morrison said some states would make changes when they were in a position to do so, as the rest of the nation watches on.
Premier Steven Marshall said one of the most important things to come out of yesterday’s national Cabinet meeting was a commitment from all jurisdictions that no restrictions would be lifted over Easter.
He said the state’s current set of restrictions had allowed them to match the demand for high-level critical care with the supply of beds, equipment and personnel.
“We are the envy of much of the world, with regards to the way we have addressed this,” he said.Mr Marshall said he was happy with the slowing of new infections – rising by four yesterday – but the state remained vulnerable.

“What we’ve got right now is important time. That’s what Australians have given us through their co-operation and the work that they’re doing that is giving our researchers, our scientists our doctors, our healthcare sector, all of us more time to be able to chart and plot the way out of this.”

Full text: We've had enough of the government drip-feeding us vital information: give it to us straight, we can take it.
Australia is on a steep slide into a health emergency with almost everyone wearing blindfolds on the descent. Even the experts cannot be sure of the broader strategy to manage the fall and quicken the recovery when the worst of the crisis passes - as it will.
The strategy depends on the cruel numbers of the COVID-19 pandemic: transmissions, infections, deaths. Every government decision today can produce a different number in two weeks, but our political leaders are keeping this to themselves. It is time to loosen the blindfolds.
"In the last week I've been concerned at the lack of information provided by government and the advisers," says Tony Blakely, a professorial fellow in epidemiology at the University of Melbourne.
Blakely can guess why politicians do not release their modelling. While the federal government has a team working on the likely infections and deaths from the virus, the forecasts would be alarming.
Scott Morrison and other leaders might think Australians have enough to worry about with the coronavirus already.
"But that's not what I read at the moment," Blakely says. "I see a population that actually wants to be told it straight, that wants to know what those numbers are, that wants to understand how those decisions are being made."
Other countries are being more open. In the United Kingdom, for instance, the government's approach was guided by an Imperial College study that warned of an "unmitigated epidemic" that would cost 510,000 lives. That conclusion changed policy almost overnight.
Australia has conjecture instead. When the Imperial College work was applied to Australia, it suggested at least 50,000 would die. This was based on the assumption that 20 per cent of our population would be infected and the mortality rate would be 1per cent.
The more debate we have about these projections the better. The crowds on Bondi Beach were not the only sign of complacency in Australia in recent weeks. The debate on shutdowns has become stuck in the weeds. Are gyms shut down or not? What are the rules on barre? The disputes about the details suggest the most important message is not being heard.
That message? Australia will be very lucky to survive this crisis without our families shattered, our economy frozen and our society under immense strain. Blakely has kept his focus on the big picture. Applying the Imperial College work, he warns that Australia could have a shocking death toll of 134,000 if the infection reaches 60 per cent of all age groups.
What is fundamental is the need to shield older and more vulnerable people. The unforgiving data for those aged from 70 to 79 shows why. Among people infected in this age group, 24.3 per cent require hospitalisation. Of those in hospital, 43.2 per cent require critical care. The death rate is 5.1 per cent of those infected.
Those who are infected and are aged from 80 to 89 have a death rate of 9.3 per cent.
If we "wrap protection" around these people, Blakely says, the death rate falls significantly.
It could be 58,000 if we assume more isolation for the elderly and higher infections among the young, who can survive the threat so much better. The fatalities could be lower if we assume better treatment and healthcare.
"There are still going to be more deaths than we'd like," he says. "It's 30,000 under my best-case scenario and it might be a little bit optimistic, but I think we can do that. It's not pretty, but it's OK."
There is one catch. The modelling cannot be precise and the Imperial College study is only one way of looking at a new pandemic that is moving so fast it is hard to pin down. The science is not settled.
The argument over schools has been conducted in this scientific fog. The medical advice so far, relayed by the top commonwealth medical officers, is that it is best to keep children at schools.
Those looking for mistakes can easily find them elsewhere. The government advertising campaign has been too weak. The warnings to older Australians, in particular, should have been running at full volume weeks ago.
Stuart Robert failed Australians as Services Australia Minister. The government chose to use Centrelink to deliver its stimulus cash and then forced people to go to Centrelink by shutting businesses. And it was somehow surprised at the calls for help.
The biggest mistake remains the muddled message when the virus ballooned.
It was only two weeks ago that Morrison said he wanted to go to the football on the weekend - a declaration he reversed on the Friday night. Within days there was a ban on gatherings of more than 500.
One of Morrison's objectives is to apply gradual controls to shield the economy. He has to choose between competing goals: protecting the economy or protecting health. Acting on one front only makes things harder on the other. Blakely remains unclear on the government's end goal. Judging Morrison by his actions, not by his words, he sees a workable approach that could slow the virus and limit the deaths.
While people argue over the messaging or the specific measures, that is what counts.
