Full text: Five million Melburnians will be freed from a months-long lockdown this week after the Victorian government accelerated the easing of restrictions, citing new modelling which has drastically cut projections for hospitalisations.
From Friday, restrictions on leaving home will be lifted, along with a curfew and travel limits within the city. Visitors will be ­allowed into homes, and pubs and restaurants will reopen.
Premier Daniel Andrews and state health officials said a surge in Covid-19 vaccinations had ­allowed the lockdown to end ­earlier than first announced – it had been initially expected to lift in late October.
“It is really extraordinary how we’re shooting up the global rankings in terms of our vaccination coverage,” Victoria’s chief health officer, Brett Sutton, said. “It will make a huge difference to the size and complexity of the outbreak.” The announcement came a day before NSW further eases remaining health restrictions after vaccination coverage hit 80 per cent.
From Monday, the number of vaccinated adult visitors allowed in a home in NSW will double to 20 and customers will no longer need to be seated in pubs. Masks will no longer have to be worn outdoors or in offices, and face-to-face teaching in schools resumes.
“I approach this day, tomorrow, with lots of confidence,” NSW Premier Dominic Perrottet said.
“I know that they will be some nervous parents and some nervous children. But lots of excited kids as well.” The accelerated road map in Melbourne follows new Burnet ­Institute modelling predicting ­almost 2000 fewer hospitalisations when Victoria’s Covid-19 ­infections peak than it forecast less than a month ago. It also forecasts almost 1000 fewer deaths between now and the end of the year.
The institute has pointed to ­increasing vaccination rates to explain the disparity, emphasising that it bases its modelling on actual data, rather than predictions of the impact of vaccination rates.
The new Victorian measures will apply from 11.59pm on Thursday, when the state is set to reach 70 per cent vaccination coverage for those aged 16 and over.
Further easing – involving the full reopening of retail, regional travel and indoor dining for up to 150 patrons indoors and 500 out – is expected approximately 10 days later, with the state currently on a trajectory to reach 80 per cent by October 31. As of Sunday, 88.05 per cent of Victorians had ­received a first dose and 65.02 per cent were fully vaccinated.
For Melbourne toddler Benjamin Sinkovic, born amid Australia’s first wave of Covid-19 in April last year, the reopening represents a rare chance for his extended family to enjoy meals together at each other’s homes. His mother, Kylie Else, said he was especially looking forward to spending time with his Croatian-Australian grandmother, Nella Sinkovic, who is in her 70s and lives nearby.
“He’s constantly talking about his ‘Baka’. They adore each other,” Ms Else said. “For him to see family will just be amazing. It’s been so long. The poor little guy has had very little contact with anyone outside his dad and me.” Announcing the new rules on Sunday, Mr Andrews said that while he could not rule out isolated lockdowns of small and particularly vulnerable communities in future, as per national cabinet’s agreed plan, the days of city or statewide lockdowns were over.
As of Friday, Melburnians will have spent 263 days locked in their homes since March 2020.
“Why did we have lockdowns? Because we didn’t have the vaccine. Why did we have rules and density limits and all manner of quite unimaginable restrictions on people’s lives? Because we didn’t have a vaccine. We now have the vaccine,” Mr Andrews said. “We’re not locking people down any more across the board. We are instead locking people out who have not got vaccinated.” From Friday, stay-at-home ­orders, and the 9pm-to-5am curfew and 15km travel limit, will be abolished for Melburnians, but a ban on travel between Melbourne and regional Victoria will remain. The government is also changing quarantine requirements for fully vaccinated, non-household primary close contacts of Covid-19 cases, who will need to isolate for seven days rather than 14.
Health Minister Martin Foley said those in a household with an infected person would still need to isolate for the full fortnight, given that on average 45 per cent of vaccinated household contacts are still contracting the virus.
Up to 10 people including dependants will be permitted to visit private homes, and public gatherings will increase from five people from no more than two households, to 15 people with no household limit in Melbourne, and 20 people in regional Victoria.
While hospitality was always expected to reopen to 50 fully vaccinated patrons outdoors, (100 in regional Victoria), an ­additional 20 will now be permitted indoors. Retail trade will only be permitted outdoors or via click and collect, and gyms will remain closed until the 80 per cent vaccination threshold is reached. Masks will also continue to be compulsory outdoors.
On September 18, the Burnet Institute predicted Victoria’s seven-day average number of Covid-19 cases would peak at a median of 4543 on about December 15. The updated modelling, dated October 15, has that number revised down to 3850 – a 15 per cent reduction – peaking just a day later on December 16, and compares with the current seven-day average of 1851 cases, and Sunday’s 1837 cases.
Hospitalisations were previously projected to peak at a ­median of 3150, but that figure has been revised down to 1166 – a 63 per cent reduction. As of Sunday, there are 777 people in Victorian hospitals with Covid-19. Of those hospitalised at the projected peak, 706 were expected to be in ICU, with that figure now ­revised down 55 per cent to 317.
The institute has revised the number of Covid-19 deaths it expects by the end of the year in Victoria down by almost 1000, or 45 per cent, from 2202 to 1212. So far 145 people have died as a result of the current outbreak.
The latest modelling predicts Victoria’s current wave of cases will peak between October 15 and 27, with a second peak in December resulting from reopening, which the Burnet Institute forecasts will see hospital and ICU ­admissions remain relatively flat rather than declining.
However, the modellers offer the caveat that “due to uncertainty about whether the epidemic growth rate will be sustained, seasonal impacts and vaccine efficacy parameters against the delta strain, updated projections are required as more data becomes available.” Opposition Leader Matthew Guy welcomed the easing of some restrictions, but added: “It doesn’t seem consistent to me that you can have 10 people at your house but you can’t have 10 people in a shop.”

Full text: Melburnians are days away from ending their sixth citywide lockdown when restrictions ease on Friday under greater freedoms than had been previously flagged.
Ten people will be allowed in homes and up to 20 patrons permitted to dine indoors, the travel limit will be scrapped within metropolitan Melbourne, including the Mornington Peninsula, and the controversial curfew will end from 11.59pm on Thursday.
The Victorian government will also today announce changes to the way health authorities manage close contacts of confirmed coronavirus cases as it begins to reopen the economy and manage the disease in a highly vaccinated population.
From Friday, non-household primary close contacts who are fully vaccinated will be required to isolate for only seven days if they return negative results on days one and six of quarantine.
Household contacts and unvaccinated Victorians will still need to complete 14 days in isolation.
New Burnet Institute modelling, underpinning the Andrews government's updated road map, revealed the state's fast-climbing vaccination rate almost halved the projected number of people expected to die from COVID-19 before the end of the year.
Epidemiologist Tony Blakely welcomed the changes but has warned the easing of restrictions will come at a price: more deaths, morbidity, long-COVID and increased pressure on the healthcare system. "I want everyone to understand doing what we're doing will probably be OK, but there's a moderate risk - not a small risk - we may have to put the brakes on the freedoms if cases continue climbing and the hospital service is under pressure," he said.
But Premier Daniel Andrews said this was intended as the last blanket lockdown.
"Today we're moving beyond [statewide lockdowns] - we're not locking people down any more across the board. Instead we're locking people out who have not got vaccinated," he said.
When the state hits its 70 per cent double-dose vaccination milestone, the staggered return of school students in metropolitan Melbourne will also be brought forward to Friday, enabling children in years 5, 6, 7, 10 and 11 to resume on-site learning a week earlier than first flagged. All year levels in regional Victoria will be allowed back.
The easing of restrictions on Friday is predominantly centred around social freedoms. Businesses have been asked to wait a further 10 days - until the 80 per cent double-vaccination rate is hit - for any meaningful changes, including indoor shopping.
Tim Piper, the Victorian head of employer association Ai Group, urged the Andrews government to consider bringing forward that date by about four days to give businesses an opportunity to kick-start their trade for the Melbourne Cup long weekend.
"We have to consider this as both a health and an economic crisis and maybe the date of important events in the calendar should be taken into account," Mr Piper said. "If we reach 78 per cent, for example, prior to the Cup carnival, maybe that will be enough to have crowds for Derby Day, or for Melburnians to head to regional Victoria for the weekend."
Chief Health Officer Brett Sutton said while Victoria's hospital system will face significant challenges in coming weeks and months, with the "very high vaccination coverage" it would cope.
But with high vaccination coverage and two years of lockdown fatigue, which Professor Sutton yesterday acknowledged had contributed to lower levels of compliance in recent weeks, Victoria's strategy of locking down the entire state or city to save lives and protect the healthcare system will be a feature of the past.
Under the national cabinet plan, there is scope for lockdowns, though they will be more targeted and measured. "If you have a particularly vulnerable community where vaccination rates were very low, then there is, in the national cabinet plan, there is the prospect that is something that's quite focused and it's quite targeted," Mr Andrews said.
The curfew will end, and the 15-kilometre travel bubble, which was initially planned to increase to 25 kilometres once the state reached the 70 per cent double-dose vaccination milestone, has been scrapped. Rules surrounding travel between the regions and Melbourne will remain in place, but Victorians will be allowed to travel interstate. Hospitality venues will be open for indoor food and drink service for up to 20 fully vaccinated patrons, in addition to the outdoor cap of 50.
Chef and restaurateur Scott Pickett was jubilant about the news he can reopen his restaurants from Friday. "I'm pretty f---ing relieved that it's come," said Mr Pickett, the owner of restaurants including Matilda in South Yarra and The Estelle in Northcote.
Mr Pickett's venues had been war-gaming different scenarios based on when the state might reach its 70 per cent double-dose vaccination target. "We thought that might be brought forward from the Monday or Tuesday to the Friday, so now we are just ready to pull the trigger. We will prep Wednesday, Thursday and do our mise en place and stuff, and then Friday, open the doors."
Mr Pickett was expecting to be able to reopen to up to 50 fully vaccinated people seated outside. However, being able to have up to 20 fully vaccinated people indoors came as a welcome surprise.
"While it's not the end game, it makes a massive difference."
The Burnet Institute modelling, briefed to media before yesterday's announcement, predicts a much lower hospitalisation rate than once expected due to high vaccination coverage.
Under the revised reopening plan, announced yesterday after the state recorded 1838 new local coronavirus cases and seven deaths, people will be allowed to have 10 visitors, including dependants, at their home each day. Mr Andrews said authorities were "highly recommending" people be fully vaccinated.
Families and friends across Melbourne began making plans at the news. Northcote woman Dianne Bruzzaniti said the impact of lockdowns had been hard on her family, but restrictions would ease just in time to celebrate the 18th birthday of her son Joseph.
"I'm so excited to be able to entertain and to go out, and see people not just by passing them in the street," Ms Bruzzaniti said.
The opposition called for outdoor mask rules to be scrapped, indoor retail with density limits to be permitted, and strict work-from-home orders to end on Friday. With Jewel Topsfield

COVID peak \weeks off' amid border rule disarray

Full text: Interstate travellers will be able to visit Victoria without quarantining before Melburnians can go to Ballarat under what the Health Minister has dubbed a transitional anomaly brought on by the latest COVID-19 travel restrictions.
It comes as an influential scientific modeller believes Victoria's COVID-19 case numbers will continue rising for weeks instead of peaking ahead of the state's anticipated easing of restrictions next week.
Following another high tally of 2179 new locally acquired COVID-19 cases yesterday, the state government announced changes to the NSW border from Tuesday, which will allow fully vaccinated NSW residents into Victoria without quarantining while Melburnians are still prohibited from travelling more than 15 kilometres from home.
In addition, NSW Premier Dominic Perrottet announced that from November 1, quarantine will not apply to flights into Sydney by fully vaccinated international travellers, who will then be able to move on to destinations such as Melbourne.
If Victoria reaches its 80 per cent double dose target later than the forecast date of November 1, international visitors could visit regional Victoria before Melburnians.
A number of epidemiologists have been predicting that Victoria has been close to reaching the top of the third wave of infections, but Dr Jason Thompson, a modeller with the University of Melbourne, said Victoria could now miss the window of opportunity for case numbers to flatten or drop. When the state reaches the 70 per cent fully vaccinated target next week, it will trigger the outdoor reopening of retail and hospitality venues in Melbourne, bringing more opportunities for the virus to spread.
Dr Thompson, who was part of the research team that provided the government modelling to inform the exit from Victoria's second wave last year, said data showed Melburnians were moving around 20 per cent more compared to the height of COVID-19 cases in 2020 - an increase from 5 to 10 per cent since a month ago when there were stricter restrictions.
Travel into Victoria from "red" zones such as Sydney will be allowed from Wednesday for visitors who are fully vaccinated and receive negative tests within 72 hours of leaving home and arriving in Victoria. No requirements will apply to fully vaccinated travellers from "orange" zones such as most of regional NSW.
Yet travel rules within Victoria have not shifted and the state's reopening road map prohibits free travel within the state until the 80 per cent double dose milestone is met, expected by November 1 at the latest. Some forecasts now suggest it could be attained by October 31.
Health Minister Martin Foley yesterday defended the apparent inconsistencies as "transitional anomalies" that would resolve as Victoria opened up.
"These things will work themselves out as the transition from our current situation through the road map," he said.
Further pressed on the contradictions, Mr Foley said Victoria was still working through the details of NSW's international borders announcement, which was made 15 minutes before he gave the daily COVID briefing.
"I think everyone just needs to take a chill pill," he said.
Mobility data shows movement has surged in the outer southeast areas of Melbourne, which have emerged as a new COVID-19 hot spot.
Yesterday, for the first time in the outbreak, there were more new cases in the southeast (616) than reported in the north (585), the initial centre of the third wave.
The highest increases in movement have been observed along the Mornington Peninsula, with the assumption this is due to people illegally visiting their holiday homes at the weekends.
The modelling group at the University of Melbourne's transport, health and urban design research lab is now expecting cases to increase through October and into November.
"We're not at a stage in Victoria where we're about to reduce interaction between people, we're actually going to increase it. That's fine, but it would be difficult to imagine a situation, I think, where doing that would lead to reduced numbers of cases," Dr Thompson said.
"Vaccinations will help us stop being sick. They may not dampen transmission as much as we hoped."
The prediction raises more concerns about the impact on the hospital system, which is already under severe strain due to fast-growing numbers of COVID-19 patients, now at 677.
One promising sign though is the rate of hospitalisation, which is significantly lower than it was last year due to the higher proportion of younger people getting infected. Around 3.5 per cent of active cases are hospitalised today, compared to around 7.5 per cent at the peak of the second wave.
Southern Tasmania became the latest area ensnared by an outbreak yesterday, sent into a three-day lockdown after a traveller from Sydney escaped hotel quarantine and spent 18 hours in the community, before testing positive.
Mildura's lockdown was also extended into a second week after recording another 34 cases.
Qantas fast-tracked the restart of international flights by two weeks to November 1 in response to NSW's quarantine announcement, which Prime Minister Scott Morrison also welcomed, albeit with a caveat.
"We are not opening up to everyone coming back to Australia at the moment. I want to be clear about that," Mr Morrison said.
"In the first instance, it will be for Australian residents and their families. We will see how that goes and then we will be to other priorities set out as being skilled migration as well as students to Australia and then we will move on to the challenge of dealing with international visitors to Australia."
The Victorian government has not confirmed when international flights will resume into Melbourne, although the Prime Minister has stated his intention to reopen borders into states once they hit 80 per cent double dose coverage.
Victorian Chamber of Commerce and Industry chief executive Paul Guerra said he expected demand to be high for businesses to ramp up travel between Melbourne and Sydney, despite the existing regulations around testing.
"[Intrastate] business travel will take time to get to pre-pandemic levels but there is certainly an appetite from the business community to get going," he said.
Senior Liberal MP David Davis said Victoria's eased border with NSW was welcomed in principle but was "slightly unusual and slightly bizarre" while Melbourne remained under restrictions.
"I think of people coming from overseas, being able to come to Victoria and see people all over the state and yet I can't see my father on the Peninsula," he said. "I think that is a very strange piece of policy decision-making by this government."
The eased border provides good news for separated friends, family members and partners, such as long-distance couple Bree Stewart and Louise Mole, who haven't been able to see each other for three months. Ms Stewart, a mental health clinician, moved from Sydney to Melbourne ahead of Ms Mole, when Victoria was thrown into lockdown.
"I've been managing trying to get our lives in order ever since. We were both really rapt about the announcement," the 33-year-old said.
She said she missed the couple's dog Nash and Ms Mole, 33, who will move to Melbourne in the coming weeks.
"If I'm honest, I think she misses the dog more than me," Ms Mole joked.

Full text: Health Minister Martin Foley has hit out at journalists after it was announced fully vaccinated people from New South Wales would be able to travel to Victoria without quarantining for 14 days.
When questioned at Friday’s press conference about a perceived divide between NSW and Victoria, Mr Foley snapped: “I think everyone needs to take a chill pill.”
“We are not aware of the full details of a media release hot off the printer from the NSW government.”
On Friday it was announced fully vaccinated people from NSW would be able to travel to Victoria without quarantining for 14 days if they arrive after October 20.
Despite the border change, regional Victoria will still remain off limits to Melburnians as metro residents will be subject to the 15km travel limit.
But anyone travelling from New South Wales — including Sydney — will just need a negative test result within 72 hours of landing in Victoria.
The change effectively means Victorian families separated by the regional-metro divide will remain apart even after Sydney tourists are welcome in Melbourne.
After entering from NSW, visitors will only need to isolate until they get another negative test result which must be undertaken within 72 hours.
Unvaccinated or partially vaccinated people will still need to isolate for 14 days and present a negative Covid test result on arrival in Victoria.
The changes come into effect from October 20 and travel permits must be obtained through Service Victoria.
It comes as the state recorded 2179 local Covid infections in the past 24 hours, taking the total number of active cases across the state to 21,324.
Six more people died from the virus, bringing the total number of deaths this year to 131.
A woman in her 50s was among six people who died with Covid on Thursday, Mr Foley announced.
Of the six Covid-related deaths recorded, three were men aged in their 80s, who came from Brimbank, Darebin and Boroondara respectively.
Vic Locally-acquired Covid-19
Two women who died were in their 80s from Hume and Moreland.
The third woman was in her 50s and from Moonee Valley.
“We take this opportunity to pass on our deepest condolences and best wishes to families, friends and community members of those who are grieving for those that they have lost,” Mr Foley said.
Friday is the second consecutive day case numbers have crashed through the 2000 mark following an Australian record 2297 cases and 11 deaths on Thursday.
Eighty-eight per cent of Victorians aged 16 and over have received one dose of the Covid vaccine and 63 per cent have received two doses
On Thursday, 73,942 Victorians turned out to get tested. Almost 39,000 vaccine doses were administered in state-run centres.

BUS ROUTES CUT AFTER COVID CASES Several Melbourne bus routes will be scrapped on Saturday after seven Transdev employees tested positive for coronavirus.
In a statement, The Department of Transport said a “number of Transdev drivers are required to isolate to help contain the spread of coronavirus.”
There will be morning cancellations on the 270, 905, 906, 907, and 908 bus routes.
The 903 route will also experience “a significant number of cancellations” in the afternoon peak periods.
Other services – including routes from Sunshine Station to City, Somerville Rd to Highpoint Shopping Centre, and the Sunshine South Loop will also run on reduced timetables.
Anyone catching public transport this weekend has been urged to check the PTV website to see if their service has been affected.

FRESH BLOW FOR RESIDENTS OF MILDURA Covid restrictions in Mildura will be extended for another seven days - until October 22 - after another 34 cases were announced on Friday.
Health Minister Martin Foley said it was a “complex” situation.
Mr Weinmar said the majority of cases were located around Swan Hill.
“We are keen to make sure that those cases are well supported and we uncover any final remaining cases still to be found with a high number coming in yesterday impacting our view on that outbreak,” he said.

MOST NEW HOSPITAL CASES UNVAXXED Victoria’s Covid Commander Jereon Weimar said unvaccinated Victorians were 10 times more likely to catch coronavirus than those who had received the jab.
He said 67 per cent of the 2179 cases recorded yesterday involved unvaccinated people.
Of about 700 people in Victorian hospitals, 75 per cent had not been vaccinated.
Of those in intensive care, 87 per cent had not been vaccinated.
“This is why vaccination is our way out of this and this is why it is critically important that we protect ourselves to get fully vaccinated as swiftly and safely as possible,” Mr Weimar said.

WHAT NEW BORDER RULES MEAN FOR YOU Border rules are changing and it will have a big impact on travelling between Victoria and NSW, but also internationally.
This handy explainer details everything you need to know.

JABS SAVE VIC FROM 2020 DEATH TOLL While the state has recorded ­almost double the number of Covid cases this year compared to 2020 there were 85 per cent fewer deaths – proving the power of vaccines.
More than 39,200 Victorians have been infected with the virus in 2021, well above the 20,311 to October 14, 2020.
But this year’s death toll – 125 – is significantly lower than last year’s 816.
Health experts have credited the effectiveness of lifesaving vaccines for keeping both death rates and hospitalisations relatively low.
With 706 people in hospital as of Thursday, Victoria’s hospitalisation rate is less than 5 per cent.
Despite record case numbers, Daniel Andrews confirmed it would not delay the end of Melbourne’s lockdown once the 70 per cent vaccination ­target was hit.
“We will deliver the roadmap,” the Premier said.
“We have a really important agreement with the Victorian community. You get vaccinated and we open up.”
As of Thursday, 87.6 per cent of the state’s eligible population had received one dose, while 62.6 per cent were fully vaccinated.
It is likely Victoria will hit the 70 per cent milestone late next week, well ahead of October 26 as first forecast.
The Australian's Victorian political reporter Rachel Baxendale says it has been 'really interesting' to see there hasn't been a high number of hospitalisations in Victoria despite the record level of COVID-19 cases. 'Even though we are seeing quite scary case numbers, that's not converting necessarily to the numbers that were predicted in the Burnet modelling in terms of hospitalisations and deaths," she told Sky News host Chris Kenny.
Mr Andrews said it was possible that restrictions could be eased further than planned given about 90 per cent of Victorians aged 16 and over would have received one dose, about the same time as 70 per cent were fully vaccinated.
But he refused to detail what the extra freedoms could be.
“That work is still ongoing. It’s going to be a busy few days,” he said.
At the 70 per cent threshold, Melbourne’s lockdown and 9pm curfew will lift, travel limits expand to 25km and hospitality venues open to 50 patrons outdoors.
Master Builders Victoria confirmed in an email on Thursday night indoor renovations would also be given the green light to restart.
Chief health officer Professor Brett Sutton this week revealed he was “open to” the prospect of an earlier return of home visits, currently banned until 80 per cent of people are fully vaccinated.
“If we think the epidemiology looks okay, we’re absolutely open to that,” he said.
Infectious diseases physician Peter Collignon said ­allowing controlled numbers to visit one another was no longer a high-risk activity, given the added protection of vaccinations.
“You’re not going to get a superspreading event because there’s not enough people there,” Prof Collignon said.
“This is a matter of putting risks in perspective for the benefit of social and mental wellbeing too. If you overdo strict rules, you have the perverseness of larger gatherings hiding indoors.
“This virus is going to be an issue that we face for another year or so, I think we need to be practical. Nothing is absolutely safe but we have to be relative.”
VICTORIA'S Covid STATS
Of Thursday’s record case numbers, 693 were detected in Melbourne’s north, 650 in the southeast, 633 in the west, 144 in the east and 170 in regional Victoria.
More than 37,600 vaccine doses were administered through the state’s mass hubs on Wednesday.
It comes as a new survey ­revealed that Australia could ­eventually boast a vaccination rate of 90 per cent.
The Melbourne Institute Survey found Victoria had the lowest vaccine hesitancy rate nationwide, just 10.1 per cent. Hesitancy in South Australia soared over the past fortnight to 19.2 per cent.
“The largest drop in hesitancy comes from those unwilling to be vaccinated,” the research stated.
Hesitancy among people aged 45-64 has fallen 4 per cent from August, when it was 12 per cent.

POSITIVE CASE AT MARCELLIN COLLEGE A student at Marcellin College in Bulleen has tested positive for Covid, parents were advised on Thursday.
The student was last on-site on October 7 and tested positive on Monday, October 11.
Although the student was not infectious while onsite, the school has made the decision to close the college to ensure VCE exams can proceed from October 27.
The school is expected to reopen on Monday, October 18.
Staff and students in the meantime are anxiously awaiting Covid test results.
New Education Department guidelines mean VCE students who are close contacts can still sit exams but positive cases will have to get a derived score.
The school is among more than 50 to have on-site exposure, although most are expected to reopen within 24 hours.

RETAIL CHAINS DISMISS OUTDOOR TRADING Westfield, JB Hi-Fi and Kathmandu are the latest major retailers to wave the white flag to Victoria’s “comical” outdoor trading rules.
The Herald Sun revealed on Thursday that many Melbourne retailers would not reopen when lockdown ends because stores are only permitted to operate outdoors.
Scentre Group, which owns Westfield malls in Australia, has joined rival Vicinity Centres and key retail chains JB Hi-Fi, Kathmandu and Myer in saying outdoor trading was not possible.
Harvey Norman boss Gerry Harvey said he did not see how outdoor trading could be implemented at the electronics, whitegoods and furniture chain.
“I don’t understand how it would work,” the retail veteran said.
“Everything is very complicated at the moment.”
While Melbourne will win back some freedoms when the state hits 70 per cent double vaccination – restaurants and cafes can offer outdoor dining and hairdressers can open – many fashion and non-essential retailers will remain closed.
They can only open indoors when the state hits 80 per cent double vaccination, in a move the Australian Retailers Association branded “deeply disappointing”.
Small Business Australia chief Bill Lang said: “What we have here with the ‘outdoor retail’ debacle is what occurs when bureaucrats who have never worked in business present ideas to politicians who have never worked or run a business either.”
NED-3869-Covid-19-Exposure-Sites-Victoria
Questioned about the slow retail reopening, the Premier said the 80 per cent target could be hit 10 days after lockdown ends.
“The key point here is that we’ve had gateways at 70 per cent and 80 per cent,” Mr Andrews said.
IN-HOME RENOVATIONS RESUME EARLY In-home renovations will be allowed to resume ahead of schedule – once 70 per cent of Victorians are fully vaccinated.
Currently under the Victorian government’s roadmap, the renovation sector was not permitted to work until November 5, when the state was forecasted to hit a vaccination rate of 80 per cent.
For many weeks, the sector has not been permitted to work inside occupied premises and have been severely limited to only one person working outside.
“The reopening of renovations in occupied homes ahead of schedule will provide a much-needed boost to the residential building industry and help many families who have been waiting for their home renovations projects to either commence or resume,” Housing Industry Association Victorian Executive Director Fiona Nield said.
“There are thousands of small building businesses that have been unable to work during the lockdowns, both this year and last year, and this has caused great financial hardship.
“There have also been many families who have been living with partially completed building work in their homes.
“This news will provide welcome relief for all – builders, trades and homeowners.”
Master Builders Victoria CEO Rebecca Casson said she hoped that this advance notice of the reopening of renovations would allow people the time to plan, gear up, and line up trades or redeploy staff.
“We also hope that this means many Victorians will have kitchens and bathrooms finished by Christmas and will be able to celebrate the New Year in comfort,” she said.
Both the bodies have continued to lobby over the weeks and months for the safe return to renovations in occupied homes.
“We have clearly demonstrated that steps can be taken by our members to operate safely to protect both owners and workers,” Ms Nield said.
A maximum of five workers plus a supervisor will be permitted unless additional workers are required for safety reasons.
Returning workers must have received their first dose of a Covid-19 vaccine and have their second jab before November 15.
TRAINEES PLATE UP FOR CHANCE OF JOB The hospitality industry says a shortage of workers threatens the sector’s post-lockdown recovery as the state’s biggest players roll out a new training blitz.
Crown Resorts is offering to pay 1000 budding hospitality workers to undertake a specially designed training course.
It comes as new unemployment figures reveal nine out of 10 jobs lost across the nation during September were in Victoria.
Prompted by the state’s sixth lockdown, the jobless rate soared 0.7 points to 4.8 per cent. The national figure rose 0.1 points to 4.6 per cent, an increase of 138,000.
But federal Treasurer Josh Frydenberg – who has called for Victoria to ease restrictions in line with NSW – warns that lockdowns have had an even greater impact on the labour market than the headline figures show.
“Hours worked fell and there are now 173,000 people in Victoria who have been stood down on zero hours,” he said.
Casino and tourism giant Crown will work with the Australian Hotels Association and Victorian Chamber of Commerce and Industry to place graduates in jobs across the industry.
Crown food and beverage general manager Enda Cunningham said Covid lockdowns had forced workers to leave the industry and dried up the pool of international students who often filled roles.
“The skills shortage is arguably the biggest concern across the industry at the moment,” he said.
Participants will receive an entry-level wage during the week-long intensive-training course.

Full text: Health Minister Martin Foley has hit out at journalists after it was announced fully vaccinated people from New South Wales would be able to travel to Victoria without quarantining for 14 days.
When questioned at Friday’s press conference about a perceived divide between New South Wales and Victoria, Mr Foley snapped: “I think everyone needs to take a chill pill.”
“We are not aware of the full details of a media release hot off the printer from the NSW government.”
On Friday it was announced that fully vaccinated people from New South Wales would be able to travel to Victoria without quarantining for 14 days if they arrive after October 20.
Despite the border change, regional Victoria will still remain off limits to Melburnians as metro residents will be subject to the 15km travel limit.
However, anyone travelling from New South Wales — including Sydney — will need a negative test result taken less than 72 hours before arriving in Victoria.
The change will effectively mean Victorian families separated by the regional-metro divide will remain apart even after Sydney tourists are welcome in Melbourne.
After entering from New South Wales, arrivals must isolate, get tested again within 72 hours, and stay isolated until they get another negative result.
Unvaccinated or partially vaccinated people will still need to isolate for 14 days and present a negative Covid test result on arrival in Victoria.
The changes come into effect from October 20 and travel permits must be obtained through Service Victoria.
It comes as the state recorded 2179 local Covid infections in the past 24 hours, taking the total number of active cases across the state to 21,324.
Six more people died from the virus, bringing the total number of deaths this year to 131.
A woman in her 50s was among six people who died with Covid on Thursday, Mr Foley announced.
Of the six Covid-related deaths recorded, three were men aged in their 80s, who came from Brimbank, Darebin and Boorandara respectively.
Vic Locally-acquired Covid-19
Two women who died were in their 80s from Hume and Moreland.
The third woman was in her 50s and from Moonee Valley.
“We take this opportunity to pass on our deepest condolences and best wishes to families, friends and community members of those who are grieving for those that they have lost,” Mr Foley said.
Friday is the second consecutive day case numbers have crashed through the 2000 mark following an Australian record 2297 cases and 11 deaths on Thursday.
It comes as 88 per cent of Victorians aged 16 and over have received one dose of the Covid vaccine and 63 per cent have received two doses
On Thursday, 73,942 Victorians turned out to get tested. Almost 39,000 vaccine doses were administered in state-run centres.

MILDURA RESTRICTIONS EXTENDED Mildura restrictions will be extended for another seven days until October 22 due to a high case load.
Another 34 cases were announced in Mildura on Friday – higher than in any other regional area.
Health Minister Martin Foley said it was a “complex” situation.
Covid Commander Jeroen Weinmar said the vast majority of cases in the region were located around Swan Hill.
“We are keen to make sure that those cases are well supported and we uncover any final remaining cases still to be found with a high number coming in yesterday impacting our view on that outbreak,” he said.

MOST OF NEW HOSPITAL CASES UNVAXXED Covid Commander Jereon Weimar said data had shown unvaccinated Victorians were 10 times more likely to catch coronavirus than those who have received the jab.
He said 67 per cent of the 2179 cases recorded yesterday were diagnoses in unvaccinated people.
Of the approximately 700 people in Victorian hospitals, about three-quarters had not been vaccinated as were 87 per cent of those in intensive care.
“This is why vaccination is our way out of this and this is why it is critically important that we protect ourselves to get fully vaccinated as swiftly and safely as possible,” Mr Weimar said.

JABS SAVE VIC FROM 2020 DEATH TOLL While the state has recorded ­almost double the number of Covid cases this year compared to 2020 there were 85 per cent fewer deaths – proving the power of vaccines.
More than 39,200 Victorians have been infected with the virus in 2021, well above the 20,311 to October 14, 2020.
But this year’s death toll – 125 – is significantly lower than last year’s 816.
Health experts have credited the effectiveness of lifesaving vaccines for keeping both death rates and hospitalisations relatively low.
With 706 people in hospital as of Thursday, Victoria’s hospitalisation rate is less than 5 per cent.
Despite record case numbers, Daniel Andrews confirmed it would not delay the end of Melbourne’s lockdown once the 70 per cent vaccination ­target was hit.
“We will deliver the roadmap,” the Premier said.
“We have a really important agreement with the Victorian community. You get vaccinated and we open up.”
As of Thursday, 87.6 per cent of the state’s eligible population had received one dose, while 62.6 per cent were fully vaccinated.
It is likely Victoria will hit the 70 per cent milestone late next week, well ahead of October 26 as first forecast.

Victorian reopening plan on track despite surge in new Covid-19 cases

Full text: While a record 2297 cases were reported on Thursday – higher than the forecast by the Burnet Institute modelling that the road map was based on – hospitalisations are lower than expected.
New daily cases in Victoria, from July 10, 2021
An analysis by The Australian comparing the NSW and Victorian Delta outbreaks also shows the latter state with a lower proportion of hospitalisations despite higher case numbers, at a point where a higher percentage of the population is vaccinated.
The Burnet Institute, which is due to update its modelling this week, predicted a seven-day ave­rage of 1960 cases by October 25, with 1666 people in hospital and 360 in ICU. As of Thursday, the seven-day average had reached 1806, but there were only 706 hospitalisations and 147 in ICU.
Eleven deaths reported on Thursday brought the state’s toll for the current outbreak to 125.
Thursday marked the 66th day of Victoria’s outbreak, which began amid short-lived celebrations of zero cases being reported on August 4. On the 66th day of the NSW outbreak – August 30 – that state had a seven-day average of 1018 cases, with 840 people in hospital, of whom 137 were in ICU. There had been 93 deaths.
NSW and Vic: Delta outbreaks compared
While comparisons between the two states are imperfect, and there is generally a lag between people testing positive and being hospitalised or dying, the statistics point to those infected in the NSW outbreak in late August being more than twice as likely to require hospital treatment as their Victorian counterparts. As of Wednesday, 87.15 per cent of Victorians aged 16 and over had received one dose of Covid vaccine, and 62.65 per cent were fully vaccinated.
On August 30, 68.16 per cent of people in NSW aged 16 and over had received one dose, and just 37.07 per cent of the state’s population were fully vaccinated.
Sky News host Peta Credlin says the promise on ICU beds is going to “haunt” Victorian Premier Daniel Andrews until the “day he leaves office”. In statistics released by the Australian and New Zealand Intensive Care Society, as of September 9 this year, there are only 476 staffed and available intensive care beds in Victoria. Ms Credlin says this proves “despite the governments spin and obfuscation”, 4000 new ICU beds as promised by Mr Andrews and his then health minister Jenny Mikakos in April 2020 “never materialised” “Now neither Daniel Andrews, his former health minister, his current health ministers nor the chorus of officials fronting these daily press conferences, have ever given the public a proper explanation as to what happened to the money, the $1.3 billion promised, or the 4000 beds. “For months and months, the Premier, in the parliament, has brushed off the Opposition's questions about ICU bed capacity. “This broken promise hasn't gone away, and it isn't going to go away, and if the COVID cases continue to rise, so too the anger from Victorians, put at risk, and let down, by the bloke that's been in charge of the state's health system for the last 11 of 15 years.”
The Premier said case numbers were becoming less relevant as Victoria approached the 70 per cent full vaccination target set to be reached as soon as next Friday, when Melburnians would be released from lockdown.
“Once we’re open, which is sometime next week, we’re going to hit 70 per cent, then the case numbers do become less relevant,” Mr Andrews said.
Asked whether there was a danger of reopening being delayed because of the surge in case numbers, Mr Andrews said he’d struck a deal with Victorians, and they had kept up their end of the bargain. “We have, fundamentally, a very important agreement with the Victorian community. You get vaccinated and we will open up,” he said. “You know, we do what we say. We’re going to be opening up because people got vaccinated in record numbers.”
Only 11 per cent of Victorians in hospital with Covid-19 on Thursday were fully vaccinated.
Some 46 per cent of Thursday’s 2297 cases were in people aged under 30, and 63 per cent were aged under 40.
The Victorian government has hinted at an end of lockdown announcement in the coming days.
There were 406 cases reported in NSW – and six deaths – while the ACT recorded 46 infections.
NSW is expected to hit 80 per cent vaccine coverage at the weekend, with more restrictions to ease on Monday.
Sonya Bennett, the commonwealth’s deputy chief medical ­officer, said the number of infections in Victoria was “disappointing but not unexpected”.
“We don’t expect case numbers are going to rise exponentially, but we’ll probably continue to see high case numbers for some time, and then expect to see them come down as vaccination continues to increase daily, which is what we’re seeing.” she said.

Daily Telegraph editorial: End the eastern suburb’s cocaine culture

Full text: If that is the case, then Sydney’s eastern suburbs must be even more loaded than many people realise – and not just with illicit stimulants.
Despite a single gram of the damaging and addictive drug costing anywhere between $250 and $500, Bondi resident Lauri Meyer said that, pre-lockdown, cocaine was a standard eastern suburbs party accessory.
“Whenever you go to a house party there is always people doing bags of coke,” Meyer, who moved to Sydney’s east from her native France three years ago, told The Daily Telegraph.
“Especially Aussie people, all my Aussie mates go crazy for cocaine.”
Understandably, this has become all too much for Magistrate Ross Hudson.
During his sentencing of socialite Kristin Fisher on Wednesday for possessing two bags of cocaine in Bondi earlier in 2021, Magistrate Hudson lashed out at the rampant eastern suburbs cocaine culture.
“The eastern suburbs of Sydney must be becoming fed up with drug dealing in this state. It really is a stain on our community,” Magistrate Hudson told Waverley Local Court.
“In terms of people who think cocaine and other drugs are just acceptable, that they are part of our fabric, that they are part of a night out … they are not. It (cocaine) is a criminal, illegal drug.”
For good measure, Police Minister David Elliott also slammed the cashed-up, coke-crazed eastern suburbs.
“This whole cocaine culture, particularly in the eastern suburbs, has to end,” Minister Elliott said.
“It’s an illegal substance for good reason. No one, regardless of celebrity status or influence, should be allowed to pollute our community with illicit drugs.”
Mr Elliott added: “I would encourage the judiciary to treat every drug matter as if the offender had been caught selling death pills to their own kids.”
That is very sound advice.
Quite aside from the destructiveness and criminality, there are other compelling reasons to shun cocaine.
If people are sending money indirectly to overseas cocaine suppliers, they are denying potential profits to legitimate Australian businesses.
Cocaine use is unpatriotic.
VACCINATION TARGET HIT, SO WHY HOLD BACK? The word “Bam” is ­rarely deployed by state Premiers, but Dominic Perrottet was justified in its use on Wednesday.
“Bam. We’ve hit 70 per cent of over-16s double vaccinated in NSW,” the new Premier announced online.
“This is great news and big step closer to a full reopening and a proper summer.”
It definitely is good news — so much so that reopening should not now be needlessly delayed, not even until Monday.
After all, just last month then-Treasurer Perrottet revealed that chief health officer Dr Kerry Chant was perfectly content to commence reopening NSW as soon as 70 per cent vaccination were reached.
“She’s very happy at 70 per cent,” Perrottet said, “and ­obviously we will have further restrictions released at the 80 per cent mark.”
So why the delay? Why wait until Monday for certain restrictions to be lifted when we’ve already had our “bam” moment?
According to newly sworn in Deputy Premier Paul Toole, a delay until Monday is necessary because various businesses are not ready for a more rapid ­return to commercial activity.
“They’ve got to ensure that they’ve actually got the supplies, they’ve got the produce,” the Deputy Premier said.
But many businesses are able to reopen at a moment’s notice. There seems little reason to hold them back simply because other businesses may take a few days to get back up to speed.
Back in August, the Doherty Institute, whose modelling informs the government’s tactics, also cited 70 per cent as a safe point for reopening.
“There is light at the end of the tunnel,” the Institute reported. “Once we achieve 70-80 per cent vaccination we will see less transmission of Covid-19 and fewer people with severe illness, and therefore fewer hospitalisations and deaths.”
Let’s get moving, then, and quit our dependence on arbitrarily-selected, bureaucracy-enforced timelines.
As well, there are practical benefits to reopening now ­rather than next week. As Professor Peter Collingnon points out, restoring freedoms now will prevent people from congregating in large numbers on Monday and Tuesday night.
“Visiting your family on a Sunday afternoon in the backyard is much safer than visiting them on Monday night inside,” he said.
There you have it. Bam
LEFT’S HYPOCRISY ON PREMIER’S RELIGION Some 135 years after Sir Patrick Alfred Jennings became the first practising Catholic premier of NSW, Dominic Perrottet is now our state’s leader.
Anti-Catholic bigotry was a major issue back in Sir Patrick’s time. Likewise, the new Premier’s openly expressed religious faith is evidently a problem now for many on the left.
Or so they would have us ­believe. In fact, the left’s focus on Perrottet’s Catholicism is nothing but cynical and divisive political opportunism.
This is made abundantly clear by the left’s treatment of a previous Catholic premier.
Those currently attacking Perrottet had no concerns at all about Catholicism when Labor’s Kristina Keneally was in office.
Keneally’s master’s thesis at university was on the Catholic Church. She taught at a Catholic school. She met her future husband at Catholic World Youth Day in Poland in 1991.
In Australia, one of Ken­eally’s first jobs was with the Catholic charity Society of St Vincent De Paul. She attended, for a time, the Australian Catholic University.
And her beliefs were ever-present in state politics.
Keneally’s maiden speech to parliament in 2003 celebrated her Catholic faith.
In 2007, Keneally crossed the floor in opposition to overturning a ban on embryonic stem cell research.
And nobody, quite rightly, gave Keneally any grief for this. She was not pilloried as an extremist or a religious obsessive.
The same decency deserves to be extended to Dominic Perrottet, who on Tuesday made a promising beginning to his premiership.
Describing himself as a “family Premier” during his last press conference prior to being sworn in, Perrottet said his aim is to improve the lives of “our tradies, our working mums and dads, small-business owners, community groups and frontline workers”.
All of this is consistent with Perrottet’s vision of government not as a smothering, over-protective, intrusive force but as an agency of assistance.
“No matter who you are, where you come from or what you believe,” Perrottet said, “it is the greatest privilege of my life to represent and serve every one of you.”
That declaration of tolerance echoed lines from Labor prime minister Paul Keating in a 1994 interview. “One thing I think that I picked up as a kid in a Catholic school was the church would never have a bar of racism,” Keating said.
“We all arrived equally, we’re all children of Christ. That’s their view. And that’s always been part of my belief, that everyone has an innate dignity.”
Note: as with Keneally, nobody on the left had any problems with Keating’s faith influencing his politics. And nor should they.
Perrottet spoke at length on Tuesday about rebuilding NSW following the ravages of the pandemic. Significantly, his ­primary attention was on work and the economy.
“On Monday, the state opens up,” Perrottet said.
“And we want to get people back into work, get businesses open again. That is the sole focus of our government today.”
Perrottet’s approach may be perfectly timed.
As vaccination totals continue to climb and Monday’s reopening occurs, NSW very much needs an employment-driven attitude across the board – starting at the very top.
Nowhere in the state is this more crucial than in Western Sydney, our economic and ­social engine room.
Noting the government’s prior and continuing focus on that vital region, Perrottet ­referred to his Deputy Premier.
“Stuart Ayres is a fighter,” the Premier said. “He is somebody who sits in cabinet fighting for the people of Western Sydney.”
As he should. Additionally, Perrottet made an observation about Western Sydney often missed, sometimes even by ­experienced political observers: “The values of our party, the ­aspiration, the work ethic, the opportunity for a fair go, they are fundamental values of Western Sydney.”
Two final historical points. When he came to office in 1886, Sir Patrick Alfred Jennings did so because the previous premier, John Robertson, resigned.
And one of the big controversies of the era was whether Australia should unite as a federation or remain as divided states. Sound familiar?
BY-ELECTIONS A MIXED BLESSING FOR PERROTTET The good news for likely new NSW Premier Dominic Perrottet is that he is about to receive a very clear idea of how voters rate the ­Coalition’s performance.
Following the resignations of Premier Gladys Berejiklian, Nationals leader John Barilaro and Transport Minister Andrew Constance, three by-elections will be scheduled in short order – possibly on December 4.
But the bad news for the ­incoming Premier could be in the results of those by-elections.
Typically, state and federal by-elections favour opposition parties and independents over governments of the day.
In fact, the last time an opposition party lost a seat to a government at a federal by-election was more than 100 years ago.
So the Coalition might take a few hits when these three by-elections eventually take place.
Against that, all three seats have handy Coalition margins.
A swing of 21 per cent would be required to shift Berejiklian’s seat of Willoughby away from the government.
Likewise, Constance’s seat of Bega would only leave the Liberals if they suffered a swing of seven per cent. And Barilaro’s Monaro also seems secure with a margin of 11.6 per cent.
Still, by-elections can generate odd outcomes. A focus on local issues sometimes overrides state or federal concerns.
As The Daily Telegraph reports, Liberals believe Willoughby could be vulnerable to a high-profile independent.
Nationals leader Barilaro takes with him from Monaro a significant personal electoral appeal that may be difficult for his replacement to duplicate.
So there are definite challenges ahead. Dominic Perrottet said this week that the pandemic is a greater priority than politics, but he’ll need a great deal of political and campaigning skill to keep those seats safe.
And that is without the further difficulties that may arise if any additional Coalition MPs stand down.
Consider just how quickly everything could change for Labor, should government candidates underperform in the upcoming by-elections.
Chris Minns became Labor leader 123 days ago following Jodi McKay’s resignation. Labor were adrift. Three months later, Labor could be in the box seat.
McKay’s resignation, of course, was brought about by the Upper Hunter by-election. A lot rides on these polls.
WHAT A PERROTTET PREMIERSHIP MEANS FOR NSW The deal hasn’t yet been completely sealed, but as of Sunday evening it appears highly probable that Treasurer Dominic Perrottet will become the 46th premier of NSW.
Perrottet’s ascension was all but secured through various factional arrangements. Yes, the Liberal Party has factions, contrary to then-prime minister Malcolm Turnbull’s 2018 assurance otherwise.
Let us consider, then, exactly what a Perrottet premiership may mean for our state.
On a purely political level, it may take time for the Treasurer to calm some raw feelings within the Coalition government.
Gladys Berejiklian’s resignation has exposed certain rifts. “A lot of people are saying ‘anyone but Perrottet’, and that’s a problem in a marginal seat like Heathcote,” the member for Heathcote, government MP Lee Evans, said on Sunday.
“The silvertail North Shore thing, that is an issue with the two current frontrunners (Perrottet and likely next treasurer Matt Kean).”
Factional tensions are the reason why the transfer of power from Berejiklian to her successor has not run as smoothly as during other recent Liberal leadership changes. Indeed, if the leadership contest is still alive when Liberals convene on Tuesday, it will be the first time the Liberals have voted on a new leader in nearly 20 years.
But that’s just politics. Of greater significance is how Perrottet will influence the state.
It could be, as John Howard once accurately said in 1986 of his own rise to power, that the times will suit Perrottet.
The current Treasurer is determinedly pro-commerce and pro-liberty, which could be a potent combination as NSW emerges from the coronavirus pandemic.
Daily Telegraph - News Feed latest episode
NSW needs a leader who sees opportunity rather than focusing obsessively over risk. In this sense, Perrottet would continue Berejiklian’s approach but with added energy.
Perrottet hinted at that during comments to media.
“The last 18 months have been incredibly tough,” Perrottet said, “but I have no doubt that NSW will come through this difficult time, just like we did last year, to not just recover, but to come out the other side much stronger.”
“Much stronger” would be a fine theme for a refreshed NSW government to pursue.

Full text: QUARANTINE TRIAL HOPE FOR PEOPLE STUCK INTERSTATE STRANDED Queenslanders will be quarantining at home before December, the state’s top doctor has revealed, as it emerged health authorities had begun secretly recruiting residents for a trial that starts next week.
More than 3000 Queenslanders desperate to return home from hotspots are still waiting for their border ­passes to be granted, with hotel quarantine requirements creating a serious bottleneck.
But chief health officer Dr Jeannette Young has revealed home quarantine for residents would be available before December.
Dr Young’s comments stand in contrast to Premier Annastacia Palaszczuk’s ongoing refusal to provide any certainty on Queensland’s pathway out of Covid-19 restrictions once vaccination milestones are met.
Dr Young also signalled her confidence in the quarantine system, noting 56,000 Queenslanders had successfully isolated in their homes, including those deemed close contacts, international flight crew and diplomats.
Home quarantine is available in Queensland for returning children whose family had “a suitable residence” and for people who may “struggle” in hotel quarantine, such as people with a disability, she said.
“We are working it through, but it (home quarantine) would probably be before (December), I would think,” Dr Young said.
“We are looking at whether there are other people who could safely quarantine at home.” Those people are currently being cherrypicked by Queensland Health, with emails seen by The Courier-Mail revealing an expanded home quarantine trial is due to start on October 11.
Up to 1000 people will be part of the trial, Queensland Health confirmed, but eligibility criteria are strict and only those formally “invited” can apply for a spot.
In order to be considered “suitable”, a home quarantine trial candidate must be fully vaccinated against Covid-19, be prepared to travel after October 11, must fly in to Brisbane and live in one of eight South East Queensland council areas.
Those are Brisbane, Moreton Bay, Sunshine Coast, Noosa, Ipswich, Logan, Gold Coast and ­Redland City, excluding its adjoining islands.
Queensland Health forms state a “suitable” home quarantine site must be a “freestanding” private dwelling with no shared common areas accessible by other people, ruling out those that live in apartments.
Those undertaking the home quarantine trial will have to declare that they have enough food and provisions to last 14 days before they arrive home.
They must also present to get tested four times by going to a drive-through clinic in their own car on day 1, 5, 12 and 14 of quarantine.
Anyone who normally lives at the home must either agree to also go into quarantine or live somewhere else for two weeks.
Queensland’s cautious approach to home quarantine is in contrast to NSW, which is trialling seven-day home quarantine for vaccinated international arrivals, and to Victoria, where a home quarantine program for residents stuck interstate is already in place.
The latest blame game ­between the Premier and her federal counterparts rolled into Wednesday, with Ms Palaszczuk again defending Queensland’s demands for extra health funding – a move branded “shakedown politics” by Prime Minister Scott Morrison.
The Premier denied the state was not following the national plan, saying Queensland was in phase A of the plan, before suggesting people query what the ­commonwealth’s plan is on Covid-19 booster shots.
Preparation for a booster shot program is outlined in phase B of the national roadmap and is estimated to come into effect in the final “post vaccination” phase.
Federal minister and Queensland MP Stuart Robert said the nation’s peak vaccine authority was preparing advice on a booster shot program before slamming Ms Palaszczuk for her continued “distractions”.
“The other major states and territories have outlined plans for moving forward in line with a national plan. Is it too much for Queenslanders to expect the Premier of Queensland to do the same?” he said.
Ms Palaszczuk has offered up a smorgasbord of reasons for not revealing Queensland’s roadmap, including the need of a “plan for the children”, the perpetual wait for more scientific modelling, and once questioning why anyone would want to travel overseas anyway.
Queensland had no new local cases of Covid-19 on Wednesday, with three cases recorded in hotel quarantine.
PALASZCZUK’S GIBBER JABBER The list of the Premier’s excuses on not committing to a roadmap out of Covid-19 - Still waiting on more modelling from the Doherty Institute - The Federal Government has not planned a rollout for booster shots - We need a “plan for the children ‘’.
- There are hospital “capacity issues” - There are hospital “capacity issues” - It depends on the situation when we reach 80% (what’s happening interstate, how many cases, etc.) - Needs to see a plan for the vulnerable, elderly and disabled. - Doherty (worst case scenario) modelling shows that 2240 will die each month when borders open - Vaccination rates need to be higher in regional areas and vulnerable communities

Full text: “This is great news and big step closer to a full reopening and a proper summer.”
It definitely is good news — so much so that reopening should not now be needlessly delayed, not even until Monday.
After all, just last month then-Treasurer Perrottet revealed that chief health officer Dr Kerry Chant was perfectly content to commence reopening NSW as soon as 70 per cent vaccination were reached.
“She’s very happy at 70 per cent,” Perrottet said, “and ­obviously we will have further restrictions released at the 80 per cent mark.”
So why the delay? Why wait until Monday for certain restrictions to be lifted when we’ve already had our “bam” moment?
According to newly sworn in Deputy Premier Paul Toole, a delay until Monday is necessary because various businesses are not ready for a more rapid ­return to commercial activity.
“They’ve got to ensure that they’ve actually got the supplies, they’ve got the produce,” the Deputy Premier said.
But many businesses are able to reopen at a moment’s notice. There seems little reason to hold them back simply because other businesses may take a few days to get back up to speed.
Back in August, the Doherty Institute, whose modelling informs the government’s tactics, also cited 70 per cent as a safe point for reopening.
“There is light at the end of the tunnel,” the Institute reported. “Once we achieve 70-80 per cent vaccination we will see less transmission of Covid-19 and fewer people with severe illness, and therefore fewer hospitalisations and deaths.”
Let’s get moving, then, and quit our dependence on arbitrarily-selected, bureaucracy-enforced timelines.
As well, there are practical benefits to reopening now ­rather than next week. As Professor Peter Collingnon points out, restoring freedoms now will prevent people from congregating in large numbers on Monday and Tuesday night.
“Visiting your family on a Sunday afternoon in the backyard is much safer than visiting them on Monday night inside,” he said.
There you have it. Bam
LEFT’S HYPOCRISY ON PREMIER’S RELIGION Some 135 years after Sir Patrick Alfred Jennings became the first practising Catholic premier of NSW, Dominic Perrottet is now our state’s leader.
Anti-Catholic bigotry was a major issue back in Sir Patrick’s time. Likewise, the new Premier’s openly expressed religious faith is evidently a problem now for many on the left.
Or so they would have us ­believe. In fact, the left’s focus on Perrottet’s Catholicism is nothing but cynical and divisive political opportunism.
This is made abundantly clear by the left’s treatment of a previous Catholic premier.
Those currently attacking Perrottet had no concerns at all about Catholicism when Labor’s Kristina Keneally was in office.
Keneally’s master’s thesis at university was on the Catholic Church. She taught at a Catholic school. She met her future husband at Catholic World Youth Day in Poland in 1991.
In Australia, one of Ken­eally’s first jobs was with the Catholic charity Society of St Vincent De Paul. She attended, for a time, the Australian Catholic University.
And her beliefs were ever-present in state politics.
Keneally’s maiden speech to parliament in 2003 celebrated her Catholic faith.
In 2007, Keneally crossed the floor in opposition to overturning a ban on embryonic stem cell research.
And nobody, quite rightly, gave Keneally any grief for this. She was not pilloried as an extremist or a religious obsessive.
The same decency deserves to be extended to Dominic Perrottet, who on Tuesday made a promising beginning to his premiership.
Describing himself as a “family Premier” during his last press conference prior to being sworn in, Perrottet said his aim is to improve the lives of “our tradies, our working mums and dads, small-business owners, community groups and frontline workers”.
All of this is consistent with Perrottet’s vision of government not as a smothering, over-protective, intrusive force but as an agency of assistance.
“No matter who you are, where you come from or what you believe,” Perrottet said, “it is the greatest privilege of my life to represent and serve every one of you.”
That declaration of tolerance echoed lines from Labor prime minister Paul Keating in a 1994 interview. “One thing I think that I picked up as a kid in a Catholic school was the church would never have a bar of racism,” Keating said.
“We all arrived equally, we’re all children of Christ. That’s their view. And that’s always been part of my belief, that everyone has an innate dignity.”
Note: as with Keneally, nobody on the left had any problems with Keating’s faith influencing his politics. And nor should they.
Perrottet spoke at length on Tuesday about rebuilding NSW following the ravages of the pandemic. Significantly, his ­primary attention was on work and the economy.
“On Monday, the state opens up,” Perrottet said.
“And we want to get people back into work, get businesses open again. That is the sole focus of our government today.”
Perrottet’s approach may be perfectly timed.
As vaccination totals continue to climb and Monday’s reopening occurs, NSW very much needs an employment-driven attitude across the board – starting at the very top.
Nowhere in the state is this more crucial than in Western Sydney, our economic and ­social engine room.
Noting the government’s prior and continuing focus on that vital region, Perrottet ­referred to his Deputy Premier.
“Stuart Ayres is a fighter,” the Premier said. “He is somebody who sits in cabinet fighting for the people of Western Sydney.”
As he should. Additionally, Perrottet made an observation about Western Sydney often missed, sometimes even by ­experienced political observers: “The values of our party, the ­aspiration, the work ethic, the opportunity for a fair go, they are fundamental values of Western Sydney.”
Two final historical points. When he came to office in 1886, Sir Patrick Alfred Jennings did so because the previous premier, John Robertson, resigned.
And one of the big controversies of the era was whether Australia should unite as a federation or remain as divided states. Sound familiar?
BY-ELECTIONS A MIXED BLESSING FOR PERROTTET The good news for likely new NSW Premier Dominic Perrottet is that he is about to receive a very clear idea of how voters rate the ­Coalition’s performance.
Following the resignations of Premier Gladys Berejiklian, Nationals leader John Barilaro and Transport Minister Andrew Constance, three by-elections will be scheduled in short order – possibly on December 4.
But the bad news for the ­incoming Premier could be in the results of those by-elections.
Typically, state and federal by-elections favour opposition parties and independents over governments of the day.
In fact, the last time an opposition party lost a seat to a government at a federal by-election was more than 100 years ago.
So the Coalition might take a few hits when these three by-elections eventually take place.
Against that, all three seats have handy Coalition margins.
A swing of 21 per cent would be required to shift Berejiklian’s seat of Willoughby away from the government.
Likewise, Constance’s seat of Bega would only leave the Liberals if they suffered a swing of seven per cent. And Barilaro’s Monaro also seems secure with a margin of 11.6 per cent.
Still, by-elections can generate odd outcomes. A focus on local issues sometimes overrides state or federal concerns.
As The Daily Telegraph reports, Liberals believe Willoughby could be vulnerable to a high-profile independent.
Nationals leader Barilaro takes with him from Monaro a significant personal electoral appeal that may be difficult for his replacement to duplicate.
So there are definite challenges ahead. Dominic Perrottet said this week that the pandemic is a greater priority than politics, but he’ll need a great deal of political and campaigning skill to keep those seats safe.
And that is without the further difficulties that may arise if any additional Coalition MPs stand down.
Consider just how quickly everything could change for Labor, should government candidates underperform in the upcoming by-elections.
Chris Minns became Labor leader 123 days ago following Jodi McKay’s resignation. Labor were adrift. Three months later, Labor could be in the box seat.
McKay’s resignation, of course, was brought about by the Upper Hunter by-election. A lot rides on these polls.
WHAT A PERROTTET PREMIERSHIP MEANS FOR NSW The deal hasn’t yet been completely sealed, but as of Sunday evening it appears highly probable that Treasurer Dominic Perrottet will become the 46th premier of NSW.
Perrottet’s ascension was all but secured through various factional arrangements. Yes, the Liberal Party has factions, contrary to then-prime minister Malcolm Turnbull’s 2018 assurance otherwise.
Let us consider, then, exactly what a Perrottet premiership may mean for our state.
On a purely political level, it may take time for the Treasurer to calm some raw feelings within the Coalition government.
Gladys Berejiklian’s resignation has exposed certain rifts. “A lot of people are saying ‘anyone but Perrottet’, and that’s a problem in a marginal seat like Heathcote,” the member for Heathcote, government MP Lee Evans, said on Sunday.
“The silvertail North Shore thing, that is an issue with the two current frontrunners (Perrottet and likely next treasurer Matt Kean).”
Factional tensions are the reason why the transfer of power from Berejiklian to her successor has not run as smoothly as during other recent Liberal leadership changes. Indeed, if the leadership contest is still alive when Liberals convene on Tuesday, it will be the first time the Liberals have voted on a new leader in nearly 20 years.
But that’s just politics. Of greater significance is how Perrottet will influence the state.
It could be, as John Howard once accurately said in 1986 of his own rise to power, that the times will suit Perrottet.
The current Treasurer is determinedly pro-commerce and pro-liberty, which could be a potent combination as NSW emerges from the coronavirus pandemic.
Daily Telegraph - News Feed latest episode
NSW needs a leader who sees opportunity rather than focusing obsessively over risk. In this sense, Perrottet would continue Berejiklian’s approach but with added energy.
Perrottet hinted at that during comments to media.
“The last 18 months have been incredibly tough,” Perrottet said, “but I have no doubt that NSW will come through this difficult time, just like we did last year, to not just recover, but to come out the other side much stronger.”
“Much stronger” would be a fine theme for a refreshed NSW government to pursue.

Full text: Mr Morrison on Tuesday accused Annastacia Palaszczuk’s government of “shakedown politics” after it again refused to commit to reopening its borders when it hits a 80 per cent double vaccination rate, this time citing a need for more hospital funding from the commonwealth.
Queensland has proved reluctant in agreeing to a timeline to reopen and has previously expressed concern over the vulnerability of unvaccinated children, while also calling for updated Doherty Institute modelling before it makes a decision.

But Health Minister Yvette D’Ath was not impressed by Mr Morrison’s latest barb and said it was unfair to single out Queensland.
“I remind the Prime Minister … this is a national conversation,” Ms D’Ath said.
“It‘s not a fight between the commonwealth and Queensland, it is every single state, we are saying that our health system is subject to extensive pressure and demand.
“Prior to Covid, that required a rethink. And with Covid now we need to see more contributions from the commonwealth, partnering with us 50/50 is only fair.”
Earlier, Mr Morrison launched an stunning attack on the Queensland government during an interview on The Today Show.

“We have been showering the states with money over the course of Covid,” he said.
“To go down this point and say ‘well, you know, I’m going to hold the federal government to ransom and seek to extort money from them on the basis of Covid’, I just don’t think is the right way to go.
“We’ve been working with them constructively. We’ve supported them time and again with joint funding initiatives. We’ve shared 50/50 the costs of Covid on the health system, more than $30bn around the country we’ve pumped into health support.”

The latest back and forth between federal and state leaders came as Queensland recorded two new local cases of Covid, with neither linked to the mystery Brisbane masseuse case that emerged on Monday.

One of the cases was a three-year-old girl from a family that visited the Gold Coast and was linked to the aviation cluster. She was detected in home quarantine.
The other was a 19-year-old woman who was given an exemption to return to Brisbane from Victoria.
She was detected on arrival in the Queensland via Monday’s Jetstar 562 flight from Melbourne.
Queensland on Tuesday also unveiled its new chief health officer – Royal Brisbane and Women’s Hospital director of infectious diseases Dr Krispin Hajkowicz.

Dr Hajkowicz will replace Dr Jeannette Young when she assumes the role of Queensland Governor on November 1.
Dr Young had earlier reassured the state’s capital that a lockdown was not yet necessary despite the discovery of the mystery case on Monday who was infectious in the community for 10 days.
The 55-year-old woman from Fitzgibbon was behind a slew of new exposure sites across Brisbane’s north, including supermarkets, cafes, and six massage businesses where she worked.

Dr Young on Tuesday said a recent spike in testing – and the infected woman being fully vaccinated and her household contacts returning negative tests – had given her some comfort even after previously stating one unlinked case could be enough to force the state to lock down.
She said the government was still working through the QR codes, businesses, and contacts the woman may have come across but was heartened by the 112,000 tests carried out since the emergence of the aviation cluster.

Full text: July 2 The plan The National Cabinet agreed to formulate a four-phase National Plan to transition Australia’s National Covid Response.
August 6Scott Morrison says plan is agreed to: The National Cabinet agreed to adopt in full an updated National Plan, based on the Doherty Institute’s findings. This follows the National Cabinet’s agreement in principle to the updated National Plan on July 30.
August 16A long way off the threshold that allows an easing of restrictions, the Premier said: “We are provided constantly with advice from the Doherty Institute and what (it) is saying is that 80 per cent national threshold is what we are aiming towards.”
August 17Still discretion for specific lockdowns. Annastacia Palaszczuk said: “(The national cabinet plan) doesn’t say we are not going to have lockdowns, but that lockdowns will be minimised. That Doherty research starts from the premise that Australia is in a situation with very little Covid.”
August 24 Modelling predicated on different case numbers. Ms Palaszczuk said: “(The modelling used was) predicated on 30 cases across Australia, not 13,000. So I’m looking forward to seeing that modelling.”
August 28Wanted “a look” at the new modelling. The Doherty Institute reiterated to national cabinet on August 27 that it would be safe to reopen the country once 80 per cent of over-16s were fully vaccinated – regardless of case numbers. A spokesman for Ms Palaszczuk said her government was yet to receive the paper and “looks forward to further discussions next week”.
September 1 Premier Annastacia Palaszczuk: “What’s going to happen to the children? We need to have further research done on what happens to the 0 to 12-year-old cohort as they remain unvaccinated.”
September 2Worst case scenario Doherty modelling. Ms Palaszczuk said: “Doherty Institute modelling predicts that even with 70 per cent of the population vaccinated, 80 people will die each day from Covid once the outbreak reaches six months after it started. That is 2240 who will die each month.”
September 23What freedoms or rewards would Queenslanders get? Ms Palaszczuk: “The national plan hasn’t been finalised, they’re still doing work. We’ve got another meeting next week so everyone can just hold off and calm down until next Friday.”
October 1 Hospital funding. Ms Palaszczuk: “I am not going to put Queenslanders at risk until ... a big injection of funds from the federal government into the states to make sure the hospitals are able to cope with the growth (in cases) that will happen.”
October 2 Vax rates. Yvette D’Ath said: “That 20 per cent ... could be our remote indigenous communities ... our low-socio economic ... that have a lower percentage of protection in their vaccination rates.”

Vow to get Victoria open as Covid-19 cases rocket

Full text: While the Victorian Premier refused to rule out having to revise his reopening road map should a further escalation in cases overwhelm the state’s already struggling health system, he vowed that Victoria was “not turning back” in seeking to reopen as scheduled when the 70 and 80 per cent vaccination targets were met.
Mr Andrews attributed at least 500 extra cases in Thursday’s number to illegal household gatherings held on the AFL grand final long weekend, maintaining that while he was “not trying to blame anyone”, case numbers “go up faster if people are out visiting each other in their homes”.
Asked whether he could rule out having to revise his road map should the health system become swamped, he said: “I have never ruled that out. There is no crystal ball with this.”
However, he said there was “no turning back now” in terms of the state moving towards reopening. “We are finding a way to push through and get this place open. We’ve got to do it,” he said.
The increase in cases came as the major supermarkets pleaded with the Andrews government to revise isolation protocol for fully vaccinated casual contacts of Covid cases, warning the furloughing of staff could see dozens of stores forced to close as early as this weekend.
Business groups, meanwhile, called on the government to honour its road map, saying a lockdown-battered Victoria needed hope and certainty to recover.
Opposition Leader Matthew Guy called on Mr Andrews to take responsibility for the state’s health system already being in crisis — with widespread ambulance ramping at major hospitals as well as waiting times of up to 12 minutes for triple-0 calls to be answered earlier this week.
Victorian Premier Daniel Andrews says there are currently 11,018 active cases of COVID-19 in the state. It comes after the premier announced on Thursday there had been 1,438 new local COVID-19 cases and five further deaths recorded in the state.
“The Premier has been in his job for seven years. He was the health minister for four years as well. For 11 of the last 15 years, he is the person who’s run the health system in Victoria,” Mr Guy said.
“We’ve all known this moment would come to reopen and there would be more cases. If our hospital system is not ready now, questions need to be asked why?”
The Burnet Institute modelling on which the Andrews government has based its reopening road map predicts hospitalisations will peak at between 1950 and 4400, including between 462 and 953 ­patients in ICU.
New daily cases in Victoria, from July 10, 2021
On Thursday, 398 people were in Victorian hospitals with coronavirus; 83 were in intensive care, of whom 57 were on ventilators.
Covid logistics chief Jeroen Weimar on Thursday warned that if the jump in case numbers proved to be a trend, “we will jump to the worst of those Burnet predictions”.
While Victoria’s case numbers have outstripped those of NSW on a per capita basis, slightly higher vaccination rates in Victoria now compared with the NSW peak on September 11 appear to correlate with fewer deaths and hospitalisations. Victoria’s 1438 cases on Thursday are the per capita equivalent of 1758 cases in NSW, compared with the actual peak in NSW on September 11 of 1599 local cases.
COVID-19 Australia: Cumulative vaccinations by state
At the time, NSW had a single-dose vaccination rate of 78.1 per cent, with 45.6 per cent fully vaccinated, compared with Victoria’s rate on Thursday of 80.1 per cent single and 49.8 double-dosed.
There had been 170 deaths in the NSW outbreak to September 11, compared with 41 in Victoria as of Thursday.
These included five deaths reported on Thursday, all in Melbourne’s north.

Vaccines begin to quell ICU numbers

Full text: NSW's strategy of pouring vaccines into COVID-19 outbreak areas is paying off, with about a third of new cases fighting their infection with some level of protection against severe disease.
Immunisation and treatment innovations could keep the state's intensive care cases well below numbers predicted by the Burnet Institute last month, infectious disease experts say.
According to NSW Health's regular COVID-19 surveillance report, more than 35 per cent of people who tested positive to the virus in the week ending September 11 had received at least one dose of a vaccine. About one in 20 cases were fully vaccinated.
There were 1155 COVID-19 cases admitted to hospital in NSW and 214 people in intensive care yesterday. A week earlier, there were 1207 hospitalised cases and 236 in intensive care. Modelling by the Burnet Institute, a Melbourne-based medical research organisation, published by the state government last month suggested NSW Health could be treating 560 COVID-19 patients in intensive care by the end of October.
NSW Health confirmed yesterday the modelling did factor in rising vaccination rates, but rates had increased more quickly than were modelled.
"Pleasingly the hospitalisation rate has not been as high as we had seen in the modelling and the ICU admissions have been a bit lower as well but it doesn't mean we are out of the woods in terms of overwhelming our hospitals," Premier Gladys Berejiklian said.
However, the number of virus patients being treated - and dying - in their homes is rising. There have been 29 people who have died at home with COVID-19 during the Delta outbreak, including at least 13 since September 15. Sixteen tested positive after their death.
Data from September 22 showed 14,447 COVID-19 patients were being cared for outside a hospital setting, up from 13,590 the previous week.
Professor Greg Dore, an infectious disease physician at St Vincent's Hospital, said rising vaccination rates had "clearly" made an impact on hospitalisation and intensive care numbers.
"We know that there's a 70 to 90 per cent reduction in hospitalisation with a single dose of AstraZeneca or Pfizer, and that is being reflected in the numbers," he said.
Professor Dore said he thought the situation in hospitals was "considerably less bleak" than the modelling suggested.
"The progression to intensive care requirement by a patient has absolutely been slowed down by vaccination," he said. "It is pretty good news in terms of stabilising hospitalisation numbers a month earlier than projected."
He said improvements in treatments for COVID-19 patients - such as the provisional approval of sotrovimab, a one-dose intravenal antibody treatment shown to reduce a risk of severe disease - may also have played a small role.
"The numbers aren't huge, but that may be having some sort of impact as well," Professor Dore said.
Professor Tony Cunningham, co-director of the Centre for Virus Research at the Westmead Institute for Medical Research, agreed the impact of vaccination and improved treatment was being seen.
Given one dose of COVID-19 vaccine is less effective against the Delta variant than earlier strains of the virus, he said the focus needed to be increasing second-dose coverage by administering AstraZeneca four to eight weeks apart and bringing forward Pfizer doses initially scheduled to be administered on eight-week intervals where possible.
Of the 236 cases in intensive care yesterday, 46 had received one dose of a vaccine and 161 were not vaccinated.
Hospitalisation tends to lag about 10 days behind case numbers, said ANU infectious diseases physician Professor Peter Collignon.
"The good news is case numbers appear to be turning, and that's a function, also, of vaccination," he said.
University of Sydney professor of biostatistics Ian Marschner, who has been modelling the ongoing mortality of COVID-19 in NSW, said the outbreak had a mortality rate comparable to an unvaccinated population until the beginning of September, when numbers started to shift.
"We are now starting to see what we refer to as 'mortality deficits': less mortality than would be expected in the population of cases," he said. with Lucy Carroll

Full text: The number of Victorians in hospital with COVID-19 has hit 241, a 15 per cent jump from Monday's figure, as the state recorded 603 new cases and one death.
Sixty people are in ICU with 40 connected to a ventilator.
Of the 603 new cases, just 10 are from regional Victoria and all of those were in LGAs already in lockdown: three each in Mitchell Shire and Bacchus Marsh, and one each in Ballarat, Greater Geelong, the Macedon Ranges and Bass Coast.
There were 40,811 vaccine doses delivered across Victoria yesterday, the highest for any state.
Victorian Treasurer Tim Pallas addressed the daily press conference to discuss the sudden shutdown of the construction industry across metropolitan Melbourne and the locked-down regional LGAs.

The decision to shut down the sector, effective from 11.59pm Monday night, was made after protests outside CFMEU headquarters in the Melbourne CBD turned violent, but followed weeks of concern around COVID-19 transmission in construction sites across the city.
Mr Pallas said it was a difficult but necessary decision.
"It is a sad day in many ways for a lot of the construction industry workers, a lot of people who have been doing the right thing that, unfortunately, aberrant behaviour amongst a minority has led to a very substantial public health risk," he said.
"We have seen a need for the Government to intervene and take strong action, consistent with the Chief Health Officer's orders, in order to protect the community."
Mr Pallas said the Department of Health had already been formulating plans for a shutdown when the city protests spiralled out of control, saying the sector had been warned about rising infections across work sites.
"There is noncompliance across a range of construction sites. You'll recall when I spoke to you last week that we said that we would put a safety blitz in place," he said.
"Close to 50 per cent of the sites inspected have failed to meet the safety requirements, when they've been inspected by authorised officers."
He described the protests as "reprehensible" and said he hoped the shutdown would "take this opportunity... to reset and restart the industry".
"We cannot simply go back to the way things were being conducted," he said.
Mr Pallas said he recognised the "economic trauma" that many workers would suffer as a result of the government's decision. He said workers would be eligible for Commonwealth disaster payments of either $450 or $750, depending on the amount of work they lost. He also said the Victorian government was working on widening eligibility for state payments.
Victorian CHO Professor Brett Sutton said it was vital that all construction workers were vaccinated as soon as possible. He said the Burnet Institute modelling predicted dire results if the sector wasn't vaccinated.
"It makes a difference of hundreds to thousands of cases, and that is potentially hundreds of debts through November and beyond," he said.
Asked why the government had brought in a mandate, rather than a 90 per cent target, Professor Sutton said there was already a 90 per cent target for the sector, but it hadn't raised vaccination rates.
"When we had a blitz offering the vaccine for construction workers, voluntarily, there wasn't a terrific response," he said.

Full text: The desire of NSW health officials to focus on the effect of the vaccine rollout on that state's outbreaks could explain why its plan to ease coronavirus restrictions differs from Victoria's road map out of lockdown.
One of the co-authors of the Burnet Institute modelling that informed both states' road maps, Professor Margaret Hellard, told The Age the faster vaccine rollout, specifically in COVID-19 hotspots was "super important" for NSW health officials when commissioning modelling for their route out of lockdown.
She said Victorian health authorities were "much clearer" about what they wanted from modelling, but declined to expand on specific requests.
"Different jurisdictions will ask us to look at different things that are critical to them as they're thinking about what they're doing," Professor Hellard said.
In addition to differences in the modelling, MPs from both NSW and Victoria told The Age that political motivations also helped shaped pathways out of lockdown, which will result in Victorians waiting up to a month longer for some freedoms granted to NSW residents from early October.
Under Victoria's road map, home visits will be banned and gyms and swimming pools will remain shut until 80 per cent of residents have received two doses of coronavirus vaccine.
By contrast, vaccinated residents in NSW will be allowed to travel around the state, have friends and family visit their homes and attend theatres and cinemas when the state hits its 70 per cent double-dose target, which is expected to be on October 9.
Bars, restaurants and cafes will be limited to takeaway only until October 26 when Victoria is expected to hit its 70 per cent double-dose target. Only then will venues be allowed to provide an outdoor dining service.
For indoor dining, Victorian restaurants and cafes will have to wait until 80 per cent of the state's residents are fully vaccinated, which isn't expected to be until early November. A density quotient of one person per four square metres will remain in place.
Amid rising criticism from the business community about Victoria's slow-and-steady approach to easing restrictions, Professor Hellard said the two strategies implemented by NSW and Victoria were not "markedly dissimilar", claiming the two states are following similar paths.
"In essence they are all pretty much saying the same thing - that you need to get really high levels of vaccination to get control of the pandemic," Professor Hellard said. "Though the road maps might look a little different in some things, they're not markedly different."
Inside the NSW government, MPs believe Premier Gladys Berejiklian's is partly framed by internal pressures, with several cabinet ministers lobbying for eased restrictions.
In Victoria, cabinet ministers believe the government's prospects at the next election are tied to its ability to chart a more cautious approach which they maintain is favoured by voters.
"We know businesses are frustrated, but we have continually said we follow the health advice and now it's part of our political brand," one Victorian minister said, commenting on the condition of anonymity.
"People have different expectations of us here, they don't want us to rush out as fast as NSW is."
Restaurant and Catering Australia chief executive Wes Lambert slammed the Victorian government's reopening plan, saying it had left Victorian businesses "shattered" and "confused".
"We are very disappointed," Mr Lambert said. "Businesses were left flabbergasted that at 70 per cent vaccination rates they get outdoor dining outdoor only and are screaming that it should be at least the same as NSW."
"The hospitality sector was left scratching their heads at the modelling behind the extremely strict easing which will leave many businesses closed until November."
Several other industry groups, speaking to The Age on the condition of anonymity, expressed frustration at the Victorian government's approach, claiming that their pleas to reopen sooner were ignored.
"With Victoria it always seems as they are only willing to consult once they have their decision," one industry boss said.

Darkest days loom on path to 'normal'

Full text: The road map released by the Victorian government on Sunday finally charts a course out of COVID's seemingly endless lockdowns to a more normal life, but the modelling on which it's based suggests that path takes us through some of the pandemic's darkest days and weeks.
As slow and careful as the road map is, it will allow the virus to spread, the Burnet Institute's best guess says, and the toll we have avoided for so long of new cases, hospitalisations and deaths will come along with it.
It predicts a peak in average infections of between 1400 and 2900 per day in the last two weeks of October - and then a second, much larger peak of around 4000 cases per day at the end of December. It predicts a better than one-in-two chance of the healthcare system being overwhelmed.
Without vaccines the path would be considerably worse. Indeed, the overwhelming majority of serious illness and death will be among the unvaccinated, and for those people, particularly in older age groups, the outlook is grim.
Up until now, they have been protected from COVID-19 by the efforts of the whole community to limit the virus circulating. This, according to the modelling, will change rapidly in coming weeks.
Should you remain unvaccinated, you face a dramatically higher risk of catching COVID-19. At the same time you will be treated in a stretched healthcare system. Modellers expect mortality rates to jump when healthcare systems get overwhelmed.
How accurate are the Burnet Institute's projections? Will we really have 120,000 new infections in December? It is hard to know at this stage. Given Victoria recorded just 507 cases on Sunday, future projections about the course of the pandemic are extremely uncertain.
Models are, ultimately, sophisticated guesses - the modern version of soothsayers reading the future in chicken entrails. Expect a week of scientific debate over this one's underlying assumptions.
The second takeaway is about the direction Victoria has chosen.
Premier Daniel Andrews and Chief Health Officer Brett Sutton have come in for regular criticism that their approach to COVID-19 has been too cautious.
There was an opportunity for more caution at this juncture.
Mr Andrews could have used the Burnet Institute's modelling to support a decision to avoid reopening at 80 per cent vaccination rates, and demand we push up toward 90 per cent - as other COVID-free states have done. Doing so would substantially cut the likely number of deaths.
He chose not to do this.
We can read a lot into the reporting that suggests cabinet ministers pushed to reopen schools in October over the objections of Professor Sutton, who preferred to wait till November. It is now clear who won that argument.
The road map represents a substantially more risky option than staying in lockdown or opening only partially, at least in terms of infections and deaths.
But such is the reality of COVID-19. Choosing to open and live with the virus, rather than seek elimination - as some senior scientific voices have called for - means cases and deaths.
Such is the trade-off for a return to something approximating life as normal.
"Remaining closed forever has its own cost," Mr Andrews said on Sunday.
"We are opening up, no doubt about that. There will be no turning back. We have to normalise this, we have to pass through this pandemic."

Editorial: Don’t be surprised if 80 per cent suddenly becomes 90 per cent

Full text: If a state election were held today there is little doubt Ms Palaszczuk and her Labor Party would be returned with an even greater majority than they were 11 months ago (with a comfortable five-seat majority on the back of a 53-47 two-party preferred vote).
With the two big southern states locked down now for months while we in Queensland enjoy almost-normal freedoms, you could comfortably assume the incumbent government would be even further ahead now.
Obviously, that is moot because our fixed-terms model means the next election is set for October 26, 2024. But politicians always keep one eye on the opinion polls, no matter what they might publicly say.
That being the case, when viewed solely through a political lens there is zero political reason the Premier would take any chances when it comes to Covid-19. The longer Queensland can remain free of the virus that has ravaged the rest of the world, the better things will be politically for the politician that Ms Palaszczuk is.
Little wonder, then, that Labor insiders are now actively briefing out the idea of shifting to 90 per cent the current 80 per cent (of the eligible population fully vaccinated) trigger for our state border to be reopened, and for region-wide lockdowns being taken off the table.
The Queensland and Western Australian premiers are “clinging to this false hope of zero COVID” by planning to keep their borders closed even after 80 per cent double doses is reached, says infectious diseases physician Dr Clay Golledge. “You're not going to have zero COVID in the long term,” he told Sky News host Chris Smith. “Eventually COVID will spread right throughout Australia, right throughout the world. “And I still maintain in the next 18 months to two years that we’ll all be exposed to the virus and get it in some way, shape or form and hopefully being vaccinated we won’t get anything at all or get very minimal symptoms.”
Such a move would – politically – make sense. Internal Labor polling is understood to be – unsurprisingly – showing a massive spike in how much Queenslanders now value their freedoms as the situation in NSW and Victoria reach the point of no-return.
Keeping the border closed to those virus-ridden southerners has therefore quickly become just about the biggest no-brainer that history has ever gifted to a populist Queensland premier.
As we report today, Queensland could hit 80 per cent of our over-16 population double-jabbed as soon as November 12 – coincidentally the same day the nation is due to reach that milestone. Under the national cabinet agreement struck prior to the NSW and Victoria outbreaks, that would trigger all border restrictions to be dropped – and lockdowns deemed to be a measure of last resort, and then only imposed at a localised level.
But – and this is the point the Premier has been, perhaps a little clumsily, making – that agreement was struck when there were no Covid cases in Australia. Opening up the nation now would be a totally different ballgame, as it would all but ensure outbreaks within days right across Queensland.
In that context, you can understand why those political operatives working for a naturally risk-averse Premier whose entire focus is on Covid are flying a kite around the lifting of the 80 per cent threshold for our state to reunify with the rest of Australia.
The Premier is still publicly saying it is still too early to speculate on what might happen at 80 per cent. After all, that milestone remains at least seven or eight weeks away. In the meantime, she repeats whenever asked: “We are waiting on updated Doherty Institute modelling before we can make those decisions.”
How to get vaccinated in Queensland
We understand that living a life free from Covid is a glorious thing. Being able to turn up to a full Suncorp Stadium is wonderful. As is having a dinner out with friends or family, or just the simple pleasure of a pint at the pub with your mates.
But we can’t shut ourselves off from the world indefinitely.
And yet there are two statistics that worringly indicate this could be the reality if the government does decide to shift to 90 per cent.
The first is that 90 per cent of people aged over 16 in Australia (the standard benchmark for Covid jab rates) equates to 72 per cent of the entire population. Just 13 nations have so far managed Covid jab rates that high. The UK is stuck at 66 per cent, Canada 70 per cent, and the United States 54 per cent.
Even more worrying is that the threshold would have to be hit both in Queensland and nationally – and 13.4 per cent of Queensland adults are still saying they are unwilling to be vaccinated against Covid. Across Australia, that rate is at 9.4 per cent. There is a real chance our Covid jab rates will never top 90 per cent.
All that being the case, it looks – sadly – prudent for Queenslanders to delay making any plans for an interstate Christmas holiday.

Full text: There are, on the contrary, arguments for restrictions of this kind that should appeal even to libertarians.
After all, no one has a right to impose a harm on others by negligently disregarding their rights and interests. And it is surely clear that negligently infecting another person with a potentially serious disease breaches their right to live safely and securely, undermining a fundamental freedom that govern­ments have a duty to protect.
Indeed, for most accidental harms, the law of torts – which towering libertarians, such as Friedrich Hayek, have not only endorsed but eulogised – serves precisely that purpose, entitling the victim of a negligent act to rely on the coercive powers of the state to secure compensation from the act’s perpetrator.
Were tort law readily applicable to highly contagious diseases, it would not only help compensate victims; the threat of being sued would deter negligent transmission, inducing people to seek vaccination, or, knowing or suspecting that they have a communicable disease, to self-isolate.
There are, however, obvious difficulties in relying on the remedies offered by the law of tort to control the spread of Covid.
In part, those difficulties relate to the complexities of making out a case: it would, for example, be virtually impossible to unambiguously identify the culprits in a lengthy chain of transmission.
But even if those issues could be addressed, many of the costs of Covid do not fall on those who catch the disease; they are instead borne by society as a whole, through broader economic and social losses that tort law is neither designed to recover nor to effectively prevent.
And with an infection that can spread explosively, it is surely preferable to pre-emptively reduce the probability of outbreaks, rather than relying, almost certainly unsuccessfully, on private legal action to pursue those who helped trigger an outbreak once it had ­occurred.
Given those difficulties, other instruments – such as “vaccinal passports” – must fulfil the functions that tort law cannot serve, including preventing immediate harm and encouraging the taking of reasonable precautions.
Moreover, since those other instruments are merely regulatory substitutes for the (coercive) law of tort, it is scarcely sensible to criticise them for being coercive; rather, the only real issue is whether they are more coercive than they need to be.
Inevitably, the answer to that question depends on an assessment of the facts.
If one believes that Covid is not a serious disease, then any restriction on the unvaccinated is plainly unjustifiable. And much the same would hold were vaccination ineffective or unduly dangerous. But if one accepts the Doherty Institute report and the latest modelling by the US Centres for Disease Control, the picture is altogether different.
Those studies suggest that the unvaccinated are about five times more likely than the vaccinated to catch Covid. Even assuming that the unvaccinated and the vaccinated transmit the disease at exactly the same rate, that implies that adding just one unvaccinated person to a group of five people who are vaccinated doubles the risk of there being a person in the group who has Covid.
The New South Wales and Victorian Governments are hoping to streamline vaccine passport technology that would work in both states. Residents will soon be required to show proof of vaccination to access pubs, clubs and other services, but Digital Certificates across Australia will initially differ state-by-state. Vaccine passports in New South Wales will be linked to the existing Service NSW QR check-in System. The state's Customer Service Minister Victor Dominello has exclusively revealed to Sky News Australia he's working to make that operate in conjunction with Victoria's scheme.
Clearly, the overall danger that poses depends on the likelihood that the infection will be passed on, seeding a major outbreak; the higher the proportion of the population that is vaccinated, and the better the quality of contact tracing and isolation, the lower must be the probability of an uncontrolled outbreak.
But even putting aside the possibility of further spread, the fact that about 7 per cent of the symptomatic cases among the vaccinated are sufficiently serious as to require hospitalisation provides some basis for policy measures that limit the scope for contagion by restricting the unvaccinated’s access to crowded places. And where the contagion would affect very vulnerable groups – as in aged-care homes or in hospitals – the case for restricting access by the unvaccinated is overwhelming.
Those measures may seem harsh but they are hardly discriminatory: far from treating like unalike (which is the essence of discrimination), they differentiate on the basis of a crucial difference, namely the risk of infection.
However, the function of the restrictions is not to simply reduce the immediate likelihood of transmission; it is also to encourage the unvaccinated to seek vaccination. They therefore resemble punishments, which, when taken to an extreme (as in “no jab, no school” policies), can make vaccination virtually mandatory.
Presumably, the goal being pursued is that of achieving a level of vaccination in the community that is sufficient to reach a degree of herd immunity, reducing the need for costly lockdowns.
Just how high that level has to be is controversial; what is certain is that any gains from herd immunity, once it is achieved, flow to both the vaccinated and unvaccinated, in terms of reduced risk of illness and improved quality of life. And because the unvaccinated stand a far higher chance of catching the disease and dying from it, they derive a substantially greater benefit than do the vaccinated from herd immunity being reached.
UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson has unveiled a raft of measures to stop a winter COVID-19 resurgence. At its heart – a continuing drive to get the whole country vaccinated and for those over 50 to receive booster vaccines. The government also revealed a Plan B which includes the possibility of vaccine passports and even the return of lockdowns.
To that extent, the unvaccinated free-ride on a benefit they have done nothing to secure, other than by making a trivial contribution to the fiscal cost of the vaccines. It could be argued that their free riding on the risks and inconvenience borne by the vaccinated causes no harm, as the benefit remains intact, at least in the short term; but it is reasonable to suggest that a free society will struggle to survive if the principle of mutual obligation can be lightly disregarded, including when it comes to sharing the cost of vital public goods. Rather, just as refusing to be conscripted in times of war should not come cheaply, so the refusal to be vaccinated when one readily and safely could ought to come with hurdles and burdens attached.
Of course, it may be that imposing any such penalties will prove unnecessary. Perhaps the intense fear of Covid that has gripped Australia will make very high levels of vaccination easy to achieve. But even if it did, there would still be a risk that when the vaccinations have to be renewed, the passage of time will have dulled the panic, causing herd immunity, and the benefits it brings, to be lost.
Having lived in fear for the past two years, wouldn’t it be ironic if now all we had to fear was the waning of fear itself?

Full text: UPDATE, 12pm: A Melbourne resident infected with COVID-19 has been confirmed to have been working in Ballarat.
Victoria's COVID Commander Jeroen Weimar confirmed on Monday morning a disability care worker had attended a residential disability site last week.
He did not reveal the site in question.
"They were infectious on the 9th and 10th of September, when they worked an overnight shift," Mr Weimar said.
"There's 10 primary close contacts. Of the four residents there, three have been vaccinated."
Mr Weimar said the worker was permitted to be in Ballarat at the time, but it served as a reminder for essential workers from Melbourne to be extra vigilant.
There are still no further exposure sites listed in Ballarat on the health department website.
See where all the exposure sites are here.
"For those authorised workers who are moving into regional settings, you are able to do so by the nature of your work but please be very careful for who you come in contact with," he said.
"The potential for you to be taking the infection from Melbourne into regional Victoria is significant, it is very real.
"It will be down to the strength of the workplace procedures and how you conduct yourself in regional Victoria as to whether you pass it on to other people."
Health minister Martin Foley said the worker was vaccinated, but could not confirm if they had received one or two doses.
Meanwhile, there were six new cases officially recorded in regional Victoria.
Three of the cases are in Geelong and the other three are in Mildura.
All six are primary close contacts.
The Melbourne worker at the disability care house in Ballarat does not count in this tally, as the worker lives in Melbourne.
Ballarat has not had a new COVID-19 case since August 24, 2020 and has been officially COVID-free since September 9, 2020.
There were no further cases detected in the Daylesford region following the confirmed case on Friday last week.
EARLIER: Victoria has recorded 473 new local COVID-19 cases, as case numbers continue to soar throughout the state.
Of the 473 new cases, 202 have been linked, meaning 271 are currently classed as mystery cases.
It is the highest daily figure that has been recorded in the state this year.
There is not yet any information on whether any deaths occurred.
There were 30,032 vaccinations administered and 49,037 tests received on Sunday.
Details and locations of the cases will be revealed later today.
The new figures come as COVID-19 continues to show greater signs of spreading into into the regions.
There were more than a dozen cases recorded in the regions over the weekend, including a confirmed case in Daylesford.
In Ballarat, there have been multiple detections of COVID-19 in the wastewater, with a warning going out the city is "more probable than possible" to have an active case.
Almost all regional trains have also been cancelled, with more than 300 V/Line staff in isolation due to an outbreak within staff.
Meanwhile, Victorians can expect to soon get a more detailed roadmap out of COVID-19 lockdown, as much-anticipated modelling inches closer to completion.
Premier Daniel Andrews has flagged the state government will receive detailed modelling from the Burnet Institute in coming days, before the "caveated" blueprint is laid out "in about a week's time".
The modelling will allow health authorities and ministers to formulate plans about what businesses can open and when, on the path to fully vaccinating 80 per cent of Victoria's eligible population.
The state government has previously announced a minor easing of restrictions when the state hits 70 per cent first-dose coverage, including an extra hour of outdoor activity and the expansion of the five-kilometre travel radius to 10km.
By Sunday, 66.2 per cent of the eligible Victorian population had received at least their first dose.
A plan to return students to classrooms, including upgrading ventilation in schools and staggered entry times, will form part of the more comprehensive roadmap.
Health authorities are currently investigating a significant outbreak at a Melbourne school, with The Age reporting its principal repeatedly flouted lockdown rules by inviting parents to send their children.
Deputy Chief Health Officer Dan O'Brien said the outbreak at the Fitzroy Community School in North Fitzroy had grown to at least 30 cases involving students and staff.
Children aged from 12 to 15 years will be able to get a Pfizer vaccination in Victoria from Monday.
Schools and COVID-hit areas are also preparing to welcome a series of pop-up vaccination hubs to boost coverage rates, with the program to begin over the next two weeks.
Of the 392 new cases reported on Sunday, 255 were from Melbourne's north and another 89 came from the western suburbs.
The federal government has embarked on a three-week vaccination blitz of the areas, sending an extra 417,000 Pfizer and Moderna doses to Victoria.

COVID facts under pressure: we need a reopening we can trust

Full text: Responding to pandemics is highly political. Is it possible that facts are being selectively reported and distorted to match political motivations?
The Doherty Institute's modelling suggested reopening from lockdown once vaccination reached 70 to 80 per cent, but that it would rely on low case numbers and excellent contact tracing to result in a low burden on the health system. We don't, however, have a modelled road map for patchy vaccination coverage (70 per cent of people aged 16 and over) with a high case load and ineffective contact tracing and isolation, all amid an already-burdened health system. Yet this is NSW's reality - and its reopening is planned for next month.
NSW Health has released ICU bed and hospitalisation modelling only for the hotspot local government areas. It is not clear why.
The Australian Medical Association, among the many worried, warns it is "concerned that the NSW government plan to start reopening lacks important detail and ignores warnings".
A NSW Health-commissioned study on Delta transmission in schools reported on 59 COVID-positive children who attended school while NSW was in lockdown with a 5 per cent school attendance rate. Yet the study's conclusions have been interpreted to suggest schools are safe for "reopening". Its release was seemingly well timed with the announcement of the reopening plan.
Just as the public debate around climate change is not only about the science, the public discussions and debate about COVID-19 are also about values, culture and ideology. Facts are under pressure. There are increasing calls for transparency around data and decision-making by NSW leaders as we march towards this new path out of the pandemic. Transparency builds trust. We need the public to align to the collective behaviour changes required to beat COVID-19, but the public needs to trust and mostly agree with the plan for it to work well.
We are living in an unprecedented fast-paced pandemic. Australia has been a global leader in terms of its public health response and its approach has saved many lives and livelihoods, and prevented likely hundreds of thousands, if not more, chronic conditions due to long-COVID. Let's keep up the stellar job, Australia!
But we are at a fork in the path regarding COVID-19. Data should be our compass, guiding us on which path to take. Unfortunately, in NSW, the feeling is that data are not being shared transparently, and are not being listened to by decision-makers.
In epidemiology we use the term "reporting bias". It includes time-lag bias and selective-reporting bias - suppressing some findings and sharing others - also known as "cherry-picking". It is a real threat, not only regarding COVID-19 but also the climate-change debate. Reporting bias can distort the full picture of scientific evidence. It can threaten credibility, and can also result in avoidable harm.
I have no reason to suggest the Doherty Institute is involved in any such behaviour. But I do fear our political decision-makers may be.
Every country needs a health system independent from politics. In Canada, Ontario's decision-makers have a Doherty equivalent - the Ontario Science Table. Recently, one of its leading epidemiologists resigned, alleging it was "withholding grim projections". He blamed political interference.
While data are withheld from the public here, it leads us to legitimate questions about the motivations. Globally, we know from research that selective reporting is most often caused by financial conflicts of interest. Without full disclosure of data, it is easier for vested interests to cherry-pick the "evidence" that suits them.
We also know from research that selectively informed people think things are more risky than they are. They over-generalise their perceptions of risk. For instance, parents fed data about transmission in schools during lockdown that proves incomplete might start to question and catastrophise the true situation. So selective government reporting could have the perverse effect of increasing COVID worries.
If we fail to report all scientific data, we risk either underestimating or overestimating the real dangers - or freedoms - in front of us. In a COVID vaccination study this year in Sydney and Melbourne, participants with high confidence in their government had greater willingness to receive the vaccine. We need the public to trust their governments. Transparency breeds trust.

Full text: NSW Health said there was no room left in hospitals
HEALTH authorities have reversed a decision directing aged care homes to look after Covid-positive residents on- site days after families were told there was no space left in hospital.
At least two facilities were told there were not enough beds for non-critical residents to be transferred into hospital care.
Authorities eventually found beds for the residents only after details leaked about the plan.
Aged care facilities were initially told to manage Covid cases on-site, including the Uniting Edinglassie Lodge in Penrith where nine residents tested positive to Covid last week.
In a statement on Friday, Uniting said seven residents had been transferred to hospital, but the facility was advised by NSW Health that no further clinically stable residents would be transferred.
By Monday, an “agreement” had been reached to transfer the remaining two residents to hospital, according to a Uniting statement.
Similarly, Advantaged Care’s Preston Lodge last week told families that NSW Health had told the facility that due to a shortage of hospital beds, five Covid-positive residents would need to be cared for on-site “while they remain stable”.
On Monday, the facility said arrangements had been made over the weekend to transfer all remaining positive patients to a private hospital.
“We have been advocating for the transfer of Covid positive residents for a long time and are in the process of doing that now,” a spokesman said.
Chief health officer Kerry Chant (inset) on Monday said decisions about transferring aged care residents with Covid to hospital was made by a “case-by-case assessment … (considering) what’s in the best interest of the facility”.
Sydney’s second wave is predicted to grow at a rate of up to 2500 cases per day by mid-September before daily case numbers begin to subside, according to modelling released yesterday by the state government.
It comes as new modelling predicted that up to 947 people will require intensive care treatment in hospital by the middle of October, with the numbers set to have an “overwhelming impact” on ICU operations.
Premier Gladys Berejiklian insisted that despite the increased load, “patients will receive all the care they need”.
“Anybody who needs that care will receive it.
“Our surge capacity, we estimate, is in excess of what we’ll need,” she said. The modelling considered daily case numbers up to August 23, meaning the data used is two weeks old.
Health authorities insisted that the current rate of infection is in line with what the modelling predicted.
Dr Chant on Monday expressed her hope that higher rates of vaccination could lead to better outcomes than modelled.
“I want to see us reach 80 per cent first dose (vaccine coverage) this week,” she said.
Meanwhile, the Premier revealed that she had quoted a “national figure” when she suggested that Delta’s hospitalisation rate was just 5.5 per cent. In reality, the hospitalisation rate in NSW was about twice that – with 11 per cent of Covid cases in NSW being hospitalised according to the latest available data.

Full text: COVID-19 cases in NSW will peak at a seven-day average of about 1500 in September and more than 550 COVID-positive patients will require an intensive care bed by early November, government modelling shows.
But daily infections are unlikely to top 2000 per day, the NSW Premier says, and the state's 1550-bed ICU surge capacity is expected to bear the load of admissions.
NSW reported 1281 new locally acquired cases of COVID-19 and five deaths in the 24 hours to 8pm on Sunday, taking the toll for the current outbreak to 131.
The five deaths recorded in the 24-hour reporting period include a man in his 90s, two women in their 80s, a man in his 60s and a woman in her 50s.
Modelling conducted by the Burnet Institute for NSW Health and published on Monday shows daily COVID-19 infections will increase until mid-September, with cases forecast to hit 1100 to 2000 per day.
Vaccine-acquired immunity along with the state's strict lockdown would then begin to bend the curve.
As cases accumulate, hospitalisations - COVID-related or otherwise - will peak at about 3400 in late October, with COVID-related ICU admissions hitting 560 in early November. Overall ICU occupancy could approach 950 beds.
But Premier Gladys Berejiklian said an intensive care surge capacity of 1550 beds - lower than the previously announced 2000-bed capacity - would likely hold up, even if patients needed to be transferred to distant hospitals.
She also warned that the modelling was predicated on several variables including compliance with lockdown and no super-spreading events. "You may be moved to a different hospital than the one closest to your home ... but the bottom line is anyone who needs care will receive it," Ms Berejiklian said.
"Our surge capacity, we estimate, is in excess of what we'll need."
"The biggest determinant of whether someone ends up in ICU is whether or not they're fully vaccinated and that's why every day, every week that goes past and our rates of vaccination increase, that puts less pressure on our system."
Ms Berejiklian has pledged to restore some freedoms for fully jabbed residents upon 70 per cent double-dose vaccination coverage, expected in mid-October.
There are 1071 COVID-19 patients in NSW in hospital, with 177 in intensive care and 67 on ventilators.
Nepean Hospital intensive care doctor Nhi Nguyen reiterated that staffing levels were the most important variable in intensive care, rather than beds or ventilators.
Intensive care training for nurses had been boosted throughout the pandemic, while other healthcare workers such as operating theatre nurses, emergency department nurses and coronary care nurses were also well trained, he said. Some 2000 nurses had been upskilled to work in intensive care.

She also warned that the modelling was predicated on several variables including compliance with lockdown and no super-spreading events. "You may be moved to a different hospital than the one closest to your home ... but the bottom line is anyone who needs care will receive it," Ms Berejiklian said.
"Our surge capacity, we estimate, is in excess of what we'll need."
"The biggest determinant of whether someone ends up in ICU is whether or not they're fully vaccinated and that's why every day, every week that goes past and our rates of vaccination increase, that puts less pressure on our system."
Ms Berejiklian has pledged to restore some freedoms for fully jabbed residents upon 70 per cent double-dose vaccination coverage, expected in mid-October.
There are 1071 COVID-19 patients in NSW in hospital, with 177 in intensive care and 67 on ventilators.
Nepean Hospital intensive care doctor Nhi Nguyen reiterated that staffing levels were the most important variable in intensive care, rather than beds or ventilators.
Intensive care training for nurses had been boosted throughout the pandemic, while other healthcare workers such as operating theatre nurses, emergency department nurses and coronary care nurses were also well trained, he said. Some 2000 nurses had been upskilled to work in intensive care.

Full text: ● FRANTIC TESTING AS SCHOOL, KINDY CLOSE ● PM: QLD MAY ISOLATE AS OTHER STATES OPEN A GIRL, 4, has tested positive to Covid-19, forcing the closure of a primary school, putting its community into quarantine and restrictions back on certain aged care facilities, hospitals and disability services.
The girl is a close contact of a Logan truckie, 46, who triggered an alert this week.
The child attended Boulevard Early Learning Centre at Mt Warren Park on Tuesday and Wednesday, with children, staff and visitors urged to get tested and quarantine at home with household members for two weeks, regardless of a negative result.
The centre is also used as after-school care for students of Windaroo State School, with all students, staff and visitors who attended the school from Tuesday to Friday to quarantine with their household members for 14 days.
In a letter last night, principal Alisha LeBrese said she had been liaising with authorities and the school would be shut from Saturday for 14 days.
“All school, school events and activities are closed and postponed until the quarantine period ends and we have advised that we can resume,” Ms LeBrese wrote.
A Covid-19 drive-through collection centre will operate at Eden’s Landing on September 4-5 to help test those affected. The situation has also forced authorities to reinstate visitor restrictions at aged care facilities, disability services and hospitals in the Logan council area.
Contact tracers were last night scrambling to contact those impacted, with more information to be provided on Saturday. It’s understood testing was being undertaken on Friday night with the results to determine whether another lockdown is required.
Meanwhile, Queensland would remain an isolated kingdom under a splintered approach to reopening under Covid, with Scott Morrison confirming there may be a future in which states including NSW open their international borders while other states remain cut off.
The Prime Minister set out the scenario after a fortnight of hesitation by Premier Annastacia Palaszczuk to remain committed to the national plan informed by Doherty Institute modelling of case numbers once vaccination levels reach 80 per cent and restrictions are relaxed, making it clear the nation wouldn’t wait.
But after loud criticism of her use of worst-case scenario modelling to highlight death numbers and concerns around sick children that haven’t been backed by medical professionals, Ms Palaszczuk backed a more “constructive debate” and finally apologised over her government’s decision to let in an NRL entourage while borders were closed to returning Queenslanders.
Three days after The Courier-Mail revealed exemptions had been granted for NRL families, and after days of criticism both in the community and in Queensland Parliament, the Premier conceded it wasn’t the right move.
“It was not the right thing to do when we had the pause (on hotel quarantine),” she said. “It shouldn’t have happened. Unfortunately, it did happen, and I extend my apologies to the public about that.” It came before the national cabinet meeting where further Doherty modelling, focused on reopening with current case numbers in NSW, was presented. Details of the updated modelling are expected to be made public next week.
It is understood there was further discussion about what public health measures can be removed once vaccination rates hit 70 and 80 per cent, but no decisions were made.
Earlier, Mr Morrison confirmed international borders would open for states that reached 80 per cent vaccination, if they wanted it, without waiting for other states.
“The national plan sets that out very clearly,” he said.
Under the national plan, all restrictions on outbound travel are lifted for vaccinated Australians and travel bubbles will be expanded to countries such as Singapore and the Pacific Islands, pending deal being struck, once 80 per cent vaccination is hit.
Queensland has the second lowest vaccination levels, at 32.9 per cent double doses and 51.6 per cent single doses.
Despite Ms Palaszczuk’s comments, Mr Morrison said all states and territories had agreed to the national plan.
“It doesn’t come without risks and it’s important it is done safely and it is a safe plan,” he said. “It sees a soft opening as you ease into a more broad opening when we hit 80 per cent.” Mr Morrison described the Premier’s comment that 2240 people would die every month if the nation opened up at 70 per cent as a “misreading” of the Doherty analysis and a “scenario where there is no ongoing vaccination, where there are virtually no public health, social measures in place and that’s not what the national plan indicated”.
ANNA’S HORRIBILIS: NOT PREMIER’S BEST WEEK Wednesday, August 25 The Courier-Mail reveals Queensland’s quarantine hotels are at capacity. Premier Annastacia Palaszczuk holds a press conference to announce a pause on hotel quarantine which comes into effect just hours later, locking out people in interstate hot spots from returning home or from relocating for 14 days.
Thursday, August 26 The Premier announces from Toowoomba that a regional quarantine centre will be built near the Wellcamp Airport. But the state government hadn’t sought a guarantee from the Commonwealth that international flights can land there. Nor had she told the Prime Minister.
Monday, August 30 The Courier-Mail reveals NRL players’ families and officials have flown into Queensland despite the pause on hotel quarantine.
Tuesday, August 31 The state government is slammed by the public and all sides of politics in a fiery parliamentary sitting, but defends the NRL decision, insisting the arrivals aren’t taking rooms off returning Queenslanders. Ms Palaszczuk announces boarding school students will be allowed to quarantine at home now Wednesday, September 1 The Premier declared the fate of children was “the most serious issue that our country will face” and opening up would be exposing the most vulnerable. Meanwhile, one week after announcing a pause on hotel quarantine, Ms Palaszczuk announces 50 rooms would become available on Saturday for returning Queenslanders. Deputy Premier Steven Miles concedes he understands the frustration of the NRL exemption.
Thursday, September 2 The Courier-Mail reveals threeyear-old Memphis is stuck with his grandparents in NSW because of the hotel quarantine pause. Meanwhile the Premier uses worst-case scenario Doherty Institute modelling that shows with 70 per cent of the population vaccinated, 80 people would die each day from Covid-19. Chief health officer Jeannette Young defends the Premier’s comments and the NRL exemption.
Friday, September 3 The Premier apologises over the NRL exemption, saying it wasn’t the right decision. She announces 680 hotel quarantine rooms will come online from Monday. She also calls for a national conversation around the plan out of Covid19. An emotional Dr Young denies making political decisions.

Worsening COVID week as leaders argue over vaccination triggers to end lockdowns

Full text: YESTERDAY'S round of COVID media conferences by Prime Minister Scott Morrison and the various state and territory leaders revolved around the equation at the heart of an Australian coronavirus recovery: that case numbers can be - and should be - suppressed until modelled vaccination targets are reached.
NSW Premier Gladys Berejiklian was again the bearer of unwanted news.
The state had 1431 new cases, more than 10 per cent above the previous peak.
COVID HERE:
Chief psychiatrist says 'talk to your kids about lockdown stress' 'So sorry': COVID positive Sydney tree lopper in John Hunter Hospital Lockdown fines in the Hunter Mandalong colliery hit with positive worker COVID snapshot As they do daily, the premier and her team hammered home the importance of vaccination as the key to ending the groundhog day grind of lockdown.
The premier - and other leaders, no doubt - will have access to modelling that the rest of us cannot see.
Ms Berejiklian spent time yesterday preparing NSW for further increases in case numbers, saying it may be another fortnight before they peak.
The hope is that vaccination rates rise quickly enough to drive down the infection rate.
Falling case numbers would pave the way for the lifting of restrictions and the start of whatever "new normal" will look like in a world where "living with Delta" is a seemingly unavoidable reality.
Mr Morrison had good news, in the form of a Pfizer vaccine swap with the UK.
Australia will receive the first batch, from a total of four million jabs, almost immediately.
The same number of shots, which would have come here, but later on, will now be added to the UK's stockpile for booster shots.
Such protection will likely be offered here, with Ms Berejiklian yesterday predicting that an annual COVID booster will be as commonplace as a winter flu shot.
The NSW government might be eyeing reopening, but elsewhere - particularly in Queensland and Western Australia - the emphasis remains on closed borders to keep the virus out.
GLOBAL COVID:
NZ outbreak easing with 28 new cases North Korea rejecting UN vaccines Latest worldwide coronavirus picture EU and AstraZeneca settle vaccine legal row NZ police chase COVID absconder The ACT chief minister Andrew Barr was also on the front foot yesterday, adamant that updated Doherty Institute modelling showed it would take an 80 per cent vaccination total, if not higher, before lockdowns could safely end.
Deputy Premier John Barilaro said yesterday that any region still in lockdown beyond next Friday would remain so until NSW vaccination rates hit 70 per cent.
That predicted date is October 18.
Such an extension may well include the Hunter.
Another reason to get the jab if you haven't already.

Palaszczuk ploy is just playing with numbers

Full text: Only someone intent on scaring people would take to social media and distort medical evidence with a claim about thousands of deaths.
Political leaders usually leave the tactic for anonymous accounts on social media or, at worst, rogue backbenchers.
But Queensland Premier Annastacia Palaszczuk went out of her way yesterday to mislead people and the ploy tells everyone the national cabinet plan to open the country is "national" in name only.
Every state has its own idea of what it means to ease restrictions when the vaccination rate climbs to 70 and 80 per cent of people aged 16 and over. Prime Minister Scott Morrison conceded this, on some issues at least, when Labor asked him about state border controls this week. "Ultimately, everything is a state matter," he told Parliament.
Palaszczuk is so determined to go her own way that she bent the Doherty Institute medical advice the plan is based on to suit her needs.
"Doherty Institute modelling predicts, even with 70 per cent of the population vaccinated, 80 people will die each day six months after the outbreak," she tweeted yesterday. "That's 2240 who will die each month."
There was no link to the source and no quotation from the report saying 2240 would die each month - because there was no such finding. Only those who went hunting could find a chart that made it look like the scenario might be true.
But the number was Palaszczuk's extrapolation, not the Doherty Institute's conclusion.
One chart in the report, Figure 3.3 on page 17, shows an increase in deaths at a 70 per cent vaccination rate, assuming only baseline restrictions and partial testing, tracing, isolation and quarantine. It does not show what happens after 180 days.
In other words, Palaszczuk engineered her own worst-case scenario. But it is her claim, not the work of others.
The actual finding from the Doherty Institute is different. "In the COVID-19 modelling, opening up at 70 per cent vaccine coverage of the adult population with partial public health measures, we predict 385,983 symptomatic cases and 1457 deaths over six months," the institute said only last week.
"With optimal public health measures (and no lockdowns), this can be significantly reduced to 2737 infections and 13 deaths."
Even the worst of those two options means deaths would be about one-tenth the number Palaszczuk claimed. Another chart in the Doherty modelling, assuming "optimal" rather than "partial" protections, also predicts lower deaths. Rather than say the modelling was wrong, Palaszczuk dreamt up her own number.
This makes Palaszczuk an outlier in a significant week for pandemic policy. Victorian Premier Daniel Andrews made a necessary shift this week by admitting the Delta variant has changed everything. "We will not see these numbers go down," he said.
The elimination illusion is over.

Queensland Premier says thousands will die each month if borders open

Full text: The Queensland Premier has been blasted by the Morrison government this week over her refusal to agree to a plan to open borders.
National cabinet was presented with modelling from the Doherty Institute recently which advised lockdowns and enforced border closures would no longer be needed when jab protection reaches a specific threshold.
But Ms Palaszczuk continues to defy instructions from federal counterparts, infuriating many senior Morrison government cabinet figures.
On Thursday, the Premier fired off a number of tweets as she stood in state parliament and furiously defended her position.
“If NSW is the model of what lies in store for all of us, then serious discussions are needed,” Ms Palaszczuk tweeted.
“Doherty Institute modelling predicts, even with 70 per cent of the population vaccinated, 80 people will die each day six months after the outbreak.
“That’s 2,240 who will die each month.”
A steady stream of senior federal cabinet ministers tore into the Premier after she raised concerns on Wednesday about the need to vaccinate children, creating a new barrier to open borders.
Ms Palaszczuk also told parliament she wants more research into the impacts of Covid-19 on children and for this risk to be considered in the modelling.
“Unless there is an answer on how these young people are going to be vaccinated, you are putting this most vulnerable population at risk,” she said.
“You open up this state and you let the virus in here, every child under 12 is vulnerable.”
Home Affairs Minister accused the Premier of “scaremongering” while Federal Treasurer Josh Frydenberg continued the assault on the state leader on Thursday.
“It‘s a desperate denial of the reality and is not based on the medical advice,” he told Sunrise.
“The medical advice is that we should vaccinated people aged 12 to 15 – which we’re doing.”

Full text: Queensland Premier Annastacia Palaszczuk has cast new doubt on whether her state will follow the national road map out of the pandemic, declaring border restrictions won’t lift until children have been vaccinated.
Ms Palaszczuk’s comments came as West Australian Premier Mark McGowan warned he could keep borders with NSW and Victoria closed for months, accusing the commonwealth of trying to “infect the public” by pressuring states to lift the restrictions.
The intensifying row – after ­Attorney-General Michaelia Cash told The Australian that legal ­arguments upholding the constitutionality of state border closures would weaken once Australia hit 80 per cent vaccination coverage – could leave the nation split until well into next year.
“Until I can get every child vaccinated, we will stand firm and we will stand strong (on border ­closures),” Ms Palaszczuk said.
Victorian Premier Daniel ­Andrews on Wednesday conceded his state would not be able to eradicate Covid-19, instead outlining a plan to ease restrictions starting on September 23, when 70 per cent of adults are expected to have received their first vaccination.
But further restrictions – including stay-at-home orders and curfews – may not be lifted until Victoria reaches 70 or 80 per cent full vaccination coverage, currently forecast for November.
“We have thrown everything at this, but it is now clear to us that we are not going to drive these numbers down; they’re instead going to increase,” Mr Andrews said.
“Now it’s up to us to make sure they don’t increase too fast and they don’t increase too much, relative to the number of people who are getting vaccinated.” Victoria recorded 112 cases on Wednesday; NSW, where Premier Gladys Berejiklian will begin easing restrictions for fully vaccinated adults on September 13, recorded 1116 new Covid-19 infections.
Some 70 per cent of those cases – and all four of the deaths recorded on Wednesday – were from Sydney’s western and southwestern suburbs. There are now 917 people in NSW hospitals.
The growing number of Covid-19 case in NSW and Victoria has alarmed Mr McGowan and Ms Palaszczuk, who on Wednesday cast doubt on the Doherty ­Institute modelling that underpins national cabinet’s plan out of the pandemic.
That modelling recommends restrictions ease when 70 per cent of the adult population is vaccinated. Lockdowns would stop when vaccine coverage hit 80 per cent.
Ms Palaszczuk said the modelling had failed to take into account cases among children.
“It is a fundamental question that is omitted from any modelling,” she said. “It is omitted from any plan and every single Queenslanders must be included in that plan. I want to see a paper, I don’t want to see a slide show, I want to see detailed information.
“You open up this state and you let the virus in here and every child under 12 is vulnerable.” Commonwealth officials have previously noted a lack of vaccination programs for children under 12 overseas, while public health academics say serious illnesses in this age group are rare.
Mr McGowan reacted ­furiously to Senator Cash’s comment questioning the constitutionality of state border closures as vaccination rates rose. The hard border had the support of the community and his state’s businesses, Mr McGowan said.
“Why are they on this mission to bring Covid into Western Australia to infect our public, to ensure that we shut down parts of the economy, that we lose jobs, people get sick and some people die?” he added.
“Haven’t they seen what’s happening in NSW.” While Senator Cash re­affirmed the government’s position was not to take court action against state border closures or jeopardise the four-step national plan, there were expectations billionaire Clive Palmer or others could make another attempt to overturn borders closures through the courts.
Despite outlining a path out of Covid-19 restrictions, Mr Andrews left open the possibility of keeping Victoria’s borders with NSW shut until next year.
In response to a question on whether the border could remain shut well into 2022, Mr ­Andrews said: “Yep, and no one’s happy about that but again we’ll have many more options when we get to 80 per cent.” Ms Berejiklian seized on Senator Cash’s legal analysis and said the commonwealth could look at stopping state border closures.
“I understand there are sections in the Australian Constitution which allow the common­wealth to look at those matters. I hope it does not come to that,” she told the Seven Network Josh Frydenberg called on state leaders to stick to the ­national road map out of the ­pandemic.
“When it comes to kids, we’ve got to be very conscious of what the medical experts tell us about the impact on children … they found that the virus … was much less ­severe in children then it is an older cohorts,” the Treasurer said. Just under 60 per cent of adults across the country have had one dose of the vaccine, while 35.7 per cent have had both.

Full text: State and territory leaders signed up to a path to freedom in July, based on 70 to 80 per cent of the eligible population being fully vaccinated.
The Doherty Institute, whose modelling underpins the national plan to freedom, has advised reopening the country would be safe once Australia reaches its vaccination target, even with large numbers of new infections.
But Ms Palaszczuk is not satisfied with modelling on how unvaccinated children would fare when Delta cases spread north from NSW.
Stranded Queensland resident Marcus Fretwell says Queenslanders who are “just trying to get home” are getting “no support” from the state government amid the two- week ban on hotel quarantine.
“It is a fundamental question that is omitted from any modelling, it is omitted from any plan and every single Queenslanders must be included in that plan,” she said.
“I want to see a paper, I don’t want to see a slide show, I want to see detailed information,” she said.
“You open up this state and you let the virus in here and every child under 12 is vulnerable, every single child.”
Ms Palaszczuk said she would “stand strong” on borders “until I can get every child vaccinated”.
“I honestly believe that we need to have further research done on what happens to the 0 to 12-year-old cohort as they remain unvaccinated,” she said.
“The plan has now moved to vaccinate high school students, which I fully support.”
During Question Time, LNP frontbencher Deb Frecklington asked whether Covid restrictions would remain until 100 per cent of the population was double vaccinated.
Ms Palaszczuk again said she wanted medical advice on how children would be affected.
“If you are going to let the virus in and rip through, obviously because that is what the opposition wants to happen, what’s going to happen to the children?” she said.
“I want to know what is going to happen to the children of this state.”
Federal Attorney-General Michaelia Cash this morning warned state governments that their constitutional power to shut borders would diminish once Australia reached an 80 per cent vaccination rate.

Full text: Senator Cash said the legal ­arguments that led the High Court to block billionaire Clive Palmer’s push to tear down the West Australian border were shifting, as a coalition of the nation’s largest employers urged governments to work together to ease restrictions once 70 to 80 per cent of Australians were jabbed.
West Australian Premier Mark McGowan on Tuesday argued that he had to keep the option to close borders — even when the rest of the nation hit the 80 per cent vaccine threshold — as ­“hundreds of people (would) die” if he introduced the Delta strain into his state.
The High Court ruled last ­November that Mr McGowan’s state border closure was proportionate due to public health reasons. Chief Justice Susan Kiefel and Justice Patrick Keane singled out the lack of Covid-19 vaccines and treatments at the time.
Senator Cash — the most senior West Australian in the Morrison government — told The Australian it would be much harder for states to defend a hard border closure as reasonable and necessary by the time 80 per cent of Australian adults were vaccinated. “Once you hit 80 per cent, you are in a fundamentally different position if you are looking at the issue of proportionality,” Senator Cash said.
“When you look at the reasons for that decision, flowing from the Clive Palmer vs WA case, the issue of proportionality was a live issue … we did not know where the virus was going, it was considered a proportional response to Covid-19.
“We now have the benefits of 12 months or thereabouts, but we also have the benefit of the vaccine. Now that can only be tested in the High Court, obviously, but based on the reasons for that decision in that initial case, and based on where we are now in relation to the vaccine and vaccination rates, one would now think the grounds of any argument has now shifted.”
Senator Cash said the government was not considering court action and would do nothing to jeopardise the four-step national plan, but there were expectations Mr Palmer or others could make another attempt to overturn state border closures through the courts.
The Attorney-General’s comments came as Australia’s largest employers – including the banks, telcos, airlines and grocery chains – threw their support behind the national cabinet plan, penning an open letter in The Australian and other newspapers backing the 70 and 80 per cent vaccine targets and phasing out lockdowns.
Signed by chief executives from 80 of the nation’s biggest companies, the letter says Australia must “open up society and live with the virus in the same way that other countries have done”.
“We need to stay the course,” it says. “Informed by modelling from the Doherty Institute, it (the national plan) balances the risks from Covid in a more vaccinated population, with the risks of indefinitely keeping our country divided and cut off from the world, our children out of schools, our friends apart from loved ones, and our small businesses closed.
“We ask governments to work together to implement the national plan and chart a path out of the current lockdowns. Providing a light at the end of the tunnel will encourage more Australians to get vaccinated. We need to give people something to hope for.”
The open letter was signed by companies employing almost one million Australians, including the Commonwealth Bank, NAB, Qantas, Telstra, Optus, AGL, Woolworths, Coles, Uber, BHP and Origin.
The campaign, led by the Business Council of Australia, comes after Josh Frydenberg called on the private sector to “beat the drum” and put pressure on wavering states and territories and as Scott Morrison on Tuesday conceded it was a matter for the states when to drop hard border restrictions. “Ultimately everything is a state matter,” the Prime Minister said. “It all ­depends where their vaccination levels have risen to. So, if you have NSW or Tasmania … well above 70 per cent, and you have other states that are below 70 per cent, well, the national plan doesn’t provide for them to move into Phase B (of the national plan). It’s all a matter of where they’re at any given time.”
Sky News Political Editor Andrew Clennell says it’s clear one of the reasons WA Premier Mark McGowan is maintaining such a hard border policy, is the doubts that his hospital system could cope with an outbreak.
The Morrison government came under attack from Mr McGowan and federal Labor last year when then-attorney-general Christian Porter intervened in Mr Palmer’s High Court case. Mr Morrison made the call to withdraw the commonwealth from the stoush.
Senator Cash said she hoped to work with state governments when the vaccine thresholds were passed, making any legal fights over state borders unnecessary.
“My preference is very much to work with the state of Western Australia,” she said.
“We’re not at 70 per cent. We’re not at 80 per cent. So those considerations are not on the table. Let’s get to 70 per cent. Let’s get to 80 per cent.”
Senator Cash said WA could not relax its border measures at the 70 per cent interval due to its lack of Covid-19 community transmission, but said the 80 per cent vaccine threshold would have to change the strategy of the Labor McGowan government.
“The issue we are now confronted with as a state is if not at 80 per cent, when?” she said.
“Most West Australians would say it’s great for the rest of the country to open up at 70 per cent but they are still going to be behind WA … Once you move to 80 per cent though, you’re playing on a different field.”
Mr McGowan and Queensland Labor Premier Annastacia Palaszczuk, Tasmanian Liberal Premier Peter Gutwein and South Australian Liberal Premier Steven Marshall have all voiced concerns about the consequences of opening up when their states are still relatively Covid-19 free.
Mr McGowan said on Facebook on Tuesday that his state border regime might need to exist for “a few months” before he was willing to see Covid-19 introduced back into WA.
“When it is safe to do so we will open the borders — when an overwhelming majority of our population has been vaccinated,” Mr McGowan wrote.
“We will get there — it might only be a difference of a few months — but in the meantime, it’s worth trying to keep Covid out for as long as we can.”
Sky News host Peter Gleeson says granting exemptions to the "NRL entourage" is causing “angst” in Queensland.

Full text: The strength of state and territory public health measures will define the amount of Covid cases and deaths within 180 days of opening after Australia hits the 80 per cent adult vaccination rate.
Prime Minister Scott Morrison, Opposition Leader Anthony ­Albanese and premiers have spent the past week battling over their differing interpretations of the national plan to ­reopen and the Doherty Institute epidemiological modelling that underpins its recommended vaccine thresholds.
Mr Albanese has backed West Australian Premier Mark McGowan’s insistence that he is free to close borders at an 80 per cent vaccination rate, with the national plan failing to provide explicit guidance on state ­borders.
State and territory leaders have questioned whether the plan is out-of-date because the Doherty modelling was done ­before NSW recorded more than 1000 cases a day.
While the Doherty Institute has said the difference between minimal cases and hundreds of cases does not shift its current vaccine thresholds, it does provide scenarios where testing, tracing, quarantine and isolations (TTIQ) of cases are not “optimal”.
There have been concerns the current outbreaks could swamp testing and tracing in NSW and Victoria, and health systems in untouched areas such as Perth would struggle to cope with the Delta variant.
Under an only partially effective testing and tracing regime, Australia would experience 227,702 Covid-19 symptomatic infections and 761 deaths in the first 180 days of opening under an 80 per cent adult vaccination rate.
On the other hand, the nation would record only 1149 Covid-19 cases and six deaths in those same 180 days with the same vaccination rate if better testing, tracing and isolating efforts were put in place.
If the nation were to start opening at a 70 per cent vaccination rate – currently the threshold to move into phase B of the national plan – with only a partial TTIQ regime, Australia would suffer more than 300,000 cases and 1457 deaths in the first 180 days.
Even with an optimal TTIQ system in the states and territories, the Doherty modelling projects more than 2000 cases and 18 deaths when opening at a 70 per cent vaccination rate.
Premiers and chief ministers have been moving away from the 70 per cent vaccination rate in the past days, and ACT Chief Minister Andrew Barr said the phase B threshold was not safe.
“There’s all this commentary from people who obviously haven’t read the national plan,” Mr Barr said on Monday.
“Let’s stop talking about 70 because it’s not safe at 70 … there’s this glossing over in the debate of 70 to 80, but 80 is the more realistic step.” The national plan says in phase C that vaccinated Australians should be exempt from all domestic restrictions and there should be minimal baseline ­restrictions.
In the Doherty modelling, baseline restrictions are defined – based on past use in the pandemic – as allowing interstate travel. But the national plan, even in the final phase, makes mention only of international borders and not state borders.

Full text: The strength of state and territory public health measures will define the amount of Covid cases and deaths within 180 days of opening after Australia hits the 80 per cent adult vaccination rate.
Prime Minister Scott Morrison, Opposition Leader Anthony ­Albanese and premiers have spent the past week battling over their differing interpretations of the national plan to ­reopen and the Doherty Institute epidemiological modelling that underpins its recommended vaccine thresholds.
Mr Albanese has backed West Australian Premier Mark McGowan’s insistence that he is free to close borders at an 80 per cent vaccination rate, with the national plan failing to provide explicit guidance on state ­borders.
State and territory leaders have questioned whether the plan is out-of-date because the Doherty modelling was done ­before NSW recorded more than 1000 cases a day.
While the Doherty Institute has said the difference between minimal cases and hundreds of cases does not shift its current vaccine thresholds, it does provide scenarios where testing, tracing, quarantine and isolations (TTIQ) of cases are not “optimal”.
There have been concerns the current outbreaks could swamp testing and tracing in NSW and Victoria, and health systems in untouched areas such as Perth would struggle to cope with the Delta variant.
Under an only partially effective testing and tracing regime, Australia would experience 227,702 Covid-19 symptomatic infections and 761 deaths in the first 180 days of opening under an 80 per cent adult vaccination rate.

If the nation were to start opening at a 70 per cent vaccination rate – currently the threshold to move into phase B of the national plan – with only a partial TTIQ regime, Australia would suffer more than 300,000 cases and 1457 deaths in the first 180 days.

National COVID plan could see state suffer

Full text: Grave concerns have emerged over how Tasmania is placed to cope with the eventuality of borders reopening when COVID-19 vaccination rates across the country reach 70 to 80 per cent.
Health groups the Australian Medical Association and the Australian Nursing and Midwifery Federation expressed their concern that an over-reliance on a National Plan for COVID-19 could see an already under-the-pump state health system left decimated.
National Cabinet last week went into detail about the availability of ventilators and intensive care unit capacity throughout Australia.
Prime Minister Scott Morrison said, following the meeting, more work would be done on assessing health system capacities around the country. He said the work would target the "health and hospital system capacity and workforce needs to address expected demands under the National Plan".
The Doherty Institute's report itself outlined how more work needed to be done to transfer its projections across state borders. As it drew conclusions from particular populations, it freely conceded change in the projections would occur in differing regions.
"We will consider the way in which state-based differences may require tailored adaptation of the national strategy," it said.
Speaking to media in the wake of the latest National Cabinet meeting Premier Peter Gutwein remained defiant in the face of the National Plan. "I will never cede away the state's responsibility to act should we need to act," he said. The Premier's reluctance to entirely endorse the National Plan was echoed by the AMA and the ANMF, who said Tasmania's health system was not relevant to the plan's modelling.
The modelling revealed across the state there were 41 Intensive Care Unit beds, while dashboard data showed 11,007 patients waiting for surgery and 1033 of them classified as needing surgery within 30 days.
And AMA Tasmanian spokeswoman Dr Annette Barratt said the organisation was worried about how the state would cope with Delta cases indicated by the modelling, when considering the situation it was already in.
"The government has announced plans to cope with the inevitable Delta case in Tasmania, but we are concerned that our already stretched and exhausted health system may not be able to cope," she said. "The opening of our borders will need to be staged in such a way as to minimise the risk while continuing to have plans in place to prevent state-wide transmission. Uncontrolled outbreaks ... pose a major threat."
Similarly, Australian Nursing and Midwifery Federation Tasmania secretary Emily Shepherd said in a federal meeting last week fears were expressed about the federal government's reliance on the modelling.
"If we're suggesting if we reach 80 per cent, are are accepting that 20 per cent of Tasmania's population could contract COVID-19, are we absolutely positive the health system is going to be able to respond? Realistically, the answer to that is no," she said. The concerns of both the AMA and ANMF carried through to the capacity of the Tasmanian health system to respond specifically to COVID-19 - with ventilators, ICU surge capacity and staffing expertise.
Information from the state government showed there were 267 ventilators currently in the state, with 100 more set to arrive, supplied by the federal government.
Dr Barratt questioned whether the surge planning in place - a potential 367 ventilators and 114 ICU beds - in Tasmania would be able to cope with an outbreak.
"We have sufficient ventilators, but insufficient staff trained to man them without putting other areas at risk if the outbreak was state-wide," she said.
Ms Shepherd said recently up-skilled workers operating without on the ground experience would add to current staffing shortages, meaning patients would need to prioritised and care outside of COVID-19 wards would likely be compromised.
A Tasmanian government health spokesperson said across the Tasmanian Critical Care Network there was confidence the state could respond to a potential surge in virus cases if required.
"There are several strategies in place to increase ICU capacity state-wide quickly if the need arises," they said.
"We are confident staffing levels would be appropriate in the case of a surge." The spokesperson was asked how many ICU trained nurses were enlisted in the Tasmanian Health Service, but they did not answer.

Albanese gets the short end of stick from Bill

Full text: The Opposition Leader had hoped to side with breakaway premiers by throwing mud at the Doherty Institute’s targets for lifting restrictions. He’d been working up to such a stance for weeks.
The intent wasn’t to undermine the reputation of the institute. Throwing doubt on the modelling – indeed, claiming that the advice from the institute was changing, with material implications for how and when we open up – was all about making political life that little bit harder for Scott Morrison, feeding into the problems the Prime Minister has had controlling the agenda recent­ly.
Then former Labor leader Bill Shorten entered the fray, siding with Morrison and the plan originally agreed to at national cabinet. The news landed with a thud on Wednesday, with those close to Albanese privately accusing Shorten of deliberately playing the role of wrecker. Shorten supporters weren’t going to let that criticism go unanswered, reminding anyone who would listen that Albanese wasn’t exactly Shorten’s most loyal lieutenant during the six years the latter led the party.
With some of the premiers having attempted to crab-walk away from national cabinet’s staged targets for opening back up – yes, Mark McGowan, we are looking at you – Albanese hoped to be the beneficiary of such parochialism by egging on the contrarianism. But once Shorten belled the cat, doing so would have divided the federal opposition more than it would the relationship between Morrison and the premiers.
Albanese was forced to retreat, all the while claiming he wasn’t retreating. Of course the federal opposition supports the reopening plan agreed to at national cabinet.
Albanese had hoped to be able to continue to box Morrison into a corner on what happens next in dealing with Covid, but instead he was outflanked. Yes by Morrison (armed with focus group research on community attitudes showing a shift is under way), but also by Shorten (who still has a leadership baton in his backpack, as Kevin Rudd used to say).
Make no mistake, Shorten is coming for Albanese. He may not be able to seize the leadership this side of the next election or after. But he is happy to use his authority as a former leader to stir trouble when he believes he’ll be on the right side of history eventually. This was one of those moments.
Either way, Shorten forced Albanese explicitly to back the national plan, and thus back the Prime Minister. Maybe we really are all in this together.
Shorten did so despite Albanese starting the parliamentary week casting doubt on the modelling and the consequences of opening up later this year.
A week is a long time in politics after all. Of course, there is a long way to go until election day, the timing of which is at the Prime Minister’s discretion. By the time election day does roll around, any Australian who wants to be vaccinated will be. Those who aren’t won’t be able to blame the government. There will have been ample vaccinations available for long enough, such that few can reasonably complain that opening the economy up isn’t fair.
That will be the climate in which the next election campaign will be fought. Because of the furore inside Labor this week, including the backdown by Albanese, Morrison will point out Albanese wanted to keep fully vaccinated Australians wrapped in cotton wool, long after the botched vaccination rollout had been fixed.
But that is a lesser of evils for Albanese compared with sticking to his guns arguing against opening things up, only to be left stranded when community sentiment shifts. Assuming that does happen – as both Morrison and Shorten are convinced it will – Albanese really should thank Shorten for the valuable service he performed this week. Messy, yes. Awkward, no doubt. Humiliating, maybe. But necessary to save Albanese from himself? Absolutely.
Most Australians do not live on taxpayer-funded salaries, guaranteed whether we are in lockdown or not, with a generous super scheme they know will get them by no matter what. They are nervous about their economic future, the mental health of their children; indeed, their own mental health. The health risks remain real but, once they are vaccinated, people aim to be hopeful. Hence Australians are rapidly shifting their thinking, wanting restrictions lifted so they can get on with their lives in a world of Covid.
Albanese has cleverly avoided Sydney since parliament rose for the winter recess, allowing him to campaign around much of the country. He therefore hasn’t experienced the Sydney lockdown. It has left a blind spot.
While people are angry and frustrated with the failures of a slow lockdown in Sydney and a botched vaccine rollout nationally, the only thing that would make these failures even worse would be if once fully vaccinated we still weren’t let out of our cages. That was Albanese’s emerging position before Shorten intervened.
On another topic, the debacle that has been our withdrawal from Afghanistan continues to worsen. We now know many of the locals who helped us while Australian troops were deployed will not secure asylum on our shores. Some will eke out an existence under Taliban rule, others will be killed.
Morrison likes to erode the uniqueness of the welcome to country for Indigenous Australians by including a thanks to those who have served in our armed forces. I could tolerate the departure from custom if such platitudes were supported by something substantial.
For a long time our military personnel had been warning the government it needed to act with haste to secure safe passage for Afghans who supported us. They were ignored. As Morrison has said, we knew that once US troops left, the Afghan army would capitulate to the Taliban soon enough. Why then were we too late? There are no excuses.
Whatever your view on the war in Afghanistan, the manner in which we have left has been handled badly.

Full text: Queensland Premier, Annastacia Palaszczuk:
I’m here with the deputy premier, the chief health officer, the health minister and also with our good friends John Wagner and the Wagner family to talk about a really important issue for Queenslanders.
Now we all know that our hotels were not built to deal with the Delta strain of this virus. In fact what’s happening in New South Wales and Victoria is a direct result of the delta strain coming in and essentially breaching hotel quarantine.
So we need regional quarantine facilities. I have been advocating this for a long, long time. It is a no-brainer.
People across Queensland come up to me and they say to me ‘We agree with you. We don’t need people being in hotels we need them in regional facilities’.
How do we know they work? Well look at Howard Springs. Howard Springs has been a brilliant example.
You’ve seen our Olympians come back and stay there. It’s spread out, there’s fresh air for people, people don’t have to stay in rooms without balconies.
I’ve done hotel quarantine myself. There is a constant flow of people coming up and down in the lifts. Our hotels were not meant to be the last line of defence to deal with a global pandemic.
Now we have agreed with the Commonwealth about Pinkenba. So we’ve got that agreement and the Commonwealth is building that facility.
Well, today I’m pleased to announce that my government has reached agreement with John Wagner and the facility in Toowoomba will be built.
Our cabinet has given the go ahead and as you can see right behind us, construction is underway today.
This is going to be a great boost for our defence against the delta virus in this country, and in fact, I believe we need regional facilities right across the country.
We are going to be dealing with delta for quite some time and if we want to open Australia up, we want to open our states up, regional quarantine facilities are the second part of the answer.
The first part of the answer is vaccine. So I need the vaccine rollout and we need to make sure we have quarantine regional facilities, away from our densely populated cities that can spread the virus as rapidly as we’ve seen happen, unfortunately, in New South Wales and of course in Victoria.
So the deputy premier will go through a few more details. It will be a 1000 bed capacity.
In fact, I’ve been calling for this since January. It could have been built by now but we are going to have this facility starting to be up and running by the end of the year, with 500 beds and a thousand bed capacity by the first quarter of next year.
I know the Wagner family and I know John, and when John says he’s going to get things done he gets things done. And you can see by the fact it’s starting today is a commitment by his family and a commitment to the people of this state.
This is a commitment by the Wagner family working with the Queensland government to say to the people of Queensland ‘We want to keep you safe’.
And the best way to keep you safe and to keep delta out of Queensland is to build as quickly as possible a regional quarantine facility, and as soon as that regional quarantine family is built, we are ready to put it to use.
Deputy Premier Steven Miles:
Well you can see behind us what we’ve been saying all year, that we have the perfect location for a regional quarantine accommodation facility.
It is buffered from the community, it is a greenfield location but ready for construction. In fact, early works are underway as we speak, and it is adjacent to an airport.
It will be the first facility, after Howard Springs, to be completed and be accommodating returning travellers.
The talk about this facility has gone for too long. And the premier gave me a very clear instruction to get it going, make it happen and that’s what we’re announcing today.
Five hundred beds will be online by the end of the year growing to 1000 by the end of first quarter next year.
That will be added to then by the Commonwealth governments Pinkenba facility, another 1000 beds, by around the middle of the year. As you’ve heard, our hotel quarantine capacity is currently stretched with more than 5000 people and that just underlines the need for us to have facilities like this.
We do that hope flights will be able to land here at the adjacent airport. The media that travelled with me will have seen just how convenient that airport is. We would expect that once the facility is built we will have support to be able to do that.
We do know that airlines and crew are happy to fly in here and we do hope that once its built, and the heat is out of the issue, the Commonwealth would support that.
But, if not, we currently bus arriving travellers from Brisbane to hotel quarantine accommodation on the Gold and Sunshine Coasts and so that would remain an option to get people here safely.
The design and operation would be closely modelled on the very successful Howard Springs facility. It will be purpose built based on the learnings from that facility, therefore the infection control can keep our staff, the other people in the facility as well as the local community safe, in fact much, much safer than non-purpose built hotel quarantine accommodation where we currently have people.
There will be a mix of single, double and family accommodation in cabin-style with balconies, and importantly, no hallways adjoining rooms which we have seen as vectors in hotel quarantine for the virus.
While we continue to work through the details of the health and policing model that will be implemented here, Covid-positive patients who require hospital care will be treated in one of the five Covid hospitals that we currently use, that we currently transfer people to.
By funding this facility ourselves and building this facility ourselves we can ensure that it replaces current hotel quarantine usage that will allow us to take travellers who are currently within the cap and put them into this facility, reducing the need for hotel quarantine.
I want to add to what the premier said about the Wagner’s and particularly john Wagner’s support for this facility. They really do care about the Queensland community and see this as one way they can support the community and help us in the effort to address Covid-19 and we certainly welcome that.
There have been times throughout this process where it would have been easier for them to walk away, but they haven’t. They’ve continued to work with us and now we’ve achieved this very important milestone.
The financing arrangement will be commercial and confidence but I can confirm that we have an initial one year lease with options to extend that for two and three years. When you consider that the last lockdown alone cost more than a billion dollars in economic impact and compensation you can see just what fantastic value it will be if we can avoid just one lockdown, let alone more, with this new facility so the work has started now.
It’s time for the politics to end. The facility will be built. It will be a purpose built facility, it will provide a great service to the Queensland community and, as the premier says, we actually need more of these facilities.
John Wagner, Non-Executive Director and co-founder of Wagners, a Toowoomba-based construction materials and services provider:
Thank you premier and deputy premier. First of all I would like to thank the Queensland government for having the confidence in us to go ahead with this facility, and I would also like to take the opportunity to congratulate the Queensland government for keeping Queenslanders safe.
I think the fact we are going to move ahead with this facility, which was mooted a long time ago and as the premier suggested it could have already been built and operational, but as the landlord of this facility to the Queensland government, we are working though the final design criteria to make sure that we have the best fit for purpose regional accommodation facility for return travellers that there is in the country, or in fact, the world.
So this is going to be a great economic boost for Toowoomba. It will create a lot of local employment. Our local producers, just by the fact we have to produce 3000 meals a day will really benefit from this and it will help get Queensland out of Covid and on the road to economic recovery which we desperately need.
So thank you to the Queensland government and congratulate them on actually getting this to fruition. Thank you.
Queensland Health Minister, Yvette D’Ath:
Well this is a great day. We’ve been calling on this for months and if this had been built months ago when we first asked the Commonwealth to partner with us and the Wagner’s we potentially may not have had to make the very difficult decision we made yesterday to pause people domestically coming into hotel quarantine for a couple of weeks.
But now we can move forward and we have this great facility that is already, construction underway.
As the deputy premier has said, most of our transmission that has occurred within our hotel quarantine has occurred through those corridors, closed in corridors. We know that that is a very high risk. We know our hotels are not built to be quarantine facilities.
We know that when you build dedicated facilities like Howard Springs that you significantly reduce the risk of exposure and transmission for our community, so this is a great day.
I’m thrilled to be part of the Palaszczuk government partnering with the Wagner’s for this.
…..
The last thing I want to say about why this facility is so important. The Doherty institute has been talked about a lot, their modelling, recently. Their own report says we will need to keep some public health measures in place.
Test, trace isolate, quarantine. So even with high vaccination rates, we must continue these public health measures, which means we will continue to need quarantine facilities and we need to make sure they’re purpose built and they’re keeping our community safe.

Full text: STATES with hard borders, such as Queensland and Western Australia, will “no doubt” be infiltrated by Covid-19, a leading infectious disease expert has said.
Dozens of defence force troops will begin manning the Queensland-NSW border on Wednesday, in an attempt to keep the Delta strain out of the Sunshine State, where just two “low risk” cases were recorded on Tuesday.
Throughout the pandemic, Queensland has kept its total case numbers below 2000 and has routinely implemented elimination strategies whenever there has been an outbreak.
However, infectious disease specialist Paul Griffin said there would be another outbreak in the state, either by domestic borders or a hotel quarantine breach. He said vaccination was the best and only tool available to control it.
“There is so much Covid around it is unrealistic for us to expect to keep it out altogether,” he said.
“We need to do everything that we can to get on top of it in terms of controlling it in Queensland.
“We have excellent rates of testing and we need to keep that up, and the use of masks is great. But … getting as many people vaccinated, that is the key.” Dr Griffin said it was “unrealistic” for Queensland to think it could keep Covid-19 out. “I think it will get in,” he said.
His sentiment was echoed by Doherty Institute director Sharon Lewin, who said despite zero cases being the ideal outcome, it was not sustainable.
“I’m sure they (Queenslanders and Western Australians) want to have open borders and return to some normality of how we will live, movement around the country and international travel,” she told Sunrise. “I’m sure every Australian wants that.
“To achieve that, the prediction is that we can safely move from phase A to phase B with high vaccination rates and good test, trace and isolate measures.
“We will still make every effort to stop transmission, but we don’t need to get to that very difficult spot of zero.
“If we can keep it under control, we won’t see escalating outbreaks, and that should be achieved in those states enjoying zero Covid-19. They can live with low levels of Covid.” Pressure is mounting on the Queensland and WA Premiers to make a commitment to national cabinet’s staged reopening road map, built on the Doherty Institute’s modelling. In modelling presented to national cabinet last month, when 70 per cent of the eligible population is double jabbed, the country can move to Phase B, where restrictions and lockdowns are less likely.

Palaszczuk stays cagey on the plan to open up

Full text: PREMIER: I NEED TO SEE MODELLING PREMIER Annastacia Palaszczuk has been accused of taking away hope for Queensland to get out of the pandemic, as she crab-walks away from the national plan to avoid snap lockdowns.
The Premier boasted on Tuesday that the state remained open, with cafes trading and spectators attending sport, but devastated businesses warn their doors will be forced to close without a ­pathway out of the pandemic, while families remain separated by border closures.
Ms Palaszczuk (inset) could not answer whether Queenslanders could look forward to an interstate holiday this Christmas.
Prime Minister Scott Morrison has ramped up pressure, saying Australians want to see the national deal to start easing restrictions from 70 and 80 per cent vaccination milestones delivered.
“We have a plan to get out out of this. We can’t stay in a cave forever,” he said.
But Ms Palaszczuk said Queensland was not in a cave, but would not rule out pulling out of the Doherty plan to open up Australia.
She said the modelling used was “predicated on 30 cases across Australia, not 13,000”.
“So I’m looking forward to seeing that modelling.
“At the moment the borders are shut and, you know, we don’t know when they’re going to come out of their ­current outbreak.” It is despite the Doherty Institute’s professor Sharon Lewin stating this week that the “advice still holds” and that the Delta strain was taken into account in the modelling.
“If you open up with more cases, you reach that peak quicker and you have a greater load on your public health system to make sure that you can slow that, can flatten the curve, essentially. So, the outcome is the same,” she said.
The Premier’s comments provoked a devastated response from the state’s business community, eager for certainty and a way forward.
Queensland Tourism Industry Council chief executive Daniel Gschwind said people deserved a national, “coherent plan”, with specifics around what they would and wouldn’t be able to do in the months ahead.
“We’ve lost a vision of the path forward,” he said.
“We’re in the darkness again and that’s maybe the worst aspect. “We’ve lost hope. We need some plain speaking and some basic certainty.” Mr Gschwind said that businesses and holiday-makers were “in limbo”, too afraid to make decisions.
Chamber of Commerce and Industry Queensland spokesman Gus Mandigora said that it was “critical” Queensland stick to the agreement secured at national cabinet so businesses could plan for their recovery.
“They also need a forward-looking road map outlining how the Queensland government plans to handle the pandemic in future,” he said.
“Every time states warn of the potential of more snap lockdowns and trading restrictions, businesses and ­consumer confidence take a hit,” he said.
Queensland Morrison government ministers have lashed the Premier for backing away, saying the state would continue to languish in the vaccine rollout race without something to hope for.
Employment Minister Stuart Robert said while Queensland’s can watch sport and go to restaurants, livelihoods were being destroyed, workers could not cross borders and tourism businesses were suffering. “We see families torn apart by not being able to grieve together. That is right now,” he said.
“The Queensland Premier needs to stick to the plan, reopen under less-harsh and truly devastating restrictions once we meet the agreed national cabinet vaccination targets, because until we do so, Queensland isn’t truly open,” he said.
Assistant Minister for Women and Industrial Relations Amanda Stoker said the Premier’s comments were dangerous and encouraging vaccine complacency.
“The national plan is clear: vaccination is the path to ­stability, confidence and freedom. It’s irresponsible for Queensland Labor to undermine it,” she said.
“I’m under 40 and had my first dose of AstraZeneca without problems – and I encourage everyone to reject Labor’s politics of fear.” The Doherty Institute released a statement on its modelling describing the 70-80 per cent targets as the “light at the end of the tunnel”. “It won’t be possible to maintain a situation where there are no cases at all.
“The focus will shift to keeping the number of people going to hospital and dying at a minimum,” it stated.
“The team of modellers from across Australia led by the Doherty Institute is now working through the implementation issues specific to the states and territories, specific populations and high risk settings.” Meanwhile, NSW recorded 753 new Covid-19 cases, Victoria added another 50 to its tally and the ACT had a record 30 cases, with all three states in lockdown.

Pfizer doses welcomed

Full text: From P1 Premier Daniel Andrews said over the next four weeks, more than 830,000 appointments will be available, including 450,000 first-dose appointments for the Pfizer vaccine.
"This is a very significant announcement. I just ask people to be patient," he said.
"There isn't, at this stage, enough for every single person who will want to come forward and make a booking, but if we can get these appointments out the door, if we can get these jabs into arms over the next four weeks, we will achieve our target of one million (doses)."
Mr Andrews said those aged 16 and 17 would only be eligible for Pfizer, while those aged 18 to 39 could choose between Pfizer or AstraZeneca. Those aged 60 and over will continue to receive AstraZeneca.
Bendigo's COVID-19 vaccination centre has confirmed it will offer Pfizer jabs to people aged 16 to 39 years of age from today along with others across the state.
There will be no walk-in appointments.
Prime Minister Scott Morrison also warned continued lockdowns would cause more harm than good when COVID-19 vaccination coverage reached 70 per cent.
The prime minister insists Doherty Institute modelling, which underpinned a fraying national agreement for easing restrictions, is solid.
Mr Morrison said negative economic and mental health impacts would outweigh benefits when 70 and 80 per cent immunisation coverage was reached.
"That's the advice, that's the basis for the plan. We've all signed up to it, we need to get on with it," he told the Seven Network on Tuesday.
In a statement, the Doherty Institute said opening up at hundreds of cases nationally a day would be possible at 70 per cent vaccination coverage.
"However, we will need vigilant public health interventions with higher case loads," it said.
The institute said hitting that vaccination rate would make it easier to live with the virus, similar to the flu. "However, it won't be possible to maintain a situation where there are no cases at all."
Epidemiologist Tony Blakely said Australia would have to learn to deal with high case numbers.
"We're probably going to have case numbers in NSW or Victoria of 5000 or 10,000," he told Nine.
"But so many of them will be vaccinated and just be mild breakthrough infections. Australian National University researchers argue at least 90 per cent of all Australians, including children, must be vaccinated before fully relaxing public health measures and opening the international border."
The Doherty modelling calls for gradual steps at 70 and 80 per cent with high-quality preventative measures remaining in place.

'Brakes are failing' on NSW's delta response

Publication info: The Northern Daily Leader ; Tamworth, N.S.W. [Tamworth, N.S.W]. 25 Aug 2021: 0.

Full text: The delta variant is spreading at a rate that will lead to 13,000 coronavirus cases a day in NSW by early October if public health orders do not slow it down.
Case numbers have doubled consistently every 10.5 days in the eight weeks since Sydney went into lockdown on June 26, defying an incremental tightening of restrictions, rising vaccination levels and a surge in testing.
The daily count, which was 199 on August 3 and 390 on August 13, has surged past 800 and will exceed 3200 on September 11 and 13,000 on October 2 if the pattern continues.
Epidemiology and modelling expert Professor Allan Saul, from Melbourne's Burnet Institute, told ACM that tighter restrictions in west and south-west Sydney appeared to have slowed transmission, but the virus was now spreading almost twice as fast outside the 12 local government areas of concern.
He said case numbers were doubling in the 12 Sydney LGAs every 13 days, compared with every seven days in the rest of NSW.
"Doubling every seven days is very fast," Professor Saul said.
"The overall state doubling rate has been consistently at about 10 to 11 days since June, and that's an amazing thing.
"We would have expected to see that slow down as more and more restrictions are put in, but it's remained absolutely constant over two and a half months."
Premier Gladys Berejiklian said on Monday that the community would have to accept "confronting" case counts in the future and should start focusing on hospitalisations and deaths.
Health Minister Brad Hazzard has said repeatedly that the delta outbreak is putting Sydney's hospital system under stress, though Ms Berejiklian said there was "never a situation we can't manage".
The Australian reported on Monday that some Sydney hospitals have started moving patients to Wollongong and Newcastle to make room for COVID-19 patients.
The state has 11,000 active cases, including more than 586 in hospital and 100 in intensive care.
A count of 13,000 cases a day would render contact tracing all but impossible and herald the kind of catastrophe seen overseas during the pandemic.
Asked on Monday if NSW could start opening up under such a scenario, Deputy Premier John Barilaro was blunt.
"No, you can't," he said.
But he was "confident" stay-at-home orders and new mask-wearing rules would start to bring case numbers down.
"Let's see. Maybe we'll be the first state to do it [open up]," he said.
The United Kingdom, which has very high immunity levels compared with Australia, is still reporting 30,000 delta-variant cases, 1000 hospitalisations and 100 deaths a day.
The NSW government has promised to start removing restrictions when NSW reaches 70 per cent double-dose vaccination coverage for adults by late October.
Mr Barilaro said the transmission rate of the virus in NSW was 1.4, meaning every positive case is infecting 1.4 other people on average and the virus is spreading.
Research suggests the average interval between delta infections is five days. These multiples equate to NSW cases doubling every 10 days.
Professor Saul said it was difficult to predict accurately where case numbers would be in October, but NSW would have "easily 1000 cases a day by the end of the month".
He agreed with Burnet chief executive Professor Brendan Crabb's recent description of the pandemic as a "steam train heading towards a cliff".
"The brakes are failing," he said.
The benefit of Ms Berejiklian's increasingly tighter restrictions was being offset by growing difficulties in contact tracing.
"As she's putting more controls in, other things are becoming less effective," he said. "How can you expect the contact tracing to be nearly as efficient with 800 people as it was with two or three?
"You're going to have to impose harder and harder restrictions. Preferably it would be nice to impose them sooner, so that you actually give your contact tracers a bit of breathing room."
NSW has fully vaccinated 31.5 per cent of the population aged over 16, but Professor Saul warned that increasing vaccination rates would not have much effect on the virus' spread.
"It will have an effect, but it's not the silver bullet. Maybe it's not even a brass bullet," he said.
"It's really important for people to get vaccinated, but, even at 80 per cent [adult] coverage, that is only 66 per cent of the population, and a lot of transmission occurring now is in under-16s.
"It's important. It'll stop people dying. It will help slow it down. It's part of a multi-faceted package, but to think that we're going to vaccinate our way out of this is nuts."
He said recent reports from Public Health England were "scary".
The agency's latest COVID-19 surveillance report shows that 97.5 per cent of the UK population aged over 17 have antibodies to COVID-19 through vaccination or infection, or both.
Yet the nation's daily case count is up from 25,000 to 31,000 in the past fortnight and more than 100 people a day are dying.
"Really critically, despite those levels [of adult immunity], they've still got 1000 admissions to hospital per day," Professor Saul said.
"The cases peaked about a month ago at 50,000 a day. They dropped, then they took all of the restrictions off [on July 19], then in the last three weeks the numbers are starting to come back up again."
By comparison, 52.8 per cent of all Australian adults have received a vaccine dose and comparatively few people have been infected.
"You're only relying on the vaccine," Professor Saul said.
Vaccination targets of 70 or 80 per cent will leave 11 million Australians, half of them children, unvaccinated when restrictions loosen.

Professor Saul was also concerned that the Doherty Institute modelling the federal and NSW governments were relying on to set vaccination targets was based on assumptions about "optimal" testing, tracing, isolation and quarantine (TTIQ) drawn from Victoria's spring outbreak last year, which did not involve the delta variant.
"If you look then at the levels that use partially efficient TTIQ, with 80 per cent vaccination, in order to keep the number of cases stable, you actually need to put the population in stage-four lockdown, which equals what Victoria did last year in September, for 30 per cent of the time.
"We're not talking the odd day or two; we're talking a serious amount of time. It took Melbourne from August 3 to the end of October under stage-four lockdown, and that wasn't delta.
"And you're dealing today with much higher case numbers than Melbourne ever had. It's unrealistic to expect this thing to go away in a couple of months.
"If vaccine coverage was up to 90 per cent of the whole community, that would be a very, very different story.
"Sixty-six per cent of the whole population is not something we should be aspiring to; we should be aspiring to do dramatically better than that."
The Hunter region has cut case numbers from a high of 24 to just two on Monday, but Professor Saul said the threat of cross-contamination in regional areas would continue to grow.
Public health orders allow a steady flow of "essential" workers to and from the regions, including up and down the M1 to the Central Coast and the Hunter.
One such worker had more than 700 close contacts when he spent four days in Newcastle last week helping to train staff at a new Costco warehouse.
Professor Saul called for tighter restrictions in NSW.
"Hard and fast lockdowns do work, and I think you're going to see that in regional areas, that you need to get onto this thing quick. Barilaro agrees with that sentiment.
"If I was in Newcastle, I'd want to be very careful about movement coming out of Sydney if you don't want to overwhelm your local hospital.
"As sure as the sun's going to come up tomorrow morning, if there isn't more controls put outside the 12 LGAs, I hate to think what's going to happen."

Full text: National cabinet will also move to fast-track jabs for high-school students under a push to have the majority inoculated before the Christmas holidays.
After the Australian Technical Advisory Group on Immunisation finalises its interim advice on vaccinating 1.2 million children aged 12 to 15 for Friday’s national cabinet meeting, all students aged 12 and over will be eligible for vaccines from next week.
Access to Pfizer and Moderna jabs is expected to be through GPs, state hubs and schools.
A national cabinet subcommittee, consisting of Victoria, Tasmania and the Northern Territory, will report on Friday with preliminary recommendations supporting a uniform range of exemptions for vaccinated residents across states and territories. The Australian understands a decision on exemptions is unlikely this week.
Australian companies, including Qantas, have moved to order mandatory vaccines for workers and offer incentives for vaccinated people, while in France residents need to provide proof of vaccination before accessing bars, restaurants, trains, planes and other venues.
Gladys Berejiklian said NSW was developing technology allowing residents to check-in and prove their vaccination status in one process. “My message to everybody is, if you want to get back to normal, please get vaccinated,” the Premier said. “It’s your choice if you don’t but … if you want to do certain things in the future vaccination will be key as part of that process.”
National cabinet leaders, who have fractured over their four-phase reopening strategy, will ­receive updated advice from the Doherty Institute within 48 hours reinforcing that spiralling Covid-19 cases will not affect existing vaccine targets.
The Australian understands the advice will say that surging Delta variant cases in NSW, Victoria and the ACT would bring the curve forward for peak cases and deaths but not alter the 70 and 80 per cent double dose vaccine targets required to move the nation out of the suppression phase.
The Doherty Institute was expected to provide direction around baseline restrictions and test, trace, isolate and quarantine measures as the country transitions away from lockdowns and border closures. The national cabinet, which agreed to the reopening plan on July 30, is expected to clarify the positions of states pursuing Covid-zero policies.
As vaccine supply ramps up over the next two months, the majority of teenagers are expected to receive at least one jab by December with no impact on the vaccination program for Australians aged 16 and over. Under existing approvals about 8000 children aged 12 to 15, with underlying medical conditions and those in indigenous and remote communities, have been vaccinated.
Scott Morrison stepped up his defence of the national reopening strategy after West Australian Premier Mark McGowan and Queensland Premier Annastacia Palaszczuk declared they would reserve their lockdown rights to keep Covid out of their states.
Speaking to the joint Coalition party room meeting, the Prime Minister told MPs they must confront Australia’s Covid reality.
Mr Morrison said that once the 70 and 80 per cent vaccine thresholds were achieved, lockdowns would do more harm than good.
“The idea of Covid zero, that’s not the issue once you get to 70 and 80 per cent,” he said. “Any state and territory that thinks that somehow they can protect themselves from Covid with the Delta strain forever, that’s just absurd. New Zealand can’t do that. They were following an elimination strategy. They’re in lockdown.”
Ms Palaszczuk hit back at Mr Morrison, declaring that Queenslanders were not living in a cave.
“Have a look out in Queensland at the moment. You can go to work, you can go to school, you can go and watch sport, you can play community sport, you can go to a restaurant. We haven’t given up,” Ms Palaszczuk said.
While she agreed with the 70 and 80 per cent national cabinet targets, she wanted to see the updated Doherty modelling.
Navigating the issue of mandatory workplace vaccinations is a “minefield” for employers, says The Australian’s Judith Sloan.

A PLAN B FOR DELTA

Full text: LOCKDOWN 5 in Victoria was textbook. An outbreak occurred, contact tracing swung into action, cases were found, and over time the number of daily cases infectious in the community diminished to zero for three days, and we came out of lockdown.
Lockdown 6 is not going well. Victoria cannot seem to tip the balance, despite even stricter restrictions. In fact, the majority of cases found have been infectious out in the community, and the numbers are going up rather than down. Even worse – and the reason for this bad trend – is the constant stream of mystery cases.
When there are mystery cases, there will by definition be future cases in the community.
I strongly support the Victorian government’s decision to go “really hard” with curfews, by closing playgrounds and childcare, and further reducing essential workplaces. It would be so much better to re-eliminate the virus, and wish for a near-normal life until the end of the year. But we need to be realistic. The elimination strategy always had, and continues to have, a planned shift to living with the virus once we are ready.
Ideally at something like 80 per cent adult vaccination coverage (although personally I would prefer that to include children as well).
The virus may be forcing our hand earlier than we planned. If the hard restrictions in Victoria do not lead to a dramatic improvement by September 2, such as fewer than five cases a day (which seems very unlikely), what should we do?
We could hang tough, and keep the number of infections as low as possible by staying in hard lockdown longer. But for how long? Victoria has been in lockdowns for more than 200 days now. The citizens are pretty sick of it, with growing concerns about the mental health effects, and the economic damage. This is wickedly difficult decision-making for governments. It is about picking the least harmful course of action.
The Covid-19 Pandemic Trade-offs group I lead at the Melbourne School of Population and Global Health has done a lot of modelling of this pandemic, but not exactly the Victorian scenario leading up to September 2. Nor have the Doherty Institute and my collaborators in the Australian Covid-19 Modelling Initiative.
What I present here is not a model per se, but a framework to help us think our options through.
The first figure shows three scenarios assuming we make some progress by September 2.
In the first scenario, we have hit 40 cases a day a week before September 2, then five cases a day by September 2 – so we come out of lockdown. And we get lucky with no further incursions and outbreaks from hotel quarantine or across the NSW border before the end of November, when 80 per cent of adults will be at least 10 days post their second dose, and we shift into phase C of the national plan. We all hope this will happen, but it does seem unlikely.
The second, orange, scenario starts out the same as the green scenario, but we have repeated monthly incursions requiring repeated fortnightly lockdowns (each of which works, so still an optimistic assumption in that regard – although it will get easier to stamp out outbreaks as vaccine coverage increases). Here we oscillate our way to the end of November with a total of about two months in hard lockdown.
The third scenario is where some progress has been made by September 2 – but only to the point of 30 cases a day, requiring another four weeks of hard lockdown to drive the case numbers down to five a day before stepping out of lockdown. Not great, but a return to zero transmission.
BUT what if we have not made any progress by September 2, and the case numbers are still around 50 a day (or worse)? What should we do then?
We could stay in hard lockdown and wait until the vaccine coverage tips the balance our way, and we tip to numbers going down. A scenario similar to the blue line in the first figure, but longer in lockdown.
There are other options, though.
We could let go of hard lockdown and shift to a soft lockdown. A world where more time is allowed outside, no curfews, you can travel 10km or more from your home, some retail is reopened, and construction and other industries on the “essential” threshold are started up.
Using a Victorian-style stage 3 lockdown as an approximation for a soft lockdown, and using the apparent tipping point in terms of vaccine coverage when it is enough to cause numbers in our NSW modelling to start going down, I constructed the second figure. In this fourth “moonshot” scenario the numbers go up as expected, but then turn and decrease with increasing vaccine coverage.
This moonshot appears to work if the criterion for success is restricting daily case numbers to fewer than 500 on the way to the end of November. The flip side, though, is we are in a soft lockdown the whole time (or until early November). And it is – of course – risky and uncertain.
The fifth scenario is for a 2 percentage point higher daily change in cases at each point in time (that is, where I got the maths slightly wrong, or we got unlucky). It is enough to quickly see the case numbers hit 500 by virtue of exponential maths.
Nevertheless, the soft lockdown moonshot does appear to be an option worth considering.
We hope that the numbers dramatically turn down in the next week, but we need to also start discussing what our options are come September 2, if the numbers have not dramatically decreased. TONY BLAKELY IS AN EPIDEMIOLOGIST AND PROFESSOR AT THE UNIVERSITY OF MELBOURNE

Brakes are failing on delta outbreak

Publication info: Newcastle Herald ; Newcastle, N.S.W. [Newcastle, N.S.W]. 24 Aug 2021.

Full text: The delta variant is spreading at a rate that will lead to 13,000 coronavirus cases a day in NSW by early October if public health orders do not slow it down.
Case numbers have doubled consistently every 10.5 days in the eight weeks since Sydney went into lockdown on June 26, defying an incremental tightening of restrictions, rising vaccination levels and a surge in testing.
The daily count, which was 199 on August 3 and 390 on August 13, has surged past 800 and will exceed 3200 on September 11 and 13,000 on October 2 if the pattern continues.
Epidemiology and modelling expert Professor Allan Saul, from Melbourne's Burnet Institute, told the Newcastle Herald that tighter restrictions in west and south-west Sydney appeared to have slowed transmission, but the virus was now spreading almost twice as fast outside the 12 local government areas of concern.
He said case numbers were doubling in the 12 Sydney LGAs every 13 days, compared with every seven days in the rest of NSW.
"Doubling every seven days is very fast," Professor Saul said.
"The overall state doubling rate has been consistently at about 10 to 11 days since June, and that's an amazing thing.
"We would have expected to see that slow down as more and more restrictions are put in, but it's remained absolutely constant over two and a half months."
Premier Gladys Berejiklian said on Monday that the community would have to accept "confronting" case counts in the future and should start focusing on hospitalisations and deaths.
Health Minister Brad Hazzard has said repeatedly that the delta outbreak is putting Sydney's hospital system under stress, though Ms Berejiklian said there was "never a situation we can't manage".
The Australian reported on Monday that some Sydney hospitals have started moving patients to Wollongong and Newcastle to make room for COVID-19 patients.
The state has 11,000 active cases, including more than 586 in hospital and 100 in intensive care.
A count of 13,000 cases a day would render contact tracing all but impossible and herald the kind of catastrophe seen overseas during the pandemic.
Asked on Monday if NSW could start opening up under such a scenario, Deputy Premier John Barilaro was blunt.
"No, you can't," he said.
But he was "confident" stay-at-home orders and new mask-wearing rules would start to bring case numbers down.
"Let's see. Maybe we'll be the first state to do it [open up]," he said.
The United Kingdom, which has very high immunity levels compared with Australia, is still reporting 30,000 delta-variant cases, 1000 hospitalisations and 100 deaths a day.
The NSW government has promised to start removing restrictions when NSW reaches 70 per cent double-dose vaccination coverage for adults by late October.
Mr Barilaro said the transmission rate of the virus in NSW was 1.4, meaning every positive case is infecting 1.4 other people on average and the virus is spreading.
Research suggests the average interval between delta infections is five days. These multiples equate to NSW cases doubling every 10 days.
Professor Saul said it was difficult to predict accurately where case numbers would be in October, but NSW would have "easily 1000 cases a day by the end of the month".
He agreed with Burnet chief executive Professor Brendan Crabb's recent description of the pandemic as a "steam train heading towards a cliff".
"The brakes are failing," he said.
The benefit of Ms Berejiklian's increasingly tighter restrictions was being offset by growing difficulties in contact tracing.
"As she's putting more controls in, other things are becoming less effective," he said. "How can you expect the contact tracing to be nearly as efficient with 800 people as it was with two or three?
"You're going to have to impose harder and harder restrictions. Preferably it would be nice to impose them sooner, so that you actually give your contact tracers a bit of breathing room."
NSW has fully vaccinated 30 per cent of the population aged over 16, but Professor Saul warned that increasing vaccination rates would not have much effect on the virus' spread.
"It will have an effect, but it's not the silver bullet. Maybe it's not even a brass bullet," he said.
"It's really important for people to get vaccinated, but, even at 80 per cent [adult] coverage, that is only 66 per cent of the population, and a lot of transmission occurring now is in under-16s.
"It's important. It'll stop people dying. It will help slow it down. It's part of a multi-faceted package, but to think that we're going to vaccinate our way out of this is nuts."
He said recent reports from Public Health England were "scary".
The agency's latest COVID-19 surveillance report shows that 97.5 per cent of the UK population aged over 17 have antibodies to COVID-19 through vaccination or infection, or both.
Yet the nation's daily case count is up from 25,000 to 31,000 in the past fortnight and more than 100 people a day are dying.
"Really critically, despite those levels [of adult immunity], they've still got 1000 admissions to hospital per day," Professor Saul said.
"The cases peaked about a month ago at 50,000 a day. They dropped, then they took all of the restrictions off [on July 19], then in the last three weeks the numbers are starting to come back up again."
By comparison, only about 42 per cent of all Australians have received a vaccine dose and comparatively few people have been infected.
"You're only relying on the vaccine," Professor Saul said.
Vaccination targets of 70 or 80 per cent will leave 11 million Australians, half of them children, unvaccinated when restrictions loosen.
Children under 12 will not be immunised until next year as the vaccines are not yet approved for that age group.
Professor Saul was also concerned that the Doherty Institute modelling the federal and NSW governments were relying on to set vaccination targets was based on assumptions about "optimal" testing, tracing, isolation and quarantine (TTIQ) drawn from Victoria's spring outbreak last year, which did not involve the delta variant.
"If you look then at the levels that use partially efficient TTIQ, with 80 per cent vaccination, in order to keep the number of cases stable, you actually need to put the population in stage-four lockdown, which equals what Victoria did last year in September, for 30 per cent of the time.
"We're not talking the odd day or two; we're talking a serious amount of time. It took Melbourne from August 3 to the end of October under stage-four lockdown, and that wasn't delta.
"And you're dealing today with much higher case numbers than Melbourne ever had. It's unrealistic to expect this thing to go away in a couple of months.
"If vaccine coverage was up to 90 per cent of the whole community, that would be a very, very different story.
"Sixty-six per cent of the whole population is not something we should be aspiring to; we should be aspiring to do dramatically better than that."
The Hunter region has cut case numbers from a high of 24 to just two on Monday, but Professor Saul said the threat of cross-contamination in regional areas would continue to grow.

Full text: There will be a ground up approach, with the pressure expected to come from the public who want a pathway and clear goalposts.
Premier Annastacia Palaszczuk on Monday would not back down from her deputy’s comments that Queensland may not open its border to NSW even when vaccination rates hit 80 per cent.
Updated modelling from the Doherty Institute is likely to be used to reinforce the existing plan to start easing restrictions at 70 and 80 per cent, even with NSW battling hundreds of cases a day.
The vaccination plan for children aged 12-16 and those younger will also be discussed at national cabinet, as it shapes up as the next flashpoint issue.
Seeking to fire up the public’s support for the national plan, Mr Morrison said “this groundhog day has to end”.
“There has to be a plan out, there is a plan out and we have to move forward with that plan,” he said.
“The national plan is our deal with all Australians. It is the understanding that we have with Australians making their sacrifices now, and who have made them over such a long time, that that sacrifice will get them to the next step.
“Because if not at 70 per cent and 80 per cent, then when? Then when?”
How to get vaccinated in Queensland
Mr Morrison said there would be those who would seek to undermine the national plan, but denied he was talking about state’s like Queensland where the Premier has been crab walking away from the deal.
The reinvigorated Prime Minister’s fired up performance has been welcomed by his colleagues, who had become increasingly concerned about his lacklustre showings, with premiers having kept him on the ropes in recent weeks.
Cases continued to rise across the country, with NSW recording 818 cases in a day, Victoria and the ACT remaining in lockdown and even New Zealand admitting it may not achieve zero Covid under the Delta strain of Covid.
NSW Premier Gladys Berejiklian urged people “not to have the rollercoaster of emotions at case numbers every day”, saying that was not the most important thing to consider.
“Every state is going to have to go through this transition, one way or another because once you open your borders, we can’t live in isolation forever,” she said.
Ms Palaszczuk would not be drawn on how Queensland will open up once vaccination rates hit 80 per cent, saying we’re in “uncharted territory”.
Ms Palaszczuk said everyone was still aiming for the 70 to 80 per cent vaccination goal, but that there was also an agreement for extra modelling based on the current situation.
“They have commissioned more research because the goalposts have changed. it was premised on there being 30 cases in the community and now there are thousands,” the Premier said of the Doherty research.
She said her goal was always to suppress the virus and so there would be some limited and specified restrictions and lockdowns going forward.
“This is a book that hasn’t been written, folks,” she said. “This is uncharted territory.”
Ms Palaszczuk said Delta was incredibly infectious, and the other concern was children.
“We have to get children vaccinated, especially in those high school years … because we know that it can be spread. This is a big job,” she said.
Business Council of Australia CEO Jennifer Westacott called on leaders to “stick to the numbers” around reopening the country and slammed the “constant state of uncertainty” created by Queensland’s threat to withdraw from a national Covid-19 reopening plan.
“If leaders walk away from the national reopening plan or make the targets meaningless, it will cripple community and business confidence and send a terrible signal to the rest of the world,” she said.
“The longer we stay as Fortress Australia, the slower and shallower our recovery will be as we deter foreign investment and major projects, due to the lack of skilled workers; as we put a ‘not welcome’ sign up to tourists; and as we say no to international students.”

Full text: ACT Chief Minister Andrew Barr has pushed back against a blunt federal government warning that states and territories won't receive support if they lock down after reaching vaccination targets, saying it would be "electoral suicide" for the Coalition to abandon areas struggling with Covid.
His comments follow growing pressure from Commonwealth leaders for states and territories to fulfil a national deal to reopen the country at 70 and 80 per cent vaccination rates, amid rising discord over the plan.
Mr Barr on Sunday said federal government leaders had not been helpful in suggesting the Commonwealth wouldn't provide financial support for residents in lockdowns and living in jurisdictions with 70 per cent vaccination rates.
The Chief Minister also said he didn't expect the Coalition government would follow through on the warning as the federal election loomed.
"Does anyone seriously think that they are just going to abandon parts of Australia that are experiencing Covid outbreaks? I don't think they will, and I think it would be electoral suicide if they did," he told reporters.
Prime Minister Scott Morrison earlier on Sunday pushed for states and territories to follow the reopening plan, agreed at national cabinet this month, saying the use of lockdowns to suppress the virus after the nation hits a 70 per cent vaccination rate would do more harm than good.
He said while it was unlikely there would be a return to zero infections - as states and territories had earlier achieved through lockdowns and other restrictions - the goal was to suppress rather than eliminate Covid.
"You can't go with lockdowns forever, and at some point you need to make that gear change, and that's done at 70 per cent because that's where we're advised from the medical science, that you can make that gear change," he said.
"Once you do that, then you can move into focusing on the public health issues of hospitalisation and serious illness."
The Prime Minister said Covid case numbers were "not the whole story", and that reopening the nation with higher infection rates would not ultimately change case numbers later.
However states and territories are disputing the reopening plan and argue it was based on Doherty Institute modelling assuming the nation would reduce restrictions while it had low case numbers.
Mr Barr said under the reopening roadmap, at 70 and 80 per cent state and national vaccination rates, the use of lockdowns would be targeted and less frequent, and there would still be a need for other public health measures.
"We need to be very clear this broad brush language of 'open up' should not be taken to mean there will be no public health directions, no public health settings and nothing in place to support the unvaccinated," he said.
Under the national reopening plan, a state or territory can ease restrictions once it reaches a 70 per cent vaccination rate, and when the national average hits the same figure. Once the figures reach 80 per cent, lockdowns would be limited even further.
Federal Chief Medical Officer Paul Kelly acknowledged the Doherty Institute's modelling for the reopening plan was based on lower case numbers, and flagged it was doing further modelling to account for larger Covid case numbers.
He expected it would not result in major changes to the national plan to reopen.
"To be very clear, there is agreement at national cabinet at the moment, and all states were unanimous of that," he said.
"The more nuanced local elements of that will be worked out over the coming weeks with the Doherty modelling as part of but not the only element that we would consider in relation to that."
He said that ATAGI was working on advice about vaccinating people aged 12-15, and that he expected it would this week provide advice about a wider vaccination program for that age group.

The director of epidemiology at the Doherty Institute, Jodie McVernon, told Sky News on Sunday that the original plan envisaged low or minimal transmission for the country to be opened up at 70 and 80 per cent vaccination rates.
Professor McVernon said with a high caseload it was not possible to have a "freedom day" and restrictions had to be gradually eased.
The Prime Minister on Sunday also supported the use of lockdowns as Covid cases grew in NSW and Victoria, and continued emerging in the ACT.
"Right now, of course we need to make the lockdowns effective."

Full text: One million Pfizer doses on way from Poland YOUNG Queenslanders are set to benefit from a deal struck with Poland to secure an extra million doses of the Pfizer Covid-19 vaccine.
Prime Minister Scott Morrison on Sunday announced the federal government had struck a deal with their Polish counterparts to buy one million doses of the Pfizer vaccine at cost.
About 53 per cent of the doses will be prioritised for express delivery to local ­government areas in Greater Sydney hit hardest by the state’s worsening Covid-19 outbreak.
The rest of the doses will be split across the other jurisdictions based on population size, with Queensland to receive about 139,000 jabs.
The doses will be targeted at people aged 20 to 39, the group deemed by Doherty Institute modelling to be the “peak transmitters” of SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes Covid-19.
The deal struck with Poland to buy a million of the eastern European nation’s surplus jabs is the first of its kind for Australia.
The doses were manufactured at Pfizer’s Belgium facility, the same place all of Australia’s other Pfizer jabs have come from.
The Polish government, according the country’s press, had in July flagged the need to sell its vaccines to other countries as the jab rollout there stagnates.
Just 47.6 per cent of Poles are fully vaccinated, with the country considered to be among the most vaccine-sceptical nations in Europe.
The country had already sold excess stock to Georgia and Ukraine, before receiving interest from Vietnam and Australia.
Foreign Affairs Minister Marise Payne said Australia’s “network of diplomats was working hard to identify opportunities to secure additional vaccine supplies”.
“This is a demonstration of the value of Australia’s close engagement with other governments and a strong example of countries co-operating and supporting one another as we face the pandemic together,” she said.
Mr Morrison said the federal government had been in discussions with their Polish counterparts for “several weeks”, with the outbreak in NSW a key factor in securing the shipment from the country.
“There are a million doses of hope on their way,” Mr Morrison said. The first shipment was due to arrive in Australia overnight on Sunday.

COVID vaccines and kids: a complex equation

Publication info: Sydney Morning Herald ; Sydney, N.S.W. [Sydney, N.S.W]. 14 Aug 2021: 26.

Full text: Parents and health specialists are grappling with the best way to approach child inoculation, writes Rachel Clun.
Jennifer is still agonising over getting her daughter vaccinated against the coronavirus. She herself is allergic to the flu shot, and is worried her daughter may have a similar reaction to the COVID-19 jab.
On the other hand, the family lives in Sydney's south-west, in a local government area of concern in the current outbreak. Her 18-year-old daughter Emma also lives with a learning disability and epilepsy, and is at higher risk of severe disease.
"On that basis, I thought, 'well, I don't really have a choice'," said Jennifer, whose surname has been withheld to protect her and her daughter's privacy. "You want to do what's right. Do I know if I'm doing the right thing? No, I'm praying I am, but I really don't know."
Jennifer's situation is complex. And it's similar to the broader issue immunisation and child health specialists are currently grappling with when it comes to COVID-19 vaccines and children.
The University of Melbourne Professor Nigel Curtis, an infectious diseases specialist from the Murdoch Children's Research Institute, said experts were taking a more cautious approach with vaccines and children than they were for the adult rollout.
"What people don't understand is just how much more complex that risk-benefit equation is in children," he said.
With adults, that equation is fairly straightforward. The benefits of getting vaccinated generally outweigh the risks of the rare but serious side effects, as the harms associated with getting COVID-19 are greater.
Professor Terry Nolan, head of the Doherty Institute's vaccine and immunisation research group, said there were a few factors to look at when considering immunising children. There is the individual protection, the potential impact on herd immunity, the safety of the vaccines, and priority.
On need, Professor Nolan said that even with the Delta variant there was little evidence children were getting seriously ill.
"There's no evidence yet in Australia that there's an epidemic of kids who are in hospital," he said.
"That doesn't mean it's not worth preventing, especially if you've got a safe and effective vaccine that will work - then of course children should be considered for it."
The Doherty Institute's modelling for the federal government found that including 12 to 15-year-olds in the vaccine program did not have much impact on herd immunity either.
And on priority, vaccine supplies remain tight. All the experts agreed those doses should be going to the more vulnerable groups first, and then those younger adults who are more likely to transmit it.
"Ultimately, we want supply to open up so that we can get cracking with the 20 to 40-year-olds and move on to all children really soon," Murdoch Children's Research Institute vaccination expert Associate Professor Margie Danchin said.
"I fully accept that they do come after the young people, the 20 to 40-year-olds, but that doesn't mean they're not a priority."
Those calculations are made more complicated because there is a lack of good data around children and these vaccines, Professor Curtis said.
The risk of developing severe disease also appears to be lower, but the long-term impact of the coronavirus was unclear. Research is currently being conducted in Australia on so-called long COVID and children.
But one aspect that's more difficult to quantify is the importance of schools, Associate Professor Margie Danchin said.
"That actually is something that we need to try and quantify better. And we need to factor into the decision-making more," she said. "One of our big challenges now is to correct it, collect more concrete data on the mental health and wellbeing impacts for kids separate to their learning impacts, so that we try and quantify the huge, detrimental impact of lockdown and home learning on children."
Labor MP Dr Mike Freelander said while it appears children have a lower risk of developing serious illness from COVID, it was important to include them in the vaccine rollout.
"We really do need to ramp it up, because it looks like this virus is not going to go away in a hurry," he said. "And we may well get variants that affect children even worse, we just don't know. So I think the sooner we can start vaccinating kids, particularly at-risk kids, the better."
Currently, the Pfizer vaccine is approved for use in everyone aged 16 and over. The Australian Technical Advisory Group on Immunisation has approved its use in vulnerable children aged 12 to 15, including those with underlying health conditions and Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander children. The group has flagged it will look at expanding eligibility to all 12 to 15-year-olds within two months.
Professor Curtis said Australia still has the benefit of being able to wait and learn from overseas - there are trials under way in the US on children aged 5 to 12 with Pfizer. Moderna is also looking to start trials with children.
By the time Australia has vaccinated the most vulnerable - older adults, and those with underlying conditions - towards the end of the year, more of that data will be available.
The main issue right now, Professor Curtis said, was for all other eligible people to go and get vaccinated as soon as they could.
"That's the best way we can protect kids at the moment," he said.

Full text: Premier Daniel Andrews has set an ambitious new vaccination target after Victoria recorded 15 new coronavirus cases in the past 24 hours, including several mystery infections.
Of the new cases, 11 are linked to known outbreaks, and eight were in isolation throughout their infectious period.
But a further four new cases have been added to the growing list of mystery infections, with the source of acquisition still under investigation.
In total, 40,737 people were swabbed for the virus on Thursday, while 27,427 vaccine doses were administered.
On Friday night, Chadstone Shopping Centre was listed as a Tier 2 exposure site for anyone who visited the complex on August 7 between 4.26pm and 5.40pm.
It comes as the state government set a bold new target to carry out one million vaccinations in state-run centres over the next five weeks.
AstraZeneca will be available to all Victorians over the age of 18 at all 50 of the state-run mass vaccination centres.
More than 200,000 doses will be administered each week between August 16 and September 19.
It’s hoped the drive-through clinics could be open as soon as next week.
When asked when Pfizer would be available for 18 to 39-year-olds, Covid-19 vaccine program spokeswoman Naomi Bromley said she had no immediate announcements.
“We continue to align with the commonwealth program … that will continue to be supply dependent,” Ms Bromley said.
Health Minister Martin Foley said he hoped the bold new campaign would entice people to get a move on.
“We hope this campaign will encourage anyone who hasn’t had their vaccination yet, to come forward and get it done as quickly as possible,” Mr Foley said.
“You will be protecting your friends, family and your entire community.”
Ms Bromley said the state government was usually given “vaccine supply certainty” four weeks in advance.
“That’s what we use to put our appointments in place,” she said.
There are currently 275,000 appointments available in the system.
“Now is the time to jump on and book yourself an appointment,” Ms Bromley added.
While walk up appointments still remain available, people are urged to book in a time.
Premier Daniel Andrews said: “There literally are a million reasons to get vaccinated.”
“It’s a powerful contribution that every Victorian can make”.
The Premier said he wasn’t sure how much the new advertising campaign — titled Voices for Vaccines, which will run across print, television, social media and radio — was costing the taxpayer.
But he said he stood by his comments about the state opening up once Victoria reached its 80 per cent vaccine target.
“We won’t stop at 80. We want to go as high as we can,” he said.
“To be unvaccinated, once we open up, would be a really dangerous place to be.”
Mr Andrews said he wanted to see big crowds back at the footy, but he said if wasn’t even a consideration right now.
“This is this kind of limbo period,” he said.
The Premier took to social media earlier on Friday morning to announce the new task, stating there were a “million reasons to get vaccinated”.
“I know that number might sound big, but it’s achievable – it’s about 5000 more Victorians rolling up their sleeves, each day,” the Premier wrote.
“Hundreds of thousands of Victorians have already rolled up a sleeve. We get stronger every single day.
“And young Victorians have done a big part of the lifting, in a short time too. But we need to speed up even more.”
Mr Andrews urged Victorians to come together and get the first available vaccine.
“As the chief health officer has said – the best vaccine you can get is the one you can get today,” he added.
“So if you’ve been putting it off, now’s the time to stop. The price we pay for delays is more lockdowns, more time at home, and more sick people.
“Whatever your reason – whether it’s for yourself, those you love, or for the pub down the road. Just book it in.
“Get dad off the couch and book all your housemates in too. We have a goal that we can collectively achieve. And all we need is you, and everyone you know, to make it happen.
“And when you get the vaccine — talk about it. Take that selfie, make the 5G joke, share it online and tell all your friends.”

ALERT FOR SHEPPARTON, LAKES ENTRANCE Authorities are urging regional Victorians to monitor for symptoms after Covid fragments were detected in wastewater in Shepparton and Lakes Entrance on Friday.
The Shepparton catchment includes the suburbs of Shepparton, Kialla and small parts of Shepparton North and Orrvale – anyone who was in the area from August 9 to 11 and develops symptoms should get tested.
The Lakes Entrance catchment includes the local government areas of Lakes Entrance, Lake Bunga, Kalimna, Lake Tyres and the Lake Tyres Aboriginal Trust – anyone who was in the area from August 8 to 11 and develops symptoms should get tested.
In the past month, fragments in regional Victoria have been detected in Bacchus Marsh, Benalla, Bendigo, Black Rock, Healesville, Koorlong, Somers and Wangaratta.
Authorities said detections in Benalla, Healesville and Wangaratta were not consistent with known cases and wastewater monitoring was intensified with no further viral traces found to date.
However previous detections in Phillip Island and across Melbourne have been early warning signs for positive cases that were later detected, with authorities remaining vigilant over any regional detections.

FRIDAY’S NEW CASES • Four cases are linked to Al-Taqwa College (one student and three household contacts in different households)
• Two cases are linked to City of Hobsons Bay outbreak in Newport (two are household contacts in different households)
• One case is linked to CS Square Shopping Centre in Caroline Springs (a household contact of a shopping centre staff member)
• One case is a household contact of an existing case in City of Melbourne outbreak
• One case is a household contact of the Brunswick West case
• Two cases are linked to Glenroy West Primary School (one student and one household contact)
• One case is linked to Glenroy (a student at a different primary school)
Meanwhile, three of the new cases are unlinked:
• One case works in Wyndham Vale as a delivery truck driver
• One case lives in Roxburgh Park and works in Bundoora
• One case lives in Middle Park (this case is still under investigation)

NEW SCARE AT SOUTH MELBOURNE MARKET South Melbourne Market was hit with a fresh Covid scare, with the landmark listed a Tier 1 exposure site on Thursday night.
A number of vendors were pinpointed, including Rita’s Coffee and Nuts, The Fish Shoppe, Small Town Pie Co, Emerald Hill Nursery, Vangelis Deli, Fruits on Coventry and Haqen’s Organics.
Anyone who visited these stores on August 7 between 1.30pm and 2.20pm must get tested and isolate for 14 days.
The Victorian health department listed the rest of the market as a Tier 2 exposure site last Saturday between 1.30pm and 2.20pm.
Management said the market was closed on Friday morning while the site underwent a “thorough clean”.
“The market is working with the DHHS to ensure we will be able to open as soon as possible,” they said.
Moonfish Albert Park on August 9 between 11.50am and 12.15pm and Gum Tree Good Food at Middle Park between 12.05pm and 12.42pm are also Tier 1 sites.
Western Autistic School in Laverton has closed on Friday after a confirmed case of Covid-19 was linked to the bus service used by the school.
The school’s statement said all close contacts who travelled in the specific bus with the case, while the person was “unknowingly infectious” had been identified and advised by the Department of Health to test and quarantine for 14 days.
In a statement to parents and carers sent on Thursday night, the school advised it would remain closed until all those tested and returned a negative result.
Deoples COVID-19 Victorian Exposure Sites Table

NSW RECORDS 390 NEW COVID CASES NSW has recorded 390 locally-acquired cases of Covid-19 overnight and, tragically, two more deaths.
A woman in her 40s has died in Sydney and a man in his late 90s in palliative care passed away in the Hunter overnight, Premier Gladys Berejiklian confirmed.
It comes as Queensland recorded eight new Covid cases, seven of which are linked to the Indooroopilly State High School Delta outbreak.
Premier Annastacia Palaszczuk said the case numbers were good news, and said containment of the NSW Covid situation would be the focus of national cabinet, over fears it was encroaching on the Queensland border.
All of Friday’s local cases were picked up in home quarantine – one on day 12 of isolation.

RISK OF INTERSTATE TRAVEL HIGHLIGHTED Premier Daniel Andrews won’t rule out sending authorised officers up to Sydney Airport to conduct permit checks, after airlines refused to do so.
The drastic measures, which the Premier admitted might fall outside his authoritative powers, would be done in a bid to combat more incursions from New South Wales.
It comes after two women, who later tested positive for coronavirus, were able to enter Victoria earlier this week on “bogus” permits.
“If I’ve got to put authorised officers up at Sydney Airport to stop people getting on planes, I’ll do that,” Mr Andrews said.
“I’d rather not have Victorian staff working in New South Wales … I would’ve thought that airlines might’ve been able to play that role for us … I think airlines have been pretty generously supported by taxpayers and it wouldn’t be too much to ask them to check whether someone has got a permit or not. I don’t think they’d be at the front of the queue for people that could have a whinge.”
Airline workers don’t currently hold law enforcement powers to detain, question, interview or investigate people.
Qantas last year suggested to government that health officials screen people leaving hot spots, rather than when they arrive at their destination.
A Qantas spokeswoman said that approach had not been taken up.
“Trained officials should decide who can and can’t cross state borders, not airline workers,” she said.
“It is not possible for airline workers to check whether passengers are telling the truth in their declarations, as was the case this week.”
Mr Andrews said he’d welcome a partnership between airports and airlines that would help strengthen Victoria’s permit system.
“We can’t have people, who have no valid documents, come to Victoria,” he added.
The two infected women from Sydney were ordered into hotel quarantine and later tested positive to Covid-19. Each will now be fined more than $5000.
Their actions have forced 46 travellers into a two-week quarantine and also prompted the state government to increase testing efforts for all Melbourne Airport arrivals.
Covid-19 commander Jeroen Weimar said the two cases from NSW highlighted the current risk of interstate travel.
“What on earth they thought they were doing, I can only speculate,” he said.
“There’s no point getting angry, there’s no point getting frustrated … (but) this is why we’re putting such significant barriers in place to limit all unnecessary travel between our states at this most critical point of time.”
Mr Weimar said authorities continued to “implore” airlines to undertake “as much checking as they can before people get on flights”.
“Our best endeavours so far have not resulted in the airlines undertaking significant checking of people’s entitlement to travel before they board. That has always been a source of some frustration to us,” he said.
“We’ve tried, we’ve asked, but it hasn’t happened.”
Qantas said airline workers weren’t authorised to assess ­eligibility to travel, which they said were complex and changing regularly.
Of the 6000 red-zone arrivals to Melbourne Airport in the past month, 190 people have been thrown into hotel quarantine, while 65 were returned to NSW.
Mr Weimar defended the decision to keep the women in Victoria. “Hotel quarantine was the best place for them. We’d have done nobody a service by putting them back on yet another plane, and into the Sydney community,” he said.
Friday's coronavirus case breakdown:

RACE TO TRACK MYSTERY CASES Of the four new mystery cases announced on Thursday, three are linked to two unconnected households in Glenroy, including a pupil of Glenroy West Primary School who may have been infectious for one day at school.
The other mystery case is a man from Brunswick West with social connections to exposure sites. It’s likely the case will be linked within days.
Mr Weimar said tracking down the Glenroy cases was a top priority and said he wanted to see more testing around Caroline Springs to be confident there were no further undiscovered cases.
Victoria recorded 17 other cases on Thursday, all associated with current outbreaks, and just two of these were out in the community while infectious.
Authorities revealed on Thursday a Moonee Ponds testing site traffic controller caught the virus last month after a “breach” of ­infection control rules.
He used the same bathrooms as infected people waiting to get swabbed.
“There was an overlap that should not have occurred,” Mr Weimar said.
Despite the breach, no fines or penalties will be issued.
“There’s no punitive ­regimen,” Mr Weimar added.
“We have got literally thousands of people across our testing centres, our vaccination centres, in our health services busting a gut to make this all work, so going in and penalising people … is not what we do,” he said.
Contact tracers have been able to definitively rule out any link with the traffic controller to the Hobsons Bay cluster, which has ballooned to 109 cases.
It’s still unclear where the index case for that outbreak – an Al-Taqwa College teacher – caught the virus.
NSW recorded two more deaths and 345 new cases on Thursday, with almost 152,000 people tested for the virus across greater Sydney and in other hot spots.

MORE JOIN VACCINE QUEUES Vaccine hesitancy is now at the lowest level since summer, as Covid-19 outbreaks across the country spur Australians into action to get the jab.
Government research shows 79 per cent of the population is either vaccinated or intends to be, up from 70 per cent a month ago, as the proportion of people concerned about the state of the pandemic has reached 45 per cent – the highest level in a year.
The data matches with the Melbourne Institute’s vaccine hesitancy tracker, which estimates 21.8 per cent of Australians remain hesitant.
The rate is slightly higher in Victoria and lower in NSW, which is in the grip of a worsening outbreak.
On Wednesday, 6351 Vic­torians aged under 40 were vaccinated with AstraZeneca, the most in a day so far. ­
The Herald Sun can also ­reveal aged care workers are ­finally being rushed to the front of the queue for the jab, as the deadline draws closer for them to be vaccinated if they want to keep their jobs.
They are being given a form that guarantees them access to a Covid-19 shot within a week at GP and commonwealth vaccination clinics.
National cabinet has agreed to mandate the jab for all aged care workers by September 17, with Victoria’s health department examining the most ­appropriate way to legally ­enforce that decision.

NSW CASES MAY DELAY ‘REOPENING’ Concern is mounting within the federal government that the country will not be able to reopen properly when Australia’s vaccination targets are reached if New South Wales is unable to suppress its worsening outbreak.
Under the national cabinet’s plan, the reliance on lockdowns will ease and vaccinated people will be exempt from rules once 70 per cent of eligible adults have received both jabs.
But the target is based on Doherty Institute modelling which assumes there is only low-level virus transmission when that target is reached.
With New South Wales now averaging 300 cases a day over the last week, and Premier Gladys Berejiklian suggesting driving case numbers to zero is an “aspiration”, senior federal figures fear other states including Victoria will be unwilling to reopen as expected.
Scott Morrison reiterated this week NSW could not “give up” on the lockdown and needed to “make sure it works”. “The lockdown is important to suppress the virus. So when we get to the next phase, we go in stronger, not weaker,” the Prime Minister said.
“Too many Australians have done too much to put us in a strong position.
“We have to get those case numbers down, because when we get to that next phase and we’re at 70 per cent, I want us to go into that phase as strong as we can.”

Full text: Victoria has recorded 15 new coronavirus cases in the past 24 hours, as more mystery infections emerge.
Of the new cases, 11 are linked to known outbreaks, and eight were in isolation throughout their infectious period.
But a further four new cases have been added to the growing list of mystery infections, with the source of acquisition still under investigation.
In total, 40,737 people were swabbed for the virus on Thursday, while 27,427 vaccine doses were administered.
It comes as South Melbourne Market was hit with a fresh Covid scare, with the landmark listed a Tier 1 exposure site on Thursday night.
A number of vendors were pinpointed, including Rita’s Coffee and Nuts, The Fish Shoppe, Small Town Pie Co, Emerald Hill Nursery, Vangelis Deli, Fruits on Coventry and Haqen’s Organics.
Anyone who visited these stores on August 7 between 1.30pm and 2.20pm must get tested and isolate for 14 days.
The Victorian health department listed the rest of the market as a Tier 2 exposure site last Saturday between 1.30pm and 2.20pm.
Management said the market would be closed on Friday while the site undergoes a “thorough clean”.
“The market is working with the DHHS to ensure we will be able to open as soon as possible,” they said.
Moonfish Albert Park on August 9 between 11.50am and 12.15pm and Gum Tree Good Food at Middle Park between 12.05pm and 12.42pm are also Tier 1 sites.
Western Autistic School in Laverton has closed today after a confirmed case of Covid-19 was linked to the bus service used by the school.
The school’s statement said all close contacts who travelled in the specific bus with the case, while the person was “unknowingly infectious” had been identified and advised by the Department of Health to test and quarantine for 14 days.
In a statement to parents and carers sent on Thursday night, the school advised it would remain closed until all those tested and returned a negative result.

RISK OF INTERSTATE TRAVEL HIGHLIGHTED Airlines flying into Melbourne from interstate red zones are refusing to check travel permits before passengers board.
It comes after revelations two infected women from Sydney were allowed to fly to Melbourne despite having “completely invalid and inappropriate” green zone permits.
The pair was ordered into hotel quarantine and later tested positive to Covid-19. Each will now be fined more than $5000.
Their actions have forced 46 travellers into a two-week quarantine and also prompted the state government to increase testing efforts for all Melbourne Airport arrivals.
It comes as contact tracers chase down four new mystery cases, from 21 new infections, and a worsening western suburbs outbreak.
Covid-19 commander Jeroen Weimar said the two cases from NSW highlighted the current risk of interstate travel.
“What on earth they thought they were doing, I can only speculate,” he said.
“There’s no point getting angry, there’s no point getting frustrated … (but) this is why we’re putting such significant barriers in place to limit all unnecessary travel between our states at this most critical point of time.”
Mr Weimar said authorities continued to “implore” airlines to undertake “as much checking as they can before people get on flights”.
“Our best endeavours so far have not resulted in the airlines undertaking significant checking of people’s entitlement to travel before they board. That has always been a source of some frustration to us,” he said.
“We’ve tried, we’ve asked, but it hasn’t happened.”
Qantas said airline workers weren’t authorised to assess ­eligibility to travel, which they said were complex and changing regularly.
Of the 6000 red-zone arrivals to Melbourne Airport in the past month, 190 people have been thrown into hotel quarantine, while 65 were returned to NSW.
Mr Weimar defended the decision to keep the women in Victoria. “Hotel quarantine was the best place for them. We’d have done nobody a service by putting them back on yet another plane, and into the Sydney community,” he said.
Of the four new mystery cases announced on Thursday, three are linked to two unconnected households in Glenroy, including a pupil of Glenroy West primary school who may have been infectious for one day at school.
Deoples COVID-19 Victorian Exposure Sites Table
The other mystery case is a man from Brunswick West with social connections to exposure sites. It’s likely the case will be linked within days.
Mr Weimar said tracking down the Glenroy cases was a top priority and said he wanted to see more testing around Caroline Springs to be confident there were no further undiscovered cases.
Victoria recorded 17 other cases on Thursday, all associated with current outbreaks, and just two of these were out in the community while infectious.
Authorities revealed on Thursday a Moonee Ponds testing site traffic controller caught the virus last month after a “breach” of ­infection control rules.
He used the same bathrooms as infected people waiting to get swabbed.
“There was an overlap that should not have occurred,” Mr Weimar said.
Despite the breach, no fines or penalties will be issued.
“There’s no punitive ­regimen,” Mr Weimar added.
“We have got literally thousands of people across our testing centres, our vaccination centres, in our health services busting a gut to make this all work, so going in and penalising people … is not what we do,” he said.
Cluster Map
Contact tracers have been able to definitively rule out any link with the traffic controller to the Hobsons Bay cluster, which has ballooned to 109 cases.
It’s still unclear where the index case for that outbreak – an Al-Taqwa College teacher – caught the virus.
NSW recorded two more deaths and 345 new cases on Thursday, with almost 152,000 people tested for the virus across greater Sydney and in other hot spots.
Vic Locally-acquired Covid-19

MORE JOIN VACCINE QUEUES Vaccine hesitancy is now at the lowest level since summer, as Covid-19 outbreaks across the country spur Australians into action to get the jab.
Government research shows 79 per cent of the population is either vaccinated or intends to be, up from 70 per cent a month ago, as the proportion of people concerned about the state of the pandemic has reached 45 per cent – the highest level in a year.
The data matches with the Melbourne Institute’s vaccine hesitancy tracker, which estimates 21.8 per cent of Australians remain hesitant.
The rate is slightly higher in Victoria and lower in NSW, which is in the grip of a worsening outbreak.
Victoria Vaccine Locator
Victoria’s Covid-19 commander Jeroen Weimar has flagged a further ­expansion of the state’s vaccine program in coming days.
“I’ve got 240,000 appointments left to hand out over the next few weeks,” Mr Weimar said. “I’d love to see those being taken up but we will have more to say about that.”
On Wednesday, 6351 Vic­torians aged under 40 were vaccinated with AstraZeneca, the most in a day so far. ­
The Herald Sun can also ­reveal aged care workers are ­finally being rushed to the front of the queue for the jab, as the deadline draws closer for them to be vaccinated if they want to keep their jobs.
They are being given a form that guarantees them access to a Covid-19 shot within a week at GP and commonwealth vaccination clinics.
National cabinet has agreed to mandate the jab for all aged care workers by September 17, with Victoria’s health department examining the most ­appropriate way to legally ­enforce that decision.

NSW CASES MAY DELAY ‘REOPENING’ Concern is mounting within the federal government that the country will not be able to reopen properly when Australia’s vaccination targets are reached if New South Wales is unable to suppress its worsening outbreak.
Under the national cabinet’s plan, the reliance on lockdowns will ease and vaccinated people will be exempt from rules once 70 per cent of eligible adults have received both jabs.
But the target is based on Doherty Institute modelling which assumes there is only low-level virus transmission when that target is reached.
With New South Wales now averaging 300 cases a day over the last week, and Premier Gladys Berejiklian suggesting driving case numbers to zero is an “aspiration”, senior federal figures fear other states including Victoria will be unwilling to reopen as expected.
Scott Morrison reiterated this week NSW could not “give up” on the lockdown and needed to “make sure it works”. “The lockdown is important to suppress the virus. So when we get to the next phase, we go in stronger, not weaker,” the Prime Minister said.
“Too many Australians have done too much to put us in a strong position.
“We have to get those case numbers down, because when we get to that next phase and we’re at 70 per cent, I want us to go into that phase as strong as we can.”

There's no defence for reckless reopening plan

Full text: The Prime Minister has released the findings of the Doherty Institute modelling that informed the vaccination thresholds for the National Plan to reopen Australia. It shows that their four-phase plan is extremely risky.
To move to phases B and C of the plan - where COVID-19 would circulate in the community with only low-level restrictions - there needs to be near-perfect test, trace, and isolate capabilities to keep COVID-19 under control. If these capabilities are not up to scratch, the only options are either a high death toll, or more lockdowns.
And the policy changes in phase C - where the government said vaccinated people would be exempt from any domestic restrictions - are not reflected in the modelling. Such exemptions would likely undermine the effectiveness of containment measures. The Doherty model looked at how different population vaccination levels would reduce the time needed to stay in strict lockdowns and control an outbreak if optimal test, trace, isolate, and quarantine measures, and other baseline restrictions (such as capacity limits) remained in place.
It found that light restrictions combined with test, trace, and isolate measures would not be enough to constrain an outbreak when only 50 or 60 per cent of the population aged 16 or older is vaccinated. The modelling shows that at 70 and 80 per cent vaccination, baseline restrictions and "optimal" test, trace, and isolate measures would be enough.
It showed they would more than halve the effective reproduction number - the average number of people an infectious person infects - of the Delta variant. This represents a significant drop in infectiousness.
The question then is: can these "optimal" test, trace, and isolate capabilities be translated into the real world? It is unclear whether state governments' systems are up to it, especially given that tracing is notoriously difficult when case numbers are very high.
The recent lockdown in Victoria shows it felt it could not rely on its test, trace, and isolate system, even with a low initial spread, because of the infectiousness of Delta.
The Doherty modelling showed that under the 70 per cent vaccination scenario, with only baseline restrictions and partially effective test, trace, isolate, and quarantine capacities, there would be 290,000 cases and about 2000 deaths within the first 180 days.
If this spread threatened the health system, state governments would have to impose restrictions such as lockdowns to get it under control, as the plan acknowledges.
And for phase C - where the government committed to an 80 per cent vaccination threshold - there is no modelling on the impact of the policy changes on containment measures. The government's plan exempts vaccinated people from any domestic restrictions, even though vaccinated people can still spread COVID-19. Such exemptions would undermine optimal testing, tracing, isolation, and quarantine, and increase the risk of needing lockdowns.
At the same time the plan significantly curtails the ability of state governments to impose lockdowns, again by exempting the vaccinated from them. That is less likely to work than a population-wide lockdown, not only because vaccinated people can spread COVID-19 but because enforcement would be very difficult. The government is undermining its first line of defence - testing, tracing, isolating, and quarantine - and its last line of defence - lockdowns - at a level of vaccination where its own modelling suggests both of those lines of defence will be important.
The good news is the government has released the modelling that informed its thinking on the thresholds for phase B. The bad news is the plan - which was crafted by governments, not by the modellers - is reckless.
The national cabinet should not be pulling a trigger too early and consign Australia to even more lockdowns and a higher number of COVID-19 deaths - or a combination of the two.

Full text: GETTING younger people vaccinated will be the key to ending the cycle of lockdowns, in what would be a major shift in the national rollout.
Modelling shows fewer ­people will die if the vaccine rollout is broadened for all ages, so young Australians get jabbed faster.
The long-awaited Doherty report modelling revealed that Australia’s vaccination rollout now needed to target people aged 20-39, who will be the super spreaders passing the Covid-19 on to their children and parents.
It means the vaccine rollout will be expanded to 30-39-year-olds from the end of this month or early September and to 16-to-29-year-olds from October.
Meanwhile, the federal government’s Covid vaccine taskforce boss Lieutenant-General JJ Frewen on Tuesday night ­released an updated vaccine rollout plan, which revealed mass workplace vaccinations could be rolled out from ­September as more Pfizer and potentially Moderna supplies come on-board.
Drive-through vaccination clinics and jabs in super­markets would be considered from October, which could be run by state or Commonwealth governments, but the plan warned these options would vary based on local preferences and demographics.
The Doherty Institute modelling revealed that even if we hit an 80 per vaccination rate, about 1300 people would die over six months in an out-of-control outbreak with minimal restrictions.
But this is compared with 9000 deaths at a 50 per cent vaccination rate, while in 2017 about 1200 people died from the flu in Australia.
Doherty Institute’s Professor Jodie McVernon said that the strategy now should be bringing forward immunisation to the 30-39 age group to the beginning of September and the 16-29 age group to early October.
Professor McVernon described it as a “strategic shift” to target transmission of the virus and stop people getting exposed in the first place, now that the most vulnerable in the community were immunised.
“By vaccinating parents, you protect children … adverse health outcomes in children are dramatically reduced by this strategy as well,” she said.
“It’s really the 20-39 years that are peak spreaders. They will bring Covid to their children and to their parents and this is the group where we’re proposing the reorientation of the (rollout).” The modelling shows following an “oldest first” vaccination strategy would see up to 2300 people die in the event of an uncontrolled six-month outbreak, compared with 1300 deaths under the “all ages” ­approach.
But Professor McVernon said even after the nation hit the 80 per cent vaccination mark across all age groups, some measures such as masks, social distancing and capacity limits for restaurants or stadiums could still be needed in the event of an outbreak, even if full lockdowns were not.
“They’re the sort of settings that often we see as we come back out of lockdowns, having still some level of spacing of people in the community but without full lockdown,” Professor McVernon said.
Prime Minister Scott Morrison said it was about finding a path to living with the virus.
“When you get it down to 80 per cent, the sort of death, hospitalisation and infection rates is what you expect to see with something like the flu,” Mr Morrison said.
Treasury modelling released on Tuesday also revealed the devastating cost of lockdowns. But it also found short, sharp lockdowns minimised the hit to the economy under the Delta strain currently, rather than allowing higher levels of community transmission to take hold.
Nationwide, level-four restrictions, as seen at the height of the Melbourne lockdown, would cost the economy $3.2bn a week.
But if the nation can use just low-level restrictions once vaccination hits 70 per cent and higher, such as the 2sq m rule and no border restrictions, the cost of outbreaks would drop to just $200m a week.
Treasurer Josh Frydenberg said the numbers outlined the importance of Australians getting vaccinated. “It is the way out of this crisis and it is the way to avoid, in the future, longer, more severe lockdowns,” Mr Frydenberg said. Chamber of Commerce and Industry Queensland Policy and Advocacy general manager Amanda Rohan said that the snap lockdowns were ­creating uncertainty and had an “immeasurable impact” on businesses.
“This is the fourth snap lockdown this year, but since the first one in January we have been calling for businesses to be afforded certainty in lockdown and restriction ­decision making, including effective vaccine rollout, so they are well placed to plan their recovery and journey back to business as soon as possible after a lockdown,’ she said.
LIVING WITH COVID-19 In a six-month nationwide Covid-19 outbreak, this is how the Doherty Institute expects the virus will spread, based on different levels of vaccination coverage.
LIKELIHOOD OF LOCKDOWNS If tracing, testing, isolation and quarantine measures are working at an optimal level, the nation would need to be in lockdown 35 per cent of the time if only half the adult population is fully vaccinated. The likelihood of lockdowns becomes zero once more than 70 per cent are vaccinated.
IF CONTAINMENT MEASURES ARE STRUGGLING This forecast assumes tracking, tracing, isolation and quarantine measures are only partially effective as the virus spreads. With 25,756 hospital ward beds and 1964 ICU beds available nationwide, hospitals would be overrun by Covid-19 patients, causing chaos for patients with other health problems.
VACCINE COVERAGE 50% 60% 70% 80% Symptomatic infections 1,124,136 703,688 309,362 230,164 Ward admissions 49,242 27,542 13,698 7,699 ICU admissions* 11,844 6,296 2,966 1,628 Deaths 10,443 4,702 1,908 996 IF CONTAINMENT MEASURES ARE WORKING This forecast assumes tracking, tracing, isolation and quarantine measures are performing at an optimal level as the virus spreads. The hospital system would have the capacity to keep up with Covid-19 cases.
VACCINE COVERAGE 50% 60% 70% 80% Symptomatic infections 113,553 6,551 2,762 1,160 Ward admissions 4,132 227 96 40 ICU admissions* 953 52 22 9 Deaths 726 39 17 7 BASELINE RESTRICTIONS These scenarios assume these health rules are maintained: ■ 2sqm density rule in hospitality venues ■ 1.5sqm density rule in offices ■ Crowd caps on major events ■ Schools and childcare open as normal ■ Interstate travel allowed without border closures ■ No stay-at-home orders

“This is the fourth snap lockdown this year, but since the first one in January we have been calling for businesses to be afforded certainty in lockdown and restriction ­decision making, including effective vaccine rollout, so they are well placed to plan their recovery and journey back to business as soon as possible after a lockdown,’ she said.
LIVING WITH COVID-19 In a six-month nationwide Covid-19 outbreak, this is how the Doherty Institute expects the virus will spread, based on different levels of vaccination coverage.
LIKELIHOOD OF LOCKDOWNS If tracing, testing, isolation and quarantine measures are working at an optimal level, the nation would need to be in lockdown 35 per cent of the time if only half the adult population is fully vaccinated. The likelihood of lockdowns becomes zero once more than 70 per cent are vaccinated.
IF CONTAINMENT MEASURES ARE STRUGGLING This forecast assumes tracking, tracing, isolation and quarantine measures are only partially effective as the virus spreads. With 25,756 hospital ward beds and 1964 ICU beds available nationwide, hospitals would be overrun by Covid-19 patients, causing chaos for patients with other health problems.
VACCINE COVERAGE 50% 60% 70% 80% Symptomatic infections 1,124,136 703,688 309,362 230,164 Ward admissions 49,242 27,542 13,698 7,699 ICU admissions* 11,844 6,296 2,966 1,628 Deaths 10,443 4,702 1,908 996 IF CONTAINMENT MEASURES ARE WORKING This forecast assumes tracking, tracing, isolation and quarantine measures are performing at an optimal level as the virus spreads. The hospital system would have the capacity to keep up with Covid-19 cases.
VACCINE COVERAGE 50% 60% 70% 80% Symptomatic infections 113,553 6,551 2,762 1,160 Ward admissions 4,132 227 96 40 ICU admissions* 953 52 22 9 Deaths 726 39 17 7 BASELINE RESTRICTIONS These scenarios assume these health rules are maintained: ■ 2sqm density rule in hospitality venues ■ 1.5sqm density rule in offices ■ Crowd caps on major events ■ Schools and childcare open as normal ■ Interstate travel allowed without border closures ■ No stay-at-home orders

Full text: It seems like a lifetime ago that a character called Malcolm Turnbull asked for the nation to improve its collective agility.
Well, maybe not in so many words but it's a reasonable interpretation of the-then newly elected Prime Minister's quote.
"In an age of rapid disruption and volatility you've got to be much more agile and that means you have to be prepared to embrace different ways of doing things" were his exact words.
That was mid-September 2015. Oh, how the world has changed. And with great respect, Mr T, disruption has gone to new levels and the general populace's agility levels are now equal to that of wannabe Olympic gymnast most days. But hey, a pandemic will probably do that.
Today Prime Minister Scott Morrison revealed new modelling from the Peter Doherty Institute for Infection and Immunity and it showed that vaccinating younger people would be the most effective strategy to slow down virus outbreaks.
The institute director of epidemiology Jodie McVernon put it simply: "By vaccinating parents, you protect children."
Professor McVernon identified young adults as peak transmitters, but said the modelling showed vaccinating children is "not an efficient strategy" right now.
Research over the next six months, she said, would look at the best approaches for children, balancing their health and education needs. Hang tough, parents.

Also released today was data from Operation COVID Shield - otherwise known as regional vaccination rates up until August 1.
More disadvantaged parts of Australia, including COVID-hit south-west Sydney, have some of the country's lowest vaccination rates.

Path from lockdown hinges on vaccination

Publication info: Sydney Morning Herald ; Sydney, N.S.W. [Sydney, N.S.W]. 04 Aug 2021: 7.

Full text: Australia's proposed path out of harsh restrictions depends on optimal quarantine systems, contact tracing and social distancing - and lockdowns will probably still be needed.
Modelling commissioned by the Doherty Institute for the federal government found the country could move to phase B of the national road map out of the pandemic once 70 per cent of the eligible population was fully immunised.
It also shows opening up the COVID-19 vaccine rollout to all eligible adults rather than continuing to focus on vulnerable Australians will boost the level of community protection. "At 70 per cent, we're at a position where the light, low public health and social measures ... [and] an effective and well-preserved public health response could help to turn what might otherwise be a bushfire into more of a controlled backburn, and keep case numbers low," the Doherty Institute's Professor Jodie McVernon said.
But the Grattan Institute's Dr Stephen Duckett said the modelling came with a large caveat. "To what extent do we think our test, tracing and isolation is 'gold standard'?" he said. "If you think it is not, when there is lots of virus circulating, according to [the Doherty Institute], somewhere between 18 and 39 per cent of the time we'd have to be in hard Victorian-style lockdowns."
The Grattan Institute last week published its own modelling, saying the country could move to phase B of reopening only when 80 per cent of the Australian population was immunised. Its modelling found Australia could move away from economically damaging, tough restrictions with 70 per cent of eligible adults vaccinated, but only if testing, tracing, isolating and quarantine measures remained at the optimal levels seen in NSW during the Christmas and new year outbreaks.
If cases grew and stressed the health system to a point where testing and tracing lagged strict level-four lockdowns would be needed about 22 per cent of the time, it said.
UNSW epidemiologist Professor Mary-Louise McLaws said the Doherty modelling "really pulled its punches", as the 70 per cent target would not leave enough Australians protected. "That's 56 per cent of the total population. That means one in two people are not protected," she said.
Without going for an "aspirational herd immunity" target, Professor McLaws said the modelling left governments relying too heavily on the success of public health measures.

Vaccinated get 'special' rules in PM's unified plan

Full text: Vaccinated Australians will get special rules to avoid some lockdown restrictions once 70 per cent of the eligible adult population have had two vaccine doses, and international border rules will be loosened to allow more people to come home.
Once the national vaccination total hits 80 per cent, broad lockdowns will not be used in major cities, caps on returning Australians will be abolished and all restrictions on vaccinated travellers leaving the country will be removed.
Prime Minister Scott Morrison said national cabinet had agreed to the plans yesterday after considering scientific modelling from the Doherty Institute and economic advice from Treasury.
"So if you get vaccinated, there will be special rules that apply to you. Why? Because if you're vaccinated, you present less of a public health risk. You are less likely to get the virus. You are less likely to transmit it," he said last night.
Mr Morrison said lockdowns would continue to be used to deal with COVID-19, but the national plan would give Australians a clear path out of the restrictions.
Under the plan, states will have to individually hit the target vaccination levels as well as the nation.
The special rules for vaccinated Australians will be considered by a working group made up of the Northern Territory, Victoria and Tasmania.
The Prime Minister said the lesson from dealing with the Delta variant was that "early and stringent lockdowns" were necessary to deal with outbreaks, and that would be kept in mind during the suppression phase.
But once the vaccination targets were hit, Mr Morrison said states would open up.
"I can tell you there is no state or jurisdiction in the country that wants to apply a lockdown or hold Australians back," he said.
The plan includes four phases: suppression, transition, consolidation and the final phase. Australia is in the suppression phase, but will move to the second phase when the 70 per cent target is hit.
In the transition phase, the goal is to minimise serious illness, hospitalisation and deaths from COVID-19. Mr Morrison said lockdowns would be less likely but still possible. Restrictions would be eased for people who were fully vaccinated because they were less of a public health risk.
There will still be inbound passenger caps but they will return to previous levels for unvaccinated travellers, and have higher caps for vaccinated returning Australians. There will also be a limited entry of student and economic visa holders allowed.
Once the 80 per cent target is reached, all Australians who are vaccinated will be able to return to the country, caps on students and economic visa-holders will increase, and the government will seek to set up travel bubbles with other countries. At this point, vaccinated residents would be exempt from all restrictions.
Mr Morrison says he's been greatly encouraged by the take-up of the AstraZeneca vaccine over the past month - and in all states, not just NSW.
"If you want to get vaccinated, the AZ vaccine is there for you, it is a highly effective vaccine, as we've seen all around the world," he said.
The Prime Minister had previously praised NSW Premier Gladys Berejiklian for refusing to lock down during a Delta outbreak that has now spread around Sydney, but yesterday said he didn't have "perfect hindsight".
"People were acting on the information they had. No one has perfect hindsight over these issues and the Delta strain is a strain that we've sought to understand and learn and react to and respond to," he said.
"We've all humbly learned from these things, and then we make the adjustments and get on with it."
University of Melbourne professor of epidemiology Tony Blakely backed the idea of a vaccination target as a way to motivate people but said the country could not ease all restrictions once the target was reached.
Professor Blakely said some of the modelling was "the right answer to the wrong question" because governments would have to offer vaccines to everyone, including children, and adjust their settings in light of the results.
New variants and further breakouts would mean that no vaccination rate was likely to allow Australia to open its borders without restriction. "We talk about opening the borders but it won't be to all countries all of the time," he said.
Professor Blakely said Australia would need a vaccination rate of 90 per cent to reach herd immunity, while 50 or 60 per cent would not be high enough to avoid lockdowns.

Coronavirus: More than 400 unaccompanied Australian children stranded overseas

Full text: Deputy secretary of the Department of Foreign Affairs, Tony Sheehan, told the committee on Friday there were 38,523 Australians registered with the department as seeking to return home.
The number of foreign arrivals was halved to 3034 a week earlier this month over a spike in Delta cases.
In India there are 10,268 Australians registered and in the UK, 6,405. In the US 2440 Australians have lodged their desire to return home and in Thailand 1078. DFAT also has 1018 Australians listed in Pakistan and another 994 in the Philippines.
Mr Sheehan revealed that 438 unaccompanied minors were still stranded overseas and 6,039 Australians had expressed a wish to only come back from September of this year.
As the Morrison government comes under pressure to build dedicated quarantine facilities to supplement the hotel system, Tasmanian Senator Jacqui Lambie asked whether Christmas Island could be used to house returning Australians.
Alison Frame, a deputy secretary at the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet, said officials had looked at Christmas Island as an option, however the facility did not meet the national criteria of being close to an international airport or a tertiary hospital.
Senator Lambie asked why it was “good enough to put refugees over there for years on end … but you can’t bring our own travellers back”, to which Ms Frame replied that those suffering from Covid-19 would need access to better medical services than were available on the island.
“The specific medical needs of people who come back at higher risk of having Covid require additional considerations about proximity to a tertiary hospital,” she said.
The committee also heard that while there were only 1,279 people accommodated at the Howard Springs quarantine facility in the Northern Territory that number was likely to ramp up in August due to an increase in repatriation flights.
Officials explained that while 2,000 was the absolute maximum capacity at Howard Springs, it was difficult to reach that level because the facility was divided into “neighbourhoods” that only held passengers from the same flight.
It was heard that about 360 members of the Australian Olympic team will quarantine at the Darwin facility after competing in Tokyo, but officials played down suggestions the athletes would displace those wishing to return home.
“No … and they are of course returning Australians,” Mr Sheehan said. “They were being discussed previously before other flights were organised, so I think the Northern Territory has done an excellent job of ensuring that the use of Howard Springs will be maximised through the period,” he said.
Pressed by Labor Senator Kristina Keneally about a March ministerial briefing document she had obtained that suggested a notional opening of the international borders on November 1, Australian Border Force boss Mike Pezzullo said that date was not set in stone.
He would not confirm if a new date had been set for reopening due to the “changing nature of the virus” and reiterated that Scott Morrison had since unveiled a four-phase pathway towards international travel. Mr Pezzullo said Australia was still in the first phase.
“Since the time of that publication, the decisions taken by the National cabinet in relation to the four phase or step approach...,” he said. “There are different components that step you out to a reopened border, very gradually.”
Mr Pezzullo said that while closing the border was a “relatively brute force operation”, reopening it was “more like a Swiss watch”.
Last month, the Prime Minister asked experts at the Doherty Institute, a Melbourne-based research hub on infectious diseases, to work on modelling to determine what level of vaccination Australia would need to “return to normal.” National Cabinet will discuss those figures on Friday.

With the Covid vaccines lowering the chances of a jabbed person having a serious illness, health experts in the most vaccinated nations are reducing their focus on non-symptomatic or mild cases in their policy settings.
The latest long-term Covid-19 control modelling from Melbourne’s Burnet Insti­tute also finds that switching to hospitalisation rates as a trigger for restrictions would safely allow Victorians to spend less time under restrictions in the future.
However, Burnet deputy ­director Margaret Hellard warned Australia was still ­nowhere near the levels of vaccination required to make the switch away from counting total case numbers.
Once 70 per cent of people under 60 and 95 per cent of seniors vaccinated against Covid, Australia may be in a position to change its focus, the modelling finds.
“One you are vaccinated, your proportion of people who will get sick and are hospitalised is markedly different to your number of cases,” Professor Hellard said.
“There are a number of countries who are asking the question, ‘do we look at the number of infections, or do we look at the impact of infections on hospitalisation’.
“But we have to reach high levels of vaccination before we can have the luxury of that conversation.” According to the latest Burnet modelling, Victorians could still spend between 280 and 350 days a year under some restrictions despite having high vaccination rates if a seven-day average of daily case numbers continued to be used as a threshold.
But if the mild cases were ignored and the threshold was instead changed to having fewer than 100 Covid patients in the state’s hospitals, the modelling shows restrictions could only be needed for ­between 115 and 220 days.
“Without herd immunity if restrictions are lifted exponential growth resumes. However, using hospital usage as a trigger threshold for restrictions may lead to less overall time under restrictions while still achieving adequate health outcomes,” the report found. grant.mcarthur@news.com.au

Scientists torn over whether city's lockdown is enough to tame Delta

Full text: New modelling from multiple sources suggests Sydney's lockdown is still not tight enough to stop case numbers from growing.
As new locally acquired cases reached a record 239 in NSW yesterday, independent models from the University of Sydney, University of Western Australia and the federal government show the city needs tighter restrictions to control its outbreak.
Other models are still optimistic, predicting the outbreak could be brought under control in one to three months. But one team is so concerned about Delta spread it is now modelling stage five restrictions, where "nobody goes outside the door".
The NSW government has been gradually tightening rules since the outbreak began last month, although it now plans to reopen the construction sector and allow year 12 students back to class.
NSW Premier Gladys Berejiklian has dismissed calls for a tougher, Victorian-style lockdown, similar to the one used by Melbourne at the height of its second wave of coronavirus.
Scientists often caution modelling should be taken with a substantial grain of salt, as a model is only as good as the data you put in.
But Sydney's outbreak continues to grow, despite the city going into lockdown more than a month ago.
"It is clear the current restrictions are not yet at the level where the suppression will be ensured in a rapid time frame. If you want to suppress it in a month, you need to do more stringent measures, that is clear," said University of Sydney COVID-19 modeller Professor Mikhail Prokopenko.
A study released yesterday by his team that has not yet been peer-reviewed found marked improvements in social distancing since earlier this month has been slowing the growth of the outbreak. But the Delta strain's heightened infectiousness meant that was still not enough, Professor Prokopenko said.
At the University of Western Australia, Professor George Milne's model also shows cases continuing to grow under current restrictions. His team is so concerned about Delta it is modelling "stage five" restrictions, where "nobody goes outside the door".
"People are saying the current lockdown measures in NSW will put a cap on cases. Our results do not suggest that," he said.
Delta is about 60 per cent more infectious than the Alpha variant of the virus, which in turn was perhaps 50 per cent more contagious than the version of the virus that first emerged in Wuhan.
"Delta has completely changed it, totally changed it," he said.
The federal government's modelling is done by a team of scientists around the country. It clearly shows the difficulty of containing Delta.
It uses a metric called transmission potential: the ability of the virus to spread. A number below 1 means cases will fall; above 1 indicates cases will rise.
If NSW was facing the version of the virus that first left Wuhan, government modelling shows a transmission potential of 0.96, which would mean the epidemic would slowly shrink. With the Delta version of the virus, that rises to 1.75.
However, the Herald understands much of this data was collected before NSW's restrictions were tightened. Scientists close to the project estimate the number is lower now, but still above 1, and point out it varies widely across Sydney.
Separate models by the Burnet Institute and the University of Melbourne are more optimistic. They find stage three restrictions introduced in Sydney on July 9 would only stabilise case numbers, while the new stage four restrictions announced on Wednesday will drive them down quickly.
But modellers now find themselves unsure if Sydney really has implemented stage four restrictions. Their modelling is based on Victorian-style restrictions which, at stage four included a curfew, the so-called "ring of steel" separating Melbourne from regional Victoria and mandatory masks inside and outside.
The NSW government is not allowing people to enter or leave the Greater Sydney area but does not include a curfew. Masks are mandatory indoors, but are only required outdoors if social distancing can't be maintained.
"There are mixed signals coming from the NSW government. We were thinking this morning maybe they are in stage three. In terms of the adherence, how the lockdown is enforced," said Dr Driss Ait Ouakrim, an epidemiologist and COVID-19 modeller at the University of Melbourne.

Full text: Scott Morrison anticipates the government would have reached its vaccine target by the festive season, after making a series of claims during a breakfast television interview on Thursday.
“I believe that will be the case, yes,” Mr Morrison told the Today show when asked whether everyone who wants a vaccination should have received one by Christmas.
“There will be the supply. We are really turning it around. We have caught up a lot of ground on this program and Australians are responding really well.
“We need that to continue not just in NSW but right around the country.”
He was also probed about whether financial assistance will continue for those in lockdown who are unable to work, even if the strict stay-at-home orders last until Christmas.
“Yeah, those payments also keep coming,” the Prime Minister said.
“What it does is, it helps people get through. It’s not supposed to replace every dollar they were earning before but, just like with the supports we gave last year … it keeps the businesses as whole as possible.”
On Wednesday he also declared Australians could be free of restrictions at Christmas if the vaccine target is reached.

“With what we are seeing, bar any unforeseen events, then I believe by the end of the year we will be in that position,” he said.
“What we are seeing overseas is when countries do reach that much higher vaccination rate … lockdowns become a thing of the past when you are at that level.
“We have a plan for that, we are setting the target scientifically, combined with the economic advice as well, and that gets us a road map to Christmas, I think, which means we will be living life differently at Christmas than we are now.”
The Doherty Institute had been tasked with modelling what would occur when a certain percentage of the population was vaccinated, and what impact further outbreaks would have on the health system at that rate.
Mr Morrison said that modelling was now being “brought together” with Treasury figures and confirmed the modelling would be released to national cabinet on Friday.
“I don’t want to say that will be resolved on Friday. It will be our first discussion, I suspect many more will be required after that, and I hope we will be able to set those targets and give more definition to phase two and phase three in that time,” he said.
About 11.5 million doses of the Covid vaccines have been administered so far, including almost 79,000 in the last 24 hours.

Kids need the jab or we’re staying shut

Full text: IN THE next few days the government expects to be given the modelling it has commissioned from the Doherty Institute which will give it an idea of how many people need to be vaccinated before we can end the lockdowns and closed borders that have made this such a winter of discontent.
Not that it will make any immediate difference of course. With less than 20 per cent of the eligible population fully vaccinated we are still a way away from seeing any meaningful change to the current regimen. The best news of the week was that the size of the eligible population is about to increase after Australia’s drug regulator approved the use of Pfizer’s vaccine for children as young as 12.
The bad news is it still needs to get the nod from the Australian Technical Advisory Group on Immunisation. As we all know by now ATAGI isn’t very popular with the government for its extremely cautious advice over the AstraZeneca vaccine.
But it isn’t just the government that has serious questions about the way it has been calculating risk.
Some senior Labor figures also think it’s crazy to base the advice on the risk from vaccination on the present case numbers in Australia.
That is because of the ease and speed at which one case can become thousands as we are currently discovering. Given there was always a chance the virus would get in here – especially since the arrival of the Delta variant – the view is ATAGI should have confined itself to answering whether the vaccine or the virus is more likely to kill you.
It would be interesting to know what, if any, pressure the government has been exerting on ATAGI behind the scenes because it seems very confident in private that it will move quickly to approve the vaccine’s use in the general population. In the first instance it is expected to be approved for those with severe neurodisabilities, Down syndrome, immunosuppression and multiple or severe learning disabilities. Approval for everyone else will take at least a month longer.
On the face of it, this confidence that ATAGI will give the vaccine the tick is difficult to understand.
The UK’s equivalent to ATAGI – with which it has been working closely – last week gave the thumbs down to the vaccine for everyone except the above group with underlying health conditions.
The US in contrast has been jabbing 12 year olds for a few months, with President Joe telling an audience this week that based on the mail he has been given from the trials currently being run by Pfizer and Moderna, he reckons they will be vaccinating younger children before the end of year.
It cannot be overstated how important this is if we are going to get back to anything resembling the world as it was before March 2020.
Because the more we are learning about kids and Covid the grimmer the picture becomes.
As you remember, when this all began last year the word from the experts was that children were less likely to catch the virus and if they did they were less likely to get very sick. That might have been true of the original model coronavirus.
Unfortunately it appears the young are as likely to get the Delta variant as adults are. And while we are waiting for definitive studies and the scientists are far from united on this, there is also growing evidence it causes more serious illness in the unvaccinated.
That’s not the only reason we have to be gloomy on this front, however. For obvious reasons, a year ago we didn’t know as much as we do today about Long Covid, which appears to affect young people more than the old.
Luckily because we have had so little SARS-CoV-2 in Australia, most of us haven’t encountered anyone with Long Covid but studies seem to suggest it affects a lot of people – between 10 per cent and 50 per cent of the infected depending on how you define it.
It’s also very nasty. Persistent symptoms include difficulty concentrating, headache, trouble sleeping, worry anxiety, memory loss or confusion and depression, along with others associated with respiratory illnesses. These are not mild symptoms either.
According to one British study of the people who said they were still suffering from them more than three months after they became ill, two-thirds said it impacted their lives on a day-to-day basis. That study found more than 400,000 people were saying they were still sick after more than a year.
As you will have noticed, many of the above symptoms relate to brain function. In another study, researchers examined MRIs from more than 700 patients taken before the pandemic. They did another three years later. Those who had since been sick and recovered from Covid-19 had more brain atrophy or shrinkage in parts of the brain that control taste, smell and memory.
The really scary thing was most of these Covid cases were mild. It’s early days but the traffic in the research coming out on this is only going one way. Given how reluctant Australia has been to run the risk of the elderly dying, do you think we are really going to open up as long as there is a risk of this happening to our children?

Full text: IN THE next few days the government expects to be given the modelling it has commissioned from the Doherty Institute which will give it an idea of how many people need to be vaccinated before we can end the lockdowns and closed borders that have made this such a winter of discontent.
Not that it will make any immediate difference of course. With less than 20 per cent of the eligible population fully vaccinated we are still a way away from seeing any meaningful change to the current regimen.
The best news of the week was that the size of the eligible population is about to increase after Australia’s drug regulator approved the use of Pfizer’s vaccine for children as young as 12.
The bad news is it still needs to get the nod from the Australian Technical Advisory Group on Immunisation.
As we all know by now ATAGI isn’t very popular with the government for its extremely cautious advice over the AstraZeneca vaccine.
But it isn’t just the government that has serious questions about the way it has been calculating risk.
Some senior Labor figures also think it’s crazy to base the advice on the risk from vaccination on the present case numbers in Australia.
That is because of the ease and speed at which one case can become thousands as we are currently discovering.
Given there was always a chance the virus would get in here – especially since the arrival of the Delta variant – the view is ATAGI should have confined itself to answering whether the vaccine or the virus is more likely to kill you.
It would be interesting to know what, if any, pressure the government has been exerting on ATAGI behind the scenes because it seems very confident in private that it will move quickly to approve the vaccine’s use in the general population.
In the first instance it is expected to be approved for those with severe neurodisabilities, Down’s syndrome, immunosuppression and multiple or severe learning disabilities. Approval for everyone else will take at least a month longer.
On the face of it, this confidence that ATAGI will give the vaccine the tick of approval is difficult to understand.
The UK’s equivalent to ATAGI – with which it has been working closely – last week gave the thumbs down to the vaccine for everyone except the above group with underlying health conditions.
The US in contrast has been jabbing 12 year olds for a few months with President Joe Biden telling an audience this week that based on the mail he has been given from the trials currently being run by Pfizer and Moderna, he reckons they will be vaccinating younger children before the end of year.
It cannot be overstated how important this is if we are going to get back to anything resembling the world as it was before March 2020.
Because the more we are learning about kids and Covid the grimmer the picture becomes.
As you remember when this all began last year, the word from the experts was that children were less likely to catch the virus and if they did they were less likely to get very sick. That might have been true of the original model coronavirus. Unfortunately it appears the young are as likely to get the Delta variant as adults are. And while we are waiting for definitive studies and the scientists are far from united on this, there is also growing evidence it causes more serious illness in the unvaccinated. That’s not the only reason we have to be gloomy on this front however. For obvious reasons, a year ago we didn’t know as much as we do today about long Covid which appears to affect young people more than the old.
Luckily because we have had so little SARS-CoV-2 in Australia most of us haven’t encountered anyone with long Covid, but studies seem to suggest it affects a lot of people – between 10 and 50 per cent of the infected depending on how you define it. It’s also very nasty.
Persistent symptoms include difficulty concentrating, headache, trouble sleeping, anxiety and depression, memory loss or confusion, along with others associated with respiratory illnesses.
These are not mild symptoms either, according to one British study of the people who said they were still suffering from them more than three months after they became ill, two-thirds of them said it impacted their lives on a day-to-day basis.
That study found there were more than 400,000 people who were saying they were still sick after more than a year.
As you will have noticed, many of the above symptoms relate to brain function. In another study, researchers examined MRIs from more than 700 patients taken before the pandemic. They did another three years later. Those who had since been sick and recovered from Covid-19 had more brain atrophy or shrinkage in parts of the brain that control taste, smell, and memory. The really scary thing was most of these Covid cases were mild. It’s early days but the traffic in the research coming out on this is only going one way.
Given how reluctant Australia has been to run the risk of the elderly dying, do you think we are ­really going to open up as long as there is a risk of this happening to our children? james.campbell@news.com.au

The weight of the world

Full text: In a pandemic punctuated by arguments between New South Wales and Victoria over the best approach to securing public health, yesterday brought an unhappy kind of unity. Australia's two largest cities, Melbourne and Sydney, were both back in lockdown at the same time.
For 5 million Melburnians,
the familiar lockdown anxiety
was palpable.
Ask Jayashri Kulkarni, a professor of psychiatry at Monash University and Alfred Health. On Thursday afternoon, several clients made emergency appointments to deal with rising unease over lockdown No.5.
"When snap lockdown happens, it isn't just the aggravation and irritation of sudden changes in plans," says Kulkarni. "It's more a post-traumatic stress-type response. People get thrown back into reliving what happened last year. I think we'll get more and more anger responses as well. I have a sense people are tired."
People like Ben Armstrong, whose Middle Eastern food outlet Atiyah opened in Federation Square nine months ago. He's now locked down for a third time.
His big plans for a business - with a unique selling point of sustainable street food featuring a carbon-neutral kitchen - are under extreme stress; high city-centre rent combined with an absence of office workers, shoppers and tourists and repeated lockdowns have drained cash reserves.
Armstrong's dream of sustainable hospitality slips further away with
each lockdown: "Who wants to organise an event because there's a risk of it being cancelled?"
Australia is a nation on the brink. What started as a brushfire in Melbourne on Tuesday, with embers drifting over the border from Sydney, had by Friday become a roaring bushfire as the Delta variant - twice as infectious as the coronavirus strain that came before it - tore southwards.
How did things unravel so quickly? On Monday, the city was basking in normality. Lockdowns were a Sydney thing; Melbourne had recorded 12 straight days of zero local cases.
Less than 10 per cent of us are immunised. But life was getting back to normal regardless: masks were off, staff were returning to workplaces.
Scroll forward to yesterday, and Victoria - and the whole nation -
had changed.
Prime Minister Scott Morrison had unveiled a new disaster payment scheme, and Victoria had more than 100 exposure sites, including Melbourne landmarks such as the MCG, Young and Jackson's pub, and Chadstone and Highpoint shopping centres. There were at least 26 active local coronavirus cases by yesterday, stemming from the NSW outbreak - where another 97 cases were recorded.
And Premier Daniel Andrews was sounding an ominous note. The Delta variant - spread at the MCG between strangers - was so infectious it "just explodes". Victoria, he said, "can't be running alongside this thing. We have to be out in front of it".
While Victoria's lockdowns have hit many groups, they've particularly affected the young. Erich Huang is a second-year computer science student at Melbourne University. Yet, the 20-year-old has barely visited the campus. Learning online for a second year has been tough and he often worries how his friends are coping.
"I really want to go back for in-person lectures and tutorials and a lot of student clubs. It's just not been part of our university experience," he says. He ponders what his university "story" will be in years to come: "I'm just afraid I'm going to have no story."
Friend Tony Hu, also 20, says while his friends are now old hands at lockdowns, not being able to travel
is upsetting.
Both, though, support the state government's snap lockdown rather than waiting for cases to spread.
Glen Iris friends Jasper McCubbin, 18, and Caydn Thompson, 19, study business at Swinburne University and both also say lockdowns are challenging socially. They are, however, relaxed about another five days at home. "I don't like it, it's not good fun, but we're kind of used to it," says McCubbin.
The Delta variant has plunged Australia into an entirely new stage of the pandemic, says Monash University's James Trauer. The epidemiologist and public health physician says the next four months will be the most crucial of the pandemic. Fast, short and sharp lockdowns are likely to be called to squash the variant, which has shown it can quickly outpace contact tracers.
Australia has the "perfect storm" for a national outbreak, he says: a largely unvaccinated population and growing cases of a highly transmissible virus scattered across our two most populous cities.
Trauer warns that as long as NSW continues trying to suppress rather than eliminate the virus, the entire country is at risk. He wants a national elimination strategy where every state in Australia uses every public health measure needed to eradicate new cases of Delta.
He says NSW must be fast and aggressive, enforce hard lockdowns, close retail shops and all non-essential services or risk isolation by hard borders from the rest of Australia for months. "If NSW continues on this path, they will be in lockdown indefinitely because the Delta variant has shown again and again it cannot
be suppressed."
Mike Toole is unsure how NSW's outbreak will end. The Burnet Institute, where the epidemiologist works, last week released scientific modelling that predicted if NSW continued on the same trajectory with its current restrictions, it would be recording 40 new cases a day by September. This modelling only projected another six weeks; beyond that is the great unknown.
What concerns Toole most is the rising number of cases with unknown chains of transmission. "They have almost 140 mystery cases where they don't know where they came from."
Toole argues it is not too late for NSW to squash the virus, but it needs a Melbourne-style lockdown with non-essential shops shut and movements limited to five kilometres from home.
NSW's existing lockdown flattens the curve but doesn't bend it downwards. "It won't be enough for NSW to come out of lockdown,"
he predicts.
The highly infectious nature of
Delta means it is a game-changer for hospitals across the country, Melbourne infectious diseases physician Michelle Ananda-
Rajah warns.
Coronavirus clusters infiltrated almost every major Melbourne hospital last year. In one outbreak at The Alfred, three cancer patients infected with the virus while receiving treatment died.
"There is just no room for error with the Delta variant, it's completely unforgiving," says Ananda-Rajah. "If it escapes in a hospital, it's going to potentially cause carnage this time around. Not only will it infect staff but it will infect patients, many of whom haven't been vaccinated and are highly vulnerable."
Ananda-Rajah wants ventilation checks at every hospital because airborne transmission is such a driver of outbreaks. "We learnt a lot last year, but I am not confident we have got on top of it."
It wasn't meant to be this way. Melbourne emerged bleary-eyed from 112 days in lockdown last year hoping never to go back. Assistance was to come in the shape of a cohort of vaccines purchased by the Morrison government that have fallen well short of promises.
The vaccination program has been, former prime minister Malcolm Turnbull says, "a phenomenal failure".
In January, Morrison said 4 million Australians would be vaccinated in April - about 20 per cent of adults. Instead, the country was by yesterday languishing at 10 per cent fully vaccinated (about 27 per cent had had a first shot).
NSW Premier Gladys Berejiklian unilaterally declared a target of 80 per cent of adults fully vaccinated before life could return to normal last week, leading some, including NSW Health Minister Brad Hazzard, to momentarily flirt with simply letting the virus rip. Berejiklian swiftly shut that idea down.
What risks should Australians tolerate when opening up? Melbourne University's Tony Blakeley and colleagues modelled this, and found somewhere between 60 and 80 per cent vaccine coverage would allow some semblance of normality to return.
Victoria's economy remains in shape to withstand its fifth lockdown, economists say, but repeated shutdowns are wearing it down.
NAB chief economist Alan Oster says recent short lockdowns in cities around Australia showed sharp rebounds in local economies. But he warns protracted lockdowns, like the one under way in Sydney, are more difficult to recover from.
Oster expects consumption of goods and services in Victoria to plummet by about 10 per cent as lockdown bites, then come roaring back when the state reopens. "So if in three weeks' time, if we're in and out, it doesn't really hurt that much."
Thursday's jobs figures for June covered most of Melbourne's last lockdown and showed Victoria with the nation's lowest unemployment rate - 4 per cent for men and 4.9 per cent
for women.
"For an economy that went through the sharpest lockdown, the hardest lockdown, there is this really strong bounce-back," says RMIT economist Leonora Risse. "If an economy is not broken in the first place, it can find its way back again."
Risse notes, though, that under-employment in Victoria shot past 10 per cent in June - easily the highest in the country, showing the May-June lockdown wasn't pain-free. People had secured jobs, "but they're not getting the hours that they need or that they hope for".
Filomena Maraventano, owner of Aldo's hair salon on Church Street in Brighton, thought she would go broke in last year's big lockdown. Now she's confident she can get through the latest shutdown and expects her loyal clientele to flock back once it's done. "I wouldn't say that about all hairdressing salons, I know some that have gone belly-up," she says.
Maraventano says successful strips have thrived through the lockdowns while the CBD slumbers. "A lot of people are working from home, they're not going to go into the city to get their hair done," she says. "Even today, when things are shut, there'll be people around [on Church Street]; they'll do their coffees, they'll do a bit of shopping, whatever they can do,
they'll do."
Along with these success stories though, measures by the government to prevent the spread of the virus have exposed tensions between public safety and personal liberties. There has been much hand-wringing over whether the pandemic has turned Australians into a nation of dobbers.
"It's a very pressured situation and there is a lot of anxiety in the community around these things," says Alan Peterson from Monash University. The sociology professor says a perception that some were not playing by the rules while others made sacrifices inflamed the public.
The news Victoria's latest outbreak was sparked by removalists breaching their permit conditions and withholding crucial information from contact tracers sparked rage. "A lot of people wouldn't know they apparently have very poor English-language skills," Peterson says.
There is often a tendency in crisis situations to want to blame particular groups, Peterson says, rather than government policies that have seen a slow vaccine rollout and permitted mass gatherings at football matches.
Lockdowns are more challenging for people facing economic insecurity, for women in abusive relationships, for the young whose social lives are disrupted and for older people facing greater isolation. "The negative health impacts of extreme loneliness may be as damaging even as smoking," says Melbourne University's Andrew Dawson, an anthropology professor. That said, he believes people are remarkably resilient.
Enforcing the rules once again will be hundreds of front-line police and protective services officers at border stops, hotel quarantine and other locations. But with each police officer displaced from their usual business, the more the community feels the impact. "It's approximately 1000 police officers that are away from their business as usual," says Police Association secretary Wayne Gatt, imploring governments to consider giving more of a role to the Australian Defence Force. "It's not sustainable for police to be deployed in their thousands in these roles endlessly."
The emotional toll of the lockdown affects many families, particularly with remote learning. "People are hesitant to go back to at-home learning and I think it's one of the biggest factors that's making families anxious," says psychologist Emily Berger.
Another prolonged lockdown could lead to a repeat of 2020's increased numbers of children presenting to emergency with mental health issues, warns Royal Children's Hospital health services research unit director Harriet Hiscock. "We have potential to see what we saw last year in terms of mental health for kids and that was a rise in anxiety, a rise in eating disorders and a rise in self-harm," she says. "Those sorts of mental health problems get worse when you feel you can't control your life and that's exactly what lockdown was last year."
Her advice to anyone struggling with restrictions is to exercise each day, connect socially and allow negative feelings. "Be OK to feel angry, upset, sad; give yourself permission," she says. "Because this is going to be overwhelming again."

Key target: immunity among elders

Full text: A lower proportion of working age Australians will need to be fully vaccinated compared to older age groups in order to move to the next phase of Australia's pandemic roadmap, but the vast majority of over 70s and other vulnerable groups will need to have had both jabs.
The Sun-Herald has learnt there will be no move from phase one to phase two of the plan - which the government hopes to achieve by the end of 2021 - before the number of over 70s who are fully vaccinated has passed at least 75 per cent and likely higher. Currently 72.9 per cent of people over 70 have had at least one jab.
The percentage of people who will have to be fully vaccinated in younger age groups is expected to be broken down into three age groups - potentially a 50-to-70-year-old cohort, a 40-to-50-year-old age group, and an 18-to-40 age group - which broadly reflects the current age groups of the rollout.
Vaccination thresholds for younger Australians will be lower than for the over 70s before the move to phase two, but will still be high.
Under the four-phase plan to reopen Australia agreed by state and federal governments, phase two - dubbed the "post-vaccination stage" - would ease restrictions on vaccinated residents, see lockdowns imposed only in extreme circumstances, restore inbound traveller caps for unvaccinated people and allow more vaccinated travellers to return.
The federal government has asked the Doherty Institute to provide modelling on vaccination targets and that work is expected back at the end of July.
Health Minister Greg Hunt told The Sun-Herald that "Australians are getting vaccinated and they realise it takes some time".
"Opening up is likely to be a graduated staircase, a series of steps. The message is clear - we have to ease off carefully and open up carefully.
"Access to vaccines for the 40-59 group is about to open up significantly. And then we have a big population, about 7 million people, between 20 and 40 years of age; and then about 1.3 million people between 16 and 20."
Mr Hunt would not comment on what the vaccination targets for different age groups would be, pointing out the Doherty Institute work had not yet been finalised. Several other members of the ministry contacted by The Sun-Herald were also shy given the sensitive nature of the work.
One minister, who asked not to be named, speculated the required vaccination rates could be 80 per cent for the vulnerable groups and over 70s, then 70 per cent and 60 per cent for lower-risk groups - but cautioned: "that's a guess".
As well as protecting over 70s, who are more likely to become seriously ill or die from COVID-19, the tiered approach is expected to set higher targets for people who are immuno-compromised and Indigenous Australians, for example.
Epidemiology chair at Deakin University Catherine Bennett; Professor Sharon Lewin, who is director of the Doherty Institute but not involved in the government work; and Burnet Institute Infectious diseases expert Suman Majumdar all backed the planned higher vaccination rates for older and vulnerable Australians before reopening.
Lieutenant-General John Frewen, who is leading the vaccine rollout, signalled last week that under 40s will be able to access Pfizer jabs in late September or early October as the number of doses arriving in the country rises to 1 million a week in late July and then up to about 1.2 million a week in August.
The final decision on what the percentage vaccination targets should be will, however, ultimately be decision taken by state and federal leaders and will take account not just of the Doherty modelling but also of the impact of closed borders and lock downs on the economy and society more broadly.
The federal government is increasingly confident that every Australian will have had a chance to be vaccinated by the end of 2021 as supply of the Pfizer vaccine ramps up and as Moderna and then Novavax vaccines arrive onshore.
Professor Lewin said higher vaccination targets for older Australians "makes a lot of sense". She suggested that reaching a high vaccination target for vulnerable groups could even be enough for Australia to progress to a new phase of the government's roadmap out of COVID restrictions.
Professor Lewin said there were two reasons for vaccination - to stop transmission and achieve herd immunity, and to protect the vulnerable and stop people getting sick.
Professor Bennett said it made sense not only to have different vaccine targets for different ages, but also particular at-risk cultural groups and occupations, such as security guards and cleaners who moved between workplaces, aged care staff and meat workers.
Dr Majumdar said the highest priority group would need to include those aged 70 or above, but should not be solely based on age and might also include people with suppressed immune systems and Indigenous Australians.

Full text: Victoria has recorded zero new coronavirus cases in the community in the past 24 hours.
Department of Health data shows there are two new cases in hotel quarantine.
The push to increase the number of vaccinated people in Victoria continues with 15,451 vaccinations administered on Monday.
Victorians also received 22,149 test results on Monday.

"The last part of this year is when we'll really see supply no longer a limiting factor," Premier Andrews said.
"That's when I think anyone who wants a jab should be able to come forward and get it; they'll get the vaccine, and then they're protected and we're all protected.
"We won't see mass numbers of people in hospital, we won't see the sort of tragedies that we have seen here and indeed in other other other parts of the world.
"Our challenge is unique in some ways because so few Australians have gotten this virus over the course of the journey. That's that's not a bad problem to have, but it is a significant challenge we don't have some of the natural immunity that many other parts of the world do."
The state government warned yesterday it has no immediate plans to downgrade any remaining red zones in Queensland and NSW.
COVID-19 restrictions are likely to be eased later this week, with a government announcement expected on Thursday.
Meanwhile, medical students and paramedics could be enlisted to administer coronavirus vaccines when the national rollout ramps up later this year.

They are considering options including drafting in trainee paramedics or final year medical students.
John Frewen, who heads the national COVID-19 vaccine task force, said all options were on the table.
"There are more GPs, there are more pharmacists, there are qualified nurses," he told the ABC.
"But then there are also workforces that might be able to be upskilled. There are classes of medical students, there's a whole range of options."
Lieutenant General Frewen said workforces could also be dispatched from one state or territory to another.
"All of these sorts of options are on the table. We're looking for every opportunity we can to accelerate the rollout," he said.
Mobile mass vaccination hubs will also be considered.

Politics of vaccine sure to change

Author: Kelly, Paul

Full text: The road map out­sources authority to the scientific experts and still leaves premiers with the ability to stage lockdowns and dictate the terms. But Morrison and Health Minister Greg Hunt stand by their core pledge – that by year’s end every Australian who wants the jab will be vaccinated. In health terms this is imperative; in political terms it is probably a survival necessity.
The next three months will be brutal damage limitation for Morrison. Australia’s rollout is one of the slowest among rich nations. A total of 6.35 million Australians or 31 per cent of the populace have had the first jab and 1.9 million or 9 per cent have had the second jab. By comparison, in the US 67 per cent of people and in Britain 80 per cent of people have had the first dose. But Australia is far ahead of New Zealand, whose first-dose rate is just half that of Australia.
Vaccine Figures
Yet the metrics will change. The metric now is rollout speed. But by late this year and early next year speed won’t be the test. There will be a new metric – coverage. To redeem his authority Morrison needs to win on coverage. If the US finishes with 70 per cent of people vaccinated and Australia has 75 per cent, then Australia wins. And that win will be accentuated by the huge difference in death rates.
Coverage will be king. The road map identifies vaccination coverage as the test for easing restrictions. Morrison can survive a slow rollout if he delivers on coverage. That will become the next and more vital test. But the reality is, if Australia cannot get well above 70 per cent fully vaccinated, that will be a failure of national leadership and proof of alarming vaccine hesitancy.
NED-4142-Vaccine-Stats
There are three key factors in Australia’s slow rollout. First, there was no urgency, unlike in the US and Britain, because in Australia people weren’t dying en masse. It was assumed we had time on our side. The Therapeutic Goods Administration conducted a “full assessment” of the AstraZeneca and Pfizer vaccines while Morrison and Brendan Murphy said there was no race – technically correct but a political blunder suggesting complacency.
Second, last March Europe denied 3.1 million doses of AstraZeneca from a pledge of 3.8 million doses. This was another hurdle after a slow start with only 700,000 doses forthcoming. Critical to rollout has been the government’s decision last year to engage in local production of AstraZeneca.
To this point 5.2 million doses of AstraZeneca have been injected but only 700,000 doses are from overseas, with most of the 4.5 million doses coming from local production. That local production decision was pivotal. By the end of the rollout there will be around 10 million AstraZeneca jabs with far more than 90 per cent being produced locally.
Hunt calls vaccine supply “the most competitive global environment imaginable”. For Australia, everything now depends on delivery of its contracted 40 million doses of Pfizer this year. This week GPs began to distribute Pfizer. Last month Australia got 1.2 million Pfizer doses; this month it is scheduled to be 2.8 million doses. So far all Pfizer supplies have arrived on time, no delays. During the last five months of this year Australia is scheduled to get 32.6 million Pfizer doses sourced from Europe. The big surge in Pfizer jabs comes in the final quarter. Morrison’s political future hinges on these Pfizer deliveries.
Another 10 million doses of Moderna are due before the year’s end and Australia has an order for 51 million doses of Novavax and expects first arrivals late this year. A critical question now becomes public motivation – the risk being many people may decide they won’t die from Covid and therefore won’t be vaccinated. The anti-vaxxer move­ment is a threat. “The real damage they do is by spreading falsehoods and undermining people’s confidence,” Hunt told the media.
But the third factor has been the most important in weakening the vaccination rollout – the medical advice from the Australian Technical Advisory Group on Immunisation advising over two stages that AstraZeneca is not preferred for under-60s. This reduced the likely pool for AstraZeneca to five million people, about a quarter of the total over-16-year-old population.
Morrison and Hunt had to follow this deeply conservative health advice. The impact was serious. Confidence in AstraZenaca collapsed. No wonder Morrison, not contradicting the medical advice, tried to encourage people last week on AstraZeneca. The vaccine that saved Britain was demonised in Australia. This highlights the political constraints the government faces. It must follow the medical advice that it can’t control; it must beware targets it can’t meet; and it must avoid public brawls with the premiers that it cannot win.
Claims that Morrison should assert himself over the premiers and ditch national cabinet are political madness. But Morrison’s recurring mistake has been sending too many mixed and contradictory messages during the rollout. The nation needs the new road map. The problem is its fragility. It is an independent body, the Risk Analysis and Response Taskforce acting on modelling advice from the Doherty Institute, that will determine the thresholds of vaccin­ation coverage allowing the country to move from one phase to another in easing restrictions.
The theory is good. But everything depends on the modelling conclusions, whether 50 per cent, 70 per cent or 80 per cent. Coverage of the over-70s will be important and that’s encouraging because 70 per cent have had their first dose. Morrison made clear the recommendation would be a “scientific”, not a “political”, number. But if the threshold is too high the country will be paralysed.
There is no fixed timetable, no certainty and no guarantee premiers will abide by the “scientific” findings. Business is right to be worried. The price Morrison paid for the road map last week was cutting international arrivals by 50 per cent as demanded by the ALP premiers. The government anticipates the transition from phase one to two before the end of the year. That is essential.
But the premiers possess the political power. Will the ALP premiers sabotage the project based on their own interests and own health advice? All progress depends on changing the metrics – from Covid cases to hospitalisation, intensive care and any deaths. Australia has had no deaths this year yet this metric is ignored in public debate.
Once Morrison sees the vaccination rollout completed – provided the coverage is relatively high – the opportunity arrives to restore his leverage and authority. The pivotal issue is: how much political harm will be done in the interim?

Full text: Pfizer vaccines were given to students at an elite Sydney private school by mistake, it’s been revealed.
Doses remain limited for frontline workers, including teachers and other vulnerable Australians, but about 160 students at St Joseph’s College were given Pfizer jabs. The revelation came as the head of Australia’s vaccine rollout, Lieutenant General John Frewen said under 40-year-olds will be able to receive Pfizer in “September or October” after “ample supplies” become available.
Hopes for Sydney’s lockdown have been raised with NSW recording 18 new cases of community transmission in the past 24 hours. Gladys Berejiklian says she will announce whether the lockdown needs to be extended at tomorrow’s update.
More than 600 nurses in Sydney are in isolation after student nurse worked shifts while infectious. Liberal MPs have identified ­national vaccination rates as low as 50 per cent as the threshold to clear the first phase of the Morrison government’s “new deal” road map to normality. In the UK, Boris Johnson has ripped up almost all coronavirus restrictions ahead of Freedom Day on July 19.
Rhiannon Down 10.30pm: Church among new NSW exposure sites
A church, a Toongabbie construction site and multiple shopping outlets are among the latest locations to be added to NSW Health’s list of exposure sites.
Worshippers at St Mary & Mina Coptic Orthodox Cathedral in Bexley have been put on high alert after the church was added to the list as a close contact venue.
The construction site at 74 Aurelia St in Toongabbie from Monday June 28 to Friday July 2 has also been added to the list, with any workers at the site during the period asked to get tested and isolate for 14 days.
Roselands Commonwealth Bank has also been added to the list with anyone who visited the branch between 8am to 5pm on Monday June 28 and Tuesday June 29 and from 8am to 3pm on Wednesday June 30 identified as a close contact.
AJ & PM Sales, Kirrawee Trade in Kirrawee, Coles and TG Farm Chickens in Hurstville, JD Sports in Wetherill Park, Bonnyrigg McDonald’s, the Woolworths in Bonnyrigg and Hillsdale, St. George Bank in Riverwood, Big W in Menai and Bondi Beach Harris Farm have also been added to the list.
Shoppers at Westfield Hurstville other than TG Farm Chickens have been put on high alert, with anyone who attended on Saturday July 3 between 1.30pm to 2.20pm asked to monitor for symptoms.
The T1 North Shore Line and T4 Eastern Suburbs and Illawarra Line from Parramatta Station to Bondi Junction Station and return have been added to the list of public transport routes.

Queensland Health has added a string of new venues to its growing list of exposure sites, as the state records one new local Covid case linked to a known cluster today.
New exposure times for the administration building of the Greek Orthodox Community of St George Brisbane church has been added to the list, in addition to several existing exposure windows.
Shoppers at the West Village Shopping Precinct in West End have also been put on high alert after Home Grown Business Fashion and Expresso XO coffee cart at the retail hub were added to the list.
World Gym Mount Gravatt in MacGregor, 7-11 Petrol Station in Moorooka and United Service Station in Loganlea have also been added to the list.
Rhiannon Down 7pm: Sixth case linked to Sydney aged care home
A sixth resident at the SummitCare’s Baulkham Hills aged care has tested positive to Covid-19 today, as the number of cases linked to the facility continue to grow.
A SummitCare spokesman confirmed that the newest case, a fully vaccinated woman whose husband had already tested positive, had been transferred to Westmead Hospital on Sunday “as a precautionary measure”.
“The resident, who until today was not positive, wanted to accompany her husband who tested positive on Saturday,” the spokesman said.
“The latest case takes the total number of positive cases to six residents, all of whom are now off site and showing no symptoms of the virus at this stage.
“Testing of residents and staff is currently underway in the facility and testing over the last 24 hours have all shown to be negative.”
Representatives from the Department of Health were onsite today to administer Covid jabs to 24 staff and residents, as the facility underwent a deep clean.
“We are working closely with the department and taking all of the strict measures to ensure the health and safety of our residents and staff, who we thank for their ongoing cooperation and support,” the spokesman said.
Yoni Bashan 6.10pm: ‘Error’ as Pfizer given to private school students
NSW Health has issued an apology over the vaccination of 163 students at Sydney’s St Joseph’s College, saying the Pfizer inoculations were only supposed to be provided to the school’s indigenous students.
Students from the top-tier private school received the sought-after vaccine after an approach was made by education officials to NSW Health in May.
Dr Teresa Anderson, Chief Executive of Sydney Local Health District, said the request was made in relation to Aboriginal students boarding at the school.
Under Commonwealth Government eligibility guidelines, Aboriginal people aged 16 to 49 are eligible for the COVID-19 vaccination due to their elevated risk of contracting the virus and developing severe complications.
“It was agreed that the Aboriginal students would be vaccinated through the state health system at Royal Prince Alfred Hospital’s vaccination hub,” Dr Anderson said.
“Through an error, the wider group of boarders in Year 12, a total of 163 students, were also vaccinated. Sydney Local Health District apologises for this error.”
Emily Cosenza 5.30pm: Child infected with Covid hospitalised
The infant child of a recently returned miner who is infected with Covid-19 was assessed in hospital at the weekend before returning to her parents in quarantine.
Premier Steven Marshall revealed that the baby was transferred to the hospital on Sunday.
“My understanding is that (the infant’s hospital visit) was for some fairly routine observations and not for treatment,” Mr Marshall said.
Formula 1: The news no one wanted to hear, the Melbourne Grand Prix has officially been cancelled due to strict Covid restrictions in Victoria.
No further details were released and the infant has since returned to the hotel where the family are quarantining.
Separately, SA Health confirmed a five-year-old girl, also infected with Covid-19, was taken to the Women’s and Children’s Hospital for assessment on Tuesday but was never admitted.
She returned to the Tom’s Court quarantine hotel later in the day.
All confirmed Covid-19 cases are moved to Tom’s Court to complete their 14 days of isolation at the facility which is situated in Adelaide’s CBD.
The miner father of the first child to go to hospital, Adam Ryan, initially tested negative when he returned to SA in late June after working at the Northern Territory Tanami mine site where other positive cases popped up.
Despite his initial negative result, he later tested positive to the virus.
Following his results, his wife Kristen and their four children, all aged under 10 years, were found to have also contracted the virus.
Their youngest child, who is less than 12 months old, was the last of the family to return a positive result on July 2.

Rhiannon Down 4.20pm: Nationwide vaccination doses pass 8.4 million jabs
The nation’s vaccine rollout has surpassed 8.4 million jabs after 146,718 doses were administered in the past 24 hours.
The figures include 4,780,305 jabs administered through the federal system, with the significant majority of 4,332,771 delivered through primary care, while 3,621,886 jabs were administered by the states and territories, according to the latest figures from the Department of Health.
Victoria had retaken the lead with 23,431 people rolling up their sleeves in the past 24 hours, taking the state’s total to 1,189,708 doses.
Locked down NSW, which recorded 18 cases today, administered 20,562 jabs in the past 24 hours bringing the state’s total to 942,221 immunisations.
Queensland came in third with 627,814 jabs in total, including 12,670 in the past 24 hours.
Some 3311 jabs were administered in aged and disability care in the same period.
Rhiannon Down 4.15pm: Shopping centre, multiple stores among new venue alerts
A hotel, Marrickville shopping centre and multiple shopping outlets are among the venues to be added to NSW’s growing list of exposure sites this afternoon.
New exposure windows have been added for the ground floor and dining room area at the Locker Room hotel at Sydney Olympic Park and Club Marconi in Bossley Park, with patrons who visited during the identified periods urged to get tested and isolate for 14 days.
Shoppers at Marrickville Metro Shopping Centre have also been put on high alert after multiple exposure windows from Saturday June 26 and Thursday July 1, with anyone who visited asked to monitor for symptoms and get tested if they appear.
JB Hi Fi Westfield Bondi Junction and Woolworths Metro Granville have also been added to the list.
Yoni Bashan 4.00pm: Preferential treatment suggestion for Pfizer jab students rejected
Richard Stokes, CEO of Australian Boarding Schools Association, defended the decision to vaccinate the students and rejected suggestions of preferential treatment.
He said NSW Health made the decision to proceed with the immunisations, not the school, and the call to do so was likely to have been well-reasoned.
“It’s the second largest boarding school in Australia with a whole bundle of students living in close confines,” he said. “They live in a dormitory close together, so I’m not surprised NSW Health made a decision based on that. This is just more people in Australia vaccinated.”

Yoni Bashan 3.25pm: Elite private school students get Pfizer jabs
Approximately 160 students from a top-tier Sydney private school were given access to the Pfizer vaccine while doses remain limited for frontline workers, including teachers, and other vulnerable Australians.
The students from St Joseph’s College in Hunter’s Hill received their first dose of the vaccine in May after school officials approached NSW Health with an inquiry about the possibility of obtaining inoculations.
In a statement provided to The Australian, the school said those inquiries were made because it houses a number of boarders from rural, remote and indigenous communities.
“The approval and administration of the vaccine was endorsed and managed by NSW Health through the Sydney Local Health District,” said the statement, signed by school principal Ross Tarlinton.
“The College proceeded to make arrangements for the administration of the approved vaccine at a centre determined by NSW Health.
“Acknowledging that the College does not determine vaccination priority, it welcomed the opportunity to offer the vaccine for students given the approvals provided and for the reasons listed above.”
The revelations have prompted anger from the NSW Teachers Federation, whose members have been arguing for months to provide teachers and other educational staff with priority access to the COVID-19 vaccine.
Many teachers still have not been able to access a vaccination given the shortage of supplies and delays in the rollout.
“We are speechless,” said Federation President Angelos Gavriolatos. “We are told that the pandemic is the great equaliser but clearly it is not. While we are trying to convince government authorities to prioritise vaccines, we see reports of privilege being extended to the already privileged.”
Mr Gavriolatos said the most recent outbreak of COVID-19 had seen 37 young adults up to the age of 19 contract the virus, with a further 25 cases reported in children under the age of 10.
“We are looking at a situation in Australia where aged care workers have yet to be vaccinated; a host of frontline workers have yet to be vaccinated. Teachers and education workers are still seeking prioritisation and now we read this – it has left us speechless,” he said.
NSW Health has been approached for comment.
Earlier today, the head of Australia’s vaccine rollout, Lieutenant General John Frewen said under 40-years-olds will be able to receive Pfizer in “September or October” after “ample supplies” become available.

The 2021 Australian F1 Grand Prix has been cancelled — the second successive year the event has been abandoned.
The event was to be held in Melbourne in November.
Organisers said the cancellation was forced “due to the restrictions and logistical challenges relating to the ongoing Covid-19 pandemic”.

David Rogers 2.30pm: RBA keeps rates on hold for 8th straight month
The Reserve Bank has left the official cash rate unchanged at a record low 0.1 per cent, as it continues to consider how to guide the nation’s recovery from the pandemic.
In a statement following the RBA’s monthly board meeting, Governor Philip Lowe said the board had decided to leave the target at 10 basis points, where it has stood since November last year.
The RBA also kept three-year bond yield target at 10 basis points.
The central bank has repeatedly said interest rates will not rise until inflation is sustainably within the two to three per cent target, which it does not expect to occur until at least 2024.
The widely-expected decision to leave the cash rate target at a record low for an eighth-consecutive month came as the RBA mulled changes to its unconventional monetary policies.

Max Maddison 2.29pm: Pfizer for under 40s ‘by September or October’
Lieutenant-General John Frewen says under 40-years-olds will be able to receive Pfizer in September or October after “ample supplies” become available.
Australians under 40 could be eligible to receive the Pfizer or Moderna jabs as early as September, based on a recent estimate from the head of the government’s COVID-19 vaccine taskforce. Lieutenant General John Frewen held talks with state and territory leaders about the vaccine rollout to plan as a major shipment of the Pfizer vaccine is expected in the coming months. Lieutenant General Frewen discussed whether more would be needed for the states such as more vaccine hubs or GPs and indicated when under 40s would be able to get an mRNA vaccine. There have been 8.2 million vaccines administered with nine per cent of Australians fully vaccinated.
After conducting “war games” designed to plan out the next phases of the vaccine rollout, Lieutenant-General Frewen said more vaccination choice would become available in the program later in the year, but he was unable to put a “hard time” on when that would occur.
“I did mention this morning I think when we get to September and October, if we’ve got the amounts of supply that we are forecast to have at those stages, that’s around about the time we may be able to look at bringing more choice into the program,” Lieutenant-General Frewen told a press conference on Tuesday afternoon.
He also said he would be meeting with business and industry on Wednesday in a bid to broaden and accelerate the rollout of the vaccination program, including workplace vaccinations.
“Tomorrow we hope to have a national level discussion about where we see industry fitting into the rollout going forward. Both our perspectives and theirs,” he said.
“I’ll be having a conversation with them around incentives maybe later in the program when we’re trying to move portions of the population towards getting vaccinated.”

Brent Read 2.01pm: Dragons sack player over lockdown party
St George Illawarra prop Paul Vaughan has been sacked by the club.
The Dragons board met on Tuesday morning, where it is understood they made the decision to terminate his contract with more than a year remaining.
Section 8.1 in Vaughan’s contract gives the club the power to tear up his deal. The clause makes it clear that players must not engage in conduct or act in a manner that is inconsistent with the best interests, image or welfare of the NRL competition or the club.
By all counts, Vaughan appears in breach of his contract by hosting a party for 12 teammates on Saturday night that breached Covid-19 protocols. His contract had a year to run and was due to pay him in excess of $800,000 in 2022.
The blunder could cost the NSW and Kangaroos prop about $500,000 — any deal with a rival club is likely to be half what he is currently earning.
It is understood other players will be forced to apologise and show some contrition publicly for their actions. They are also expected to be whacked with a financial penalty.

Jess Malcolm 1.42pm: SA eases restrictions as ACT records zero cases
The ACT has recorded no new cases of locally acquired transmission, and zero new overseas cases.
The state has officially administered 92,671 doses of vaccine.
In South Australia, authorities have eased restrictions overnight allowing unlimited visitation times in aged care facilities. Masks are also now not compulsory for visitors to aged care homes.

Jess Malcolm 12.55pm: Airports ‘ready to help reopen international borders’
Australian Airports Association CEO James Goodwin says the nation can’t continually lockdown and calls on the federal government for more clarity around its four-step plan to emerge out of Covid-19.
Mr Goodwin told Sky News airports were the “economic enablers” for the country, and that the industry is ready to assist the government to reopen international borders.
Independent Senator Rex Patrick says national cabinet’s decision to reduce the travel caps for international arrivals has been brought about by a “lack of proper quarantine facilities”. On Friday Prime Minister Scott Morrison announced commercial flights into Australia will be reduced by 50 per cent at major airports as the country deals with the highly infectious Delta strain of the coronavirus. “The Federal Government has just absolutely failed in relation to the quarantine process and of course the vaccine rollout,” Mr Patrick told Sky News. “The two jobs they were asked to do, they’ve managed to make a shambles of. “We are in the situation that we are in because of a lack of proper quarantine facilities. “This is something that should have been addressed 12 months ago. “We now see the Queensland government responding with their own plan, just as we’ve seen Victoria respond in relation to vaccines by embarking on a program to be able to produce locally the mRNA vaccine.”
“We are encouraging confidence to get back to our normal way of life and not have the fear of being locked in another state or locked down,” he said.
“We encourage the government for more details on the phases of these plans, we know airports are the enablers of economic growth and also connect family and friends with each other.”
Mr Goodwin said hopes for more quarantine free travel bubbles have been dashed by a surge in cases of the Delta strain, but that the sector is optimistic that more quarantine free travel can resume next year.
“We can’t stay closed forever.”
“Realistically we want to try and open as many safe travel corridors as we can.”

Ellen Ransley 12.45pm: Palaszczuk defends planned Tokyo trip
Queensland Premier Annastacia Palaszczuk has defended the “unprecedented” reason she will leave the country this month, despite thousands of people signing a petition calling for her to be denied an exemption to travel to Japan to secure the 2032 Olympics.
Liberal Senator Gerard Rennick says Queenslanders are fed up with Premier Annastacia Palaszczuk’s hypocrisy in planning to travel to the Tokyo Olympic Games whilst halving the number of international arrivals. An online petition to prevent the Queensland premier from travelling to Japan in a bid to secure the 2032 Olympic Games has garnered over 20,000 signatures. “I think the issue that Queenslanders have with our premier is her hypocrisy in the way she’s dealt with Covid,” Mr Rennick told Sky News. “I’ve got no problem with people travelling overseas but there’s got to be one rule for all and the problem is last week she cut international arrivals by half, and that may be the correct thing to do but if she’s going to do that, she shouldn’t then travel herself. Mr Rennick says Ms Palaszczuk needs to be consistent in her approaches to dealing with Covid. “But I think the bigger issue is last week we had the State of Origin up here on the Sunday night, she locked down on the Monday throughout the week then opened up again on the Saturday for another football game on the Sunday where tens of thousands of people could gather in this one place with no masks on. “It’s that hypocrisy between locking down on individuals and small businesses, having their livelihoods smashed, and then on the other hand travelling overseas herself or allowing big events to take place and I think that’s where people are sick and tired of the hypocrisy.”

Remy Varga 12.10pm: Andrews: Major events only when most are jabbed
Victorian Premier Daniel Andrews says major events such as the Australian Grand Prix will only go ahead when the majority of the population is vaccinated.
Mr Andrews declined to comment directly on the cancellation of the international sporting event, the cancellation of which is expected to be confirmed at 3pm on Tuesday.
But the Victorian Premier said the halving of travel caps and the slow vaccine rollout meant staging international events was “very challenging”.
“We’ll get to that point by the end of the year, once the supply of Pfizer, once Moderna and other vaccines are here and the insufficient numbers will really be able to ramp up … But until that point we have to do everything to safeguard not bringing the virus in, particularly the Delta variant,” Mr Andrews said.

Jess Malcolm 11.55am: Expect restrictions to remain in some form: Berejiklian
NSW residents will be living under some form of restrictions until at least 80 per cent of the adult population are vaccinated, Dr Kerry Chant has confirmed.
Health authorities say the public health response to the virus has had to change as it battles a surge in cases of the highly infectious Delta variant.
“Although the Delta virus is more transmissible, the way it is transmitting is still in the settings that we have known, so for instance, it transmits well in hospitality settings, in your home, it transmits in workplaces, particularly where you have a large number of people, certain workplaces,” Dr Chant said.
“We have seen some settings where we would not have traditionally seen as risks, so for instance retail, or other settings have now become a bit more our focus.
“We will be collating all of the information that we have acquired to really hone our own assessment of the settings and provide that advice to the government.”
But the NSW Premier says residents will have to wait for extra doses of Pfizer to be made available by the commonwealth until life can resume to some form of Covid-normal.
“We’ve been asking for more jabs for a long time and we know that each state is given the allocation and the matter how much I argue the case otherwise it is not going to happen,” she said.
“While it has been a stressful time for all of us, it has been an amazing learning experience on what the virus is doing now and we will take those learnings forward.”
Jess Malcolm 11.37am: Highest risk for infection is ‘in people’s homes’
Kerry Chant has rejected claims that health authorities should tighten restrictions further if case numbers do not trend down, amid concern there are a number of retail stores open that should be deemed non-essential.
While health authorities will study the type and location of cases over the next few days, Dr Chant said the highest risk place for transmission was still people’s homes.
“We will be looking at the data and the epidemiological report will be up online later today, and we will describe the settings clearly in that report where transmission has occurred,” she said.
“But it is important that people are able to go about and get essential products through lockdown. There is nothing different about this lockdown.”
Gladys Berejiklian reiterated that the NSW government did not want to put “unnecessary burdens” on its citizens.
But despite their hopes of keeping businesses open, Ms Berejiklian warned residents to stay vigilant against the virus amid the recent hospitalisation of young people with the virus.
“It is a random disease that affects people differently, we know which age groups are more vulnerable than others but we also know that it is random.”
Jess Malcolm 11.21am: Berejiklian leaves room to extend lockdown
Gladys Berejiklian has left the door open to extending the city’s lockdown, saying health authorities do not want to pre-emptively release Sydney residents from lockdown.
The NSW Premier said she wants the current lockdown to be “the only lockdown we go through” foreshadowing that the trend must be comfortably trending down to make that call.
“It is not something we have seen before, and that is why it requires a different type of response,” she said.
New daily cases in New South Wales
“We only intend for this lockdown to be the only lockdown we go through. And that will factor into our decision-making as to whether it finishes on Friday or whether we continue for a period longer.”
While admitting she wants to provide certainty, Ms Berejiklian warned life in NSW will not go back to normal quickly and that restrictions could remain in place until more vaccines become available.
“The New South Wales government is not only thinking about when we come out of lockdown, but what coming out of lockdown looks like and then in addition to that, what life looks like until the end of October when we have many more vaccines available.”
The NSW government will announce their decision tomorrow, including whether students will return to face-to-face learning.
Jess Malcolm 11.15am: Where today’s NSW cases have been recorded
NSW Chief Health Officer Kerry Chant has confirmed reports of a further aged care worker testing positive at the SummitCare Baulkham Hills aged care facility, bringing the total cluster to eight.
This includes five residents, one of which was not vaccinated, and three aged care workers.
The new aged care worker in today’s numbers had received their first AstraZeneca dose, but the two other workers were not vaccinated.
There was one further case connected to the illegal party at the Meriton Suites Waterloo, which occurred just hours after the lockdown was enforced.
The cases linked to this party have ballooned to seven, with a further five household contacts of these cases testing positive.
There are currently 26 Covid patients admitted to hospital, six of them who are in ICU and two are ventilated.
Dr Chant also urged anyone in the Bossley Park and broader Fairfield area to be vigilant for symptoms due to a number of unlinked cases in the area.
“This is a salient reminder that Covid can have an impact on you and your loved ones,” she said.
“Please as you move about the community, assume everyone has Covid, follow the public health advice, and please minimise your exposure to others, particularly in indoor settings.”
Jess Malcolm 11.02am: NSW records 18 new local cases
Hopes for Sydney’s lockdown have been raised with NSW recording 18 new cases of community transmission in the past 24 hours.
Eleven of the new cases were in isolation for all of their infectious period and five of those cases were in isolation for part of their infectious period.
Just two new cases spent time in the community whilst infectious.
16 of today’s new cases are linked to known infections.
Gladys Berejiklian said she will be able to announce whether lockdown will be lifted in tomorrow’s press conference after health authorities have closely analysed the data.
More than 32,000 people came forward for testing in the last 24 hours.
Of 26 people currently hospitalised with Covid symptoms there are six patients in ICU and two are on ventilators.
The Premier said she hoped that this would be the state’s “last lockdown’’ before the whole population has been offered vaccination.
Remy Varga 10.51am: Victoria cancels Australian Grand Prix 2021
Victorian Racing Minister Martin Pakula and Australian Grand Prix CEO Andrew Westacott are due to address the media at 3pm amid reports the international motor sports race has been cancelled.
The 2021 Australian Grand Prix was postponed to November after it was originally scheduled to take place in March. The race was dramatically cancelled at the last minute in 2020 due to the emerging pandemic.
The Herald Sun reports the Grand Prix has again been cancelled. The Australian has approached the Victorian government and the Australian Grand Prix CEO for confirmation.

Jess Malcolm 10.47am: The number needed to free Sydney from lockdown
Infectious diseases expert Peter Collignon says there is a “reasonable chance” NSW authorities can ease restrictions if case numbers come down over the next few days.
Professor Collignon said NSW must get down to 10 to 15 new cases of community transmission per day, the majority of those cases already in isolation and no mystery cases in order to release Sydney from mandatory stay-at-home orders.
“I think the lockdown has been successful in that we are not seeing an exponential or rapid rise in numbers and you remember in Melbourne last we did see that,” he told Sunrise.
“Good news is that even though the numbers are bouncing around, really they are staying at the same level.”
Professor Collignon flagged it could be extended three or four days if the numbers do not decrease to that threshold.
“When you start getting more than 30 a day that are not in isolation or majority not, there is a lot of contact tracing you have to do and that is probably at the limit of what you can do safely and satisfactorily in a short period of time.”
Lydia Lynch 10.21am: Sydney woman escapes Cairns quarantine
A Sydney woman will finish her mandatory quarantine stay at a North Queensland watch house after escaping an isolation hotel.
The woman, 32, is accused of scaling two balconies and kicking down a door to flee a Cairns quarantine hotel.
Deputy Police Commissioner Steve Gollschewski said the woman arrived from
Sydney on July 1.
She was found missing on Monday during routine hotel checks.
Police reviewed CCTV footage and arrested the woman at her mother’s house on Monday night.
Meanwhile two fines were given to people in Brisbane’s West End and Fortitude Valley who refused to wear a mask.

Max Maddison 10.11am: ‘Hypocrisy’: Palaszczuk blasted over Tokyo trip
Liberal Senator Gerard Rennick has blasted Queensland Premier Annastacia Palaszczuk for “hypocrisy”, saying if she’s calling for international arrival caps to be halved then she shouldn’t be travelling to Japan for the Olympics.
Sky News host Paul Murray says "magically" queen Annastacia Palaszczuk thinks the rules "shouldn't apply to her". Queensland Premier Palaszczuk has faced scrutiny amid plans for her to travel to Japan in a bid to secure the 2032 Olympic Games for her state.
The Queensland Senator pointed to the inconsistency with her decisions, which seemed to favour major events like State of Origin and other NRL games over small businesses and individuals who were impacted by snap lockdowns.
“But there’s got to be one rule for all. The problem is last week she cut international arrivals by half. And yeah, that might be the correct thing to do but if she’s going to do that, she shouldn’t then travel herself,” Senator Rennick told Sky News on Tuesday morning.
“I think that’s where people are a little bit sick and tired of the hypocrisy.”
He also criticised Ms Palaszczuk’s decision to place domestic travellers in hotel quarantine alongside international arrivals.
“We should have open borders at least within Australia, and to put people who come from another state where there might be one or two cases in a quarantine for two weeks is just over the top, especially when there’s probably four cases of Covid within quarantine” he said.

Lydia Lynch 10.07am: Queensland records one new ‘low-risk’ local case
One new local Covid case has been confirmed in Queensland on Tuesday.
The woman, linked to a known cluster had no symptoms.
Chief Health Officer Jeannette Young said the woman was a student nurse who was doing a placement at Logan Hospital.
The last time she visited the hospital was on June 15.
Dr Young said it was hard to determine how long she was infectious for because she had no symptoms. She was swabbed because a close contact tested positive on Monday.
“I believe it is low risk,” Dr Young said.
Four others tested positive on hotel quarantine.

Jess Malcolm 9.58am: Sydney braces for critical numbers update
Gladys Berejiklian will give her Covid-19 update at 11am, alongside Health Minister Brad Hazzard , NSW Chief Health Officer Kerry Chant and NSW Police Deputy Commissioner Gary Worboys .
Health officials say today’s announcement will be critical in their decision whether to release greater Sydney residents from lockdown as scheduled this Friday.
But non-compliance of stay-at-home orders could threaten the relaxation of restrictions, with officials worried there could be undetected seeds of transmission circulating in the community.
Deputy Commissioner Worboys said he was “dismayed” to see people disobeying health orders in light of two illegal parties during lockdown.
Deputy Commissioner Worboys told the ABC that police had not yet given infringement notices to party-goers at the Meriton Suites in Waterloo, but an investigation is underway.
NSW Police have issued 13 infringement notices to the NRL players who gathered for a party on the South Coast.
There were 74 infringement notices given in the last 24 hours, mostly for people failing to wear masks.

Jess Malcolm 9.40am: Pfizer less effective against Delta spread: Israel
The Pfizer vaccine is less effective against stopping the spread of the Delta variant, according to an early study by the Israel health ministry.
The study found the protein-based vaccine is 64 per cent effective at preventing infection for those who are fully vaccinated, rather than 94 per cent as was previously thought.
But the data, collected over the past month, found the vaccine is 93 per cent effective at preventing serious illness and hospitalisation.
The study adds to growing evidence about a decrease in efficacy for the Pfizer shot against the Delta variant. Public Health England in May found the protection of two doses of Pfizer against the strain was 88 per cent, and 66 per cent for AstraZeneca.
The study, first reported by Israeli news outlet ynetnews, was conducted as Israel battles a surge in cases of the highly infectious variant.

Jess Malcolm 9.05am: Aged care cluster grows as worker tests positive
A third aged care worker at SummitCare in Baulkham Hills in Sydney’s north-west has tested positive for Covid-19, the operator has confirmed.
Australians have been forced to obey rules “more than any other time in history,” but this year it’s been the health officials who can’t seem to adhere to “their own rules or common sense,” according to Sky News host Chris Smith. “We had the Sydney limo driver – minus a vaccination – transporting often infectious air crew,” Mr Smith said. “We had the receptionist outside a Covid ward in a Brisbane hospital also working unvaccinated. “And now, a cluster is growing inside a vulnerable aged care centre in Baulkham Hills in Sydney, because two-thirds of their staff are unvaccinated.” Mr Smith noted national cabinet only signed off on having all aged care staff vaccinated last month. “It seems there’s really no other choice but to just hang on through this winter period, hoping that outbreaks are controlled,” he said.
There are now five residents who have tested positive to the virus, plus two other aged care workers previously recorded. This brings the total cluster associated with the home to eight.
SummitCare has confirmed the affected staff member was already in isolation as they worked closely with the other two infected staff.
The new case has sparked fears there could be more infected aged care workers test positive in coming days, with just two thirds of its workers vaccinated.

Jess Malcolm 9.00am: Negative propaganda ‘seeding in Aboriginal community’
Senator Pat Dodson says there has been a complete lack of messaging about the vaccination rollout to First Nations Australians and is worried negative vaccine propaganda is seeding in the community.
Mr Dodson told RN Breakfast vaccine hesitancy is discouraging indigenous people to get the vaccine, urging the commonwealth to ramp up its messaging.
“There really hasn’t been a program to inform First Nations people of the seriousness of this virus and it’s mutations,” he said.
“There’s been no communication material.”
“Less than one per cent of people in the Pilbara have received their first dose.”
He also said the vaccination rollout has not effectively reached remote areas, saying most of the campaign has been focused on major centres in Perth, Sydney and Melbourne.
Mr Dodson has urged all First Nations people to get vaccinated as soon as possible.
“My simple message is that all Aboriginal people should get the vaccine and get it soon. If you don’t you run a very serious risk of dying. Don’t listen to the other propaganda.”

Jess Malcolm 8.26am: Further setbacks: ‘Vaccine supply may be disrupted again’
Commonwealth vaccination taskforce commander Lieutenant-General John Frewen has revealed officials have not ruled out the potential for major disruptions to supply of vaccines, sparking concern there could be further setbacks to Australia’s sluggish vaccination rollout.
Australia is expecting to receive a major ramp up this month from Pfizer, reaching one million a week by the end of July.
But the Lieutenant-General has told ABC News Breakfast major supply issues could still eventuate.
“The forecast we’ve got at the moment starts to see real upticks in mRNA vaccines from September, October,” he said.
“At the moment, we have confidence that could be the case.
“But in our war game today we’ll be looking at all sorts of setbacks, major disruption to supply, potential additional complications coming up around some of the vaccines like we’ve seen before, things that can very significantly affect public motivation to get vaccinated. We’ll build all those potential setbacks into the plan.”
State and territory leaders will meet with the commonwealth to discuss their preparedness in dealing with an anticipated acceleration of the rollout.
Lieutenant-General Frewen said the taskforce is considering expanding the vaccination workforce through GPs, pharmacists, nurses and even medical students.

Jess Malcolm 8.08am: Today’s NSW numbers will be telling: Hazzard
NSW Health Minister Brad Hazzard says the state’s Covid-19 numbers today will be “telling” but authorities are “hopeful” they can bring in some changes to restrictions by Friday.
Mr Hazzard conceded that while the numbers haven’t spiralled out of control, health authorities are still analysing if the current settings are working effectively.
“We are on high alert but we are hopeful we could bring in some normalcy,” he told RN Breakfast.
“Last year when the numbers were going through the roof, that was traumatising. We know that what we’re doing needs to be done to hold the line but we’re just not sure how to break that line.”
While admitting the numbers will “bounce around”, Mr Hazzard revealed health authorities don’t have a specific number of cases needed to ease restrictions, and that officials were looking at a whole range of factors.
“There’s a whole team of health officials … they’re looking at the numbers, whether they’re linked or unlinked, and also whether there’s unknown chains of transmission.”
Mr Hazzard also repeated the race for vaccines in the rollout was “the hunger games” and called for a vaccination blitz for workers in aged care homes.
“We couldn’t quite understand why the federal government sent teams into facilities to vaccinate residents but not staff.”

Chair of the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Jane Halton says Australia is “in the middle of the pack” in the global race to ensure vaccine supplies.
COVID-19 Australia: Cumulative vaccinations by state
Australia is expected to receive one million Pfizer vaccines by the end of July, in a bid to ramp up the nation’s vaccination rollout.
“As an Australian obviously I’d like to see the vaccination rolled out as soon as we can,” she said.
“In terms of global equity it’s always important to remind ourselves, there are other countries who don’t have vaccines either,” she said.
“We’re sitting in the middle of the pack, we’d like to be at the front but it could be worse.”
On the topic of international quarantine, Ms Halton said purpose-built facilities are an essential part of the nation’s public health response and Australia must endeavour to bring people home for compassionate reasons.
“If we can tighten up hotel quarantines and bring people in that would be good.”

Jess Malcolm 7.31am: Rollout ‘failed to prioritise aged care workers’
Aged & Community Services Australia CEO Patricia Sparrow says aged care workers have not been prioritised in the federal government rollout, amid emerging concern there are staff working in facilities while unvaccinated and infectious.
Leading Age Services Australia CEO Sean Rooney says aged care workers have been left behind in the government’s vaccine rollout. He said changes to the rollout such as notice of the AstraZeneca vaccine's possible side-effects meant residents and workers could not be "simultaneously" vaccinated. “What we’ve seen … is a sense within aged care workers that they got left behind," he told Sky News. Mr Rooney said the method for workers to get vaccinated has been difficult even despite access to the priority queue. “They’ve had to line up behind everyone else and deal with the constraints of not being able to get vaccinated at a GP or a vaccine clinic. “People were still lining up in the priority queues for a number of hours and still not getting vaccinated.”
Ms Sparrow told ABC News Breakfast the government’s rollout was not as promised, with workers losing priority by having to line up at mass vaccination hubs.
“The workers expected to be vaccinated in reach, and we know from doing the flu jab every year, that’s the easiest and most effective way for workers to be vaccinated, for it to come to the place of work, and to be vaccinated,” she said.
“That’s not what happened. Workers weren’t necessarily a priority if they had to go to hubs. They were in line with other people and they lost some of that priority.”
Ms Sparrow said she welcomed the decision for mandatory vaccination for aged care workers, considering the number of Covid-19 related deaths in aged care homes during the pandemic.
“They’ve been turning up without being vaccinated, to care for people, and we must make sure they’re also supported.”

Jess Malcolm 6.45am: Fully vaccinated Kate Middleton in isolation
The Duchess of Cambridge has been forced into mandatory self-isolation after she was exposed to a Covid-19 case, despite being fully vaccinated and testing negative four times in a week.
Kate Middleton was first alerted about the exposure on Friday afternoon after spending time at the Wimbledon Grand Slam.
The Duchess was forced to cancel her engagements, including the 73rd anniversary of Britain’s National Health Service on Monday with Prince William, who was not required to self-isolate.
Under the current rules in the UK, contacts of confirmed coronavirus cases must quarantine at home for 10 days.
A spokesperson from Kensington Palace said she is not experiencing any symptoms and is isolating at home.
“Last week the Duchess of Cambridge came into contact with someone who has subsequently tested positive for COVID-19,” they said.
“Her Royal Highness is not experiencing any symptoms, but is following all relevant government guidelines and is self-isolating at home.”

Jess Malcolm 6.40am: Sydney release hangs on today’s numbers
The hopes of greater Sydney emerging out of lockdown this Friday hangs on today’s numbers, with NSW Health officials calling the data “critical” to their decision. Authorities are hopeful that the number of cases who are infectious while in the community will decrease, in a bid to stop the spread of the virus.
But non-compliance to stay-at-home orders could threaten to jeopardise the city’s release from lockdown, with health authorities worried about an illegal party held at Waterloo Meriton Suites just hours after lockdown started. Thirteen NRL players have also been fined $305,000 and suspended 20 games by the NRL after they gathered for a party on Saturday night at player Paul Vaughan’s house.
Overnight, several new exposure sites were added to its growing list of exposure sites including several restaurants, a chicken shop and multiple pharmacies. Another hospital has been placed on high alert overnight after Sydney Adventist Hospital was potentially exposed to the virus. This comes after hundreds of nurses have been forced into isolation at Royal North Shore Hospital and Fairfield Hospital after an unvaccinated student nurse worked shifts while infectious.
The state recorded 35 cases on Monday, with 21 of those in isolation whilst infectious.
But the stay-at-home orders have been lifted overnight for anyone in Brisbane and Moreton Bay who were caught up in Sydney’s lockdown. These people can also now enter NSW from these locations, but must obtain a border declaration to do so.
Over 20 new exposure sites were listed in Brisbane overnight, including locations in Forest Lake, New Farm, Kangaroo Point and Woolloongabba. There were four new community transmission cases recorded yesterday, but all were linked to the Greek Orthodox community Centre. Health officials are comfortable they have contained their latest outbreaks, and were pleased Monday’s new cases were close contacts and had the Alpha strain.
South Australian restrictions were eased overnight, with increases to density rules, home gatherings increased to 200 people and singing and dancing now allowed.
Most restrictions have also loosened in Perth and Peel overnight, with masks still to be worn indoors in close settings and on public transport. The government also announced a new Covid-19 on a bulk carrier in Western Australian waters. The crew member has been taken into a Geralton hospital. Authorities say no one else on board has tested positive, and the state government is urging the federal authorities to remove the ship from Australian waters.
Restrictions in Victoria are expected to be relaxed further within days, as the state recorded its fifth day with zero cases on Monday.

Jacquelin Magnay 6.25am: Boris rips up restrictions for Freedom Day
British Prime Minister Boris Johnson has ripped up a raft of coronavirus measures, handing responsibility back to the public to assess their own personal risk as he confirmed that July 19 will be the country’s “Freedom Day’’.
United Kingdom Prime Minister Boris Johnson has set out the final step in the lifting lockdown in England on July 19. Social distancing, mask mandates and club closures are just some of the restrictions which will come to an end. Mr Johnson said, “we must be honest with ourselves, that if we can’t reopen our society in the next few weeks then we must ask ourselves, when will we?” “And to those who say we should delay again, the alternative to that is to open up in winter when the virus will have an advantage or not at all this year. “We are trying to move from a system of very elaborate government rules to one in which we rely on people to exercise personal responsibility.”
Under the new rules, all business will be allowed to re-open, any current restrictions on social contact and distancing is to be abandoned and masks will no longer be required. The work from home edict has been scrapped.
In a win for civil liberties, Mr Johnson has declared that there will be no requirement for Covid certificates or proof of vaccination to enter premises and any requirement to register at premises through an app or by providing details will also be eliminated.
Mr Johnson said that further decisions on whether people will be sent home to isolate if anyone in their bubble tests positive will be reassessed.
Similarly a decision on opening up quarantine free travel those who have been double-vaccinated is still to be determined.

Olivia Caisley 5.55am: Businesses shut-out of vaccine data plan
Attorney-General Michaelia Cash has rejected a proposal by one of the nation’s major industry bodies to change federal privacy laws to enable employers to collect data to track whether staff have been vaccinated.
Ai Group chief executive Innes Willox has called for the change, declaring it would help governments and businesses to better manage Covid-19 outbreaks by more easily identifying which workers are most at risk.
The proposal is part of a new drive by business groups and ­unions to help speed up the vaccine rollout through a range of new measures, including the possible use of worksites as centres for ­employers to administer jabs.
However, business groups are pushing for the same indemnity provisions as GPs to ensure that they are not liable for any adverse vaccine side-effects.
Senator Cash said protections already existed for businesses through state and federal worker compensation schemes. “It is important that employers know that there are appropriate protections for them to encourage employees to get vaccinated,” she said.
Mr Willox has previously said businesses are eager to help in the vaccination drive but are concerned about potential liabilities if employees experience adverse side-effects after receiving a Covid-19 jab.

Olivia Caisley 5.45am: Half vaccinated population enough: MPs
Liberal MPs have identified ­national vaccination rates as low as 50 per cent as the threshold to clear the first phase of the Morrison government’s “new deal” road map to normality as epidemiologists try to determine the “magic number”.
National cabinet agreed to a four-step blueprint on Friday for a phased easing of restrictions once Australians have met the new vaccine thresholds, which will be set using scientific modelling from ­epidemiologists at the Doherty ­Institute in Melbourne.
Sydney MP Jason Falinski said the two key trigger points to opening up should be all residents having been offered a jab and half of all adults having received both jabs.
“I think once everyone has had the opportunity to be vaccinated and we reach a threshold of 50 per cent, we should move to a staged opening over three months where restrictions are eased gradually,” he said.
“That would build confidence in the community to ensure the health systems can handle it.”

Rhiannon Down 5.35am: More than 600 nurses in isolation
More than 600 health workers across two major Sydney hospitals have been forced into isolation after an unvaccinated student nurse worked shifts while infected with Covid-19, leaving hospitals to grapple with major staffing shortages.
Royal North Shore Hospital has lost 500 staff who are currently in isolation after the 24-year-old worked at the cardiology and general abdominal surgery wards at the hospital from June 24 to 28.
A further 120 staff at Fairfield Hospital have also been forced to self-isolate after the same nurse worked shifts at the hospital’s rehabilitation ward.
NSW Nurses and Midwives Association general secretary Brett Holmes said staff were already battling high levels of “exhaustion” amid widespread worker shortages.
“This is a difficult situation and probably the largest number of staff we’ve seen forced to isolate because of their close contact status in the workplace,” he said.
“It’s a massive challenge for the remaining staff at these two hospitals.
“At Royal North Shore they’ve stopped all but emergency surgery and are diverting some patients to other hospitals.”
Mr Holmes said the public health system was already struggling with workforce issues pre-pandemic and the “regular pool of casual nursing staff has been otherwise absorbed”.
Sydney Adventist Hospital in Wahroonga was also added to the list of exposure late on Monday night.

Full text: This formula offers the chance to live life in a way that COVID-19 does not dominate every decision.
A plan for a phased exit from the lockdown-prone, closed-border policy of Australia's aggressive suppression strategy was music to the ears of many Australians. Details were scant, but nonetheless the Prime Minister's roadmap sets out an aspiration for exit that is appropriately cautious, staged and - crucially - based on epidemiological milestones, not dates. To determine what those milestones are the Prime Minister was explicit, Australia will rely on modelling
The first phase of the roadmap is designed to buy time. Time to get vaccinated, in fact time to get enough vaccines into the country to boost coverage, and time to model the scenarios that predict if it's safe to progress to the next phase. Buying time means returning to COVID zero and reducing the likelihood of further lockdowns by addressing leaks from hotel quarantine.
It buys time to "review the national hotel quarantine network"; we hope this includes reviewing the national standard to mitigate against airborne spread in quarantine and in the community.
The current aggressive suppression strategy that underpins COVID zero has served Australia well on all fronts and is easily the best option while we are building vaccine coverage and public health defences. It is the only safe, economically smart and socially relatively open option for the moment. But it cannot and should not be Australia's long-term plan. So how do we move beyond this point?
The cornerstone of the roadmap is to achieve high levels of vaccine coverage. With 26 per cent of Australian adults currently saying they don't intend to get vaccinated, and children under 16 not included in the current vaccine strategy (another 15 per cent or so of the population), achieving very high population coverage will be challenging even when availability is less of an issue.
Some modelling suggests even with high vaccine coverage, "herd immunity" to stop transmission, illness and death from COVID-19 will only be possible with the addition of public health interventions. The level of vaccine coverage required will vary depending on vaccine efficacy against the different variants circulating. Importantly, even with high levels of coverage there will be a group of people in whom the vaccine did not work, or who were unable to be vaccinated, who will not be protected. In addition to vaccine hesitancy, many people remain unvaccinated because of difficulties accessing the vaccine.
Even with high levels of vaccination it will be vital people continue to test regularly and quarantine until they have their test result. Also, on occasions it is likely that restrictions will need to be introduced to stop large outbreaks in the community, especially with the emergence of new variants in the future. Further modelling is needed to understand the timing of when to introduce restrictions and the level required to maintain control.
Also a critical issue is the management of Australian citizens and residents returning from overseas travel. Again, models suggest that simply opening the borders will not be possible; there will be a need for ongoing border quarantine controls. However, the type of quarantine will vary; with improved community vaccination levels and vaccination of people returning to Australia, home-based quarantine will be possible for some people while others may need to stay in purpose-built, government-controlled facilities. This might vary depending on the prevalence of COVID-19 in the country from where the person has travelled, the countries through which they transited and if they have been previously vaccinated, when and with what vaccine.
Apart from Australian residents returning home, COVID-19 border restrictions have had a significant economic impact with reductions in international students and skilled and non-skilled migrants entering the country. A similar thoughtful approach is required to ensure these groups can travel to Australia without putting the community at risk.
While much remains to be determined and many hurdles remain, starting this discussion at a national level, led by the Prime Minister in collaboration with the state premiers, is a significant step. It signifies an ambition to safely reopen in a way that, if continued, has the potential to be nationally galvanising. With all we will learn from overseas, and with all we know about the effectiveness of public health measures here and elsewhere, Australians should be confident that an appropriate 'Vaccines-Plus' formula can be found in the coming months. One that builds on the back of high vaccination coverage to involve judicious use of public health measures like masks, home-based testing, home-based for some, purpose-built quarantine for high-risk travellers that mitigates against airborne transmission.
It may be many years, if ever before we return to our pre-COVID lives, but this formula offers the opportunity to live life in a way that COVID-19 does not dominate every daily conversation and decision, while keeping Australians safe from the worst pandemic pathogen in more than a century.

Flu claim by Morrison disputed by experts

Full text: Epidemiologists have disputed Prime Minister Scott Morrison's claim that coronavirus will be able to be treated "like the flu" when Australia reaches a high vaccination rate, saying contact tracing and widespread mask wearing may be needed for years to avoid deaths.
Infectious diseases experts are hopeful that the nation will be able to reach what Mr Morrison described as the third stage of a four-stage pathway out of the pandemic, when vaccinated people can start freely travelling overseas and lockdowns are avoided.
This scenario is estimated to be feasible when about 80 per cent or more of the population is fully vaccinated, although modelling of the vaccination rates needed to move to the next phase is underway.
Epidemiologists including Nancy Baxter, the head of the Melbourne School of Population and Global Health, have disputed the assertion that coronavirus could be treated like the flu. The seasonal flu has typically been managed with a vaccination program, and little else.
"We could live just our normal lives, but I just think we'd have a lot more dead people," Professor Baxter said.
There were more than 800 flu deaths recorded in 2019, when 313,085 cases were detected, although the actual death toll is estimated to be in its thousands in an average year.
Often having the greatest impact on the elderly and sometimes killing children, the winter flu season can strain the hospital system, including intensive care units.
Mr Morrison said yesterday it was likely that by the time Australia reached phase three of the pathway that hospitalisations and deaths from COVID-19 would be similar to the flu.
"We're already seeing evidence of that in other jurisdictions that have higher levels of vaccination," he said. "So, when it is like the flu, we should treat it like the flu, and that means no lockdowns."
Chief Medical Officer Professor Paul Kelly said health experts could in the future measure success based on the number of people severely unwell with COVID-19 rather than total case numbers.
This year, Australia has recorded just over 2000 cases of COVID-19, with one death in a person who had returned from overseas. Besides Queensland, where the state keeps all positive cases in hospital, Professor Kelly said there had been few hospitalisations and very few cases in intensive care.
"There are active cases in all but two of our jurisdictions in Australia. But throughout that, and as of today, there are only three people in intensive care out of all of those hundreds of cases now that are active in Australia," he said.
"That's a really crucial point. It does point to and will increasingly point to how vaccination will see us get out of this current situation."
There were more than 900 deaths from coronavirus in Australia last year, mostly in Victoria.
Burnet Institute infectious diseases expert and physician Suman Majumdar said he thought a vaccination target of 80 per cent would reasonably allow Australians to live with coronavirus in the community, without regular lockdowns.
But the public should not expect it would be possible to just "let the virus go" - and instead there would likely be a gradual release of restrictions.
"Rather than the flu, I would say measles might be more similar, because measles is catastrophic if it is rampant in an unvaccinated population," Dr Majumdar said.
University of Melbourne epidemiologist Tony Blakely said while it was "sensible" to plan for living with the virus, a high level of vaccination alone would not be sufficient to protect the public as borders opened.
That's because he estimated that a high vaccination rate of 90 per cent of all Australians, including children, would be required to get close to herd immunity - the point where it becomes difficult for the virus to spread in the community.
Professor Baxter called for a shift in attitudes on how to prevent the spread of infectious airborne diseases, including by following the lead of many Asian countries and making regular mask-wearing the norm, as well as a bigger focus on ventilation.
A rare silver lining of coronavirus restrictions has been that cases of the flu have dropped so dramatically, it's suspected the virus could have been eradicated from the community.
Last month there were 52 cases of influenza detected, compared with almost 60,000 in June 2019.
Professor Baxter said that in past not enough attention had been given to how the flu could be prevented, and it was just accepted that it killed older people.

Covid calm: Premier rebuffs lockdown calls

Full text: Health officials in NSW are increasingly confident the state’s contract tracing effort is holding – and a lockdown appeared less likely to be needed – despite the spread of cases outside of Sydney’s eastern ­suburbs including into Parliament House.
While there were 11 new cases in NSW on Thursday – and three in Victoria – officials said a sense of serious concern from Premier Gladys Berejiklian and the state’s chief health officer Kerry Chant had eased as contact tracers managed to track the spread of Covid-19.
There was no discussion of lockdowns nor a request for ­additional resources, said sources involved in the briefings who were prevented from speaking publicly.
Ms Berejiklian and Dr Chant, however, stopped short of ruling out further restrictions if the number of cases that could not be linked to existing infections grew, with the Premier describing the outbreak as the “scariest period” since the pandemic began.
“It is a very contagious variant but at the same time we are at this stage comfortable that the settings that are in place are the appropriate settings,” Ms Berejiklian said.
Employer groups hailed the ­deferral of a citywide lockdown, describing it as “proportionate and balanced”, although some epidemiologists warned the NSW ­government was pursuing a high-risk strategy and urgently needed to ­consider more restrictions.
There are now 49 Covid-19 cases in the city since a limousine driver contracted the virus transporting airline crew and tested positive on June 16.
Investigations into that case are ongoing, with police examining the conduct of the driver and limousine company.
All but one of the cases recorded on Thursday were linked to a known source, with the largest cluster – now 36 infections – still concentrated in Sydney’s east.
Of most concern are three cases whose origins remain unidentified, but that number remained too low to justify a full-scale lockdown to halt the movement of people and catch up on tracing efforts, Dr Chant said.
“I am not dismissing any situation, but that is the purpose of that strategy, to get it to a pause. We are not in that situation,” she said. “You have a sudden surge of cases and you want everybody to stay in the same place, and that ­allows you to get any backlog of any contact tracing.” The unlinked cases include a hairdresser, a nine-year-old child from St Charles Primary School in Waverley, and a healthcare ­worker – all in the city’s eastern suburbs. No cases have been linked to the nine-year-old but three contacts of the hairdresser have tested positive.
Victoria declared a swath of Greater Sydney and surrounding regions as a red zone – stopping all non-essential travel – as restrictions on Melbourne eased on Thursday.
A man in his 60s, who was visiting his daughter in Sydney and ­returned to Melbourne on Sunday tested positive to Covid-19 and on Thursday his co-worker at a Sandringham drycleaner was also confirmed to have the coronavirus.
As NSW officials worked to contain the spread of cases, concerns were heightening around a potential cluster that had emerged in parliament following a positive test recorded by Agriculture Minister Adam Marshall.
Mr Marshall attended a dinner with three NSW Nationals colleagues at Christo’s Pizza in Paddington on Monday only to learn of his exposure to the virus the ­following evening. By then he had attended a joint-party room meeting, question time, and a budget night dinner.
Ms Berejiklian attended the same budget night dinner as Mr Marshall, along with a large number of cabinet members and government MPs, but said on Thursday that she was not required to self-isolate for 14 days because she had been deemed a “casual contact”.
There were 48,402 tests reported to 8pm on Wednesday, an ­increase from the previous day’s total of 44,640, though Sydney residents have been urged to raise this number further.
Economists say it is too early to gauge the impact from the existing but limited restrictions, but they were likely to be mild.
EY chief economist Joanne Masters said: “We know the most economically impactful thing is social distancing, followed by the closure of domestic borders, followed by international border ­restrictions.
“We have been seeing a pick-up in interstate travel, but every time you have a border closure it slows that down. It’s the confidence factor.” The northern beaches Covid-19 outbreak and lockdown cost the economy $3.2bn in lost working hours in December, according to KPMG modelling.
Helen Waldron, from employer organisation Australian Industry Group, said the NSW approached showed it was possible to achieve “the same health results without the much more widespread disruption to normal economic activity” in other states.
“Any approach to Covid-19 needs to achieve the desired health outcomes with the least disruption to normal economic and social activity and we urge the Premier to hold her ground against calls for lockdowns which would damage the state’s economy and put peoples’ livelihoods at risk,” Ms Waldron said.
Epidemiologists and public health experts remain sceptical about whether health authorities will be able to contain the spread of Covid-19 without further ­restrictions.
“I think the chance of them getting this without a lockdown is less than 50-50,” said University of Melbourne Epidemiologist Tony Blakely.
Professor Blakely said leaving gyms open, considering the ­fleeting transmissions that had taken place, was “bonkers” and called for them to be shut.
He also urged tighter limits on home visitors ahead of the ­weekend. “I would be very impressed and surprised if they get through this without a lockdown,” he said.
Mary-Louise McLaws, a World Health Organisation adviser, said: “One of the problems is NSW does not like to go into lockdown, as they don’t like to interfere with the business sector.
“As someone who has had ­experience with an outbreak I’ve seen that going in earlier has a way better outcome than waiting too late,” Professor McLaws said.
“We humans who have ­Saturday and Sunday off, that’s when a lot of us go out, go ­shopping or as we’ve seen fly to interstate.” ADDITIONAL REPORTING: PATRICK COMMINS, RHIANNON DOWN

“I think the chance of them getting this without a lockdown is less than 50-50,” said University of Melbourne Epidemiologist Tony Blakely.
Professor Blakely said leaving gyms open, considering the ­fleeting transmissions that had taken place, was “bonkers” and called for them to be shut.
He also urged tighter limits on home visitors ahead of the ­weekend. “I would be very impressed and surprised if they get through this without a lockdown,” he said.
Mary-Louise McLaws, a World Health Organisation adviser, said: “One of the problems is NSW does not like to go into lockdown, as they don’t like to interfere with the business sector.
“As someone who has had ­experience with an outbreak I’ve seen that going in earlier has a way better outcome than waiting too late,” Professor McLaws said. “We humans who have ­Saturday and Sunday off, that’s when a lot of us go out, go ­shopping or as we’ve seen fly to interstate.”

Full text: Health officials in NSW are increasingly confident the state’s contract tracing effort is holding – and a lockdown appeared less likely to be needed – despite the spread of cases outside of Sydney’s eastern ­suburbs including into Parliament House.
While there were 11 new cases in NSW on Thursday – and three in Victoria – officials said a sense of serious concern from Premier Gladys Berejiklian and the state’s chief health officer Kerry Chant had eased as contact tracers managed to track the spread of Covid-19.
There was no discussion of lockdowns nor a request for ­additional resources, said sources involved in the briefings who were prevented from speaking publicly.
Ms Berejiklian and Dr Chant, however, stopped short of ruling out further restrictions if the number of cases that could not be linked to existing infections grew, with the Premier describing the outbreak as the “scariest period” since the pandemic began.
“It is a very contagious variant but at the same time we are at this stage comfortable that the settings that are in place are the appropriate settings,” Ms Berejiklian said.
Employer groups hailed the ­deferral of a citywide lockdown, describing it as “proportionate and balanced”, although some epidemiologists warned the NSW ­government was pursuing a high-risk strategy and urgently needed to ­consider more restrictions.
There are now 49 Covid-19 cases in the city since a limousine driver contracted the virus transporting airline crew and tested positive on June 16.
Investigations into that case are ongoing, with police examining the conduct of the driver and limousine company.
All but one of the cases recorded on Thursday were linked to a known source, with the largest cluster – now 36 infections – still concentrated in Sydney’s east.
Of most concern are three cases whose origins remain unidentified, but that number remained too low to justify a full-scale lockdown to halt the movement of people and catch up on tracing efforts, Dr Chant said.
“I am not dismissing any situation, but that is the purpose of that strategy, to get it to a pause. We are not in that situation,” she said. “You have a sudden surge of cases and you want everybody to stay in the same place, and that ­allows you to get any backlog of any contact tracing.” The unlinked cases include a hairdresser, a nine-year-old child from St Charles Primary School in Waverley, and a healthcare ­worker – all in the city’s eastern suburbs. No cases have been linked to the nine-year-old but three contacts of the hairdresser have tested positive.
Victoria declared a swath of Greater Sydney and surrounding regions as a red zone – stopping all non-essential travel – as restrictions on Melbourne eased on Thursday.
A man in his 60s, who was visiting his daughter in Sydney and ­returned to Melbourne on Sunday tested positive to Covid-19 and on Thursday his co-worker at a Sandringham drycleaner was also confirmed to have the coronavirus.
As NSW officials worked to contain the spread of cases, concerns were heightening around a potential cluster that had emerged in parliament following a positive test recorded by Agriculture Minister Adam Marshall.
Mr Marshall attended a dinner with three NSW Nationals colleagues at Christo’s Pizza in Paddington on Monday only to learn of his exposure to the virus the ­following evening. By then he had attended a joint-party room meeting, question time, and a budget night dinner.
Ms Berejiklian attended the same budget night dinner as Mr Marshall, along with a large number of cabinet members and government MPs, but said on Thursday that she was not required to self-isolate for 14 days because she had been deemed a “casual contact”.
There were 48,402 tests reported to 8pm on Wednesday, an ­increase from the previous day’s total of 44,640, though Sydney residents have been urged to raise this number further.
Economists say it is too early to gauge the impact from the existing but limited restrictions, but they were likely to be mild.
EY chief economist Joanne Masters said: “We know the most economically impactful thing is social distancing, followed by the closure of domestic borders, followed by international border ­restrictions.
“We have been seeing a pick-up in interstate travel, but every time you have a border closure it slows that down. It’s the confidence factor.” The northern beaches Covid-19 outbreak and lockdown cost the economy $3.2bn in lost working hours in December, according to KPMG modelling.
Helen Waldron, from employer organisation Australian Industry Group, said the NSW approached showed it was possible to achieve “the same health results without the much more widespread disruption to normal economic activity” in other states.

Don't get distracted by vaccine delay blame games

Full text: Own goals do not instil confidence. And there have been some big ones of late with the vaccine rollout.
Internationally, there have been own goals with the Oxford-AstraZeneca product. For example, many European countries paused rollouts due to rare thrombo-embolism events. This pre-emptive action masquerading as an "abundance of caution" unnecessarily undermined public confidence in what is really a pretty good vaccine.
And now Australian politicians have initiated a totally unnecessary and destructive slanging match between federal and state governments about the slow rollout. Seriously? It is a supply problem, d'oh.
The major problem for the vaccine rollout in Australia is the lack of supply of AstraZeneca from Europe. Maybe better co-ordination of federal and state systems would have meant about another 100,000 people or so vaccinated by now with smoother logistics - but nothing like the additional 3 million people needed to meet the target of 4 million by the end of March.
I had sympathy for the federal government on this matter - up to Wednesday. As an academic, I applaud setting targets. But, politically, being bold about "going for 4 million" has backfired since failure due to reasons (largely) beyond our control has made the goal impossible.
The David Littleproud brain fade (or Machiavellian scheming gone wrong) on Wednesday was shocking. In an environment where maintaining public confidence in the vaccination rollout is imperative, not only was this an own goal - but sabotage of the public good.
Politics aside, however, these supply issues should soon be in our rear vision mirror. As CSL comes on stream, delivering about 1 million doses of AstraZeneca vaccine a week (and hopefully more), the rollout will accelerate.
There will be other pressure points in our fight to stay ahead of COVID that will matter more in six to 12 months. At the University of Melbourne on Wednesday we launched the COVID-19 Pandemic Trade-offs web-tool that allows the public and policy makers to see what happens in Australia under 648 scenarios of vaccine rollout.
You can alter what the vaccine uptake will be, what you think the effectiveness of the vaccine will be in reducing transmission, and what you think the reproductive rate of the virus will be. And then see what happens to infection rates over the next year, and net health effects (allowing for the negative impacts of lockdowns).
One lesson we draw from the modelling in this tool is that we need to keep our borders secure and quarantine comprehensive until Phase 2 (adult vaccination) is near complete. Otherwise, especially if the more infectious UK variants get into Australia and gain a foothold, the results may not be pretty.
Unsurprisingly, but importantly, getting vaccine coverage as high as possible to make us more resilient to viral incursions matters. Building confidence in, as well as safe speed of, the rollout matters.
We also find that the negative effects of lockdowns on depression, anxiety and self-harm (let alone economic impacts) mean that as vaccine coverage increases we need to pivot from the aggressive elimination approach that served its purpose in New Zealand and Victoria in 2020, and evolve to a more moderate approach.
Down the track - perhaps about July - we will be seriously discussing Phase 3. Which is vaccinating children. The vaccines are not yet approved for children. Children themselves stand to gain less than adults, given COVID-19 is not as serious an illness for them. But we will need wide uptake of vaccination among all ages in the population for us - as a community - to be resilient to opening up our borders. Put another way, herd immunity is unlikely without also vaccinating children. Approval of the vaccine for children and a high uptake by them as well as adults is necessary.
Speaking of herd immunity, many epidemiologists in a global survey this week expressed concern about variants arising that are resistant to vaccines (and also more infectious, like the UK variant). I too am worried about this (just set the reproductive rate high and vaccine effectiveness at reducing infection low on our web-tool and see what happens).
But if such variants arise, it will be more of a setback than a disaster. We will "just" have to keep evolving the vaccines to cover these new variants, making the SARS-CoV-2 virus (variants) and vaccine more like the annual influenza and flu vaccine. Not ideal, but OK.
Professor Tony Blakely is an epidemiologist at the University of Melbourne.

On track to reopen, but going too soon risks a third wave

Full text: Victoria is on track to meet government targets for reopening the state, epidemiologists say, but they warn reopening too soon would increase the risks of a third wave.
The state had five new cases yesterday, while the 14-day average fell to 20.9, the trigger for the government's step-two reopening target.
Doherty Institute epidemiology director Professor Jodie McVernon said: "We are definitely where we would wish to be having put these measures in place.
"But I think we all recognise it's going to be very challenging to put out some of these embers."
Reaching the third step, which would allow shops to open storefronts and cafes and restaurants to seat diners, requires the state to hold the rolling average below five new cases a day.
University of Melbourne senior research fellow Jason Thompson said the state was on target to meet the case thresholds as set out in the road map ahead of time.
"This should be cause for humble celebration," said Dr Thompson, a co-author of one of the models informing the state government's road map.
Epidemiologists urged a focus on the 14-day-average, rather than the daily total, which is more subject to random variation.
The daily cases reflected what was happening in the state several days ago, Burnet Institute deputy director Professor Margaret Hellard said.
It was also unlikely testing teams were picking up 100 per cent of all cases.
"You're not seeing what's happening now. That's why it's really important not just to react to one number," Professor Hellard said.
Models being used by the Victorian government show a significant probability of resurgence if the state lowered its restrictions now.
This was in part because of how COVID-19 spreads - in superspreader clusters, which Professor McVernon described as "explosive".
Not all infected people pass the virus on, but a small group give it to a large number of people. This means the virus will tend to just bubble along until a superspreading event happens.
Dr Thompson said: "You might successfully manage it with micro-policies and adjustments for a time, but eventually your luck runs out."
The more people with the virus, the higher the chances of "multiple times where you have the chance event in the wrong direction", said Professor Hellard, lead author of the Burnet Institute's modelling.
A model built by the institute and funded by the Victorian government considered two scenarios: the state dropping restrictions back to "COVID-normal" on September 14 or 28.
Even assuming high levels of contact-tracing performance, if restrictions were eased on September 14, there was an 86 per cent chance cases would rise to 100 a day within a month.
If the state waited another two weeks, that number fell to 41 per cent.

Reasons to keep 5km rule challenged

Full text: Top infectious disease experts are unconvinced about the merits of Melbourne's five-kilometre rule, arguing its health benefits must be more closely scrutinised against the great social and economic cost.
Some epidemiologists say good hygiene, face masks, strict social distancing, gathering outdoors instead of indoors and paid sick leave for workers are far more effective in preventing transmission of coronavirus than restricting the distance people can travel from home.
"It helps with policing, but the real question is, how much does it really decrease transmission?" leading infectious diseases physician Peter Collignon said.
Melburnians rejoiced as Premier Daniel Andrews confirmed the axing of the city's controversial 9pm-to-5am curfew on Sunday, which - along with the stay-at-home rule banning people from travelling more than five kilometres from their residence - was among the strictest coronavirus restrictions in Australia. But many questioned why the government continued to impose a limit on how far Melburnians can venture from home.
When questioned by reporters on Sunday, Mr Andrews repeatedly stated that it was too dangerous to lift the five-kilometre rule yet.
"Limiting movement limits the spread of this virus," he said.
"Keeping people local, to their local communities, is very, very important."
But with most of Victoria's new coronavirus cases linked to essential workers, including in aged care and at hospitals, Professor Collignon said the five-kilometre-radius rule was increasingly futile.
"It's like measles and german measles," he said of COVID-19.
"We are not going to eliminate it or keep it eliminated. We have to have rules that make biological sense, but that don't restrict us so badly that we can't function in any sort of life."
Deakin University epidemiologist Catherine Bennett questioned why the state government was yet to use epidemiological modelling to test the effectiveness of its five-kilometre rule.
Modelling released on Sunday, undertaken by the Burnet Institute, showed a NSW-style set of restrictions would have resulted in a 41 per cent chance of a third wave in Victoria within four weeks.
While this helped guide moves to lift the curfew, it failed to closely examine the five-kilometre rule, Professor Bennett said.
"It's strange to me, why wouldn't you do modelling that examined the outcomes without a curfew and without a five-kilometre rule?" she said.
"It seems to me the modelling is more about defending not opening up completely, but in fact what you want is the more nuanced modelling that the Burnet Institute developed to be used to answer some of these questions using our own data."
Adopting NSW's restrictions on September 14 - when Melbourne's stage four was originally due to end - would have brought an 86 per cent chance of a third wave, it found.
There are some exceptions to the five-kilometre rule, including people who are providing care, single people visiting a nominated person in another household, intimate partners, and people taking children to school and childcare. Those who gather outdoors to meet people from another nominated household - as was allowed from yesterday - must not travel more than five kilometres from their home to meet.
Under step three of the state's road map - subject to an average of fewer than five new daily cases over 14 days, and public health advice - the five-kilometre rule would be lifted. Initially, the earliest date the metropolitan region could have moved to step three was October 26, but that date has shifted to October 19 because the 14-day average has plummeted beyond expectations.
Mystery cases, where the source of the infection is unknown, recently dwindled to one or two cases a day, hinting at low levels of community transmission. Yesterday there were no new mystery cases reported.
"There is no epidemiological rationale to say that people within a heavily populated community must stay within five kilometres or 10 kilometres for that matter. To my mind, it's now less about the epidemiology part of public health and more about managing people," Professor Bennett said. Strong messaging around the infectious nature of the virus had instilled anxiety in Victorians about leaving their homes, she said.
"It's true we don't want another wave, but equally the individual risk is now so incredibly low you want to keep people doing right things, but for right reasons," Professor Bennett said. "There is a big difference knowing it's incredibly important to stay home versus being too scared to leave your home."
Epidemiologist John Mathews from the University of Melbourne said the five kilometre rule was becoming less effective. "The fewer the cases, the less relevant it becomes," he said.

Full text: The PM is guilty of hypocrisy and cruelty as quiet Australians are grounded at home
It is a very small piece of good news that the Morrison government has increased the number of incoming Australians allowed to enter this country from 4000 to 6000, starting on Friday. But minor tinkering cannot hide what is missing from the Prime Minister’s handling of our international borders. It is high time that Scott Morrison outlined to Australians the way forward.
Australians continue to be banned from leaving their country without special permission from an invisible, unaccountable bureaucrat. And incoming caps and mandatory 14-day hotel detention prevent thousands of Australians from coming home.
What was decided in March, with incomplete and inaccurate data and a sense of urgency, needs to be replaced with a regime based on new data, better modelling and greater transparency. In late April, after Australians begged the Prime Minister to reveal the way out of the government-imposed economic lockdown, Morrison stood at a lectern, between Australian flags, and said: “We can’t keep Australia under the doona.” It is advice that needs repeating because his government’s travel ban is causing families too much pain.
The Prime Minister talks about bringing stranded Australians home by Christmas, all 24,000 of them. That is a start. It is also the easy part. The bigger issue, the principled part, is when will the Morrison government allow Australians to leave the country and return? In other words, when can we get on a plane to see our families overseas?
There are four flaws with the Prime Minister’s approach to borders: it reeks of hypocrisy; it is ­arbitrary; it has created a heartbreaking compassion competition for boarding passes; and it offers Australians no way forward.
Consider the hypocrisy. The Prime Minister harangues the Queensland Premier over her state border closures and the lack of compassion that separates fellow Australians, causing despair among families. And yet, by not budging on our international borders, Morrison is inflicting precisely the same pain on many more Australians.
The managerial PM is not much interested in defending freedom of expression; he has told us on many occasions that this core value doesn’t create a single job. But what about our freedom of movement, our ability to leave and return to our own country?
Here, the jobs of the rich, famous and privileged matter more than the uncountable family bonds of ordinary Australians. Shane Warne secured boarding passes to commentate on summer cricket in the UK. Tom Hanks ­secured a tick from the Australian Border Force to enter, as did ­Nicole Kidman and Dannii Minogue. British billionaire and television host Lord Sugar was allowed to fill one of 30 seats on an Emirates flight from London to Sydney last week. Business people readily leave for meetings, knowing they will get a return flight. Former PM Tony Abbott travelled overseas without a hitch.
But daily, mainstream Australians who want to care for a family member, nurse a newborn grandchild, kiss their partner, sit with a dying relative, grieve at a funeral, celebrate marriage or hug their children are told they cannot leave. And if they do get approval after lodging many requests, there is no guarantee they can return. To compound their dilemma, airline seats are priced for the rich.
The arbitrariness of the system needs to end. So does the government’s compassion competition, a bleak contest that no one in their right mind wants to win; travel depends on having a story of woe worse than others.
The human costs of Australia’s closed international border may be hard to calculate. But that is no reason for the Prime Minister to ignore the pain of keeping families apart any longer.
The federal government has the constitutional power to deal with quarantine. It decided to handball that responsibility to the states with a regimen of mandatory hotel detention. Rather than continuing to shift blame to the states, the Prime Minister should focus on how to lift the federal government-imposed travel ban and, critically, include Australians in that planning.
There is plenty of work being done by Qantas, the International Air Transport Association and the International Civil Aviation Organisation’s COVID-19 task force to find safe and sensible testing ­regimes that can replace quarantine. The Burnet Institute, based in Melbourne, released an interim report last month — Transparent Risk Assessment of Quarantine (traQ) Study — that uses mathematical models to examine what kind of multiple testing regimen can reduce the 14-day quarantine without substantially increasing the risk of virus transmission.
That report has been sent to federal bureaucracies. A final report, led by the Burnet Institute’s Professor Margaret Hellard, will be settled within weeks.
There are studies in the UK, trials at Heathrow, one of the busiest airports in the world, using rapid point-of-care tests. There are reports about the Virolens device, developed by iAbra, that uses a digital microscope to screen a mouth swab sample for signs of coronavirus, providing results within 20 seconds. The machine is described as a “low-cost, repeatable and self-administered method of screening” and studies by the University of Bristol point to a false-negative rate of 0.2 per cent, and a false-positive rate of 3.3 per cent. From mid-June, all travellers to Iceland have had the option of COVID-19 testing at the border as an alternative to undergoing 14-day quarantine. After tracking results for a month, the government released the data to its citizens. “Our data shows that a very low proportion of travellers have active infections, approximately one out of every 3000 tested in the past month. Furthermore, we have high confidence in our assumption that tourists are highly unlikely to become major sources of contagion as they usually don’t interact with the local population in a way that is conducive to contagion,” said chief epidemiologist Thorolfur Gudnason.
Given this background, Morrison’s silence is disappointing. And it points to managerialism, when leadership is needed to show the way forward.
What will a vaccine passport look like? Will it hinge on certain vaccines, but exclude others? Given that a vaccine is uncertain, and has no timeline to it, what about opening up travel areas of low risk?
What about implementing a traffic light system so that if you are returning from an “amber” area of risk, risk levels can be ­reduced safely to “green” by pre-travel testing regimes?
The Morrison government’s response to the COVID-19 virus is setting precedents, some worthy, others dangerous. The assumption that this is a once-in-a-generation pandemic is dangerously flawed. Six months after our international border was shut, this assumption continues to stoke disproportionate policy and stymies an honest discussion about risk.
What if there is a different virus in six months, a year, two years, five years? Will a future government copy the Morrison government’s zero-risk strategy without considering other consequences? “We are dealers of hope,” the Prime Minister told a party room meeting earlier this month. But his government’s continued ­lockdown of the international ­border, and keeping Australians in the dark about how it will open, make a mockery of this marketing of hope.

Full text: Regional Victoria is on track to reopen for business within days, after the state yesterday recorded its lowest daily COVID-19 tally for 11 weeks.
Premier Daniel Andrews said the news should invigorate a city entering its sixth week of hard lockdown, and tough stage four restrictions could be eased in metropolitan Melbourne earlier than outlined in the state government's road map.
If current trends continue, Christmas could be "as close to normal as possible" and there could even be "significant" crowds at the Boxing Day Test.
"I think this is going to be summer like no other, it is going to be absolutely amazing to see all of us pull together, looking out for each other, having defeated this thing," the Premier said.
"We're in the 30s. People can be positive, they can be optimistic. This strategy is working. We're gonna open this place up because we're doing it right - not popular, but right. It'll be able to stay open. And everything that every Victorian's given will mean something."
The state recorded 37 new coronavirus cases yesterday, including four earlier cases that had been reclassified, bringing the number of active cases to 1251. Regional Victoria recorded no new cases, with 58 active cases overall. For restrictions to lift, there must be fewer than five cases, as a daily average across 14 days, with no cases of unknown transmission over that two week period. The 14-day average in regional Victoria is now 4.3 and Mr Andrews said regional Victorians could expect to have significant easing of restrictions by mid next week.
Under the state government's road map, the Melbourne region will be able to move to its next step of reopening on September 28 if the 14-day average for new cases is between 30 and 50.
Melbourne's 14-day average reached 61.6 yesterday.
Pet grooming premises - not mobile vans - would be allowed to resume operating under the second step on September 28.
Beauty and personal services will also be allowed to open earlier than previously flagged, to bring them in line with hairdressers in the third step of the road map, providing masks are worn the entire time (meaning facials will still not yet be allowed).
Under current predictions, Melbourne is expected to hit the third step of the road map on October 26.
Six Victorians lost their lives to the virus overnight - two women and a man in their 80s, and two women and a man in their 90s. All six fatalities were linked to outbreaks in aged care homes.
"It was only five weeks ago that we had 725 cases in a day," Mr Andrews said.
"Every single Victorian can be hopeful and positive that this strategy is working and we will hit our targets. If we get there beforehand, then absolutely."
Chief Health Officer Brett Sutton was to meet yesterday with leading epidemiologist Professor Tony Blakely to revisit modelling relied on by officials to draft Victoria's plan out of restrictions.
"We will sit down and make further revisions of modelling and re-prosecute the inputs and the assumptions and follow the real data as we go and we can make judgments that are different at different points in time," Professor Sutton said.
"The importance of the road map was to lay out general movements in those directions and have some really strong indicative numbers so that people understood where we were heading."
Professor Sutton also suggested authorities could revisit the five-cases target.
"It is possible that we will get to a point where the numbers are higher, but we will investigate those numbers, we will see where they are occurring and why they are occurring and how they are occurring, and we will make a judgment about whether five is the appropriate target.
"Or if it is 10 cases a day but eight are in aged care - and that is not inconceivable - we will absolutely focus our attention on containing all transmission within aged care, but otherwise lifting for the community."
The softening of rhetoric comes after leading public health academics, whose modelling was relied upon in designing the plan out of restrictions, raised concerns with the tough approach.
University of Melbourne dean of medicine Shitij Kapur and professor of mathematical biology James McCaw wrote in The Weekend Australian their modelling had been constrained by the fact it did not distinguish between COVID-19 cases in aged care settings and those in the community.
Writing on The Age website, University of Melbourne professor Blakely said authorities should consider easing the requirement to move from stage three to stage two - which currently would require cases to fall to fewer than five a day over 14 days, and fewer than five mystery cases over 14 days. "By this standard, NSW would be in stage three," he wrote.
"I propose that we can relax the triggers to attain transition from stage three to stage two if cases are clustered. If mystery cases are low."
The state opposition called for a royal commission into the government's handling of the COVID-19 pandemic. "There have been too many deaths, too much damage done and too many lies told," Opposition Leader Michael O'Brien said. "Victorians deserve the truth and only a royal commission will deliver it."
He called on the Premier to swiftly move to stage three restrictions. "He's keeping this state locked down against the advice of the modellers, [and] against the advice of the public health experts," Mr O'Brien said.

THE MODEL BEHIND OUR ROAD TO RECOVERY

Full text: WHAT YOU NEED TO KNOW PREMIER Daniel Andrews has said Victoria’s road out of lockdown is based on detailed modelling and data, crunched by a super computer. But experts have questioned the information and assumptions used to generate the modelling, and the difficult targets set to ease restrictions.
WHAT IS THE MODELLING AND WHO DID IT?
The modelling is an estimate, powered by a computer program simulating up to 1000 scenarios, of how daily coronavirus infections could change as restrictions ease. It predicts what would happen if Victoria began easing restrictions at daily case counts of 25, 10 and 5. It was developed by four Melbourne University experts in different fields — Dr Jason Thompson, Professor Rod McClure, Professor Mark Stevenson and Professor Tony Blakely.
WHAT DOES THE MODELLING SHOW?
It predicts it would not be safe to reopen in mid-September — when the lockdown was due to end — because the 14-day case average would still be more than 60. It also shows a 62 per cent chance of needing to reimpose a lockdown by Christmas if restrictions eased at 25 cases a day. The likelihood drops to 3 per cent if authorities wait until the fortnightly-case average is five.
WHY HAVE SOME EXPERTS RAISED QUESTIONS ABOUT THE MODELLING?
Top epidemiologists have questioned why the modelling was based on the experience of countries overseas, rather than Victoria. They argue this fails to paint a true picture of how the virus spreads in the state and its hot spots. It also relies on the assumption the efficacy of Victoria’s contact tracing will remain at current levels, despite improvements to the system. Researchers who developed the model have said Victoria could take steps to ensure it perform better than the model predicts. They have described their model as a blunt guide that show the risks of reopening too quickly. But they say it does not account for additional factors, such as aged-care outbreaks. Epidemiologist Peter Collignon said he was worried about the use of a theoretical model to design a recovery road map. “To me, this type of modelling, you’ve got to be careful of,” the ANU Professor said this week. “(It’s) better to follow a real life model.”
WHAT DOES PREMIER DANIEL ANDREWS SAY IN RESPONSE?
The Premier defended the model as proof it is too risky to ease restrictions when cases are, on average, about 25 a day. He said the modelling had provided a base for the government to make its decisions while also considering what was happening in the real world.
WHAT HAPPENS IF CASE NUMBERS KEEP DROPPING? WILL THE MODELLING BE RECREATED? On Wednesday, Mr Andrews said authorities would be updated with new case numbers and transmission data to compare against the predictions. “Data beats modelling every day,” Mr Andrews said. This leaves the door open to easing restrictions if updated modelling shows a reduced risk of further outbreaks.
BY THE NUMBERS 76 NEW CASES 19,688 TOTAL CASES 1622 ACTIVE CASES 11 NEW DEATHS 694 TOTAL DEATHS 196 IN HOSPITAL 20 IN ICU 16,686 TESTED ON SUNDAY 4337 COMMUNITY TRANSMISSION CASES 252 ACTIVE INFECTIONS IN HEALTHCARE WORKERS
VICTORIAN COVID-19 DEATHS APRIL 14 MARCH 4 MAY 1 JUNE 1 JULY 93 AUGUST 452 SEPT 129

State contact tracing last-minute digital reset

Full text: The Andrews government has engaged a US tech giant to lift its COVID-19 contact tracing system into the digital age as the nation's most senior health official urged Victoria to have greater confidence that it could move safely out of lockdown.
Under a data management system being installed within Victoria's Health Department by the Silicon Valley group Salesforce, automated text messages will alert health officials, infected people and potentially their close contacts about positive tests, dramatically improving the speed of the process.
The technology already supports contact tracing in Western Australia, South Australia and New Zealand. Victoria rejected an approach by Salesforce earlier in the pandemic, according to sources familiar with the matter.
The firm also made an unsuccessful pitch to the federal government to roll out a national contact tracing management system.
The high-tech boost to Victoria's contact tracing regime was confirmed by government sources yesterday as Victoria's painstakingly slow path out of restrictions brought into sharp focus the state's capacity to contain future outbreaks.
The Commonwealth's Department of Health Secretary and former chief medical officer Brendan Murphy said although Victoria's contact tracing had significantly improved since the start of the second wave, it appeared to be holding back the state's emergence from lockdown. "I think they are in a stronger position, a much, much stronger position now, and I hope they can feel confident with the strength of their position to take a somewhat less conservative approach to their restrictions," he said.
"There's no rule book for this virus, but I think some of us feel that if there was more confidence in the public response capability, you could take some slightly more generous triggers."
Prime Minister Scott Morrison said Victoria's contact tracing fell short of the "gold standard" set by NSW, where the containment of outbreaks has enabled Australia's most populous state to remain open.
"NSW has a stronger capability when it comes to tracing," Mr Morrison said. "One of the questions that is being raised in relation to the Victorian plan is what assumption is being made about the efficacy of contact tracing with the measures they have set out?
"To what extent would those restrictions be otherwise lessened if a higher capacity and functionality of contact tracing were present?"
Victoria's approach to contact tracing has been the subject of intense scrutiny and regular criticism since the onset of the pandemic, with reports of lengthy delays and antiquated systems based on whiteboards and notepaper.
Australia's Chief Scientist Dr Alan Finkel was embedded in Victoria's Health Department to determine what had gone wrong.
Burnet Institute epidemiologist Professor Mike Toole described Victoria's contact tracing as "woeful" compared to NSW.
Chief Health Officer Brett Sutton - who heads the state's Public Health Incident Management Team responsible for investigating and managing outbreaks - said Victoria's system had been overwhelmed by the volume of cases in the second wave but was now the match of any other state.
Professor Sutton indicated there may be some flexibility in the criteria announced on Sunday by Premier Daniel Andrews for the state to move out of its staged restrictions. He said it was possible that Victoria could move to stage one restrictions - a level that would allow restaurants, bars and cafes to welcome diners back indoors for the first time since early July - without meeting the strict requirement of zero new cases for 14 straight days.
The epidemiological modelling that underpins Victoria's lockdown exit plan assumes only a 25 per cent chance that a new infection case will be contacted within a day by a member of the Public Health Management Team.
A co-author of the modelling, University of Melbourne professor Tony Blakely, said this was based on a general assumption about contact tracing, not how it worked in practice in Victoria. Mr Andrews said that in nearly 100 per cent of cases, contact tracers were reaching new cases within a day and people they might have infected within 48 hours.
Mary-Louise McLaws, an epidemiologist who advises the World Health Organisation, called for a nationalised approach to contact tracing and urged all states and territories to help each other lift standards across the country.
Professor McLaws said this should include a public register of all outbreaks, irrespective of size, so that more people could take preventive measures to reduce the viral spread.
"Rather than assuming that an exposure hasn't been significant, provide the potential locations and then locals can make the decision on whether they think they're at risk and get tested," she said.
The call for a national register was backed by Burnet Institute deputy director Margaret Hellard, who said all clusters were already publicly reported in NSW.
The Salesforce technology, a cloud-based data management platform, is used in 35 US jurisdictions including California, where it supports a statewide army of 10,000 contact tracers.
It follows a $4.2 million contract finalised last week by the Victorian government with IBM to add artificial intelligence software to the state's contact tracing regime.

Full text: When the day finally came for Daniel Andrews to share with us his plans to revive the social and economic life of this city and state, the first job he talked about was his own.
Being Premier of Victoria was a job of great honour, filled with difficult decisions, he told us. Only in this case, his decision wasn't difficult at all. There was only one choice, he said. For him and, apparently, for us.
That choice - to keep greater Melbourne under tight COVID-19 restrictions until October 26 and beyond unless the average number of daily confirmed infections can be counted on one hand - relies heavily on modelling showing what could happen if we open up sooner.
The headline-grabber is that if we lift restrictions when daily cases are averaging 25, we'll be back in lockdown for Christmas.
"You can't argue with this sort of data," the Premier said. "You can't argue with science."
Of course you can. Particularly science of this kind.
Melbourne University epidemiologist Tony Blakely, one of the co-authors of the government modelling Andrews cited, describes his work as highly stochastic. This means that although it can statistically analyse the probability of something happening, it isn't predictive. It is also inexact. "The conundrum of modelling is we simply don't have enough information in a fast-moving pandemic to know that every parameter is exactly right," Professor Blakely explained.
"There are huge amounts of chance in whether you get a third wave or not."
Let that last sentence sink in for a moment.
This doesn't mean modelling should not shape Victoria's public health response. Professor Blakely has produced work throughout this pandemic, including for this masthead, that has informed our understanding of how the virus spreads and what should be done to contain it. Similar modelling at the start of the pandemic influenced the early decisions taken by national cabinet.
Yet, given we are now six months into this pandemic, government policy should not be wholly reliant on a best guess. It should also take into account what we have learnt about how the virus behaves in specific industries, work sites and social situations.
What's missing from Victoria's COVID-19 plan is evidence of extensive consultation between government, business and other sectors to determine where it is safe to reopen. It is a plan rightly informed by epidemiologists and public health officials, but a plan that makes little to no use of expertise beyond that.
Jennifer Westacott, a Wesfarmers director and chief executive of the Business Council of Australia, gave voice to the frustration felt across Victoria's business community when she appeared on the ABC's Insiders shortly before Andrews' announcement. "This is not about statistics, it is about people's lives," she said. "It is about that sense of hope versus despair."
Westacott asked why retailers such as Bunnings, Target, K-Mart and Officeworks, having traded and avoided COVID-19 outbreaks throughout Melbourne's entire stage three lockdown, are still shut for the foreseeable future.
"There [have] been consultations, but I don't think it has been good enough," she said. "It is one thing to tell business things, it is another to work with them." The government has worked with the construction industry, wholesale trade and warehousing, manufacturing and postal distribution centres to identify ways for sectors operating under heavy restrictions to further open by the end of this month.
A campaign by Jim's Mowing against a health edict requiring lawnmowers and hedge trimmers to stay at home has also resulted in an easing of restrictions on garden maintenance.
Retail and restaurant owners, by contrast, have been stiffed. Under the plan, restaurants, bars and cafes won't be able to welcome customers inside their premises until the entire state has gone two weeks without a single COVID-19 case.
The government provisionally puts this date at November 23 but, as publican Paul Dimattina said, it could be January 2022.
"Zero transmission for 14 days straight, what sort of plan is that?" Dimattina said. "God gave Daniel Andrews ears and he is not using them to listen."
Ben Logan, the manager of Rinaldo Di Stasio's restaurants, says the hospitality industry is devastated. "People are done, people are finished," he said.
Yesterday's announcement will do nothing to soothe the city's jangled nerves. It has also ensured that next month's Melbourne city council elections - a three-way race between lord mayor Sally Capp, her deputy Arron Wood and a Labor ticket headed by businesswoman Jennifer Yang - will boil down to a single-issue stoush about the COVID-19 response.
"We can't run out of lockdown," the Premier told us. Somehow, Melbourne must get back on its feet.

Full text: MEET THE AUSTRALIAN SPEARHEADING THE GLOBAL RACE TO DEVELOP – AND FAIRLY DISTRIBUTE – A CORONAVIRUS VACCINE
On October 18 last year, Jane Halton was one of 16 world experts gathered in the ballroom of New York City’s neoclassical Pierre Hotel to talk pathogens and plagues and panic in the streets. A novel coronavirus had leapt from animal to human and a deadly respiratory disease was now sprinting across continents. “We could be looking at double the cases in a week and 16 times as many in a month if we are not able to stop the spread,” the pandemic emergency board was told.
Joining Halton at the table were leaders from business, government, security and public health: a former deputy director of the CIA and former deputy national security adviser; Centre for Disease Control heads from China, the US and Nigeria; and senior figures from the UN Foundation, the World Bank Group, the World Economic Forum, and the Monetary Authority of Singapore. Unsmiling and resolute, they jotted notes as now-familiar TV images of patients on ventilators and the horrifying roll call of predictions continued. The global economy would be in freefall. Social order would collapse. In 18 months, 65 million people could be dead.
Check that date: it would be another 10 weeks before China alerted the world to a virus outbreak in Wuhan and nine more before the World Health Organisation officially declared a pandemic. So how did they know? How did these various world authorities come to be gathered in what would become the plague’s US epicentre, war-gaming an unfolding pandemic that had yet to occur? The answer is: they didn’t. Event 201, as it was known, was a high-level simulation hosted by the World Economic Forum in partnership with the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation and the Johns Hopkins Centre for Health Security to discuss preparedness and response in the event of “a severe, highly transmissible intercontinental outbreak”. The fictional virus was called CAPS (Coronavirus Accelerated Pulmonary Syndrome); it emerged from pigs, not bats, and first appeared in South America. Otherwise, it tracked closely Covid-19, the borderhopping killer that’s brought the world to its knees.
“So how’s that for spooky?” says Halton, back in Australia self-isolating with her countrymen as real-life calamities threaten to outstrip the simulation. It’s spooky but certainly not surprising for the 60-year-old former federal mandarin whose job it is to be paranoid. Halton chairs the Gates-backed Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations (CEPI), a public health coalition that has been priming for such an emergency for years and is now spearheading the global race to develop – and fairly distribute – a vaccine for SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes Covid-19.
A former World Health Organisation director and chair of the OECD’s health committee, Halton has long dwelt in the alert-but-not-alarmed camp. She was president of the World Health Assembly at the height of the 2007 bird flu outbreak; both SARS and swine flu struck during her 12-year tenure as secretary of Australia’s health department, prompting her to install a federal incident room designed for public health emergencies. She oversaw the country’s first influenza pandemic plan, ensured surge capacity staffing and developed a national medical stockpile. “Until driven by recent events, I’m not sure anyone has worked as hard on this as [we] did,” says Tony Abbott, who worked closely with Halton as health minister in the mid-2000s.
Two years as federal finance department secretary helped her segue into post-bureaucracy life serving on the boards of ANZ, Clayton Utz and Crown Resorts and, in March, she was appointed to the National Covid-19 Coordination Commission, set up by Scott Morrison to mitigate the economic and social impacts from the pandemic. And so, with the world caught up in the exigencies of a public-health code red, Halton finds herself occupying not one but two very public hot seats. “Occasionally I think I might be stretching the rubber band just a little bit in terms of what I’ve agreed to do,” she says, “but I do come from this history of public service. You get asked to serve; you can’t not.” As a public servant, Halton built a fearsome reputation for blunt talk, once reportedly surveying a meeting of timorous men and declaring: “Haven’t any of you got balls?!” Both sides of politics considered her a bright, no-nonsense operator who got the job done. “The kind of analysis paralysis that’s all too common now never happened,” says Abbott. The World Economic Forum’s Ryan Morhard, who helped organise the New York simulation, describes her as “frank and pragmatic”. ANZ chairman David Gonski was swimming upstream in appointing a health expert to the bank’s board in 2016. He now looks shrewdly prescient, and may speak for the country when he says: “We are incredibly fortunate to have her in the foxhole with us.” It’s a cool, overcast morning in the high country of NSW and Halton has crowbarred this interview into a two-hour commute between her Snowy Mountains home and Canberra. Undistracted by the pretty alpine scenery, she nevertheless keeps an eye peeled for kamikaze kangaroos while briskly outlining the challenges facing Australia as we begin to ease out of lockdown.
A public servant’s work takes place behind the scenes; apart from a tumultuous period as head of John Howard’s border control taskforce at the height of the “children overboard” controversy, Halton has largely avoided the spotlight. She’s made a conscious decision to up her profile recently, though, considering it her duty to “help people understand the issues around vaccines at a time like this”. And so, with her neat asymmetrical hairdo and brightly coloured spectacles, she’s begun popping up on panels and in interviews, from the National Press Club to The Project.
Part of her responsibility, she says, involves managing expectations. Vaccine development is typically measured in years, not months; the quickest development of a vaccine in history was four years, for mumps in the 1950s. Yet the 12-to-18- month timeframe for Covid-19 has become gospel; only the holy-grail vaccine is a sure-fire exit strategy from all the disruption and pain and it can’t come soon enough. As cases worldwide top 5.6 million, with well past 350,000 deaths, members of the global scientific community have dropped what they’re doing to focus on developing a vaccine. About 130 research groups are racing to be first, while big pharmaceutical companies unite to examine ways to compress the timelines of clinical development and manufacture.
CEPI, an alliance of public and philanthropic funding, has secured commitments for more than $US1.3 billion of the $US2 billion it requested to fight Covid-19 and is funding 10 vaccine candidates worldwide, including the promising molecular clamp technology at the University of Queensland, which could move to human trials as early as July. “I’m pretty optimistic with the amount of effort that’s going into this,” Halton says, “but as I keep reminding people, we’ve been dealing with HIV now for very many years and there is still no vaccine.” And no vaccine yet for the “common cold” group of viruses, which have a similar structure to Covid-19.
“Precisely,” she says. “So let’s have a Plan B in the back of our head and be able to enact it.” Not President Trump’s favourite, hydroxychloroquine, which is “not safe”, she says, “but there are other therapies that are starting to demonstrate benefits.” Hundreds of potential treatments are currently being tested in more than 1100 clinical trials around the world. “We know that work on therapy will probably happen faster than the work on vaccines.” Meantime, on the much-discussed continuum between lockdown for health and loosen up for the economy, Halton favours caution. “We do need to get our economy going, there’s no doubt about it, but we have to do it in a way that’s thoughtful, respectful of each other and ultimately influenced by the science,” she says. Australia has “done pretty well” in containing the virus through a combination of luck, good management, low population density and a strong public health system. “In hindsight, it looks like we were quite clever,” she says. “But we wouldn’t want to be complacent. You can see elsewhere where it has got out of control pretty quickly when they think it is managed.” Halton, a mad-keen skier, was in transit at a US airport in late December on her way to a birthday party at a ski resort when she received a phone call that prompted that “horrible feeling in the bottom of your stomach”. It was one of her many public health contacts reporting an odd cluster of pneumonias in China’s Hubei province. She became cautious about touching surfaces; by early February, she’d stopped shaking hands. It’s about training yourself out of habits, says Halton, who has an honours degree in psychology. “The challenge now is cementing behaviours as the new normal so the whole community has a greater level of confidence, and can go about life and business knowing we’re doing everything we can to minimise the risk of further outbreaks,” she says. “That is not a medical or clinical issue; it’s about understanding how human beings behave. It’s about how you sanction the kinds of behaviours you need to see.” She likens redefining social norms to protocols around wearing seatbelts, not smoking in cars with children, and compulsory schoolyard hats. “If you think about reopening the economy, we need workplaces to set up so people can do the right thing but you can’t be supervising every single person in our community every minute of the day. The good thing about Australians is we like to complain but largely we are compliant if it’s made easy for us and if we understand what we need to do. That’s the phase we’re about to come into.” These behaviours – routine hand-washing, no handshakes, covering your mouth when coughing – need to be reflexive: “I think the harder things are going to be continuing to practise the distancing in places like supermarkets and lining up for things,” she says.
A Covid-19 vaccine still sits on the far horizon but the conspiracy theories are already here. The one to gain traction is arguably the most bizarre: a recent poll showed 40 per cent of US Republican respondents believe Bill Gates, a major CEPI contributor, plans to use a vaccine to implant microchips as part of a nefarious global surveillance plot. The lunacy has proved infectious, with the claim parroted at an anti-lockdown protest in Melbourne last month. “To have people believe such fantastical things…” Halton is momentarily speechless. “I don’t think we can do anything about the conspiracists but what we can do is give people confidence that any vaccine produced is safe and actually will do the job we want it to do.” A close friend, a fellow CEPI board member, has only recently emerged from a period in intensive care in London, sick with Covid-19. “I talked to him just before; he said it is the worst thing he has ever been through.” She exhales forcefully and her breath catches. “Awful.” She’s disappointed when she hears of people not taking the threat seriously. “I think it’s not acceptable to say, ‘Well, it’s a bunch of old people and they’re at the end of their life anyway’. I just think that’s abhorrent. I don’t think Australians would be happy to see people dying in carparks in jerry-rigged intensive care units because we don’t have enough care and there is that much disease in the community. And that’s what’s been happening elsewhere. I don’t think people are very good at looking at things at a distance and extrapolating what they see over there to here. They just think, ‘Oh well, we dodged a bullet, back to normal’. Don’t kid yourself: If we don’t do the right thing, absent herd immunity, better treatment and/or a vaccine, you can get there without too much trouble.” Despite a career-long interest in elderly care – she is currently chair of the Council on the Ageing – she also feels for the nation’s young people. “Many of them, their education is interrupted, their employment is no more, and I’m hoping they will get something out of where we’re going now in terms of opening up,” she says. “The solidarity that has been shown in looking after the vulnerable in our communities has to continue in terms of looking after the people who have been impacted by the measures we’ve had to take to get this outcome.” In late autumn Halton would typically be in Seattle for yet another board meeting, this time for the Institute of Health Metrics and Evaluation, which has been modelling coronavirus data for the White House. But the borders are sealed and so Canberra it is. Today she’ll conduct a webinar on crisis management for the National Security College before dialling in to a virtual meeting with colleagues on the Covid-19 Commission. The six members of the commission, described in the AFR as “some of the most powerful people in the country” by virtue of their new roles, have drawn flak from a broad cross-section. Institute of Public Affairs executive director John Roskam complains that the voice of small business is missing; independent MP Zali Steggall has raised concerns about the lack of transparency around its “governance and processes”; environment and renewable energy groups have condemned what they see as its promotion of a gas-led post-Covid recovery.
“The commission is an important part of the dialogue but we’re not in charge,” Halton counters. The mission is to “minimise the impact on jobs and businesses” and “facilitate the fastest recovery possible once the virus has passed”. It is not a decision-making body, nor does its remit extend to endorsing specific projects. Early work included expediting the supply of critical medical supplies and ensuring that disrupted supply chains were restored. “Jane has specifically been working with the health industry and not-for-profit sectors… helping to source personal protective equipment, advising on health policy, and engaging on the vaccine work through her role at CEPI,” says deputy chair and ex-Telstra boss David Thodey. “Her extensive knowledge of the health industry and pandemics has been particularly relevant but her contribution is by no means limited to that area.” For example, she recently acted as a go-between for a hospitality industry business that had been forced to stand down staff and another business looking to hire. “We’re obviously moving into working with different industries on their restart plans,” she says.
Halton has a lot on her mind but there is one place she goes to be freed from concern about the fate of the world. It’s on the slopes, and she’s been finding her religion on steep pitches of fleecy snow since moving to Canada from England as a child. “While you’re skiing down a run you can’t think of anything else,” she says. “During the season we ski every week.” Her husband, Trevor Sutton, a former statistician for the Australian Bureau of Statistics, now in consulting, and their two grown sons are all dedicated skiers. Halton brought her powder passion with her when, as a 13-year-old, her family migrated to Australia, her father Charles Halton lured by Gough Whitlam to run the transport department. “Does it snow in Canberra?” she recalls her mother, a computer programmer, saying. She had shovelled enough driveway snow for a lifetime. “No? OK, we’re going.” Despite the pedigree, Halton describes herself as “an accidental public servant”, who was “quite determined not to follow my father into the public service” but fell into it after a brief, too-tame stint in academia. Moving up the ladder early, she held senior roles in Finance and the Department of Prime Minister and Cabinet before becoming Secretary of the Health Department at 42.
The “accident” would lead to her becoming one of the most powerful women in the history of Australia’s bureaucracy and her profile in global health governance would catch the eye of leading Norwegian health diplomat Tore Godal. Currently a special adviser to the prime minister of Norway, Godal was the inaugural director of the Global Alliance on Vaccines and Immunisation and was instrumental in establishing CEPI, along with Bill Gates and other top-tier global health leaders. “The original idea for CEPI came from the West African ebola outbreak, which we did not as a world manage well,” Halton says. A vaccine that had been in development for more than a decade was not deployed until after the 2014-16 ebola crisis, in which more than 11,000 people were killed. CEPI has been working to accelerate the development of vaccines against emerging infectious diseases since it launched at Davos in 2017, but its Covid-19 funding has now placed it centre-stage.
Halton takes pride in the fact that, in addition to fully funding UQ’s frontrunner vaccine candidate, CEPI has contributed to the quest for a cure via funding for the Peter Doherty Institute in Melbourne and the CSIRO in Geelong, as well as its work with Australian biotech company CSL. “All funding decisions taken by CEPI are based on independent scientific assessment and I’ve been careful to stay one step removed,” she says. “So I’ve been delighted when those processes have thrown up Australian recipients.” National rivalries are inevitable in the race for a vaccine, with countries such as China and the US eager for the public health and propaganda boosts that victory would confer. This is where the second tenet of CEPI’s platform – ensuring equitable access – comes in. “We have to ensure that if there is a vaccine, it doesn’t just go to the wealthy countries,” Halton says. The WHO is compiling a list of priority recipients, including the elderly, the immunocompromised and frontline health workers, and encouraging collaboration between nations. But the global stampede to secure masks and other PPE doesn’t bode well for the spirit of cooperation. “The undignified scramble for PPE is going to be nothing compared to the fight for access to a vaccine,” she says.
The Australian government has been critical of the WHO’s delayed response to the pandemic, which has been described as “China-centric”, and was instrumental in pushing for the just-passed resolution for an international probe. Halton, who sat on the WHO board from 2004 to 2007, concedes there were “undoubtedly things they could have done better” but points out “the WHO relationship with any member state is always complicated. It doesn’t have any capacity to dictate to countries [or] to force its way in to inspect. It relies on the cooperation of sovereign governments.” Halton’s pitch for a harmonious approach, one world united against a common foe, the strong lifting up the weak, is based on solid, scientific, practicalities. “If any country continues to have this disease, it means the world’s still got it,” she says. “If we want our communities and our economies up and functioning, being able to import and export, people travelling – it’s actually in everyone’s interests to make sure we minimise the impact of the disease globally as fast as we can.” We are, in other words, only as strong as our weakest link. We are only as healthy as our neighbours.

Full text: We were ready for virus but new threats will come COVID-19 is unprecedented, but we’re not unprepared.
There’s a lot that science can help us predict. Drought combined with climate change will lead to more bushfires; finite resources will lead to seeking renewable solutions; and increased global traffic will lead to faster disease transmission.
We saw it in the past summer’s bushfire season, we see it in the global energy market, and we can see it in today’s COVID-19 pandemic. These are all unprecedented but not unforeseen.
Around the world, countries and communities are being reshaped by COVID-19, but in our research institutions scientists are continuing what they’ve always done: applying their scientific expertise to solving challenges.
A century ago, science journals were recording the rise and fall of the Spanish influenza. This century we’ve seen rapid development of vaccines for avian flu and swine flu, and ongoing research into vaccines for severe acute respiratory syndrome and Middle East respiratory syndrome.
As the world has become more interconnected, scientists have known the next disease outbreak would move faster. While we may not know where, when or how a pandemic may strike, the likelihood of it eventuating is something the scientific community has been preparing for. It’s this preparation that has allowed us to hit the ground running with our COVID-19 response, both globally and locally.
Since 1985, the CSIRO has been protecting Australia through research and development into highly dangerous diseases at our Australian Centre for Disease Preparedness in Geelong.
In 2015, when we were creating our new strategy, the CSIRO brought together experts from a range of backgrounds to build a “one health” model that could respond to a new disease threat in multiple ways, from vaccine development and medical supply production to data modelling and environmental science.
We brought big data and artificial intelligence to genetics research with the creation of our digital network, Data61; we created our biologics manufacturing facility to give us the local ability to scale up vaccines for testing; and we strengthened our global ties last year by partnering with the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations.
Domestically, we built strong partnerships with the Doherty Institute at the University of Melbourne, with the University of Queensland, and with tropical disease experts at James Cook University.
With so many teams around the world and in Australia working on a vaccine, you may ask: why not leave it to other countries with bigger populations and bigger research budgets?
This pandemic has shown us the frailty of relying on international supply chains. When health systems around the world are making heartbreaking decisions about who to save, we need to be building our own armoury for the war. And Australia has won many of the early battles because we were prepared.
We were the first country outside China to generate sufficient stock of the virus to enable preclinical studies and research. At the CSIRO, we successfully established a biological model analogous to humans in February, we were the first to confirm ferrets react to SARS-CoV-2 (the virus that causes COVID-19) and we are now using that knowledge to test vaccines.
In 1916, Australia was cut off from the rest of the world by geography and war, but it didn’t stop the Spanish influenza arriving. So the Commonwealth Serum Laboratories was established to reduce our dependence on imported vaccines, and the precursor to the CSIRO was formed to apply science to the many other challenges faced by a fledgling nation.
Today, our geography is not the protection it once was. We must collaborate locally and internationally to share knowledge and expertise while securing our own arsenal against new and emerging threats.
Collaboration has never been more important — the competi­tion is us against the virus, and we’ll win only as Team Australia, for Team Humanity.Larry Marshall is chief executive of the CSIRO.

Full text: Restrictions help stop spread
FLATTENING CURVE LONG-awaited COVID-19 modelling reveals diligent Australians have significantly flattened the curve to slow the spread of coronavirus and buy enough time to boost the country’s intensive care capacity.
Prime Minister Scott Morrison yesterday unveiled the models used by National Cabinet to decide social distance restrictions, showing how the measures had so far helped Australia avoid “horror scenarios” in countries like Italy and Spain.
But the early positive signs came with a dire warning that failure to follow the strict measures over Easter holidays would cause what experts ­described as an “explosive ­resurgence” of the deadly virus in Australia.
The models showed if COVID-19 had been allowed to spread without any interventions to stop it, up to 23 million Australians would have contracted it with about 38 per cent of them requiring medical care.
At the peak of an “unmitigated” outbreak about 35,000 people would need a bed in an intensive care unit.
However, only 15 per cent would actually get one. Health officials are confident Australia is now flattening the curve, but confirmed it will be months before the disruptive restrictions on daily life, social interactions and business can be lifted.
The total number of coronavirus cases in Australia yesterday rose by 113 to 5908, of which 2686 are in NSW.
Mr Morrison said the daily growth rates of new corona­virus cases had fallen rapidly, and sooner than the government had expected, but the country must now “hold the course”.
“We must lock in these gains,” he said.
“We cannot be complacent … this Easter weekend will be incredibly important. “Stay at home.” Mr Morrison said the decrease in new cases had given Australia “much needed time” to boost intensive care unit ­capacity. “We have so far avoided the horror scenarios that we have seen overseas,” he said.
Chief Medical Officer Professor Brendan Murphy said he was most concerned about the more than 500 cases of coronavirus in Australia without a known source of infection. “That is why we cannot relax,” he said.
“It could all come undone. We’ve seen what this virus can do … it can spread to 30, 50, several hundred people very quickly. We have to be maintaining that vigilance.” NSW Health confirmed an 87-year-old woman who had travelled on the Ruby Princess Cruise ship and a 90-year-old man who was a resident of the Opal Care nursing home in Bankstown had both died from coronavirus, bring the state’s death toll to 21.
Across Australia 48 people have died.
About 305 people with COVID-19 are currently being treated in hospital, with 93 patients in intensive care and of these 37 are on ­ventilators.
Experts from the Peter Doherty Institute who prepared the modelling warned relaxing current measures would result in a “rapid and explosive resurgence” of the virus.
The modelling shows a combination of quarantining and isolating the sick, and strict social distancing in the general community would suppress the spread of the virus enough to ensure ICUs were not overwhelmed. Researchers found broad based social distancing measures were most effective in ­reducing the chance of transmission from people with COVID-19 who are either contagious before showing signs of illness, or never ­develop symptoms.
Assuming the measures are able to reduce transmission by 33 per cent, the modelling shows pressure on emergency departments and hospital beds would be “substantially eased”.
“As a result, the proportion of critical cases that can access care is greatly increased,” the research found.
In this scenario, experts believe the treatment of all cases would be “achievable” in most scenarios, provided Australia increased ICU bed capacity by at least three, if not five times the normal amount. Australia is on track to triple its ICU capacity to 7500 beds and ventilators.

Full text: PROGRESS AUSTRALIA faces an “explosive resurgence” of the coronavirus if unprecedented social distancing and self-isolation rules are relaxed.
Authorities are on high alert for the Easter long weekend, with Scott Morrison warning the nation faces a “horror scenario” if people become complacent.
Alarming modelling released yesterday by the Prime Minister showed about 30,000 critically ill Australians would have been left to fight the coronavirus without intensive care if it had been allowed to rip through the country.
The worst-case scenario model, based on international evidence, predicted an uncontrolled outbreak would infect almost 23 million Australians, 38 per cent of whom would need medical care.
At the peak, 35,000 people would have needed intensive care beds — and hospitals would have only had room for 15 per cent, likely costing thousands of lives.
The national cabinet used the modelling to decide on quarantine, isolation and social distancing measures, with overseas experience suggesting it would reduce community transmission of the virus by a third, freeing up intensive care beds.
Mr Morrison said those measures meant Australia had avoided tens of thousands of cases by slowing the spread of the virus even faster than the government expected.
“But we must hold the course — we must lock in these gains,” he said. “We have so far avoided the horror scenarios that we have seen overseas. “We have bought valuable time, but we cannot be complacent. This Easter weekend will be incredibly important. Stay at home. Failure to do so this weekend would completely undo everything we have achieved so far together — and potentially worse.” Chief medical officer Professor Brendan Murphy said the biggest concern was more than 500 people, including 93 Victorians, acquired the virus “from someone in the community that doesn't know they’ve had it”.
“That is why we cannot relax,” he said.
“If we, in any way, lose that rigour that the Australian community has embraced, particularly over Easter, it could all come ­undone.” Mr Morrison insists restrictions could be in place for six months, while NSW Premier Gladys Berejiklian said social distancing would be “a way of life” until a vaccine was found — likely at least a year away.
University of Melbourne epidemiologist Professor James McCaw, from the Doherty Institute team that produced the modelling, warned softening such measures could result in a “rapid and explosive resurgence in epidemic activity”.
He said the number of new cases would decline as restrictions were enforced, but the population was “still largely susceptible” to the virus.
Premier Daniel Andrews also declared this weekend was “a matter of life and death”.
“We have a long weekend coming up — we do not have a holiday weekend coming up,” he said.
“If people go about their business and have a normal Easter, then all of our hard-won gains will just be frittered away.” Victoria recorded another 33 cases yesterday, taking the state’s total to 1191, as a woman in her 80s died in hospital to become the 11th casualty, with another 47 people in hospital including 13 in intensive care.
Grandfather Francesco Ferraro yesterday became the first South Australian to die from the virus.
He had attended a large family wedding in Melbourne last month, where at least 13 guests had flown in from Italy, a virus hotspot.
Doherty Institute epidemiology director Professor Jodie McVernon said the early modelling was so severe it was hard to comprehend, and no pandemic planning in the world had considered measures as harsh as a lockdown — now commonplace two months later.
“It was clear very early that unmitigated epidemics would be well beyond any high-income country’s healthcare system’s capacity,” she said.
Prof McCaw said Australia was now in a “lucky position” to plan its next steps in calm rather than crisis.
Prof Murphy said there were “lots of potential paths” to tackle the virus in the future.
“At the moment, our strategy is very much to identify, completely control and isolate every case,” he said.

Full text: Australia's leaders must make a hard choice in the next two weeks: deciding what social distancing measures the nation is willing to live under over the long term and what death toll they are willing to bear.
The success of social distancing rules means Australia appears close to passing the first peak of the coronavirus pandemic, according to one mathematical model, but leading epidemiologists say the moment Australia loosens those rules, infection rates will climb.
The pandemic will only end when enough people have been infected to achieve herd immunity or scientists develop a vaccine, likely at least 12 months away, experts said.
In interviews with The Age this week, leading epidemiologists laid out two roads for the nation.
Australia can choose to live in total lockdown until a vaccine is developed. Or it can choose to loosen restrictions, which comes with a higher death toll.
One option being canvassed in the UK is a cycle of loosening restrictions and then reintroducing them when infection rates climb, which could mean six months of openness and 12 of lockdowns.
"We need to start discussing this," said Professor Tony Blakeley, one of Australia's leading epidemiologists. "Some of us are now wondering whether the social cure is worse than the disease."
Modelling by Professor Mikhail Prokopenko's University of Sydney team suggests if Australia maintains social distancing rules, new infections could fall to almost zero by July.
"It is quite likely the incidence peak is very close," he said. "We may have even passed it."
The federal government has said it will release its top-level modelling on Tuesday, which will further inform the choices we face. Epidemiologists said Australia was unlikely to ever eliminate the virus using social distancing. "I think the consensus is, with the number of cases we have, it would be very difficult to drive the virus out altogether," said University of Melbourne epidemiologist Professor John Mathews.
We either can stay locked down until a vaccine is developed or herd immunity reached or try to loosen restrictions without overwhelming our healthcare system.
Herd immunity requires about 60 per cent or more of Australians to be infected with the virus in order to stop it circulating in the community.
Scientists predict a vaccine is 12 to 18 months away. It also is possible that one will never be developed.
"That's a scary possibility," said Professor Blakely, head of population interventions at the University of Melbourne's Centre for Epidemiology. That could mean a society trapped inside indefinitely.
"The cost on society is immense: economic loss, social disruption, major damage to quality of life," said Professor Blakely. "Unemployment kills. Housing insecurity kills. Social isolation kills."
The second option is a gradual loosening of social restrictions once new infections fall close to zero.
People at lower risk can come out of their homes and return to work. Some pubs and cafes could reopen.
The lockdown would never end for high-risk groups. They would remain cloistered until a vaccine was developed or herd immunity established. Almost inevitably, that would mean more infections.
"We are likely to see multiple waves," said Professor Catherine Bennett, chair in epidemiology at Deakin University.
In the 1918 Spanish flu pandemic, communities that dealt best with the first wave of deaths tended to see larger second waves. Australia's winter will likely be worse than summer and our hospitals will have to deal with flu victims as well.
There is the option to loosen the lockdown a little and try to hold the infection rate at a sustainable level until we get a vaccine.
"Modelling does suggest that we need some sort of social distancing in addition to case finding and contact finding," said Professor Allen Cheng, director of epidemiology at Alfred Health and an expert adviser to the federal government. "But how much social distancing is enough, and how targeted can it be, is the difficult question for everyone."

It's time to loosen the blindfolds

Full text: The virus death forecasts are grim, but Australians don't want to be shielded from the truth, writes chief political correspondent David Crowe.
Australia is on a steep slide into a health emergency with almost everyone wearing blindfolds on the descent. Even the experts cannot be sure of the broader strategy to manage the fall and quicken the recovery when the worst passes - as it will.
The strategy depends on the cruel numbers of the COVID-19 pandemic: transmissions, infections, deaths. Every government decision today can produce a different number in two weeks, but our leaders are keeping this to themselves.
It is time to loosen the blindfolds.
"In the last week I've been concerned at the lack of information provided by government and the advisers," says Tony Blakely, a professorial fellow in epidemiology at the University of Melbourne. Blakely can guess why politicians do not release their modelling. While the federal government has a team working on the likely infections and deaths, the forecasts would be alarming.
Scott Morrison and other leaders might think Australians have enough to worry about already.
"But that's not what I read at the moment," Blakely says. "I see a population that actually wants to be told it straight, that wants to know what those numbers are, that wants to understand how those decisions are being made."
Other countries are being more open. In Britain, the approach was guided by an Imperial College study that warned of an "unmitigated epidemic" that would cost 510,000 lives. That conclusion changed policy almost overnight.
Australia has conjecture instead. When the Imperial College work was applied to Australia, it suggested at least 50,000 would die. This was based on the assumption that 20 per cent of our population would be infected and the mortality rate would be 1 per cent.
The more debate we have about these projections the better. The crowds on Bondi Beach were not the only sign of complacency in recent weeks. The debate on shutdowns has become stuck in the weeds. Are gyms shut down or not? What are the rules on barre? The disputes about the details suggest the most important message is not being heard.
That message? Australia will be very lucky to survive this crisis without our families shattered, our economy frozen and our society under immense strain.
Blakely keeps his focus on the big picture. Applying the Imperial College work, he warns Australia could have a death toll of 134,000 if the infection reaches 60 per cent of all age groups.
Shielding older and more vulnerable people is vital. The data for those aged from 70 to 79 shows why. Among people infected in this age group, 24.3 per cent require hospitalisation. Of those, 43.2 per cent require critical care. The death rate is 5.1 per cent. For those infected and aged 80 to 89, the death rate is 9.3 per cent.
If we "wrap protection" around these people, Blakely says, the death rate falls significantly. It could be 58,000 if we assume more isolation for the elderly and higher infections among the young, who can survive the threat so much better. The fatalities could be lower if we assume better treatment and healthcare.
"There are still going to be more deaths than we'd like," he says. "It's 30,000 under my best-case scenario and it might be a little bit optimistic, but I think we can do that. It's not pretty, but it's OK."
There is one catch. The modelling cannot be precise and the Imperial College study is only one way of looking at a new pandemic that is moving so fast it is hard to pin down. The science is not settled. The argument over schools has been conducted in this scientific fog. The medical advice so far, relayed by the top commonwealth medical officers, is that it is best to keep children at schools.
While Morrison has been attacked for wanting to keep children in schools, the science is on his side. The verdicts on the science may change, in which case the policy should change, but that is not the case so far.
Those looking for mistakes can easily find them elsewhere. The government advertising campaign has been too weak. The warnings to older Australians, in particular, should have been running at full volume weeks ago.
Stuart Robert failed Australians as Services Australia Minister by not predicting the queues at Centrelink. The government chose to use Centrelink to deliver its stimulus cash, then forced people to go to Centrelink by shutting businesses. It is ridiculous that it's surprised by the calls for help.
The biggest mistake remains the muddled message when the virus ballooned. It was on this day two weeks ago that Morrison said he wanted to go to the football on the weekend - a declaration he reversed on the Friday night. Within days there was a ban on gatherings of more than 500.
One of Morrison's objectives is to apply gradual controls to shield the economy. He has to choose between competing goals. But the virus is not the only killer. The economic damage will cost lives over time.
Blakely remains unclear on the government's end goal. Judging Morrison by his actions, not by his words, he sees a workable approach that could slow the virus and limit the deaths. It will take two weeks to be sure whether the shutdown measures are limiting the spread of the virus. While people argue over the messaging or the specific measures, that is what counts.
"No government's going to get it all right," he says. "I actually think the Morrison government has done it pretty well in the last week, to be honest. But I think there are mistakes being made in not being transparent with the public."
