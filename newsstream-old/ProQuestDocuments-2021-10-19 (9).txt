Full text: FROM page 1 While double-vaccination freedoms had been part of interstate roadmaps, Mr Ferguson said a similar decision had not yet been made in Tasmania.
"We want to be able to enjoy Tasmania in a more conventional, more normal way, so we look forward to providing that further advice," he said.
Premier Peter Gutwein announced a diversion from the COVID National Plan in late September when he revealed state-specific modelling applied to the federal government's Doherty Institute could result in grave consequences.
He said the same approach would see 14,900 COVID cases in the state in the first six months along with 590 hospital admissions, 97 intensive care admissions, and almost 100 deaths.
State Health Minister Jeremy Rockliff was last week co-signatory on a letter to federal Health Minister Greg Hunt calling for more Commonwealth funding for hospitals to help them get through COVID challenges.
But Mr Ferguson remained confident the state's hospital system was "well prepared for the positive cases that will come".
"We're well prepared, we've got significant redundancy in out health system that we've actually held onto since the initial outbreak that occurred in Tasmania [and] we've got significant resources on standby if required," he said.
"That is part of the management of COVID going forward."
While Mr Ferguson was steely in his resolve, the opposition called on the government to be "upfront and honest" about the health system and "the dire need for more federal funding".
"The facts remain that even without the burden of COVID Tasmania's health system is at breaking point," Labor Health spokeswoman Anita Dow said.
"Our health system is in crisis ... As we look to reopen out borders, we know that will have a significant impact on our health system's ability to stand up.
"We're already exceeding our demand right across the state when it comes to providing health services to our communities."

Full text: Gyms limbered up to once again pipe dance music through their studios. Salon owners polished their shiny surfaces, and across the city thousands of retailers were being brought out of ­stasis, eager to reawaken.
Nearly four months since the city’s longest and harshest lockdown was imposed, Monday’s wind-back of government decrees marked the first of a three-phase ending to the restrictions ushered in with the outbreak of the Delta variant.
From Monday, people who can demonstrate immunity will be able to once again share meals in cafes, return to cinemas and welcome up to 10 guests into their home. Weddings and funerals will return with density limits of 100 people, while socialising in groups of up to 30 will be allowable outdoors.
Monica Schnieper, owner of Pelle Designer Footwear and Accessories, in Sydney’s inner-city Paddington, said the lockdown had nearly ended her business of 25 years, but described a palpable excitement having returned to the suburb in recent days.
After nearly four months, the lockdown has now lifted in Sydney – with vaccinated people across New South Wales now able to access businesses and venues with capacity limits. Under the Reopening NSW roadmap at 70 per cent double-dose, the following freedoms will apply only to fully vaccinated adults and those with medical exemptions: Up to five visitors will be allowed in a home where all adults are vaccinated (not including children 12 and under). Up to 20 people can gather in outdoor settings. Hospitality venues can reopen subject to one person per 4sqm inside and one person per 2sqm outside, with standing while drinking permitted outside. Retail stores can reopen under the one person per 4sqm rule (unvaccinated people will continue to only be able to access critical retail). Personal services such as hairdressers and nail salons can open with one person per 4sqm, capped at five clients per premises. Gyms and indoor recreation facilities can open under the one person per 4sqm rule and can offer classes for up to 20 people. Sporting facilities including swimming pools can reopen. Major recreation outdoor facilities including stadiums, racecourses, theme parks and zoos can reopen with one person per 4sqm, capped at 5,000 people. Up to 500 people can attend ticketed and seated outdoor events. Indoor entertainment and information facilities including cinemas, theatres, music halls, museums and galleries can reopen with one person per 4sqm or 75 per cent fixed seated capacity. Up to 50 guests can attend weddings, with dancing permitted and eating and drinking only while seated. Up to 50 guests can attend funerals, with eating and drinking while seated. Churches and places of worship to open subject to one person per 4sqm rule, with no singing.
“For the last week, people have been walking past and looking in the shop window, knocking on the door, eager to come in,” Ms ­Schnieper said.
“There’s a lot of excitement on the street, which fills me with hope after a pretty dark time.”
To accommodate window-shoppers, Ms Schnieper placed two chairs on the footpath outside her store to give prospective customers a chance to try on shoes.
“I made a couple of important sales that way,” she added. Monday’s easing of restrictions similarly ends a requirement for mask-wearing outdoors — except for hospitality staff — while also jettisoning the mobility limits that confined residents to within a 5km radius of their homes.
Forecasts of driving rain did not appear to dampen spirits. The Glenmore Hotel in The Rocks is preparing to seat 400 guests on its first day of opening, its rooftop booked out with 100 people.
“We’re expecting big things,” said Lincoln Baker, the venue’s manager.
Covid-19 case numbers are predicted to climb substantially off the back of the increased mobility, but officials remain committed to easing restrictions further once 80 per cent of the state is vaccinated, and again at 90 per cent.
As of Sunday, some 73.5 per cent of NSW residents had received both doses of a vaccine, with 90.3 per cent having received one dose, according to federal data.
Hundreds of people got to experience the taste of freedom at 12.01am with their first trip to Kmart in almost five months.
NSW Premier Dominic Perrottet said Monday’s reopening was a “first step” towards mending the state’s battered economy, but he acknowledged these steps would test his government’s ­decision-making and become a subject of scrutiny across the country.
He spent part of his press briefing on Sunday wiping beer off his face after tapping a keg at a Marsden Park brewery in the city’s northwest that partially exploded.
He urged NSW residents to treat each other with “kindness and respect” during the transition to a vaccine-mandated economy.
“As we reopen after more than 100 days, we ask everyone to treat staff with kindness and respect when they ask you to check in or see your vaccination certificate,” Mr Perrottet said.
Modelling by the Burnet Institute released by the NSW government in September predicted a caseload peak of up to 2000 infections a day and intensive care units overrun in the state’s public hospitals.
Contingency plans were established to prepare for these scenarios but as of Sunday the forecasts did not appear to have played out, with cases continuing to decline alongside patients requiring ICU.
NSW Health said 477 fresh cases of the virus were recorded on Saturday, with 177 people being treated in intensive care.
Both are substantially lower than the numbers recorded across the past four weeks.
In Sydney’s inner-west Balmain, shop owner Peta Palomino, who runs clothing store Blokes Balmain, said local businesses were banking on a rapid return of customers. “I had planned to reopen on Tuesday, but customers have been calling asking when they can come in again, so I’ve decided to open up a day earlier,” she said, adding that some had resorted to unusual measures to purchase clothes in the meantime.
“I recently had a case where a long-term customer came to the shop front desperate for new shorts. He decided he would try them on over his trousers in the street. His wife was very amused and he bought three pairs.”
Nearby, Joanne Farah’s toy shop The Little Treasure Chest was forced to close and hand-­deliver parcels to customers to reduce costs. The widowed mother of three said she had balanced homeschooling with the demands of the business, but it had struggled to shift to online sales.
“Business has been lost to bigger online companies during lockdown, so I’m hoping as soon as we open up, people come back and pick up their toys,” Ms Farah said.


NSW Premier Dominic Perrottet is pleading for patience and kindness as hospitality venues in Greater Sydney prepare to open to the fully vaccinated after 106 days in lockdown.
Among attractions scheduled to return is Taronga Zoo, which will welcome its first guests from Friday, and whose staff have been working through the lockdown to maintain the health and wellbeing of the animals.
Brad Mackenzie, supervisor of the Marine Mammal Unit, said the zoo’s seals were among those that continued performing during this period for this purpose. “They actually didn’t stop training. Training for us and the seals is an important part of their mental and physical health,” he said

VAX RATES ON THE RISE

Full text: HEALTH chiefs say Victoria is pulling ahead of vaccination target dates in the state’s reopening road map, but fear record rises in Covid-19 cases could swamp hospitals.
As Melburnians were out and about enjoying the spring sunshine on Saturday, there were 1965 coronavirus cases reported and five deaths.
Modelling is predicting daily infection numbers could rise to 3000 within weeks, spurring calls for people to get jabbed as soon as possible.
Kate Matson, Department of Health deputy secretary for Covid-19 response, backed calls from community leaders, in the Saturday Herald Sun, for people to “close the gap” between doses and quicken the path to freedom from lockdown.
“I think it is possible that we hit the October 26 and November 5 (reopening) dates earlier, if people do rush to their local vaccination sites, pharmacies and GPs,” she said. “It’s in all our power to bring those dates forward.” Those dates were targets the government set to have 70 per cent and then 80 per cent of people over the age of 16 double-jabbed.
Ms Matson also said modelling by the Burnet Institute would be “refreshed” in coming days to update likely hospitalisation rates from recent case surges.
Government Services Minister Danny Pearson said 85 per cent of eligible Victorians had received their first jab, while 57 per cent were fully vaccinated.
There are now 578 Victorians in hospital with 117 in ICU and 83 on ventilation. In a desperate bid to prop up the struggling hospital network once lockdowns ease, the government has flown in health professionals from overseas.
Contact tracers are focusing on Melbourne hotspots in the north and southeast, as well as Mildura where 20 extra cases were identified on Saturday.
There are also fears that an infected cabin crew member who worked on six flights across three major Australian cities, may have spread Covid-19.
Ms Matson said the Virgin employee had worked from October 4-6, including flights between Melbourne and Adelaide, Melbourne and Sydney, and Melbourne and Newcastle.
As plans for reopening take shape, Mr Pearson announced a $15m fund for arts and entertainment groups to prepare for when live events could be held once more.
Victorian Chamber of Commerce and Industry chief executive Paul Guerra has also called for Melbourne’s New Year’s Eve fireworks to be brought back to encourage people into the city.
“While the theatres and the restaurants and a bit of retail will help, it’s the events that really drag people in,” he said.
“We’ve got to have a summer calendar of events that starts to encourage people to be back in the CBD.” “We need to be able to move back into a Covid normal environment.” matthew.johnston@news.com.au

Full text: HEALTH chiefs say Victoria is pulling ahead of vaccination target dates in the state’s reopening road map, but fear record rises in Covid-19 cases could swamp hospitals.
Melburnians were out and about enjoying the spring sunshine yesterday as the state inches closer to freedom.
There were a whopping 1965 coronavirus cases reported on Saturday, and five deaths, and modelling predicts daily infection numbers could rise to 3000 within weeks.
The record numbers spurred on calls for people to get jabbed as soon as possible, with vaccination protections the key to bringing down infections.

Premier stays silent on Covid exit plan

Full text: EDITORIAL QUEENSLANDERS finally have some answers on what life may look like over the next few months as vaccination rates soar and we transition to living with Covid-19.
But for some inexplicable reason, the Premier is not the one providing those answers.
Today, The Courier-Mail can reveal some important aspects of Queensland’s plan to open up.
Chief health officer Dr Jeannette Young has confirmed stranded Queenslanders wanting to come home will be able to home quarantine by December.
Some returning Queenslanders have already been invited to participate in a home quarantine trial. And senior doctors have revealed the plans to manage patients in hospitals, with 50,000 cases expected over roughly six months when Covid hits the state.
These are the sorts of details Queenslanders have been crying out for over the past few months. But instead of answering repeated questions on home quarantine, how hospitals will cope and when Queensland will open its borders, Premier Annastacia Palaszczuk has deflected at every turn.
We need to vaccinate the children, she said. I need to see the revised Doherty modelling, she claimed. And on the subject of opening up? Well, as of yesterday she now needs to see what the plan is for booster vaccines.
Home quarantine has been a cornerstone of the national plan – agreed to by all states, including Queensland – as international travel resumes and state borders open up. Last week, Prime Minister Scott Morrison announced Australian states can reopen to international travellers in November once they hit their 80 per cent vaccination targets.
Ms Palaszczuk said it was “disappointing” that state and territory leaders were not briefed ahead of the national cabinet meeting last Friday, seemingly forgetting her own announcement about the Wellcamp quarantine facility, which similarly blindsided the federal government.
On Sunday, she dismissed fears Queensland would be left behind once other states opened up to international travel using home quarantine arrangements. But some Queenslanders stranded interstate have already been sent a letter saying they can quarantine at home from October 11.
There are a lot of hoops to jump through – for instance, you need to be able to prove you have enough food, you have to quarantine in a house and attend drive-through testing clinics multiple times – but for many, this is a small price to pay after being locked out for months. These are all really useful details that could have been revealed much, much earlier.
The same goes for details on how our hospitals are preparing for a potential Covid outbreak.
According to John Gerrard, head of infectious diseases at Gold Coast University Hospital, hospitals will have a hub of medics to manage the home care of vaccinated patients with less severe disease via teleconference.
The numbers show hospitals will be under pressure – mostly from unvaccinated people – but he reiterated staff were as prepared as they can be. That is in contrast to Ms Palaszczuk’s comments on Sunday that no hospital system in the country was ready. She was swiftly corrected by Dr Young. Queenslanders are sick of the politics and just want to know what our future holds.

Full text: It comes after another high Covid-19 tally was recorded.
Authorities on Thursday confirmed there were 564 people were in hospital - a rise in 39 people from the day prior.
The state recorded a 21 person jump to 115 people in intensive care, and also 21 more people on ventilators.
There’s now concern the hospital system may become overwhelmed as Victorians race to get vaccinated.
Acting chief health officer Ben Cowie said hospitalisations generally occurred between seven to 10 days after a person tested positive.
He expects to see an increase in Covid hospital admissions.
“When we see days of 1700 cases, we are not just worried about that because of the case number, we are worried that 80 or 90 of those people are going to end up in hospital down the track,” he said.
“The pressure on the whole system is increasing and it will continue to increase and the thing we can do about that is get vaccinated.”
Victoria recorded 1638 new Covid cases on Thursday and another two deaths.
Earlier this week, the state broke a record for the highest ever daily cases in Australia, with 1763 infections reported.
Thursday’s tally was significantly higher than Wednesday’s 1420 infections, as the figure bounces around the mid-1000s.
But despite the high numbers, the Burnet Institute’s Mark Stoove said the state was still on track to reopening.
“The numbers that have been coming through over the last week or so have been high and they’ve been stabilising between 1000 and 1500,” Professor Stoove told Today.
“But it is well within the bounds of our modelling. I don’t see any reason why the government would want to change its road map at the moment.”
It comes a day after a cancer ward at the Melbourne Royal Children’s Hospital was listed as a public exposure site when a parent tested positive to the virus.
Hospital CEO Bernadette McDonald said the exposure occurred a few days ago and contact tracing was underway.
“Every time we get an exposure site it’s concerning to all of us and we’re trying to minimise it as much as possible,” she said.
“But we do know that Covid in children is not as extreme as it does affect adults. But all children, no matter where they are, are monitored very closely, whether they’ve got Covid or not, and if they happen to become Covid positive, there’s an increased monitoring.
“This is something we’re seeing regularly and that’s why we have our screening processes in place.”
Victoria on Wednesday announced it would roll out rapid antigen testing in the state’s healthcare settings.
More than 500 people are in Victorian hospitals with Covid, with 101 in intensive care and 66 on a ventilator.
The government will purchase at least 2.2 million tests throughout the state’s healthcare system before expanding to “riskier” settings such as schools, childcare, corrections and emergency services.
The testing will also be used to manage close contacts and for triage patients seeking access to urgent care.
“There will of course be an opportunity for industry and for domestic use and for other areas of the Victorian community to incorporate rapid testing,” Health Minister Martin Foley said.
“It will be part of the ongoing toolkit to make sure that we can manage and deal with the potential for Covid in our daily lives.”

Full text: Tasmania must reject the federal government's national plan for reopening the country and take the most cautious approach possible due to recent overseas evidence of the transmissibility of Delta, a health policy analyst believes.
And even when state borders fully reopen - either in December or early 2022 - mask mandates and restrictions would likely still apply to prevent extreme pressure being placed on Tasmania's health system.
Martyn Goddard released analysis on Tuesday into the latest overseas data on the effectiveness of vaccines to prevent Delta transmissibility, claiming that while the vaccines were effective at preventing serious illness, they were not entirely effective at slowing the spread.
He found that modelling relied upon by the Doherty Institute in informing the federal government's reopening plan was already out of date, and that vaccination targets of 70 and 80 per cent were far too low.

Mr Goddard's analysis found that Tasmania would be in trouble even with the state government's ambitious target of 90 per cent double-dose vaccination for all people eligible over the age of 16 by December should COVID be allowed to spread, given the large numbers of unvaccinated people still in the community at that level.
He commended the government on having more ambitious vaccination targets than the federal government, but warned Tasmanians that life was unlikely to return to normal any time soon.
"Once we start to open up, it will not be as free as it is now, that's the price we're going to have to pay," Mr Goddard said.
"We either stay where we are now, keep the borders closed and try to control anything that does come in, or we start to open up and the extent to which we open up - the controls we put in place - are going to be absolutely crucial."
While Victoria, NSW and ACT might want borders reopened at 80 per cent, Mr Goddard said this would be unfair on states that have gone without COVID spread for much of the past 18 months.
"What the federal government is wanting states like Western Australia and Tasmania to do is, in my view, insane," he said.

"It might go down OK in Sydney and Melbourne where they've got lots of lockdowns - that's a different mindset, a different situation to what we're facing.
"What works for them does not work for us, and for any state government - in the Tasmanian or Western Australian situation - to just open up and do what Scott Morrison wants would be, in my view, nuts."
With 90 per cent of eligible Tasmanians vaccinated, there would still be 116,000 unvaccinated, with children 15 and under not included in the government's figures.
Slow and steady approach preferred for Tasmania Economist Saul Eslake agreed with Mr Goddard's analysis, and urged the Tasmanian Government to only reopen when modelling showed it was absolutely safe to do so.
"I think it would be better in the medium to longer run to wait until we have reached levels of vaccination that the serious modelling tells us is safe, and minimises the risk of going back into recurring lockdowns, than to go earlier than that and run the risk," he said.
Tasmania has not experienced community transmission since May last year, when the North-West outbreak resulted in the closure of two hospitals.
Mr Eslake said the evidence from the United Kingdom and Israel showed that opening up the economy too soon could have dire consequences for health systems, costing the state more in the long run.
"If you open up with (vaccination) percentages of the total population that low, especially bearing in mind that the Delta variant seems to be affecting younger people much more than the Alpha and other variants, you are... taking a considerable risk," he said.
"There is a sound argument that Tasmania needs to be more careful than other jurisdictions might be able to be given the inadequacies of our health system."
The pair were eager to urge all Tasmanians to get vaccinated as the greatest defence against COVID.
"You can't rely on somebody else getting vaccinated to protect you," Mr Goddard said.
"You've got to do it yourself. You've got to protect yourself, you've got to take responsibility to get vaccinated and it's really important to do it now."
Tasmania-specific modelling weeks away to inform opening plan Professor Raina MacIntyre from the University of NSW's Kirby Institute is preparing Tasmania-specific modelling to guide the government's opening plan, expected to be released within two weeks.
Director of Public Health Mark Veitch said the latest data - including the transmissibility of the Delta strain among the vaccinated - will be factored in.
"They will also be putting into it estimates of the extent to which the vaccine prevents transmission," he said.

"We know that's less effective at preventing transmission as it is at those severe clinical consequences, but the models will put the latest in, and it'll also put values in a bit higher or lower just to see how that changes the picture."
Health Minister Jeremy Rockliff welcomed Mr Goddard's input, and said the health and safety of Tasmanians would be the main priority in developing a reopening plan.
"That will inform us when we make some very key decisions when we get those vaccination rates at 90 per cent or above," he said.
"There are various scenarios that Professor MacIntyre is modelling through the Kirby Institute, and we look forward to receiving that modelling."

Full text: MORE FRUSTRATION AS STATE DELAYS COVID ROAD MAP LAGGING vaccination rates in poorer communities has become the Palaszczuk government’s latest roadblock to reopening under the national plan when 80 per cent of people are double-dosed.
And Queenslanders have been told they will need to wait for the international travel trial outcomes from NSW, though experts insist there is no reason why the Sunshine State cannot commit to reopening now.
When asked if the state would reopen at 80 per cent, Premier Annastacia Palaszczuk’s office on Saturday said she was still waiting for “completed advice” from the Doherty Institute.
But that advice is done, with a federal government spokesman saying NSW, the ACT, NT and Victoria had released road maps.
“It is a matter for Queensland to articulate why they cannot make decisions based on the advice already provided to … other states,” he said.
Infectious diseases expert Paul Griffin said other states were implementing the same advice Queensland had.
“I don’t think we need to reinvent the wheel here in terms of questioning that ­advice too much,” he said.
Just days after Ms Palaszczuk contentiously asked why people would want to travel to India or Tokyo, Health Minister Yvette D’Ath on Saturday questioned why anyone would want to travel to Bali, which has had an average of 1900 cases daily for the past week.
“I have said continuously around the 80 per cent threshold that the Doherty Institute modelling is not just about percentage,” she said.
“It’s also whether, as a state, what’s the number of outbreaks you’ve got? Whether you are able to test, whether you are able to contract trace, whether you are able to isolate the virus and manage those things.
“I saw the reference to Bali … where people will be able to travel to Bali and back but may not be able to travel to Queensland. Can I say I don’t know if anyone wants to be travelling to Bali right now when they recorded 1693 cases two days ago, and the seven-day average for Bali … it’s over 1900 cases a day.” It’s understood the Doherty Institute explained its update on the impact of Covid-19 spread if seven-day home quarantine was adopted during Friday’s national cabinet meeting.
The federal government spokesman said Doherty would continue to advise ­national cabinet in addition to the modelling that was ­finalised and adopted by all jurisdictions in September.
“Governments should hold up their end of the deal made with Australians, that if they get vaccinated they would be able to enjoy greater freedoms and eased restrictions,” he said.
Assoc Prof Griffin said if Queensland delayed a decision there could be a “big lag” before it could be implemented.
“We do risk being significantly behind other states (in border reopenings),” he said.
Ms D’Ath said the government was not “closed off” to the idea of resuming international travel but the Commonwealth had to do more planning around what countries Australia opened up to.
Ms D’Ath said the 80 per cent vaccination rate figure was “one element” of the Doherty modelling. “That 20 per cent, if we’re looking at percentage and percentage alone, in every jurisdiction it is saying that that 20 per cent – that could be our remote indigenous communities, it could be our low-socio economic, it could be our multicultural communities that have a lower percentage of protection in their vaccination rates, that we’re OK for them to have outbreaks,” she said. “So we’ve got to look at all of it.”

COVID - is our health system ready?

Full text: That long anticipated day when NSW re-opens from its COVID hibernation is drawing closer. But is our health system ready for it?
It will begin with some eased restrictions on the Monday after the state hits 70 per cent double vaccinations. Even greater freedoms can be expected when that double vaccination rate hits 80 per cent.
The state-wide road map to re-opening is based on modelling by the Doherty Institute, and that first target is shaping up to be mid-October. That's less than a month away.
While at first glance the promise of more freedoms seems like a positive, the big question is 'are our rural, regional and remote communities ready?' More specifically 'is our health system ready?'
The health landscape has changed forever because of this pandemic. And that impacts every one of us.
Many would argue that our health system has been in poor health for quite some time. Submissions and witness testimony to a State parliamentary inquiry that began in September last year paint a picture of an already chronically ill system.
Health Services Union NSW Secretary, Gerard Hayes, has been quite clear about his concern that our regional and rural health care services are not prepared for what lies ahead.
"I'm not saying this to be obtuse, but what we have seen over the past decade has been a system tightening its belt constantly and working to be as lean as possible," Mr Hayes said. What good are extra beds in an upgraded hospital if there are not enough staff to adequately support the patients that may occupy those beds?
Dr Debra King, North Coast representative on the Royal Australian College of General Practitioners NSW board fears an increase in general practitioners getting burnt out with the increased workload.
"Our workforce doesn't go up, we just work longer hours," she said.
Meanwhile, our paramedics are being pushed beyond the limit.
Burn out among health professionals, could well be our next health disaster. We don't have a vaccine for that.
We do have them for COVID-19, though.
Ready or not, we must move out of the lockdown phase of the pandemic. High vaccination rates are key to minimising harm as we do so.
So too is an adequately resourced and funded health system. It is well past time regional, rural and remote NSW had one.

Full text: Almost 100 Tasmanians would lose their lives to COVID-19 if the state opened its borders to the country at an 80-per-cent vaccination rate.
This statistic is based on state-specific modelling, revealed on Wednesday, applied to the Doherty Institute report on border reopenings.
Premier Peter Gutwein said there would be 14,900 COVID cases in the state in the first six months should Tasmania open to states, including NSW and Victoria, at 80 per cent with baseline restrictions.
READ MORE: 100 COVID deaths predicted if state borders open
He said there would be 590 hospital admissions, 97 intensive care admissions, and almost 100 deaths.
"As we move to reopen our borders, the Delta [strain] will arrive," Mr Gutwein said.
"When Delta arrives, that will mean that some people will get sick, some people will get very sick, and unfortunately some people will die."

Health Department secretary Kathrine Morgan-Wicks said the state was still on track to reach a 90-per-cent vaccination rate by December 1.
She said more than 331,000 Tasmanians had been administered their first dose of the COVID vaccine and more than 251,000 had been fully vaccinated.

Ms Morgan-Wicks said more than 25,000 people aged over 50 years old had not yet received a first dose of the vaccine.
She said those in the 12 to 15 year age group were lagging behind the vaccination rate of that cohort in other states.
Mr Gutwein said borders were planned to be reopened by Christmas, however, that depended on circumstances around COVID-19 in other jurisdictions.

Regional outbreak continues to grow; new case in Ballarat, two in Moorabool

Full text: Regional Victoria is continuing to see growing cases of COVID -19 on a day where cases broke a new record
There are now 225 active cases in regional Victoria with an additional case in Ballarat.
There were also two new cases in the shire of Moorabool but their exact location was not yet known.
Acting chief health officer Professor Ben Cowie said from the modelling and experience of NSW, numbers were likely to continue to climb.
"But it is absolutely with in our power to slow the spread and to prevent thousands of cases and thousands of people from becoming seriously ill and some people losing their lives," Prof. Cowie said.
"And we can do that by following the public health directions, social distancing, and, of course, getting vaccinated."
The spread of the outbreak continues to grow on both sides of the state.
"There were nine in Mitchell Shire, four cases in Warrnambool, all from the same household, two cases from Greater Dandenong, two cases in Moorabool, two cases in Wellington, and one case each in Strathbogie, Surf Coast, Ballarat, Murrindindee, Corangamite, Baw Baw Shire, and South's Gippsland."
Ballarat and the region had several new exposure sites overnight including two in Ballan and two in Daylesford as well as an extra time for a fruit shop in Wendouree.
Earlier Victoria recorded 950 new locally acquired COVID-19 cases and seven deaths.
It is the state's highest daily figure since the start of the pandemic, surpassing the previous record of 867 cases on Tuesday.
The new infections bring the number of active cases in the state to 9890. It brings the toll from the current outbreak to 32.
This figure comes from 61,322 test results according to the DHHS.
Health officials say 34,020 vaccine doses were administered in the 24 hours to Monday evening.

Meanwhile Victorian paramedics are transferring about 150 COVID-19 patients to hospital each day, only for them to be turned away.
Ambulance Victoria's Mick Stephenson says the state's health system is facing unprecedented pressure due to a rise in COVID-19 cases and other emergency presentations.
"We're having longer delays at hospital than we've ever had before and our capacity to respond and our performance has never been challenged as much as it has been over recent weeks," he told ABC Radio Melbourne on Wednesday.
"If the growth in COVID cases continues, performance will be expected to get poorer unless we can do something about reducing the number of people coming into hospital."
Associate Professor Stephenson said transferring COVID-19 patients had become a "major issue" for paramedics.
"Ambulance (Victoria) alone at the moment is transporting about 150 COVID- positive patients a day, they take an extraordinarily long time to process in emergency departments, so they make a significant contribution to slowing the system down," he said.
Assoc Prof Stephenson said most had mild symptoms and did not require hospital treatment and are being sent home.
Currently, there are 375 Victorians in hospital with COVID-19, but that number could grow to up to 2500 by end of the year according to Burnet Institute modelling commissioned by the state government.
Marty Smyth, Emergency Services Telecommunications Authority chief executive, said 3250 Victorians made ambulance calls on Monday.
It is the highest number of calls since the deadly thunderstorm asthma event in 2016, which led to an unprecedented surge in demand for ambulances and 10 deaths.
"Last year, people were reluctant to access medical services and general practitioners," Mr Smyth told ABC Radio Melbourne.
"This year we're seeing a significant increase in demand and calls but they're all standard calls that we would typically take on a day - road traffic accidents, medical emergencies, chest pain, abdominal pain, headaches that kind of thing."
He said there is a benchmark that 90 per cent of triple zero calls are answered in five seconds but the average wait is currently is one to two minutes.
One person was forced to wait 13 minutes on Monday night.
"These calls are not triaged, so until we actually take the call and triage it and find out what exactly is going on, that's what really concerns us," Mr Smyth said.
Government funding has allowed the service to hire an additional 43 staff but it will take them months to train.
He and Assoc Prof Stephenson both urged Victorians not to call triple zero unless it was an emergency.
.
Meanwhile the Latrobe Valley region has been plunged into a seven-day lockdown to curb a growing COVID-19 outbreak believed to be linked to a household gathering.
Residents in the City of Latrobe, which encompasses the Gippsland towns of Moe, Morwell and Traralgon, entered lockdown just before midnight on Tuesday.
They are now living under the same restrictions as those in Melbourne, aside from curfew.
Where can I get tested: Click here to see where you can get a COVID test.
Health Minister Martin Foley said the illegal social gathering, held over the AFL grand final weekend, was "regrettable".
Active cases in the region have now jumped to 18, with a further four infections confirmed on Tuesday afternoon. They will be reported in Wednesday's tally.
It comes as approval of the Victorian government's handling of the pandemic has fallen, despite the release of its COVID-19 roadmap and Melburnians enjoying more minor freedoms.
The latest Essential poll, which surveyed 1094 people last week, shows support for the Andrews government's response to the state's COVID-19 outbreak fell to 44 per cent over the past fortnight.
The approval rating had rebounded to 50 per cent in mid-September after falling to 44 per cent in late August.
Victorians also generally have less confidence in state-specific plans for reopening than their counterparts across the Murray River, the poll indicates.
Both Victoria and NSW have released reopening roadmaps in line with reaching 70 and 80 per cent double dose vaccination coverage targets.
Of the 277 Victorians surveyed, 36 per cent said they had confidence in their plan compared to 48 per cent of 348 NSW respondents.
Melbourne's lockdown will remain in place until 70 per cent of Victorians aged over 16 are double-vaccinated, which is forecast for October 26.
A more significant easing of restrictions will occur when the 80 per cent double-dose target is met, forecast for November 5.
With the state forecast to pass 80 per cent single-dose vaccination coverage, a modest easing of rules comes into effect on Wednesday including extending the travel limit to 15km and resumption of contactless sports.

Full text: Almost 100 Tasmanians would lose their lives to COVID-19 if the state opened its borders to the country at an 80-per-cent vaccination rate.
This statistic is based on state-specific modelling, revealed on Wednesday, applied to the Doherty Institute report on border reopenings.
Premier Peter Gutwein said there would be 14,900 COVID cases in the state in the first six months should Tasmania open to states, including NSW and Victoria, at 80 per cent with baseline restrictions.

He said there would be 590 hospital admissions, 97 intensive care admissions, and almost 100 deaths.
"As we move to reopen our borders, the Delta [strain] will arrive," Mr Gutwein said.
"When Delta arrives, that will mean that some people will get sick, some people will get very sick, and unfortunately some people will die."

Health Department secretary Kathrine Morgan-Wicks said the state was still on track to reach a 90-per-cent vaccination rate by December 1.
She said more than 331,000 Tasmanians had been administered their first dose of the COVID vaccine and more than 251,000 had been fully vaccinated.

Ms Morgan-Wicks said more than 25,000 people aged over 50 years old had not yet received a first dose of the vaccine.
She said those in the 12 to 15 year age group were lagging behind the vaccination rate of that cohort in other states.
Mr Gutwein said borders were planned to be reopened by Christmas, however, that depended on circumstances around COVID-19 in other jurisdictions.

COVID - is our health system ready?

Full text: That long anticipated day when NSW re-opens from its COVID hibernation is drawing closer. But is our health system ready for it?
It will begin with some eased restrictions on the Monday after the state hits 70 per cent double vaccinations. Even greater freedoms can be expected when that double vaccination rate hits 80 per cent.
The state-wide road map to re-opening is based on modelling by the Doherty Institute, and that first target is shaping up to be mid-October. That's less than a month away.
While at first glance the promise of more freedoms seems like a positive, the big question is 'are our rural, regional and remote communities ready?' More specifically 'is our health system ready?'
The health landscape has changed forever because of this pandemic. And that impacts every one of us.
Many would argue that our health system has been in poor health for quite some time. Submissions and witness testimony to a State parliamentary inquiry that began in September last year paint a picture of an already chronically ill system.
Health Services Union NSW Secretary, Gerard Hayes, has been quite clear about his concern that our regional and rural health care services are not prepared for what lies ahead.
"I'm not saying this to be obtuse, but what we have seen over the past decade has been a system tightening its belt constantly and working to be as lean as possible," Mr Hayes said. What good are extra beds in an upgraded hospital if there are not enough staff to adequately support the patients that may occupy those beds?
Dr Debra King, North Coast representative on the Royal Australian College of General Practitioners NSW board fears an increase in general practitioners getting burnt out with the increased workload.
"Our workforce doesn't go up, we just work longer hours," she said.
Meanwhile, our paramedics are being pushed beyond the limit.
Burn out among health professionals, could well be our next health disaster. We don't have a vaccine for that.
We do have them for COVID-19, though.
Ready or not, we must move out of the lockdown phase of the pandemic. High vaccination rates are key to minimising harm as we do so.
So too is an adequately resourced and funded health system. It is well past time regional, rural and remote NSW had one.

Full text: PREMIER Annastacia Palaszczuk refuses to commit to reopening borders by Christmas, saying she’s awaiting more modelling as federal heavyweights pile on the pressure.
Prime Minister Scott Morrison has said he saw no reason why people should be separated by state borders when an 80 per cent national vaccination target is reached.
Ms Palaszczuk, visiting the Gold Coast mass vaccination hub at Broadbeach on Monday, said she was looking forward to revised modelling of predicted Covid deaths by the Doherty Institute, whose predictions are guiding the national reopening plan.
She hoped to receive new Doherty modelling on Friday at national cabinet and said she hoped the Prime Minister “will release all of that publicly so everyone can see it”.
Asked if Queenslanders could expect to reunite with loved ones interstate come December, she said it depended on “the modelling and our discussions at national cabinet”.
“Look at what our life is like now in Queensland, I’m pretty proud of the life we have at the moment,” Ms Palaszczuk said.
“I’m sure the tourism operators would not want Delta here, that’d be catastrophic to the Queensland community.” Federal Ministers are piling on the pressure for Queensland and WA to reopen in line with the rest of country, with Deputy Prime Minister Barnaby Joyce saying he didn’t realise Ms Palaszczuk was an epidemiologist.
Ms Palaszczuk responded: “I think Barnaby should be sitting down with Darren Chester who just left the Nationals. He’s got to focus on his own job and let me do my job.” Her comments came after visiting embattled Coolangatta on Monday amid months of public outcry, speaking with business owners suffering due to the border bubble’s removal for the second time in weeks.
“I know it’s tough down there, that’s why the government has put in money for the hardship. I can see some businesses are closed and I do look forward to the day that hopefully, the Northern New South Wales area can be lifted from that lockdown,” she said.
Deputy Prime Minister Joyce told Sunrise: “I didn’t know (Ms Palaszczuk) was an immunologist. I didn’t know her epidemiology was so up to speed. She’s prepared to put her views ahead of the Doherty Institute and sending business broke.” Queensland Deputy Premier Steven Miles has indicated the state border could stay closed for Christmas.
Queenslanders are enjoying some of the most relaxed Covid restrictions in the country, and the state government did not want to “let Covid in for Christmas”, he said.
Queensland chief health officer Jeannette Young, asked if in favour of reopening at 80 per cent, said: “It’s not a simple straightforward process. You can’t pick something and then say it leads to something else. “We should all prepare and hope and get everyone vaccinated, that’s the most important thing business can do.”

Jeff’s Shed earmarked for makeshift Covid hospital amid case spike

Full text: Amid the state’s highest ever daily case number the Sunday Herald Sun can reveal high level briefings have again discussed the option of converting the Melbourne Convention and Exhibition Centre into a hospital.
Multiple sources familiar with the arrangements have confirmed the idea has been canvassed for the first time since it was raised as an option at the beginning of the pandemic.
The contingency plan was considered as early as March 2020 but was shelved after Victoria drove cases to zero.
But with case numbers continuing to rise, and a higher proportion of patients needing intensive care than last year, some senior officials have questioned the capacity of the hospital system.
“The plan is on reserve. Case numbers are not going in the right direction, and very serious consideration is being given to the contingencies in place,” one senior government source said.
“The site is perfect for a temporary hospital, but we’re really hoping it’s not needed.”
The source said a significant complication to using the site would be losing one of the state’s two largest vaccine hubs currently operating from the centre.
The Department of Health has flagged it will need additional beds in coming weeks, and on current projections say the hospitals currently treating Covid patients may not be sufficient.
Health Minister Martin Foley has also flagged suspending some elective surgery as needed.
According to one senior government figure a ‘field hospital’ scenario isn’t yet projected to be required.
However such a proposal would become a live option if there was a surge in demand for intensive care beds.
Cities including London and New York have each introduced field hospitals at various times throughout the pandemic.
Modelling by the Burnet Institute, commissioned by the state government, has forecast up to 120,000 diagnosed cases after the easing of restrictions.
Health sources said such a scenario would put unprecedented pressure on the state’s hospital system.
One senior source said authorities were actively preparing for a “NSW level impact to hospitals” with consideration given to pulling nurses off the vaccine front line if needed.
Such a move risked slowing the state’s vaccination rollout with the potential to further delay meeting recovery road map targets.
A surge workforce of 2,200 oral and allied health professionals and students is currently being trained to replace nurses on the jab frontline.
But just 300 newly trained vaccinators have completed the training since the initiative was announced three weeks ago.
Others have been employed directly by vaccination sites via health services and community health partners.
In April last year the government promised a $1.3 billion injection to quickly establish an extra 4,000 ICU beds in response to the pandemic.
By August 1,556 critical care spaces had been prepared across public and private hospitals with another 2,700 to be made available if required.
Mr Foley said he was confident the system could keep pace but would not say how long it would take to scale up to 4,000 ICU beds if such a scenario were necessary.
Yesterday he said that once case numbers surge further there would be changes to the way hospitals are managed.
“We know that we can do that, but it will be at the expense of other arrangements in the health system and it will be at the expense of our already fatigued health professionals who will be working even harder,” Mr Foley said.
The first stage is to ensure specialist centres are prepared to manage vulnerable groups such as pregnant women and the elderly.
The next step would be to pause non-urgent elective surgery, with hospitals to determine which areas went on hold to put “as many resources as are needed into the healthcare of Covid patients” and for the private system to take up some urgent surgery.
“We know that we can do that, but it will be at the expense of other arrangements in the health system and it will be at the expense of our already fatigued health professionals who will be working even harder,” he said.
“It’s looking challenging every day, our public health system was already dealing with peak loads before this particular outbreak as a result of deferred care, as a result of increased levels of demand more broadly.”
Opposition leader Matthew Guy called for greater transparency around the hospital system’s capacity to cope.
“I’m really concerned about the loss of elective surgery, I’m very concerned about hearing about in the Eastern suburbs, some category one surgeries are already being delayed,” he said.
“I think the government really needs to give us more than just a trust me, that they’ve got it in hand.
“We need to know where are the hospital beds that were promised by the government in April last year, every Victorian deserves to know.
“This is about our health. It’s about knowing the health system is prepared.”

More data needed on kids’ jabs: doctors

Full text: Pediatricians have called for the Therapeutic Goods Administration to demand more data from Pfizer to prove the safety of its Covid-19 vaccine in children, as the government issued an invitation to the US-based pharmaceutical giant to submit its application for approval.
The invitation to the company from Health Minister Greg Hunt came after Pfizer announced that results of its initial clinical trials of its vaccine in children aged five to 11 had demonstrated safety and a strong antibody response.
Mr Hunt has encouraged Pfizer to submit its data to the TGA at the same time as initiating the approvals process with the US Food and Drug Administration.
But pediatrician Fiona Russell, a professor at the University of Melbourne, said Pfizer’s initial studies did not have enough participants to prove the vaccine was safe for children.
Teenagers and young people have been found to have a very rare side effect of myocarditis ­(inflammation of the heart), which has been found overseas to occur at the rate of around six cases in 100,000 children aged 12 to 15.
Pfizer’s clinical trials of its vaccine in the five to 11 age group ­enrolled 2300 participants.
“In a clinical trial of about 2300, that is really an insufficient size to be able to look at whether that rare side effect occurs or not,” Professor Russell said.
“Safety is really paramount because this is the age group that is least affected by Covid. It has the mildest of infections and very, very uncommonly has serious outcomes. So the risk-benefit analysis in this age group becomes even more challenging.
“It’s absolutely critical we have this safety data. We wouldn’t want to be vaccinating otherwise healthy children and making them sick from a rare side effect.” There is a significant divergence of opinion in the medical community concerning the relative merits of vaccination children, and also among epide­miologists who are split on whether vaccinating children is a significant factor in curbing the spread of Covid-19.
The Doherty Institute has said that vaccinating children aged under 16 would have only a minimal impact on the spread of the virus, but modelling by the University of Melbourne has estimated that vaccinating children would halve the long-term spread of Covid-19.
Doherty modelling has predicted that anywhere from between 30 to 86 children could die of Covid-19 in the six months following restrictions being eased.
Pediatric intensivist Greg Kelly said that even though children are extremely unlikely to fall seriously ill from Covid-19, even a small risk of severe illness and death was enough to justify mass vaccination.
“In the whole of Australia each year, only about 30 kids die in road accidents, and about 30 kids die from drowning. But we have substantial public health and regulatory things around both of those things to keep numbers really low,” Dr Kelly said.
“The Doherty’s low estimate of the number of kids who may die of Covid is 30 in six months, which is double the number that die in road accidents each year.
“So yes we are talking about small percentages, but when we understand the number of kids who could get infected and when we realise how rare serious illness and death is in children overall, then those numbers are actually really important.” Asha Bowen, the program head of vaccines and infectious diseases at the Telethon Kids Institute and head of the Perth Children’s Hospital’s department of infectious diseases, said it was much more common for adults to spread Covid-19 to children than the other way around.

Non-Covid healthcare ‘is being compromised’

Full text: AMA president Omar Khorshid says the nation’s healthcare system is already operating beyond its capacity and signs of non-Covid healthcare being compromised are beginning to emerge.
Dr Khorshid told a Senate committee scrutinising the government’s response to the Covid crisis on Tuesday that non-Covid care had clearly deteriorated since the beginning of the pandemic, which would have “significant impacts” for years to come.
“Our health system was not ready for this pandemic; it has done a lot of preparation at an acute end but we haven’t prepared it to deal with routine healthcare while dealing with Covid healthcare,” he said.
Dr Khorshid said Australia should be aiming for the highest possible vaccination rates, and he was very concerned that as the nation opened up, “the cracks will widen”.
“We face very significant impacts particularly if we open up too fast or go too far acting ahead of vaccination rates … we should be easing out cautiously, and looking at results before moving to the next phase of opening up.” Dr Khorshid said 12 to 15-year-olds who want to be vaccinated should be offered a jab before any substantial easing of restrictions in the months ahead.
He did note that Doherty Institute modelling indicated there wasn’t a lot of difference between health outcomes if children were or weren’t included in the 70 to 80 per cent vaccination targets.
Former deputy chief health officer Nick Coatsworth told the committee it was time for “cautious optimism” and he was most worried that states that had experienced minimal Covid would prevent the country moving forward. He said Australia was in a very different position this year compared with 2020.
“It’s time to inject a little more optimism,” he said. “Covid was a disease that was terribly scary in 2020, and it remains scary, but moving forward we can develop a lot of confidence.” He said Australia did not want to make policy decisions “based on the reality of 2020 (and) not the reality of 2021”.

Full text: Mask-wearing will remain indefinitely in some settings as experts predict strict lockdowns will not protect COVID-free parts of the country from the pandemic forever.
New data shows the rate of deaths from coronavirus so far this year is similar to a bad influenza season and significantly better than last year as vaccinations gain traction around the country.
For states sticking to border closures and tougher measures against COVID-19, a Doherty Institute sensitivity analysis that was presented at national cabinet on Friday found those measures would not be able to keep the virus out long term and community fatigue was a real risk.
"In reality, the national COVID-19 epidemic has been and will continue to be a 'fire' fought on multiple fronts," the report said.
Doherty Institute modelling is guiding the national recovery plan, with states agreeing restrictions should be eased once 70 and then 80 per cent of the population aged 16 and over is fully vaccinated.
Director of Doherty Epidemiology, Professor Jodie McVeron, said while short, sharp lockdowns had been able to extinguish outbreaks of other strains, the Delta variant was "really hard".
"Those statements are just a reality check that this can't be maintained forever," she said yesterday afternoon. "Our main message there is really encouraging high population vaccine uptake, encouraging an awareness and acceptance of the fact that some degree of social measures are going to need to continue in the future to keep the population safe."
Dr Michael Lydeamore, a research fellow in infectious diseases at Monash University, said some degree of public health and social measures would need to stay in place until health authorities could be sure removing them would not lead to large outbreaks.
"Masks are probably here to stay," he said. "They're a relatively low-impost intervention that we know reduces transmission by some amount, and so, at least until we're in a situation where we're very confident we're not going to have a big surge of cases, the masks are going to hang around in these closed settings."
While public health and social measures continue to play an important role in the pandemic response, data from the National Interoperable Notifiable Disease Surveillance System shows vaccinations are having a large effect on the rate of deaths.
Last year, about one in every 31 patients with COVID-19 died, with 909 deaths from 28,428 cases or a case fatality rate of 3.2 per cent. This year to September 15, about one in every 234 patients died, with 229 deaths from 53,780 cases or a case fatality rate of 0.42 per cent.
That rate of deaths is comparable to the worst influenza season in the past few years. In 2017, the case fatality rate from January 1 to September 16 was 0.48 per cent, or one death for every 210 cases, with 959 deaths from 201,446 confirmed cases of the flu.
Experts say hospitalisations from COVID-19 will be higher than those from influenza. When those numbers would peak was unclear, Dr Lydeamore said. "We can be pretty settled on the fact that in Victoria and NSW as well, the case numbers are going to continue around the level that they already are, and so that means the hospitalisations and things will continue on as well."

Rita Panahi: Daniel Andrews delivers a roadmap to misery

Full text: Not so much a roadmap to freedom but a plan to inflict further crippling restrictions even once we reach 80 per cent double vaccinated.
Lockdown Six, sold as a seven-day short, sharp lockdown will in fact last more than 80 days.
At Monday’s press conference the premier was again blaming vaccine supply and the virus being imported from Sydney for Victoria’s woes.
Nobody with an IQ above room temperature accepts that self-serving nonsense and I don’t recall the NSW premier Gladys Berejiklian blaming Victoria for the Covid outbreaks we exported.
NSW’s plan is imperfect and overly cautious, particularly when it comes to schools, but their citizens will be living relatively freely when the 70 per cent double jabbed target is met while Victorians will still be under sweeping restrictions.
The harm being inflicted in the name of “Covid safety” now far exceeds the benefit.
Throughout this pandemic the modelling, both here and overseas, has been wildly wrong and always wrong in the one direction.
The Burnet Institute is no different and as late as August 2021 released absurd, scaremongering predictions about Sydney’s outbreak topping 7,000 plus cases a day.
“Furthermore, unless new controls introduced on 28 and 30 July or in the future (eg. LGAs that develop large case numbers are included in the tighter controls) have a major impact, our model projects that Sydney will have about 7700 cases per day 4 weeks from now,” the Burnet Institute claimed in an August 2 report authored by a quartet of their top experts including the director and deputy director.
Well the new controls didn’t have much of an impact and yet NSW never got anywhere near the doomsday predictions.
On Monday NSW had 935 cases from 124,650 tests while Victoria reported 567 cases from just 50,915 tests.
The disparity in the daily test numbers between Victoria and NSW is not improving; one wonders what case numbers Victoria would record if the state’s testing numbers were in line with NSW.
More than 85 per cent of Victoria’s cases are concentrated in the west and northern suburbs and yet more than five million Melburnians remain under curfew with draconian restrictions that the rest of the world has long abandoned regardless of their vaccination rate.
The slavish adherence to health advice that is never released and modelling that has been consistently wrong sees Australia isolated from the rest of the world and trapped in a Covid hellscape of its own making.
We don’t need to wait for Sydney to reopen to recalibrate the modelling as premier Andrews claimed during Monday’s press conference.
The rest of the advanced world, with the exception of Australia and New Zealand, is open and they opened with vaccination rates well below Australian targets.
We can look at their figures and how their hospital systems have coped rather than rely on flawed models designed by lockdown enthusiasts.

Health systems must be primed as nation opens up

Full text: Covid will increasingly become a pandemic among the unvaccinated
Crunch time has arrived for Australians who have resisted Covid vaccinations to date. Scott Morrison’s announcement on Sunday that a million doses of Moderna will arrive by next weekend should hasten the nation’s reopening. Even before this welcome boost, vaccinations are proceeding apace, with more than 22.6 million doses administered. More than two -thirds of Australians aged 16 and over — 67.4 per cent — have had their first jab, and 42.3 per cent are fully vaccinated. That is encouraging news for individuals’ personal and economic wellbeing. It holds the promise of longed-for family reunions, including with loved ones living overseas. It is also vital for businesses and their staff, especially those in industries hardest hit by the pandemic, including travel and hospitality.
Ahead of reopening and lifting lockdowns, it is vital that health systems are well prepared in advance. Among many figures released on Sunday, one set revealed a telling story. Of 2793 active cases in Victoria, 147 people are in hospital. Of those, 34 are in intensive care and 28 are receiving ventilation. Of those in hospital, only one was fully vaccinated, Premier Daniel Andrews said at his press conference. And that person, Mr Andrews understood, was not receiving ventilation. With NSW on track to be the first state to reach 70 and 80 per cent levels of full vaccination, Premier Gladys Berejiklian has spelt out the looming challenges. The state has capacity to treat a total of 1550 ICU patients, she said last week. The number of people in intensive care without Covid-19 was usually about 400. According to modelling based on analysis by the Burnet Institute, about 560 people will be in intensive care units with Covid by the beginning of November. As Dr Nhi Nguyen, clinical director of the Intensive Care Network NSW, says: “I can’t emphasise enough how difficult and exhausting this is going to be for our staff.’’ As early as October 9, the modelling says, the surge in Covid-19 cases is expected to have a “severe” impact on ICU operations. “Overall demand for critical care (will be) exceeding ICU operational capacity,” the modelling predicts. By the final week of October, ICU operations will experience an “overwhelming” impact, and demand for critical care services will “significantly” exceed capacity. That pressure will persist until the second week of November, when demand will ease.
Health staff are already suffering burnout, a major Victorian study, reported by Ewin Hannan on Saturday, has revealed. In the world’s largest multi-professional study into the pandemic’s impact on primary and secondary care health workers, Monash University and Royal Melbourne Hospital researchers surveyed 7846 frontline staff. Lead researchers Natasha Smallwood, from Monash University’s Central Clinical School and The Alfred hospital, and Karen Willis, from the Royal Melbourne Hospital and Victoria University, said almost half the workers reported their paid or unpaid hours rose last year and two-thirds reported an increase in symptoms of mental illness. Professor Smallwood said while it was expected that frontline workers would be working longer during a crisis, she was disturbed that 21.5 per cent said they worked more unpaid hours. The situation has created a risk of an exodus of public health workers. And the pressures are likely to intensify with any spike in cases among the unvaccinated as the nation opens up. That is an excellent reason for government to endeavour to overcome barriers to vaccination.
Master Builders Australia is rightly concerned, for example, that the inclination of some political leaders to disregard the reopening plan they agreed to in national cabinet and persevere with lockdowns was fuelling vaccine hesitancy in the construction sector. Research commissioned by the MBA prepared by Laidlaw Campaigns shows that a “fundamental lack of trust that state and territory leaders will open up when vaccination rates reach 70 and 80 per cent is the major barrier to people in our industry getting vaccinated’’, MBA chief executive Denita Wawn told Geoff Chambers. The issue applied particularly to male workers aged 18 to 40. “They aren’t anti-vaxxers but the promise to restore their freedoms when enough people are vaccinated is their fundamental motivation to get the jab,’’ Ms Wawn said. “Their lack of trust in state and territory leaders to keep that promise is going to slow down vaccine uptake.’’ Governments also need to correct the record when deranged misinformation is fed to vulnerable groups, discouraging their opting for vaccination. As Paige Taylor reports, hostility to the vaccine has filtered through to some remote Indigenous communities in Western Australia, fanned by online streaming of grossly irresponsible US evangelists. Like all Australians, those citizens deserve to have the facts given to them clearly, to make informed decisions for their wellbeing and that of their families. As the time for opening up draws closer, Australians who intend to exercise their right not to be vaccinated have every reason to review the available facts and have a long, hard think ahead of an expected increase in Covid-19 cases as life returns to something closer to normal.

A lot must go right to get out of lockdown

Full text: letters to the editor
THE front page article, "Kids need jab", (Herald, 6/9), at least mentions some of the caveats the Doherty model places against any scheme to easing lockdowns (and state border closures), which is more than the NSW Premier's morning briefings do. But it doesn't explain what these caveats mean.
Most of the Doherty modelling assumes low (30 or less nationally was the original figure; it may have changed when the Delta variant was considered) daily case numbers, a transmission potential (TP) number of one or less, and an effective national test, trace, isolation and quarantine (TTIQ) system will be required before we can open up. There is a very long way to go before that state is reached in NSW.
With a daily new caseload well over 1000, and a TP number of about 1.3, it's obvious conditions in NSW are "sub-optimal", to use the model's euphemism. The Doherty modelling predicts those sorts of conditions, with a vaccination level (two injections, remember) of 70 per cent, will result in an exponential rise in case load. Eighty per cent of the population fully vaccinated won't do a lot better. The 40,000 new cases per day, and 80 deaths, which Queensland's Premier was attacked for quoting, are there in black and white as a possible scenario under a regime with 80 per cent vaccinated but high caseloads and sub-optimal TTIQ.
The other pertinent fact that doesn't seem to be generally mentioned in all the exhortations about getting vaccinated, and the promises about opening up, is that none of the vaccines currently being injected anywhere in the world give actual immunity against this virus. You can still catch COVID-19. You can still die of it. You can still finish up in an ICU with it. You can still get it again after you've been infected. But if you've been vaccinated, all those things are less likely to happen, for six months or so anyway. Maybe Ms Berejiklian is right. Maybe things will get better in October, after only another few thousand casualties. But I think she's trying to draw to an inside straight. If I were Premier McGowan, Marshall, Palaszczuk, or Gutwein, I wouldn't be too keen on getting pulled into that sort of high risk gamble, either. I do agree with you, though. The kids need two jabs.
Barney Ward, Edgeworth Scheme was 'corporate corruption' I LISTENED with interest as Stuart Robert, Minister for Employment, attempted to defend the indefensible refusal to retrieve tens of millions of dollars of JobKeeper overpayments to corporate mates whose companies posted huge profits.
The same Stuart Robert who presided over the infamous Robodebt scheme. Robodebt harassed and harangued recipients to repay trivial amounts of Centrelink overpayments, some tragically committing suicide.
Stuart Robert tried unconvincingly to explain how clawback provisions built into the JobKeeper scheme would harm business confidence. What a spurious, patronising and cowardly example of sophistry. Can we extrapolate from this ridiculous argument that welfare payments without Robodebt would inspire consumer confidence? Just as farcical.
JobKeeper, noble in intent, appears to be nothing more than corporate corruption in practice. Aided and abetted by the most contemptuous, venal deceitful and incompetent government we've had to endure, at least in my lifetime.
Until we have a federal ICAC, independently funded with retrospective Royal Commission-type powers this government and others inspired by it will continue to be nothing more than the cold, ominous shadow predatory, rapacious corporations cast over the population.
John Lawton, Belmont JobKeeper was totally botched THE JobKeeper scheme was set up to help secure jobs for companies that would suffer a 30-50 per cent fall in revenue.
As it turned out many companies that applied for it actually increased their revenue, some substantially. As they didn't meet the criteria, and their own revenue met the cost of wages they paid, the money needed to be returned. Some have repaid it, many others have not. It doesn't matter if there was no "claw back clause" they have received money that they were not entitled to, and if they keep it they are committing fraud.
It should have been set up in a similar way to welfare payments, where each fortnight you declare your income, and your payments are adjusted accordingly. If you make a false declaration you are made to repay the money.
The government has botched this, in the same way as they have botched so many aspects of the pandemic. So we just write off this $13 billion that has been paid to companies that were not entitled to it, do we?
At the same time, hundreds of thousands of people sit on waiting lists for things like public housing, women's refuges and the like due to lack of funds. If it was a Labor government they'd be hounded from office.
Jan Phillip Trevillian, Fennell Bay Sending the right message IT'S a good gesture by Australia Post and Beyond Blue on the front page of the Herald, 6/9, giving away free postcards to send to someone, postage free.
I hope Australia Post does a better job of delivering the postcards than they did with eight, yes eight, letters last January. We had eight correctly addressed and correct postage, delivered to number 36 and not number 30, fortunately we have good neighbours who brought the mail up to us.
Last September it took almost three weeks to get a letter from the post box outside the Post Office at Waratah Village to reach our address at Waratah West.
Fred Saunders, Waratah West Only as sophisticated as our loos IT'S refreshing to learn that I'm not alone in my concern about being caught short, ("City caught short", Opinion, 6/9). I'm reminded of the very kind New Yorker who invited me to use his private facilities when I asked (rather urgently) if there were any bars or public toilets nearby when my wife and I were walking near the Tribeca area of Manhattan.
I claim to have knowledge of most of the toilets around Newcastle and seem to have developed an uncanny ability to seek out those in places unfamiliar to me! They say, "necessity is the mother of invention", but I beg to differ.
I say the urgency of nature's call is the mother of invention. I agree that "a city is only as sustainable, global, liveable and sophisticated as its public toilets".
Sid Gray, Newcastle East Our city deserves better I HAVE to agree about the lack of public toilets in Newcastle parks, ("City caught short, Opinion, 6/9).
I am a great-grandmother of 15, with 10 of them being under four years. Before lockdown we were going to different parks once or twice a week.
There are no toilets at Islington Park, none at Mayfield West, none at Warabrook, none at Brickwork Park, Wallsend, none at Federal Park and none in the new proposed park in Federal Park and the list goes on.
I agree with Aaron Buman, the one opposite the Signal Box in Honeysuckle Drive is disgusting. Nobbys walk through is not much better. The hand basin outside is mainly used for kids drinking out of it.
Loretta Paolucci, Wallsend SHORT TAKES WHAT a joke and thumbs up to Australians that Prime Minister Scott Morrison can fly a taxpayer-funded private jet to Sydney to see his father for Father's Day when millions of constituents are in lockdown and risk hefty fines for breaking health policy rules to do the same. We would all love the private privilege to be with our loved ones, but unfortunately aren't in the top job so can't break our own rules.
Debra Forbes, Wickham THE Queensland Premier has had trouble letting the residents of her state return home, but allowed the NRL players and families in for the weekend games. I read in the Herald where a total of 39,615 spectators were at three of the games at the weekend, 20,747 at Knights/ Broncos alone. She seems to think COVID won't go into Queensland with footballers and families, but her own residents returning will infect her precious state. I see $$$$$$. As always
Lorraine Gillett, Fern Bay SINCE gaining office the LNP and Prime Minister Scott Morrison in particular have come in for a great deal of well-deserved criticism. Of late the volume of this criticism has increased exponentially over a considerable range of topics. This is shown in the latest poll figures. Is it not time the Governor-General acted for the welfare of the nation?
Dr Brian Roach, Whitebridge IS it just me looking at life through rose-coloured glasses since getting out of 'iso', or has COVID really made many of us kinder, friendlier, more caring and supportive of each other? My job (yes I'm one of the lucky ones still allowed to work) takes me to all corners of our region and whether I'm doing the COVID shuffle in the affluent suburbs or the battlers back streets my "g'day how's it goin'?" which would, prior to this virus, often fall on deaf ears, now seems to be more welcome. Or is it as a workmate suggested, "it's because your mask covers your ugly mug"?
Dave McTaggart, Edgeworth FINANCE Minister Simon Birmingham became very defensive when 60 Minutes reporter Liam Bartlett reminded him about who pays his salary. "I don't need smart-arse questions." Well minister, a lot of the great unwashed think you and your fellow MPs do need reminding from time to time and your response proved it. It was a response from a person who thinks of himself better than the working man. The way government throws around taxpayers' money to big business and does not claw it back when proved an error was made is just another example of government looking after said big business but then will bully individuals to pay money they can't afford is just so wrong so yes you need to be reminded who you work for and who pays your salary every now and then.

Full text: Fully vaccinated Sydneysiders are expected to be able to enjoy their first drink in a pub by the end of October, with NSW expected to reach its 70 per cent full vaccination target in less than six weeks.
Premier Gladys Berejiklian will today deliver the long-awaited COVID-19 recovery plan, outlining the first freedoms granted to the state's residents as they emerge from the extended Delta lockdown.
Before a wide-scale reopening of hospitality venues, the government is expected to trial in early October reopening venues in at least two local government areas with high vaccination rates and low cases numbers, with the Northern Beaches, the Hills Shire and the Blue Mountains among likely contenders.
The move to reopen Sydney and have NSW live with the virus comes amid a recent spike in COVID-19 cases in inner-city suburbs, with Waterloo, Redfern and Elizabeth Bay all recording jump in numbers in the past seven days.
NSW Health date shows 300 infections recorded in the City of Sydney council area in the past week, nearly half the total recorded there during the entire Delta outbreak. Another 135 cases have been reported in the inner west, 184 in Bayside and 125 in Randwick.
NSW Deputy Chief Health Officer Marianne Gale said health authorities were particularly concerned about a jump in infections in Glebe, Waterloo, Redfern and Marrickville. At the same time vaccination rates in the city's west have outpaced those in the east and inner city.
New data has also revealed one-quarter of positive cases receive a full interview by contact tracers within one day of testing positive, down from 32 per cent the week before.
The first stage of the road map, approved by the state's crisis cabinet yesterday afternoon, will allow gyms, restaurants, cafes and pubs to reopen at reduced capacities.
While some freedoms will be afforded to the community at the 70 per cent vaccination target, it is believed restrictions will ease even further before December, once NSW hits its 80 per cent.
Premier Gladys Berejiklian said yesterday NSW was inching towards the vaccination milestone, with 42 per cent of the state fully vaccinated and 75 per cent having received a first dose.
"We will all rest easy once we get to at least 80 per cent first dose, knowing full well that we'll hit that double 80 per cent vaccination rate."
The plan is based on the Doherty Institute's modelling and is consistent with the national plan to reopen Australia. The government had planned to release it in early August before the lockdown was extended for the first time as the Delta outbreak worsened.
Capacity limits in hospitality venues are expected to be similar to previous social distancing restrictions, limiting one person to four square metres inside venues. Those settings were eased under health guidelines as cases were reduced.
NSW yesterday reported 1480 new local coronavirus cases and nine deaths, including an Aboriginal man in his 60s from Dubbo who died at Royal Prince Alfred Hospital. He is the third Indigenous person to die in the Delta outbreak. More than 80 per cent of Wednesday's cases were under the age of 50.
Modelling provided to the state government suggests case numbers will peak in the next week but the Premier said there were "glimmers of hope" in some areas that were recording a stabilisation in case numbers.
The regional NSW lockdown is likely to be extended in some areas beyond its scheduled end this Friday, with another 34 cases recorded across western and far west NSW, including 17 in Dubbo and seven in Wilcannia.
Cases are also rising in the Illawarra-Shoalhaven region, with 24 in Wollongong and seven in Shellharbour, while COVID-19 fragments have been detected at the Bonny Hills sewage treatment in the Port Macquarie-Hastings area, where there are no known cases. Deputy Premier John Barilaro said although some regional areas with zero cases would be able to exit lockdown soon, their reopening would not mimic the pre-lockdown environment, insisting widespread vaccination was the key to triggering more freedoms.
The Riverina, New England and North Coast are expected to be among the first to exit lockdown.
"The vaccination rates in regional-rural NSW have to continue rising on par with what's happening in metro Sydney and the state average," he said.
Mr Barilaro, who has been tasked with implementing the government's plans to reopen, warned unvaccinated people in regional NSW would lose freedoms that they may gain upon reopening before October when the state road map kicks in. An announcement on the extension of the regional lockdown is expected by the end of the week.
They are 1136 coronavirus patients admitted to hospital, with 194 people in intensive care and 78 on ventilation.
Ms Berejiklian would not be drawn on reclassifying any of the 12 areas of concern, despite some recording lower case numbers than places like City of Sydney, which has recorded 474 new cases in the past month.
Burwood, which remains under strict lockdown, has recorded 45 cases in the same period.
"It's based on a population ... you can't just do it on a case by case comparison. You have to make sure you're doing it per 100,000 population," Ms Berejiklian said.
"These are all very complex decisions and we make them to protect lives, not to be popular."
Those areas of concern are outstripping the rest of greater Sydney in terms of vaccination rates," she said.
"What is still concerning us is that 80 per cent of cases are still in those areas and we would like to obviously see that decrease and there are glimmers of hope that some areas are seeing a stabilisation."

Return to pre-pandemic life will be slow and cautious: JPMorgan

Full text: Australia’s reopening will be slow and cautious and there will be no return to pre-pandemic living until better vaccines and treatments are developed, JPMorgan has warned.
In a sober reading of the Doherty Institute modelling and what it means for the nation’s path away from restrictions, the investment bank said a carefully phased easing of restrictions was most likely amid the prospect of further lockdowns if the test, trace, isolate and quarantine (TTIQ) strategy becomes “sub-optimal”.
It also predicted case numbers in NSW could end up being nearly double the expected peak announced by state Premier Gladys Berejiklian this week, with daily cases surging well into October.
The Doherty modelling, released to the public last month, forms the basis of the government’s reopening plan. It states that once 70 per cent vaccine coverage levels are reached in the adult population, lockdowns are unlikely to be needed to keep control of cases and hospitalisations, assuming no new strains, and as long as the TTIQ system keeps working.
But spiralling case numbers in NSW and Victoria could quickly threaten to overwhelm the system.
“We think sub-optimal TTIQ is a reasonable expectation for NSW and possibly Victoria,” the JPMorgan team, led by senior insurance analyst Siddharth Parameswaran, warned.
“The Doherty modelling shows that if we open up at 70 per cent with a sub-optimal TTIQ, we would still on average spend 22 per cent of the first 180 days in full lockdown to try to control growth, or we would spend 55 per cent with moderate lockdowns to constrain growth to manageable levels.” NSW case numbers could surge through September and well into October, based on the bank’s own modelling, reaching a peak of 3700 cases a day by mid-October before declining, the analysts said. This assumes the current rate of vaccination continues and with a vaccine efficacy of 75 per cent.
JPMorgan’s prediction is at odds with the NSW government’s modelling, released this week, which projects a likely peak in infections, at up to 2000 per day in the LGAs of concern, will be reached in the next week or so.
NSW reported 1220 new cases on Tuesday, down slightly on Monday’s figures, with eight deaths recorded.
The state on Saturday reached the 40 per cent double-dose vaccination mark for people aged 16 and over and is looking at easing restrictions in mid-October.
“Case growth is very strong, suggesting a higher peak in cases,” JPMorgan said. “We have increased our forecast significantly for new cases per day as there has been stronger exponential growth in cases than we previously forecast.” Hitting 3700 cases a day in October would pressure the hospital system, the analysts warned.
“Current caseloads in NSW are increasing and will reach levels that will significantly pressure the hospital system, and caseloads could remain elevated if restrictions are eased off, even if vaccination levels continue to increase.” The investment bank expects NSW to hit its 70 per cent target by October 7, followed by 80 per cent fully vaccinated by October 19. Victoria’s limited success against Delta despite its strategy of going hard and early was a warning to other states pursuing a zero-Covid strategy, they said.
“Zero Covid will eventually be very difficult to maintain given the infectiousness of Delta.
“Still, it makes sense for states like WA and Queensland to open borders very carefully/slowly given the greater freedoms their populations currently enjoy.” A phased management of different levels of restrictions is the most likely scenario once the country gets to its 70 per cent vaccinated target, according to the banking analysts.
Density rules would apply but retail and schools would reopen, and travel would be allowed. Around 70 per cent of symptomatic cases would be in children, “but deaths would not follow infections due to their much lower susceptibility,” the analysts noted. But there won’t be any sudden return to normality, they predicted. “It is unlikely we will see life return to 2019 type-living without social distancing in a reasonable time frame,” they said.

Pressure on NSW ICUs looms

Full text: NSW is six weeks away from the most intense pressure ever placed on its intensive care systems as health care workers brace for a "difficult and exhausting" period ahead.
However, modelling from the Burnet Institute reveals even at the pandemic's worst phase for the hospital system - expected in late October and the first half of November - authorities don't believe ICU occupancy will reach anywhere close to the surge capacity of 1550 patients.
"You may be moved to a different hospital than the one closest to your home. You may have slightly different surroundings to what you would normally," Premier Gladys Berejiklian said on Monday.
"But the bottom line is anyone who needs that care will receive it."
The modelling suggests case numbers will continue to increase until mid-September in Covid-19 hotspots, reaching up to 2000 cases per day.
The flow-on effect of those case numbers on hospitals and ICUs will follow, with up to 3900 patients expected to need hospital admission.
By the time of the greatest stress in late October, three in five ICU patients could have Covid-19.
The estimated peak of patients in ICU is 947, of whom 560 would be Covid-19 patients and 387 have other ailments.
At that point, some ICU patients will be treated in other spaces like operating theatres. Doctors and healthcare workers will be caring for a larger number of patients than usual.
Some critically ill patients, who would be in intensive care were it not for the pandemic, will be treated outside intensive care units.
By November, hospitalisation numbers will start to fall, a side effect of increased vaccination coverage.
The modelling shows ICUs in South Western Sydney, Western Sydney, Nepean Blue Mountains and Northern Sydney Local Health Districts are already approaching capacity.
The Australian Paramedics Association says the government also needs to employ more paramedics and staff in the emergency departments to deal with the looming crisis.
"It is all well and good that they have a plan for when intensive care units become overburdened with patients . . . but what about the emergency departments," NSW APA vice president Scott Beaton told the ABC yesterday.
"People will be dialling triple zero and there won't be ambulances available because they will all be stuck sitting out the front of hospitals with patients onboard.
"The crisis is getting to a point where in the next two to three weeks . . . we won't be able to move patients into hospitals," he said.
AMA NSW president Danielle McMullen says the government must also consider the impact on patients needing non-Covid-19 care.
"The decision to suspend elective surgery, and changes to other non-Covid service provision in public and private hospitals, is significantly impacting patients needing access to care and must be balanced with a plan on how to address patient needs in the coming months," she said yesterday.
"Patients who aren't able to go back to work or are in chronic pain because they need elective surgery will be left behind when we start to open up."

Full text: NSW is six weeks away from the most intense pressure ever placed on its intensive care systems as health care workers brace for a "difficult and exhausting" period ahead.
However, modelling from the Burnet Institute reveals even at the pandemic's worst phase for the hospital system - expected in late October and the first half of November - authorities don't believe ICU occupancy will reach anywhere close to the surge capacity of 1550 patients.
"You may be moved to a different hospital than the one closest to your home. You may have slightly different surroundings to what you would normally," Premier Gladys Berejiklian said on Monday.
"But the bottom line is anyone who needs that care will receive it."
The modelling suggests case numbers will continue to increase until mid-September in Covid-19 hotspots, reaching up to 2000 cases per day.
The flow-on effect of those case numbers on hospitals and ICUs will follow, with up to 3900 patients expected to need hospital admission.
By the time of the greatest stress in late October, three in five ICU patients could have Covid-19.
The estimated peak of patients in ICU is 947, of whom 560 would be Covid-19 patients and 387 have other ailments.
At that point, some ICU patients will be treated in other spaces like operating theatres. Doctors and healthcare workers will be caring for a larger number of patients than usual.
Some critically ill patients, who would be in intensive care were it not for the pandemic, will be treated outside intensive care units.
By November, hospitalisation numbers will start to fall, a side effect of increased vaccination coverage.
The modelling shows ICUs in South Western Sydney, Western Sydney, Nepean Blue Mountains and Northern Sydney Local Health Districts are already approaching capacity.
The Australian Paramedics Association says the government also needs to employ more paramedics and staff in the emergency departments to deal with the looming crisis.
"It is all well and good that they have a plan for when intensive care units become overburdened with patients . . . but what about the emergency departments," NSW APA vice president Scott Beaton told the ABC yesterday.

Full text: NSW is six weeks away from the most intense pressure ever placed on its intensive care systems as health care workers brace for a "difficult and exhausting" period ahead.
However, modelling from the Burnet Institute reveals even at the pandemic's worst phase for the hospital system - expected in late October and the first half of November - authorities don't believe ICU occupancy will reach anywhere close to the surge capacity of 1550 patients.
"You may be moved to a different hospital than the one closest to your home. You may have slightly different surroundings to what you would normally," Premier Gladys Berejiklian said on Monday.
"But the bottom line is anyone who needs that care will receive it."
The modelling suggests case numbers will continue to increase until mid-September in Covid-19 hotspots, reaching up to 2000 cases per day.
The flow-on effect of those case numbers on hospitals and ICUs will follow, with up to 3900 patients expected to need hospital admission.
By the time of the greatest stress in late October, three in five ICU patients could have Covid-19.
The estimated peak of patients in ICU is 947, of whom 560 would be Covid-19 patients and 387 have other ailments.
At that point, some ICU patients will be treated in other spaces like operating theatres. Doctors and healthcare workers will be caring for a larger number of patients than usual.
Some critically ill patients, who would be in intensive care were it not for the pandemic, will be treated outside intensive care units.
By November, hospitalisation numbers will start to fall, a side effect of increased vaccination coverage.
The modelling shows ICUs in South Western Sydney, Western Sydney, Nepean Blue Mountains and Northern Sydney Local Health Districts are already approaching capacity.
The Australian Paramedics Association says the government also needs to employ more paramedics and staff in the emergency departments to deal with the looming crisis.
"It is all well and good that they have a plan for when intensive care units become overburdened with patients . . . but what about the emergency departments," NSW APA vice president Scott Beaton told the ABC yesterday.
"People will be dialling triple zero and there won't be ambulances available because they will all be stuck sitting out the front of hospitals with patients onboard.
"The crisis is getting to a point where in the next two to three weeks . . . we won't be able to move patients into hospitals," he said.
AMA NSW president Danielle McMullen says the government must also consider the impact on patients needing non-Covid-19 care.
"The decision to suspend elective surgery, and changes to other non-Covid service provision in public and private hospitals, is significantly impacting patients needing access to care and must be balanced with a plan on how to address patient needs in the coming months," she said yesterday.
"Patients who aren't able to go back to work or are in chronic pain because they need elective surgery will be left behind when we start to open up."

ICU nurses warn system in crisis ahead of surge in Covid-19 cases

Full text: The stark warning comes as the health system is set to come under strain as the Delta outbreak worsens with health authorities preparing to place overflow ICU beds in hospitals and abandon staff-to-patient ratios.
The number of Covid-19 patients in ICU is expected to triple in October, when NSW Health says demand for critical care will exceed capacity, prompting the government to push staff ratios.
But hundreds of ICU nurses have warned the system will not cope if staff-patient levels are not capped at one-to-one.
“Never before has there been such a crucial time in NSW where ICUs should be properly staffed to avoid preventable adverse patient outcomes. This is currently not the case,” the letter reads.
“It is our professional conclusion that ICUs were in crisis prior to the current Covid-19 pandemic … The added demands of the Covid-19 pandemic, testing capacity and surging admissions is forcing our clinical workforce to the brink.”
NED-4484-Hospitalisations-by-state
The letter calls on the government to currently meet with nurses to mandate a one-to-one patient-staff ratio in ICU and additional breaks to allow nurses to remove PPE.
“Given the chronic unsafe staffing situation, exacerbated by Covid-19, we cannot deliver the care you expect us to provide and the level of critical care our patients rightly deserve,” the letter says.
It comes as modelling from the Burnet Institute has predicted the state’s Covid-19 hospitalisations will peak at more than 3,400 in October as daily case numbers hit more than 2,000 in hotspot LGAs.
But the Premier has insisted that the system can cope with the expected surge in demand, saying “our surge capacity, we estimate, is in excess of what we’ll need.”

COVID plan endorsed by state leader

Full text: Premier Peter Gutwein made the most significant commitment to the national cabinet COVID exit plan yet, saying the state would continue in a push to open Tasmania's borders once vaccination rates hit 80 per cent.
Returning to his position as Premier after a week off sick, Mr Gutwein worked to wrestle back control of the narrative abounding what open borders would mean to Tasmania.
"I want to put some context to reopening borders, just so people are clear," he said.
"I'm not going to allow plane loads of people with COVID to simply fly into the state.
"This is not about just opening the door and saying 'they'll come and we'll deal with it', that's not the way the national plan works.
"We're not going to open our borders at a time that's going to put our health at risk.
"What we're going to do, with the national plan, is ensure we look carefully at those jurisdictions we'd be opening up to and importantly, if they have restrictions in place, ... then we will utilise our border restrictions as advised by public health."
He said a future of "open" borders would likely see hotspot areas, local government areas and broader regions with restrictions in place would see Tasmania "manage our borders appropriately".
Mr Gutwein's endorsement of the National Plan came in contrast to comments made by Public Health Director Mark Veitch and Health Commander Kathrine Morgan-Wicks on Friday.
Both Dr Veitch and Ms Morgan-Wicks said they would like to see border restrictions eased with Tasmania's vaccination rate closer to 90 per cent.
Mr Gutwein himself conceded he would like to see vaccination rates "as high as we can [get them]", but reiterated his endorsement of the plan.
"I noted the comments of the State Health Commander and also Dr Veitch, who'd like to see vaccination rates above 90 per cent, I too share that goal, that ambition," he said.
"But the National Plan works to 70 to 80 per cent and we'll continue to follow that."
Mr Gutwein's comments came after a conversation in Tasmania had developed about the impact the plan would have on the state.
Based off modelling done by the Doherty Institute, the plan itself conceded more work needed to be done to adapt the forecasts to differing states, and differing health system capacities.

Full text: As more Australians get vaccinated, the opposition is being forced to review its political strategy, write James Massola and Michael Koziol.
Bill Shorten has been busy. Across many radio and television interviews, and even an opinion piece in the West Australian newspaper, the former Labor leader has been making himself heard on what the Morrison government - and implicitly, the Albanese opposition - ought to be doing.
"There's a very fine line between being too weak in opposition and too strong in opposition," he opined on one radio station last week. "I was opposition leader for six years. I guarantee you, that line is invisible to the human eye. You're either too weak or too negative. I think we've been getting the balance right."
Labor is in a difficult moment. The federal opposition has seen its political fortunes wax and wane multiple times this year as the vaccine rollout began and then faltered badly, the Brittany Higgins allegations surfaced, a well-received budget and lacklustre reply bit and then, tragically, the Delta variant has taken hold in NSW, then Victoria and then the ACT.
Albanese's line of attack on Scott Morrison - that he had two jobs: vaccination and fit-for-purpose quarantine - has worked until now.
But Australians are also eager for their freedoms. In the south-east of the country - even amid a sense of dread about COVID-19 becoming endemic, with all that entails in terms of illness and death - there is a desire to meet the moment, hit vaccination targets and start to reopen.
The federation is fracturing too, with Queensland and Western Australia enjoying their COVID-zero status and Liberal-led South Australia and Tasmania gone quiet.
There is a growing realisation in Labor's federal caucus that the "two jobs" attack line has a use-by-date as states hasten and hobble (respectively) towards the 70 and 80 per cent vaccination targets.
There is also concern within Labor about the polls. The Australian's Newspoll has the opposition ahead 54-46 in the two-party preferred vote and 40-36 on the primary vote.
But the Herald's Resolve Political Monitor tells a very different story, with Labor trailing 32-40 on the primary vote and lagging or line ball on a number of other key indicators. The most recent Resolve findings were widely shared and discussed within the caucus and stoked significant concern.
The criticism is twofold: that Albanese has decided to outsource Labor's fate to Morrison and rely on the Prime Minister making mistakes (of which he has made plenty) and; secondly, that Shorten is correct when he argues Labor should be selling a more positive and ambitious agenda, with stronger public support for the domestically made AstraZeneca vaccine and a more clearly defined position around issues such as vaccination targets.
In the words of one caucus member: "Our fate is in Morrison's hands - he f---s up or he doesn't. People are off Morrison at the moment but they aren't on to Albo. People want their kids back at school, they want to travel again. Only Tanya [Plibersek] can win it for sure as she's being positive".
Albanese's reluctance to embrace AstraZeneca, in contrast to Shorten, has been noted. So too has his initial reluctance to push back against the Labor states of Queensland and Western Australia.
Victoria's Labor Premier Daniel Andrews further complicated the picture last week as he moved from aiming for zero cases to accepting his state must live with the virus, and vaccinate as quickly as possible.
A second caucus member suggested the opposition leader seemed to want to coast on the popularity of Queensland and WA premiers Annastacia Palaszczuk and Mark McGowan and "hope it rubs off on him".
The contrary view, put by a member of the shadow cabinet, is that while the "two jobs" line of attack may have a use-by date, it's a long way off being reached. "When the focus is on Morrison it's good for us, so why would we make ourselves the focus?"
Albanese is also broadening out his strategy. He has called for a $300 payment to encourage people to get the jab, for booster shot plans to be laid out and for 12- to 15-year-olds to be included in the rollout targets - as well as a plan for under-12 vaccination.
The Opposition Leader is determined to stick to a strategic and consistent message. He believes that the rollout of the vaccine is one of the greatest policy failures by a federal government in decades - and he will keep reminding people about it.
Labor's dilemma over whether and to what extent to back the plan to reopen Australia at 70 and 80 per cent vaccination coverage of the 16-plus population has run up against Palaszczuk and McGowan, who are both zealously defending their respective states' zero-COVID status.
In a tweet, Palaszczuk claimed the Doherty Institute predicted 80 people would die each day after six months if the country opened at 70 per cent vaccination. In fact, the modelling predicted about 1457 deaths in the first six months; and that could be dramatically reduced to just 13 deaths in six months with optimal public health measures (such as an effective trace, test and isolate regime).
Federal Labor's deputy leader, Richard Marles, was blunt on Friday morning. "I would be distancing myself from the comments of Annastacia," he said, before adding that he understood states without COVID-19 wanted to stay that way, and that premiers would stand up for their states. The back-and-forth between Palaszczuk and Marles forced Albanese to attempt to clean up the split, which he did by heaping praise on the premier for her handling of the virus and avoiding his deputy's comments.
That state-federal division within Labor came a week after Shorten's comments that Australia must prepare to live with COVID-19, which was seen as a pivotal intervention by some in the party in getting the opposition to support the Doherty modelling and national plan to reopen the country.
Morrison forcefully changed tack and made it a political issue two weeks ago when he said Australians "can't stay in the cave" (and memorably compared it to The Croods). Sensing a growing restlessness in a country hit by long lockdowns, Morrison positioned himself as the champion of reopening, and sought to portray Labor as the advocate for staying shut.
One federal Labor staffer remarked last week that it would be brave for Albanese to slap down Palaszczuk and indeed, Albanese agrees with Palaszczuk on certain points, even if it's difficult to discern federal Labor's actual position on key details.
"We need to include 12- to 15-year-olds in the targets, or if not, specify what targets are for them," Albanese said on Friday.
The national plan as it stands does not require 12- to 15-year-olds to be vaccinated before states open up. Adding them would mean another 1.2 million people have to be double-dosed before the targets are reached.
While federal Labor has equivocated, NSW Labor has backed the reopening plan as clearly as it can. Chris Minns said the mood of locked-down voters in NSW was indisputable - they want this to be over.
He acknowledges there is "debate" among his federal counterparts about reopening. "I think Albo hit the nail on the head and said, 'we're backing the Doherty advice'. My understanding is that they did it in a meeting and that's the direction of federal Labor. I think he's made the right call, the realistic call, given the situation that we find ourselves in NSW, Australia's largest state."
For Albanese and federal Labor, there are months ahead of attempting to balance support for state Labor governments, while also not being seen to oppose the gradual opening up of the COVID-affected NSW and Victoria.

Full text: Of the new cases, 101 are linked to current outbreaks with 82 under investigation.
There are 89 people in hospital in Victoria, with 24 in intensive care and 13 on a ventilator, and the new infections bring the total number of active cases in the state to 1,417.
There were 48,487 tests in the 24 hours to midnight.
Premier Daniel Andrews told reporters on Sunday only one person in hospital had been fully vaccinated.
“We’re going to move from a situation where to protect the health system, we’ve got everybody locked down, we’re going to move to a situation where to protect the health system, we’re going to lock out people who aren’t vaccinated and can be.
“If you’re making the choice not to get vaccinated then you’re making the wrong choice.”
“If you are double-dose protected with either of the vaccines that are available then you are almost certain to avoid very serious illness,” he said.
“This is yet again another reminder and important point to make about the need to get vaccinated and vaccinated quickly.”
Victorian testing head Jeroen Weimar said 94 of the new cases were in the northern suburbs, with 53 in the Hume LGA and 17 in Moreland.
He said 50 new cases had popped up in the western suburbs, 11 cases in the south-east, nine cases in inner Melbourne and the CBD, with two cases in each of the eastern suburbs and the inner south.
In regional Victoria, Shepparton recorded six new cases, and Wodonga reported one. Eight cases remain under investigation.
“The overall outbreak map continues to be a very, very clear, very heavy concentration of community cases in the northern suburbs, in the western suburbs and we have a significant number of teams working in those areas to support people living with COVID at this point in time,” Mr Weimar said.
“We continue to see a small number of cases in other parts of our suburbs and I stress to Melburnians, all Victorians, please be aware that we are seeing more cases and all the COVID-safe protocols are such an important thing for all of us to be using at all times.”
Mr Weimar said the positive case in Wodonga involved a truck driver who visited a number of interstate exposure sites but immediately isolated and got tested when he showed symptoms.
No new cases have emerged from the Japara aged care centre in Carrum, where a staff member tested positive on Saturday.
The positive cases on Sunday also included a health care worker at Northern Health, which authorities believe was acquired outside of the facility.
Mr Weimar said there was a small concentration of infections at a retail strip in Roxburgh Park and at construction sites in Box Hill and Craigieburn.
“There are literally thousands of people on the ground dealing with this Covid response across Melbourne in particular,” Mr Weimar said.
“We will continue to provide and drive support because we are determined to contain as much as we can with these outbreaks that we are seeing in certain parts of the community.”
Victoria’s daily case count has grown rapidly in the past week as health authorities push for more people to get vaccinated.
Premier Daniel Andrews warned earlier in the week that Victorians “would not see case numbers go down”, with numbers now being driven predominantly by breaches of lockdown and an increased number of people infectious in the community.
Around 29,915 people showed up for a jab on Saturday, with the state recording its busiest weekend day since the vaccine rollout began.
The state now has 2,583,499 doses administered through vaccination hubs and has hit its 60 per cent first-dose administered target. 37.2 per cent are fully vaccinated.
“We are well on our way to achieving the one million jabs over a five-week period,” Mr Andrews said.
“We are indeed ahead of that and we should meet that target ahead of schedule.”
New modelling from the Burnet Institute this week suggested the current lockdown is working to suppress the virus while more people get vaccinated.
Professor Sutton said the state had an opportunity to reach a plateau with case numbers remaining relatively low and vaccination rates increasing.
“That is our opportunity and we have to grab it with both hands,” Professor Sutton said.
“We‘ve got a real opportunity to get to the higher vaccination coverage level with a relatively lower case load in Victoria.
“So hold the line in these last weeks and months until we get the high vaccination coverage that means that we can have greater confidence about seeing people … initially outdoors, initially in those ventilated settings, and in smaller numbers, but we will get there.”
Victorian MP Luke Donnellan on Saturday announced a $27 million extension of a support package for vulnerable communities, as the state battled the current outbreak.
The funding will include $3.7 million for the Red Cross and local government to provide isolation packages, $6 million for food relief reserve for major providers like Food Share and OzHarvest, $5.9 million, plus another $2 million to emergency hardship support package for asylum seekers, temporary and visa holders and undocumented migrants, $7.7 million for the the CALD taskforce as well as funding for family violence organisations.
“The package is very much about putting our arms around those vulnerable communities, very much ensuring that they can put food on their plate,” Mr Donellan said.

Full text: It feels like Victorians are on a treadmill; constantly pounding along with no clear destination. But we are in a race, and we have been since March 2020.
We need a road map out of lockdown, just as we had last year. It is what is necessary to provide the community, businesses and employees with some certainty and hope.
While Delta may have changed the conversation, we should not let it dictate our resolve.
Victoria can lead the nation by showing what a successful road map can look like. A road map that lets people and businesses start planning, giving them something to look forward to.
This would instil confidence in consumers, employees and business and allow them to build up, so they are ready and excited to reopen.
Importantly, it would also provide further reasons to get vaccinated. The Victorian Chamber welcomes the reduction in time between first and second AstraZeneca doses announced on Thursday, as the 12-week gap was a disincentive for some to take that vaccine.
There needs to be greater ambition to get the state going again. This does not mean that all restrictions come off straight away. That would be irresponsible, but Victoria should plan with purpose.
Victoria responsibly locked down to protect the country last year. Unfortunately, the virus made its way back here regardless of all that sacrifice. Victoria can lead the nation again by developing a strong and sensible road map out of lockdown.
Most of us are aware of the Doherty Institute modelling, which gives Victoria tangible targets to hit. The federal government also released a high-level plan of what that might mean for businesses to open up, but it was quite deliberately a framework rather than a detailed plan. Now it's up to the state government to fill in the blanks and provide the detail, benchmarks and goals to give all Victorians certainty and hope.
The Victorian Chamber proposes a four-phase plan that covers the immediate and then what happens at 70 and 80 per cent. The NSW, Victorian and federal government need to agree on this plan to protect border towns - and our economies and communities more broadly. It doesn't benefit any Australian for Victoria and NSW to be running at cross purposes.
We have couched our plan within the parameters of restriction changes previously used by the public health team. The immediate imperative and phase one of our plan - in the next week or so - should be to open up all local government areas in regional Victoria that have had no trace of COVID-19 for 14 days and allow businesses there to trade safely in restricted settings.
We have seen the reports of compliance slipping, and we can't allow that to happen if we want to open up sooner. Let's be COVID-safe, use QR codes and get tested then stay home if you're unwell. This will help give our public health team greater confidence to open up.
Phase two: once Victoria has reached 80 per cent of first dose vaccination levels, the state government could give us hope by shifting to pre-lockdown 5 restrictions with density quotients at 25 per cent and government support tapering off. Students must be back at school for the resumption of Term Four.
Phase three: at 70 per cent fully vaccinated, Victoria should progress to pre-Valentine's Day settings.
Then phase four: at 80 per cent, we go further, in effect, COVID normal. Where business can trade and we can see our family and friends at home, interstate and abroad the way we used to.
To future-proof this plan, the federal government should commit to fund, as the state has, an mRNA facility to produce the necessary vaccines. We all know that when it comes to med and biotech Victoria leads the way, just as we can with our road map out of lockdown.
What we all know is that we need to finish this race against COVID-19. We are on the final straight, but we can't get to the finish line while we are stuck on the COVID-19 treadmill.
Paul Guerra is the chief executive officer of the Victorian Chamber of Commerce and Industry.

Tough choices; ahead if elimination doesn't work

Full text: If there is Covid spreading undetected, it will be very difficult to stamp it out again. Analysis by Luke Malpass and Hannah Martin .
Concerns from some of our top Covid modellers, Shaun Hendy and Rodney Jones, that case numbers have not fallen yet, should send a shiver down the nation's collective spine.
The number of daily cases in Auckland's Delta community outbreak continues to climb, despite earlier suggestions we should have seen the 'peak' by now.
Last week, Government officials said they expected the outbreak would start to peak about day 8-10. Yesterday, there were 82 new cases - the highest daily total to date - totalling 429 cases over just 11 days.
The country is currently at alert level 4, with everywhere south of the Auckland- Waikato border moving to level 3 at 11.59pm Tuesday. Cabinet will review Auckland and Northland settings tomorrow. Previous indications were they would remain at level 4 for another two weeks.
But experts are saying the cases curve has not yet bent. And with no clear indication as to when that will happen, a further fortnight for Auckland at alert level 4 might not be long enough.
In New South Wales, the state with the worst outbreak in Australia, a lot of Delta cases spread through essential workers working in supply chains. If this is silently happening in New Zealand, the very thing that enables level 4 lockdown - the free flow of supplies to keep households fed and well - could be spreading the virus.
"You hope the curve will flatten, but so far we haven't had one day of lower cases. Each day has brought more," Jones told the Sunday Star-Times yesterday.
"The curve hasn't bent enough."
Jones said the numbers were consistent with spread among essential workers, although it was impossible to know.
"We are still in the midst of a classic Delta outbreak, [one which is] unfolding faster than in Australian states," he said.
The prime minister confirmed on Friday that there had been transmission of Covid-19 within three essential workplaces.
This once again highlights how Delta will stretch New Zealand's alert level system to the limit, and test whether the Government's elimination strategy will continue to work. If it doesn't, Labour will be left with only hard choices: Covid in the community and a largely unvaccinated population, even though the vaccination programme is now ramping up.
This is precisely what happened in NSW, which has threatened Victoria and Queensland with new outbreaks.
During the week the Doherty Institute in Australia - an infectious-disease centre working with the Australian Government to plan its way out of Covid isolation - issued a statement on its modelling on opening Australia up.
"In an average year of influenza, we would roughly have 600 deaths and 200,000 cases in Australia. Any death is a tragedy, but our health system can cope with this. In the Covid-19 modelling, opening up at 70 per cent vaccine coverage of the adult population with partial public health measures, we predict 385,983 symptomatic cases and 1457 deaths over six months.
"With optimal public health measures [and no lockdowns], this can be significantly reduced to 2737 infections and 13 deaths."
Those public health measures mentioned are summed up as "test, trace, isolate and quarantine".
According to Doherty, which Sir David Skegg cited a few weeks ago when playing his part in the 'Reconnecting New Zealand' forum, the above is an attainable aim.
Australia has set vaccination targets and is doing modelling on what is required at different scenarios. There are still pretty massive political fights between the Commonwealth Government and the states over Covid. Basically all states have had an elimination strategy, but NSW's quickly increasing Delta spread has put those at risk.
In New Zealand, the political path taken has been quite different. Instead of having a vaccine target and then a firm and telegraphed idea about opening up after that, New Zealand has decided to try to get everyone vaccinated who wants to be, and then go from there. It is hoped the rate will be above 80 per cent of the eligible population. The surge in numbers lining up for jabs since lockdown is a good sign.
But the elimination strategy, at this stage, will still be retained alongside a strategy of slowing opening up to high-risk countries. This seemed like it would be a tricky balance when announced two weeks ago.
But now that Government is throwing the kitchen sink at Delta, it has become clear just what that entails.
New Zealand has been blessed by having options due to a lack of Covid in the community. Australia did - and then suddenly didn't - have the same options, which is why it has chosen the path to reopening that it has.
New Zealand has never appeared to have a backup plan in case elimination doesn't work out.
University of Auckland physics professor and Covid-19 modeller Shaun Hendy was "somewhat alarmed" by yesterday's figures, as experts were expecting numbers to start to "flatten and drop off from about now".
"I had hoped to see them really plateau," he said.
Until we start to see case numbers coming down, and while the trend is not clear, "the end is not sight, unfortunately".
At this stage, a further two weeks at alert level 4 for Auckland is "not looking long enough", he said.
However, Hendy said it was important not to read too much into a single day's case numbers. This could be the spike before the fall.
Last week, Director-General of Health Dr Ashley Bloomfield repeatedly reassured New Zealand that while case numbers were increasing, the rate was not exponential.
If the R number (the number of people, on average, an infected person will pass the virus to) is above 1, the spread is exponential. If it is below 1, the virus will run out of steam.
Ardern said she had been advised the R number of the current Delta outbreak was around 6.
Hendy said we want to be able to see "asap" that level 4 has brought the R value down to 1.
It was "mixed news" and a "complicated situation", he said: "I think we have to wait a while".
The good news is that most of the cases being reported are associated with the largest clusters, including the Assembly of God church and the Birkdale cluster - 70 of yesterday's 82 cases.
This is "less alarming" than if these cases were in the community.
Given the high chance of transmission within households, it is likely the steady growth in cases reflects people being infected at home, he said.
That locations of interest are not "ballooning" also suggests spread is not happening in the community, he said.
If it is clear case numbers aren't plateauing over the next few days, the Government will need to take a "really fine read" on where they are coming from.
The big concern would be spread through essential services, or among those not adhering to level 4 restrictions, he said.
If it was happening via essential services, authorities would likely need to take another look at what businesses could operate at level 4.
Microbiologist Dr Siouxsie Wiles said it was important Kiwis "don't panic" that case numbers haven't yet started to come down.
"It's really important we don't start to enter the mindset that [lockdown] isn't working," she said.
The continued increase of cases is a reflection of how infectious Delta is, and most likely reflected transmission within households, she said.
She also called for the Government to provide some information on how cases are linked when possible, to be assured of this.
There was a lot of transmission early on in the outbreak and superspreading events such as at the Assembly of God church cluster, which has seen 197 confirmed cases as of yesterday.
"This outbreak is going to get big."

Full text: If there is Covid spreading undetected, it will be very difficult to stamp it out again. Analysis by Luke Malpass and Hannah Martin .
CONCERNS from some of our top Covid modellers, Shaun Hendy and Rodney Jones, that case numbers have not fallen yet, should send a shiver down the nation's collective spine.
The number of daily cases in Auckland's Delta community outbreak continues to climb, despite earlier suggestions we should have seen the 'peak' by now.
Last week, Government officials said they expected the outbreak would start to peak about day 8-10. Yesterday, there were 82 new cases - the highest daily total to date - totalling 429 cases over just 11 days.
The country is currently at alert level 4, with everywhere south of the Auckland-Waikato border moving to level 3 at 11.59pm Tuesday. Cabinet will review Auckland and Northland's settings tomorrow. Previous indications were they would remain at level 4 for another two weeks.
But experts are saying the curve has not yet bent. And with no clear indication as to when that will happen, a further fortnight for Auckland at alert level 4 might not be long enough.
In New South Wales, the state with the worst outbreak in Australia, a lot of Delta cases spread through essential workers working in supply chains. If this is silently happening in New Zealand, the very thing that enables level 4 lockdown - the free flow of supplies to keep household fed and well - could be spreading the virus.
"You hope the curve will flatten, but so far we haven't had one day of lower cases. Each day has brought more," Jones told Sunday News. "The curve hasn't bent enough."
The numbers were consistent with spread among essential workers, although it was impossible to know.
"We are still in the midst of a classic Delta outbreak, [one which is] unfolding faster than in Australian states," he said.
The prime minister confirmed on Friday that there had been transmission of Covid- 19 within three essential workplaces.
This once again highlights how Delta will stretch New Zealand's alert level system to the limit, and test whether the Government's elimination strategy will continue to work. If it doesn't, Labour will be left with only hard choices: Covid in the community and a largely unvaccinated population, even though the vaccination programme is now ramping up.
This is precisely what happened in NSW, which has threatened Victoria and Queensland with new outbreaks.
During the week the Doherty Institute in Australia - an infectious-disease centre working with the Australian Government to plan its way out of Covid isolation - issued a statement on its modelling on opening Australia up.
"In an average year of influenza, we would roughly have 600 deaths and 200,000 cases in Australia. Any death is a tragedy, but our health system can cope with this. In the Covid- 19 modelling, opening up at 70 per cent vaccine coverage of the adult population with partial public health measures, we predict 385,983 symptomatic cases and 1457 deaths over six months. With optimal public health measures [and no lockdowns], this can be significantly reduced to 2737 infections and 13 deaths."
Those public health measures mentioned are summed up as "test, trace, isolate and quarantine".
According to Doherty, the above is an attainable aim.
Australia has set vaccination targets and is doing modelling on what is required at different scenarios. There are still pretty massive political fights between the Commonwealth Government and the states over Covid. Basically all states have had an elimination strategy, but NSW's quickly increasing Delta spread has put those at risk.
In New Zealand, the political path taken has been quite different. Instead of having a vaccine target and then a firm and telegraphed idea about opening up after that, New Zealand has decided to try to get everyone vaccinated who wants to be and then go from there. It is hoped the rate will be above 80 per cent of the eligible population. The surge in numbers lining up for jabs since lockdown is a good sign.
But the elimination strategy, at this stage, will still be retained alongside a strategy of slowing opening up to high-risk countries. This seemed like it would be a tricky balance to say the least when announced two weeks ago.
But now that the Government is throwing the kitchen sink at Delta, it has become clear just what that entails.
New Zealand has been blessed by having options due to a lack of Covid in the community. Australia did - and then suddenly didn't - have the same options, which is why it has chosen the path to reopening that it has.
New Zealand has never appeared to have a back-up plan in case elimination doesn't work out.
University of Auckland physics professor and Covid-19 modeller Shaun Hendy was "somewhat alarmed" by yesterday's figures, as experts were expecting numbers to start to "flatten and drop off from about now".
"I had hoped to see them really plateau," he said.
At this stage, a further two weeks at alert level 4 for Auckland was not looking long enough, he said.
However, Hendy said it was important not to read too much into a single day's case numbers. This could be the spike before the fall.
Last week, Director-General of Health Dr Ashley Bloomfield repeatedly reassured New Zealand that while case numbers were increasing, the rate was not exponential.
It was a "complicated situation", he said: "I think we have to wait a while".
The good news is that most of the cases being reported are associated with the largest clusters, including the Assembly of God church and the Birkdale cluster - 70 of yesterday's 82 cases.
This is "less alarming" than if these cases were in the community.
Given the high chance of transmission within households, it is likely the steady growth in cases reflects people being infected at home, he said.
That locations of interest are not "ballooning" also suggests spread is not happening in the community.
If it is clear case numbers aren't plateauing over the next few days, the Government will need to take a "really fine read" on where they are coming from.
The big concern would be spread through essential services, or among those not adhering to level 4 restrictions, he said.
If this is happening via essential services, authorities would likely need to take another look at what businesses can operate at level 4.
Microbiologist Dr Siouxsie Wiles said it was important Kiwis "don't panic" that case numbers haven't yet started to come down.
"It's really important we don't start to enter the mindset that [lockdown] isn't working," she said.
The continued increase of cases is a reflection of how infectious Delta is, and most likely reflect transmission within households, she said.
She also called for the Government to provide some information on how cases are linked when possible, to be assured of this.
There was a lot of transmission early on in the outbreak and superspreading events such as at the Assembly of God church cluster, which has seen 197 confirmed cases as of yesterday.
"This outbreak is going to get big."

80% DOES NOT MEAN ‘LET IT RIP’

Full text: A RATHER alarming press release landed in the inboxes of journalists this week. It was from the Australian National University, detailing new modelling on the national cabinet’s plan to reopen the country once Covid-19 vaccination targets are met.
The bottom line? “Assuming 80 per cent vaccination coverage for only those over 16, as per the national plan, there could be approximately 25,000 fatalities,” an ANU professor said.
A slew of equally alarming news stories quickly emerged, prompting frenzied commentary. Greens leader Adam Bandt said the “terrifying” modelling showed the plan would send kids “straight to the ICU”.
At this point, there are two things you need to know. A scientific model is not a crystal ball – it does not describe the future, but it offers an educated guess. In that sense, the ANU’s work could be a useful contrast to the Doherty Institute model which underpins the national plan.
It could – and this is the part you really need to know – if it wasn’t based on an assumption divorced from reality. In the words of Walter and Eliza Hall Institute Professor Ivo Mueller, the ANU model is unrealistic, unhelpful and irresponsible. Why? Because it assumes that once vaccination thresholds are reached, Australia will let Covid rip.
The national cabinet’s plan actually mandates ongoing low-level restrictions, likely to include masks, density limits and QR code check-ins. Authorities will also persist with testing, tracing, isolation and quarantine to contain the virus.
The Doherty Institute forecasts that even if these containment measures are overrun once 80 per cent are vaccinated, 761 people will die in six months – not 25,000. If these measures work effectively, the predicted death toll is six.
Others sought to twist the Doherty work this week by highlighting a table from their report which purported to show Australia would remain in lockdown 31 per cent of the time once the 80 per cent vaccination threshold was reached if tracing and testing did not keep up.
This overlooked another table which predicted the figure would be 0 per cent – no more lockdowns – if low-level restrictions were maintained, as the national cabinet agreed to do.
Science can be spun in many directions. It was a point Anthony Albanese made to Labor MPs this week as he encouraged them to read the national plan, not “Morrison’s spin on it”.
If the events of recent days have taught us anything, it is that far too many people involved in the debate that will define Australia’s future have not bothered to read this plan and the modelling upon which it is based. Either that, or they are deliberately distorting the details.
There are some legitimate arguments to be had about the way forward. Parents are rightly concerned about reopening when their children are unvaccinated. That’s why Scott Morrison is pushing as quickly as the medical advice will allow to open jabs for kids over 12. No country in the world is vaccinating children younger than that, but trials continue.
The NSW and Victorian outbreaks have also sparked questions about whether the Doherty model would be skewed by reopening with hundreds of cases a day. The institute’s experts have now affirmed this situation does not alter the required vaccination thresholds.
Whether containment measures can keep up once the country is open is another issue, raised particularly by Albanese’s team. There are no guarantees, although state authorities have had 18 months to get it right, and higher vaccination rates make their job easier.
But with the backing of the national cabinet – in their meetings if not in public – the PM has decided once enough Australians are vaccinated, lockdowns do more harm than good.
On this point, the evidence is in his favour, both on health and economic outcomes.
Pollsters judge Morrison has also correctly captured the mood of the country. “If not at 70 per cent and 80 per cent,” he asked this week, “then when? We must make that move … the lockdowns now being endured are taking an extremely heavy toll.” Albanese may think this is spin, dubbing Morrison the “gaslight on the hill”, but if he disputes the national plan then the PM will paint him as Covid-zero zealot supporting indefinite lockdowns. Labor cannot afford for that to stick. The questions about the plan need to be resolved, and have prompted complaints from WA and Queensland that threaten to derail yet another national cabinet agreement.
Morrison has demonstrated, however, that he will not bow any more to the popular premiers. While he has been known to shrink in the face of difficult fights, this is his red line, drawn in the week marking three years since he claimed the nation’s top job.
On Saturday, Morrison will reach another milestone as the longest-serving PM since John Howard. If he wins the next election, he’ll move well into the top 10 of all time. For someone still seen by some to be an accidental leader, this would be rare air.
Morrison won his first election with a small-target strategy. He will only win again by meeting the most important target of all.

Full text: UPDATE
11.05am
COVID cases continue to grow in regional areas.
Deputy Premier John Barilaro highlighted 37 new cases were recorded in Western NSW, 23 in Dubbo, five in Parkes, two in Bourke, two in Wellington, one in Coonamble and two in Gilgandra.
Another 14 cases were recorded in Wilcannia, one in Hunter/New England, three in Illawarra/Shoalhaven and three on the Central Coast.
Mr Barilaro said there was a real focus on getting regional areas vaccinated.
"We want to keep vaccination rates high we want to keep up with what's occurring in Sydney," he said.
Mr Barilaro said 41 per cent of eligible adults in the Edward River local government area were double dosed.
PREVIOUSLY
NSW has recorded 753 cases of COVID-19 in the 24 hours to 8pm Monday.
Of which only 73 were isolating throughout their infectious period. 71 were infectious while in the community and the isolation status of 609 is not yet known.
NSW Premier Gladys Berejiklian said NSW had already hit six million COVID vaccinations.
She said about 60 per cent of the population across the state had one dose.
Ms Berejiklian said she hopes to be able to make announcements about what restrictions could ease shortly.
In the 24 hours to 8pm yesterday 48,761 vaccines were administered and 138,000 tests were received.
On Monday, Ms Berejiklian said the community was experienced 'roller-coaster ride of emotions' as daily case numbers rose and fell.
She said instead of focusing on the case numbers people should focus on the daily vaccination rate.
It comes as epidemiology and modelling expert Professor Allan Saul, from Melbourne's Burnet Institute, warned NSW could record 13,000 coronavirus cases a say by early October.

Full text: BUT QUEENSLAND SAYS OUTBREAK CHANGES DEAL THE exploding case numbers in NSW do not change the ­vaccination milestones for easing restrictions and lockdowns, according to Prime Minister Scott Morrison, even as the Queensland government insists the deal has changed.
Deputy Premier Steven Miles says Queensland may not open its border to NSW even when vaccination rates hit 80 per cent, while he insisted the four-stage plan for easing restrictions based on vaccination rates was “endorsed before the NSW outbreak”.
But Prime Minister Scott Morrison (inset) said a zero-Covid Australia was “highly unlikely” and insisted the number of cases in the community, particularly NSW and Victoria, had no bearing on the plan ­premiers agreed to on easing restrictions on Australians.
National cabinet will receive an updated briefing from ­the Doherty Institute this Friday, with federal government sources saying premiers were misinterpreting the modelling.
A federal government spokesman said that the findings were clear about what would happen when the nation reached 70 per cent and 80 per cent vaccination rates.
“We can move forward with our reopening plan because there will be far less serious illness for our health system to manage,” he said.
While the modelling used 30 Covid cases in an outbreak in its projections, theexponential growth of the virus spread means that ­having an outbreak with hundreds of cases a day will have limited impact on the overall outcomes.
Announcing another day of zero cases for Queensland, Mr Miles said that the states had agreed to a relaxation of rules under the Doherty research at a time when case numbers were very different.
“We’re signed up and committed to the plan that national cabinet endorsed, but that was a plan that was endorsed before the NSW outbreak,” he said.
“We signed up to a plan that said at 70 per cent lockdown would be much less likely, and at 80 per cent they would likely only need to be very targeted.” But Mr Morrison said lockdowns were not a sustainable way to deal with the virus.
“As we go forward, once you get over 70 per cent and particularly over 80 per cent, lockdowns do more harm than good,” he told the ABC.
“At 80 per cent, we know from the work that you can start treating Covid like other infectious diseases with those other basic precautions in place. That’s what living with the virus looks like.” Doherty Institute researcher Jodie McVernon said the Doherty report did not specifically address the NSW situation, where a state would be coming off high caseloads.
“What our modelling found is that as vaccination coverage increases vaccination does much more of the heavy lifting of the public health response,” she said.
“We’re also saying very clearly that unless those targets are achieved at some population level … if we have patchy uptake or we have groups who are left behind, then we will continue to see outbreaks.
“In that situation, public health response teams will need to do what keeps the population safe.” Queensland’s deputy chief health officer Dr James Smith said vaccination rates weren’t the only thing authorities would monitor.
“We do need to dial up and down in terms of restrictions in place, because it’s not all about vaccinations, even though vaccinations are very important and vaccination is the biggest tool in our shed really,” Mr Smith said. Meanwhile, Opposition Leader David Crisafulli called for a greater push to dispel anti-vax messaging in the community and online.

Full text: BUT QUEENSLAND SAYS OUTBREAK CHANGES DEAL THE exploding case numbers in NSW do not change the ­vaccination milestones for easing restrictions and lockdowns, according to Prime Minister Scott Morrison, even as the Queensland government insists the deal has changed.
Deputy Premier Steven Miles says Queensland may not open its border to NSW even when vaccination rates hit 80 per cent, while he insisted the four-stage plan for easing restrictions based on vaccination rates was “endorsed before the NSW outbreak”.
But Prime Minister Scott Morrison (inset) said a zero-Covid Australia was “highly unlikely” and insisted the number of cases in the community, particularly NSW and Victoria, had no bearing on the plan ­premiers agreed to on easing restrictions on Australians.
National cabinet will receive an updated briefing from ­the Doherty Institute this Friday, with federal government sources saying premiers were misinterpreting the modelling.
A federal government spokesman said that the findings were clear about what would happen when the nation reached 70 per cent and 80 per cent vaccination rates.
“We can move forward with our reopening plan because there will be far less serious illness for our health system to manage,” he said.
While the modelling used 30 Covid cases in an outbreak in its projections, theexponential growth of the virus spread means that ­having an outbreak with hundreds of cases a day will have limited impact on the overall outcomes.
Announcing another day of zero cases for Queensland, Mr Miles said that the states had agreed to a relaxation of rules under the Doherty research at a time when case numbers were very different.
“We’re signed up and committed to the plan that national cabinet endorsed, but that was a plan that was endorsed before the NSW outbreak,” he said.
“We signed up to a plan that said at 70 per cent lockdown would be much less likely, and at 80 per cent they would likely only need to be very targeted.” But Mr Morrison said lockdowns were not a sustainable way to deal with the virus.
“As we go forward, once you get over 70 per cent and particularly over 80 per cent, lockdowns do more harm than good,” he told the ABC.
“At 80 per cent, we know from the work that you can start treating Covid like other infectious diseases with those other basic precautions in place. That’s what living with the virus looks like.” Doherty Institute researcher Jodie McVernon said the Doherty report did not specifically address the NSW situation, where a state would be coming off high caseloads.
“What our modelling found is that as vaccination coverage increases vaccination does much more of the heavy lifting of the public health response,” she said.
“We’re also saying very clearly that unless those targets are achieved at some population level … if we have patchy uptake or we have groups who are left behind, then we will continue to see outbreaks.
“In that situation, public health response teams will need to do what keeps the population safe.” Queensland’s deputy chief health officer Dr James Smith said vaccination rates weren’t the only thing authorities would monitor.
“We do need to dial up and down in terms of restrictions in place, because it’s not all about vaccinations, even though vaccinations are very important and vaccination is the biggest tool in our shed really,” Mr Smith said. Meanwhile, Opposition Leader David Crisafulli called for a greater push to dispel anti-vax messaging in the community and online.

A marathon and a sprint

Publication info: Sun Herald ; Sydney, N.S.W. [Sydney, N.S.W]. 22 Aug 2021: 20.

Full text: A "difficult" few months will involve stepping stones to freedom and educating about life with COVID-19. The pandemic hasn't even started, writes Michael Koziol.
Premier Gladys Berejiklian has long warned September and October will be "the most difficult months" for NSW and she gave us a good indication of just how grim they would be on Friday.
September will be another month spent in lockdown - one that now includes measures which the government has previously said are of dubious value in reducing transmission, such as mandatory outdoor masks and curfews for the hardest-hit areas.
At the same time, the population is growing depressed, fatigued and angry. Increasingly they are also partly or fully vaccinated - but still constrained by the same harsh lockdown. As such, some light relief is in train to reward the vaccinated and improve people's mental health.
The next 90 days will therefore be a marathon and a sprint. Sydney is not in line for any serious easing of restrictions until those higher vaccination targets are reached. But every jab makes a difference and the faster the better.
For Francois Billoux, an infectious disease epidemiologist and microbial geneticist at University College London, the next few months in this part of the world will be fascinating to study. Why? "The pandemic essentially hasn't really started in Australia and New Zealand," he says.
That may be news to us but by global standards, it is true. COVID-19 is yet to sweep through the community as it inevitably will - and must - to become endemic. Berejiklian made this explicit on Thursday as she reiterated that everyone in Australia will have to live with the Delta strain.
"Some states I don't think have come to terms with that yet," she said in an interview with Nova breakfast hosts Fitzy and Wippa. "We've come to terms with it by a very confronting outbreak that I wish didn't happen."
The cases
In reality, nobody can say for sure what the next 90 days will look like because nobody knows what will happen with the case numbers. The lockdown has reduced exponential growth to slow growth, but there is no sign the outbreak has peaked. On average, each person who catches COVID-19 is spreading it to 1.3 people, ensuring numbers rise. "I don't like making predictions but there is probably a fair chance that this outbreak cannot be controlled," says Billoux.
On Thursday, the Herald revealed University of Melbourne mathematical biologist James McCaw's modelling that showed NSW cases could increase to as many as 2200 a day within a month.
The lockdown measures announced on Friday represent a "final" attempt to turn the trajectory around and "leave no stone unturned".
Peter Collignon, professor of infectious diseases at the Australian National University, said it was difficult to predict where this outbreak was heading more than five days in advance. But with the weather warming, cases would likely decline as they did in Victoria last year and during European winters, and "on top of that we will have much higher vaccination rates, which will slow the spread".
As Berejiklian has said, the coming weeks and months will also involve all Australians learning to accept the presence of COVID-19 in the community and shifting focus from case numbers to vaccinations and hospitalisations.
Ben Newell, a professor of cognitive psychology at the University of NSW, says this will probably happen faster than we think because the pandemic has proven people can adjust to new realities quickly. "The expectation has been set by the politicians: we can eradicate this, we can get down to zero, we have to be down in that sort of territory before we can reopen," Newell says. "Being able to let go of that and reset that reference point is important."
The vaccines
A record 132,439 jabs were administered in NSW on Wednesday, and another 120,581 on Thursday. If NSW maintains its seven-day rolling average, it will hit 70 per cent fully vaccinated by October 25 and 80 per cent by November 11.
Of course, the pace could increase or decrease. This outbreak and the regulator's subsequent move to encourage under-60s to take AstraZeneca jolted people into getting the jab, but that effect could fade. On the other hand, from August 30 everyone aged 16 to 39 can book a Pfizer vaccine, which will bolster momentum.
Data journalist Juliette O'Brien believes NSW can beat those targets. "First doses have picked up speed and second doses will inevitably follow," she says. "NSW is on track to get first doses into 80 per cent of the adult population by September 15. After that, we can turn all our energy towards second doses. The only thing holding us up will be the weeks needed in between for each person."
Chief Health Officer Kerry Chant has urged people to schedule their second AstraZeneca jab as soon as four weeks after their first. This will increase their protection and speed up double dosage pace. Berejiklian emphasised yesterday that "if we work harder and faster we can bring those dates forward".
NSW will hit its first major milestone any day now - 6 million doses in arms - and the Premier has promised some relief for vaccinated people at that point. What will it involve? She hasn't said, but her language has been cautious. "There might be a thing or two extra you can do that you can't do now," she told Fitzy and Wippa.
Chant has also played down expectations, speaking of "very basic and minimal changes" that might be made for vaccinated people.
Escalating case numbers have limited the government's options ahead. Whatever adjustments are made, they will likely be geared towards mental health and wellbeing, not economic activity - potentially small outdoor gatherings or revisions to the singles bubble. There is also a view among some decision-makers that measures should not be limited to the vaccinated, as everyone's wellbeing is important at this critical juncture.
Dore says more options should be on the table sooner rather than later, such as travel around NSW and family visits for the fully vaccinated. "When we do get to higher vaccine coverage, and hopefully we're trending down in the cases, then I hope we are more relaxed about low-risk scenarios."
The plan
Some in the government have high hopes for October. Last week, The Australian revealed senior ministers have drawn up a plan to reopen pubs, restaurants and gyms at the 70 per cent double-dose mark, which could occur that month if we pick up the pace. "That's the plan," an upbeat Police Minister David Elliott confirmed on Sunrise. "As a member for a western Sydney electorate, the best way to motivate my constituents to get the vaccine is to tell them they'll be able to go to the pub soon."
It is not clear exactly what will happen to restrictions when 70 per cent of us are double jabbed. Berejiklian says the federal roadmap based on the Doherty Institute's modelling promises "greater freedom" at 70 per cent, and "living freely" at 80 per cent. She has also said that how much we can reopen depends on the case numbers, too.
Berejiklian's FM radio interviews are often more insightful than her daily press conferences. For example, she was candid when it came to explaining the state's COVID-19 strategy on Nova. "Clearly, high rates of vaccination are going to get us out of this," she said. "But the challenge is when I give that message, I don't want people to think it's OK for case numbers to go as high as they can. Quite the opposite - the lower the case numbers, the more freedom we'll have more quickly."
Berejiklian also made it clear that when restaurants reopen it will be for vaccinated people only, at least in the short term, in line with a passport system agreed by national cabinet on Friday. "I'm very confident that at 70 per cent double dose and 80 per cent double dose we can start to do things that all of us enjoy and are looking forward to, but it will require being vaccinated."
"You can choose to get vaccinated and enjoy the things that the rest of us will enjoy, or you can choose not to."
NSW's ambitions for later this year are not limited to domestic activity. The federal reopening plan agreed by national cabinet stipulates that when 80 per cent of adults are fully vaccinated, there will be no restrictions on outbound travel for vaccinated Australians, and no cap on returning travellers who are vaccinated - though there will still be "proportionate" quarantine.
Berejiklian has previously hinted that NSW citizens may enjoy international travel before people in other states. "If we get our vaccination rates up as quickly as we can, well then we can live more freely than the other states. We can look forward to having international travel open," she told Kyle and Jackie O three weeks ago.
Pandemic fatigue
Government ministers know they must demonstrate there is a path out of the current malaise; the "light at the end of the tunnel" of which Berejiklian and Chant have both spoken. It's not just about giving people hope and an incentive to get vaccinated - it's also a matter of countering pandemic fatigue and wavering compliance.
A range of epidemiologists who are in favour of strict controls have acknowledged harsh rules can't last for ever. University of NSW professor Mary-Louise McLaws said Friday's changes were "helpful" but was worried about loss of co-operation in Sydney's hotspots where people felt "singled out".
Tony Blakely of the University of Melbourne said there was a trade-off between reducing cases and the hurt the restrictions would cause for people in a long lockdown. "There's only so much that societies can tolerate as far as the GDP impacts, the social impacts," he told the ABC's Afternoon Briefing program last week.
There is a political dimension to this, too. Polling published in the Australian Financial Review last week showed a big drop in voters' approval of how federal and NSW governments are handling the pandemic. Resolve Strategic's pollster Jim Reed, who conducts regular polling for the Herald, says fatigue, defeatism and protest will start to creep in the longer the restrictions are in place and the more onerous they become, but most people will still do what's asked of them.

Full text: A business leader has thrown his support behind COVID-19 vaccination as a tool to allow more freedoms and ultimately live with the pandemic.
Port Macquarie Chamber of Commerce president Michael Mowle said vaccination was the most important element of the government's transition plan.
The roadmap, which charts the way back, takes into account the Doherty Institute COVID-19 modelling and Commonwealth Department of Treasury economic analysis.
The plan contains vaccination thresholds.
"It is in everybody's interests to get vaccinated and I think it's pretty logical that the way ahead is to get vaccinated," Mr Mowle said.
He urges businesses to hang in there and stick to the rules as the state remains in lockdown in an attempt to stop the spread of the Delta variant.
"Don't be afraid to reach out to get support," Mr Mowle said.
Businesses can go to the Port Macquarie Chamber of Commerce website for information and advice on available support.

Curfew back as the city teeters on 'cliff edge'

Full text: A night curfew, taped-off playgrounds and worker permits have returned to Melbourne as public health officials and epidemiologists warn tough new restrictions are the only way for Victoria to avoid following NSW into a disastrous coronavirus outbreak.
Chief Health Officer Brett Sutton warned that Victoria was "right on the cliff edge" of an explosion of COVID-19 cases after several major breaches of restrictions, including an organised takeaway pub crawl in Richmond and an engagement party attended by 69 guests.
Melbourne's lockdown was extended until at least September 2 and a curfew applies from 9pm to 5am. Exercise is restricted to two adults from the same household and construction has been limited.
Liberty Victoria questioned the curfew, saying Victorians were yet to be given any evidence it reduced transmission. Victoria's building industry said the tougher lockdown would add more than $500 million a day to the cost of the latest outbreak.
State Opposition Leader Michael O'Brien called it a "dark day for Victoria".
In a two-hour press conference, Premier Daniel Andrews vented his anger at people who had broken the rules, saying they jeopardised the work of everyone who was obeying restrictions. "It is selfish, they are shitty choices and they will keep us all locked down for longer than we should be," he said.
Mr Andrews said the new restrictions, which came into force at 11.59pm, were introduced to stamp out rule-breaking including illegal gatherings. Health authorities also said not enough people were working from home.
There have been three positive cases linked to the engagement party, and Mr Andrews warned it was a waiting game to see whether breaches over the weekend turned into super-spreading events.
The new restrictions are in line with the toughest stage 4 restrictions that applied in Melbourne last year. Essential workers will have to obtain permits for authorised work.
The changes also mean Melburnians face tighter rules than Sydneysiders, where playgrounds are open and there is no curfew or exercise time limit. Victoria recorded 22 new cases yesterday, including two new mystery infections. NSW recorded 478 new cases and seven deaths.
Deakin chair of epidemiology Catherine Bennett said the only chance Victoria had to get ahead of the virus was going "really, really hard now" or it would risk not coming out of lockdown until the end of the year. "The problem for Victoria is that while the cases are still low, every unlinked case probably signals that there are another 10 linked cases out there and we don't know where they are," she said.
Professor Nancy Baxter, clinical epidemiologist and head of the Melbourne School of Population and Global Health, said clamping down on playgrounds and a nightly curfew sent a "strong message to the entire community that we are in trouble".
There has been no transmission linked to playgrounds, but Professor Baxter said their closure was necessary for the next fortnight. "With Delta, we know there has been transmission between children, and playgrounds are an obvious place for households to mix."
Professor Sutton said the evidence for curfews was hard to tease apart from other measures imposed at the same time, but they were needed to reduce movement.
Epidemiologist Mike Toole said the Burnet Institute examined the effect of Melbourne's stage 4 restrictions last year and while it was clear they had a dramatic effect in turning around the second wave, it was impossible to establish which particular measures worked. He was supportive of the stricter measures returning for now, saying the curfew would be a game changer for compliance.
He warned modelling for NSW's outbreak showed cases were doubling every 11 days, and would probably reach a seven-day average of 1000 by the end of the month.
Professor Sutton said he had thought "long and hard" about what closing playgrounds would mean for families with young children.
"It is not an easy choice to make and the welfare issues are real."
But he said he was concerned by the number of gatherings at playgrounds where parents had been observed unmasked.
James Trauer, head of epidemiological modelling at Monash University's School of Public Health and Preventive Medicine, said while he backed tougher measures, there was a danger they could force activity back behind closed doors.
Police Chief Commissioner Shane Patton described the conduct of some Victorians as "selfish and absolutely outrageous".
He warned that the discretion period for fines was over as he revealed police also broke up a dinner party of eight in Southbank, a party of eight in Melbourne and stopped a private property on the Mornington Peninsula from hosting a dance party for 1000 people.
Victoria's building industry said the tougher lockdown would add more than $500 million a day to the cost of the state's latest COVID-19 outbreak. Major building jobs will be limited to 25 per cent of their usual workforce on site, while smaller projects will have a cap of just five people at a time.
The Master Builders Association of Victoria says tens of thousands of construction workers would be stood down
Liberty Victoria questioned the curfew, arguing Victorians were yet to be given evidence that showed they reduce the risk.
Opposition Leader Michael O'Brien said reimposing curfews and closing playgrounds was unnecessary overreach.

Full text: Vaccine rollout ramps up
Close to 14 million doses administered. More than 1.25 million Australians vaccinated last week. More than 80 per cent of over-70s protected by first dose Over 65 per cent of over-50s protected by first dose. More than 43 per cent of over-16s protected by first dose. National plan for COVID-19 response
Following last week's National Cabinet, the Prime Minister released a four-step national plan that charts our way back as Australia manages COVID-19 into the future.
The plan incorporates the Doherty Institute COVID-19 modelling and Treasury economic analysis and sets vaccination targets required to transition to each phase.
Once Australia achieves a vaccination rate above 80 per cent, Australians should expect lockdowns to be a thing of the past, with international travel restrictions lifted for fully vaccinated Australians.
Aviation sector support
Our government has extended the Domestic Aviation Network Support and the Regional Airline Network Support programs to keep Australians moving and to ensure this critically important sector continues to operate.
More than 1.8 million passengers have been able to continue to travel across our country, including essential workers in health care and other frontline services.
Closing the gap
The Prime Minister has this week unveiled $1 billion in funding to underpin the government's first Closing the Gap Implementation Plan.
This is the first time any government has worked with Australia's Indigenous groups, known as the Coalition of Peaks, to build a real partnership. The Plan places an emphasis on giving back responsibility, listening and empowering.
The Plan outlines a major investment in health infrastructure and support to ensure Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islanders can access health services, when and where they need them.
Measures include greater support for new mothers, including greater access to antenatal care and more support for the first year of a baby's life.

Full text: What are Australia's hard border rules and when can we reopen? Sherryn Groch and Caitlin Fitzsimmons answer the questions.
Gail Holmes has a flight home to California booked for next week. But a quiet rule change by the Australian government this month - forcing citizens and permanent residents who live overseas to obtain official permission to leave - has meant a nervous wait to see if she will be allowed to board.
Expats visiting Australia have been scrambling to rearrange flights and file their paperwork. Many applications to leave were initially knocked back - despite promises from the government they would be allowed to go. That includes Helena Blackberry, a 17-year-old returning to Switzerland for her second year at an elite ballet school, and Omar Taheri, an Australian man trying to get home to his pregnant wife in Singapore. Also caught in the chaos is Holmes, back in Sydney to help her elderly mother recover from surgery.
Then there are the tens of thousands of Australians already overseas who are still trying to come home. In March last year, when Australia closed its border to the world to keep out the virus, about a million of its citizens were living overseas. Many have now returned but strict caps on arrivals (and skyrocketing airline fares) mean almost 40,000 are still stranded. That number has barely shifted in recent months despite government repatriation flights. In fact it's gone up from the 24,000 who were registered to return in September when Prime Minister Scott Morrison pledged to bring "almost all of them" home by Christmas. About 5000 are listed as vulnerable and a few people have died of COVID-19 while waiting to come back.
Australia's hard border has raised eyebrows internationally even as it has worked at keeping case numbers (and deaths) very low compared to most of the world. Now, the federal government has tied Australia's phased reopening plan to vaccination targets. The inoculation campaign, which has lagged behind most of the developed world so far, isn't likely to meet the plan's thresholds until the end of the year. Some experts despair at what the "Fortress Australia" mentality is doing to the country in the meantime while others question the legality of the new rules.
What are the rules at the national border?
Foreign visitors and temporary residents to Australia can leave whenever they want but they need a special exemption to get in. Australian citizens and permanent residents can come home without one - assuming they can find a flight - but they require an outbound travel exemption in order to leave. And almost everyone coming in, citizen or not, has to spend two weeks in hotel quarantine.
Morrison said last year that the restrictions were needed because people were still trying to holiday overseas during the pandemic, putting Australia at risk of COVID-19 when they returned. In April, during the height of the deadly Delta wave ravaging India, the government banned Australians trying to return from India, including children, with the measure threatening jail time or fines to those who tried. The ban ran out after three weeks but a small number of Australians trying to get out of India died in that time.
There are automatic exemptions for certain groups travelling to Australia, such as air and shipping crew, some business and investment visa holders, and the immediate family of Australian citizens. But "immediate family" does not include adult children or their parents. Far fewer of these inbound exemptions have been granted than outbound, with approvals averaging 3400 a month out of 21,500 requests. Who gets approved to leave has been hit and miss, but people heading overseas for more than three months are usually approved. In June 32,000 applications were lodged to leave; 14,500 approved.
Until recently, Australians who lived overseas didn't need this special exemption to go after visiting. Now, the government has closed the "loophole" - it says to stop more frequent expat travellers taking up spots in hotel quarantine for others still trying to come back. (But Home Affairs Minister Karen Andrews says those returning home for longer stints will be given permission.)
Like many expats visiting home, Holmes heard of this new requirement on Facebook - the government waited six days to announce it. She needs to fly home to her partner and job in California next week. After resubmitting her application on Monday, her exemption came through yesterday morning. "It's really disappointing the way that the whole thing has been handled," she says."It's almost like it's underhanded, like they've tried to slip it in."
Meanwhile, because of our caps on the number of passengers landing each week (as well as how many are allowed on each plane), many airlines have stopped flying to Australia. And prices on board those still coming have soared. When flights fill up, some airlines bump economy passengers in favour of business class to stay beneath the caps. Rather than getting refunds, many stranded Australians are rebooked on another flight - many months down the line. And yet private jets continue to land and the number of celebrities and millionaires crossing the moat into Australia of late (and often bypassing hotel quarantine in favour of picturesque alternatives) has sparked anger.
Are we the only ones with a hard border?
We are not alone in our isolationist approach to keeping out the virus but we don't have much company. Apart from the obvious comparison to North Korea, there's China. The nation also puts returning citizens into hotel quarantine and restricts foreigners coming in (though the rules loosened for about 20 low-risk countries in March).
China and Australia, both export-dependent economies with strong domestic travel, have weathered the fallout of their hard borders fairly well, experts say. But smaller nations following the strategy such as Singapore and New Zealand are now promising their electorates they will reopen to the world - and tourism dollars.
Australia is notable on the world stage for banning its citizens from leaving without permission too. Almost 30 per cent of our population were born overseas, and many of us have family abroad. Until late June (when New Zealand paused its side of the quarantine-free travel bubble with Australia), some Australians had been using the neighbouring nation as a backdoor into the rest of the world.
But is this legal?
Australia has form in border restrictions - not only was there the strict naval quarantine during the last great pandemic, the Spanish flu in 1918, but the White Australia policy of around that time (since struck down as racist) restricted immigration from non-Europeans. And in 1988 Australia tried to impose a kind of tax for both returning citizens and foreign travellers, law professor Kim Rubenstein at the University of Canberra says. This was struck down by the High Court, who noted citizens have a right of entry. But it's now an implied right, not one codified explicitly.
In Israel, measures similar to Australia's restricting both citizens returning home and flying out were struck down in the courts. Israel does not have a bill of rights in its constitution either but rights are enshrined in its laws so, Rubenstein says, "[the travel restrictions] were easier to challenge than it would be here in Australia".
Still, she's not convinced the rules are entirely legal either. In the case of stopping citizens from leaving Australia, the Biosecurity Act gives the minister responsible such powers. "But it also says they have to be proportionate, the least restrictive means possible," Rubenstein says. "And it's listed as quarantine but it's not really quarantine, is it, when people are leaving and pose no threat to Australia?"
The Federal Court has dismissed a challenge to the outward travel ban by right-wing think tank LibertyWorks. And the temporary ban on Australians returning from India was also thrown out when it was challenged on human rights grounds. But in both cases, Rubenstein says a very narrow point of law was being raised. She sees bigger arguments against the restrictions, such as the federal government's delay in setting up the open-air quarantine facilities experts recommended last year. "You could say these bans are not the least restrictive measure they could have taken."
Former human rights commissioner Professor Tim Soutphommasane agrees the border restrictions have revealed the vulnerability of our rights and freedoms under law. And "morally speaking, it is offensive that our government has pulled up the drawbridge to citizens and is signalling that citizens can't leave the country if they ordinarily live overseas."
In a May poll, four in 10 Australians agreed with government policy that only people with special exemptions should be allowed to travel - but roughly the same number thought vaccinated Australians should. Almost 60 per cent thought the government had done enough to help Australians stranded overseas. Given the hard border's relative popularity (and effectiveness against COVID), commentators expect the Morrison government to hang on to it for a while.
But Rubenstein says Australia's "draconian" border puts it at odds with most of the world. If it drags on too much longer, Soutphommasane worries "we could end up turning our backs on the world". "We are an immigrant, multicultural nation," he says. "And we are a trading nation ... Yet there's a significant section of our population that seems perfectly content with having our borders closed indefinitely."
When do we reopen?
While the world waited for a vaccine, closing the border was arguably Australia's most effective public health response to the pandemic. Virologist Professor Gary Grohmann likens it to John Snow, the doctor who stamped out London's nasty 1854 cholera outbreak by taking away the handle of the water pump he realised was spreading the bacteria. "This time our source is airports. And we have to take the handle off the pump by having good quarantine."
But now that we have safe and effective vaccines, if enough of the population is inoculated, the number of people getting seriously ill with the virus will plummet, putting it closer to something we can live with, such as flu. Based on modelling by the Doherty Institute, national cabinet has agreed that borders will stay shut until 70 per cent of people aged 16 and over have been fully vaccinated. Then caps will ease on international arrivals. When we get to 80 per cent vaccine coverage (likely around the end of the year), the reopening begins in earnest, with no more caps on the number of returning vaccinated Australians or bans on them leaving the country, and an extension of the travel bubble with New Zealand to low-risk countries (likely Singapore and some Pacific islands).
Many experts back the government's staged reopening plan. But some also see opportunities for more flexibility. At the University of Melbourne, infectious diseases physician Professor Nathan Grills and epidemiologist Professor Tony Blakely say we need to move away from the "one size fits all approach". Right now, they argue we could already bypass quarantine as we do with New Zealand travellers for countries with similarly low caseloads such as Taiwan, Tonga and even China. They calculate that the risk of someone coming from those countries without quarantine and starting an outbreak is lower than it is for someone from Britain cleared to leave their 14 days in a hotel. Even with a new outbreak in China, cases are still trending at about 100 new infections a day, says Grills. Blakely calculates that, out of the country's 1.4 billion population, that means there's a one-in-10-million chance of a traveller from China bringing the virus into Australia, assuming they are vaccinated and tested before arrival.
"We think a traffic light system where countries like that, less than a one-in-a-million chance are green, no quarantine, just vaccination and testing, and then yellow can be slightly more risk, one in 100,000 like Singapore and Canada, you'd probably still want some quarantine," Grills says. "It'll take the pressure off the hotel system and it means there'll be more places for stranded Australians coming from high-risk countries like India."
It may even be safer for those coming from "green light" countries. "They'd have a higher chance of picking the virus up in hotel quarantine than of bringing it in," Grills says. "This is about using public health and [real-time case] numbers to manage the border, not politics."

Full text: SNAP lockdowns and border restrictions could continue even if the Northern Territory reaches key Covid-19 vaccination targets, Chief Minister Michael Gunner has revealed.
The admission comes despite national cabinet recently agreeing to a four-phase plan to do away with stay-at-home orders and border closures at certain vaccination benchmarks, as calculated by the Peter Doherty Institute.
The Territory government has signalled it may continue to employ such tactics well after the NT reaches 80 per cent vaccination levels.
Speaking on Tuesday, Mr Gunner revealed he had since asked the Doherty Institute to look into the NT’s remote communities to come up with new targets specifically for the Territory.
“If remote communities require a higher rate of vaccination, that impacts my policy decisions going forward,” he said.
“I need really high vaccination rates here, probably higher than the Doherty Institute is flagging in their modelling.” Mr Gunner said recent changes to how vaccines were counted meant some people in remote communities were receiving vaccinations that were then being counted in other states’ totals, meaning some towns looked to have lower vaccination rates than in reality. “The Doherty modelling is based around an even spread of vaccination … it has to be 70 per cent by subregion and subgroup.” But Mr Gunner said the modelling didn’t take into account the far younger average age of the population in remote communities.
He said the median age of the NT’s remote communities was 21 years old, compared to 32 years old for the Territory overall.
The Chief Minister made the comments while attacking CLP leader Lia Finocchiaro for suggesting the NT give away some vaccines to Sydney, as leaders traded barbs in the lead-up to a by-election in the seat of Daly.
Ms Finocchiaro came under sustained fire during question time on Tuesday over her comments.
The CLP leader had dodged whether she continued to back sending extra doses from the NT to Sydney.
“I have answered this question so many times,” Ms Finocchiaro said. “What I know is that Michael Gunner and his team are politicising Covid.” Ms Finocchiaro has repeatedly called for any “surplus doses” of the vaccine to be shipped to the virus-stricken city, with government ministers criticising the stance as slowing down the NT’s rollout. NSW Health reported a record 356 locally acquired cases of the contagious Delta variant on Tuesday.

No accounting for Covid-dumb fearmongering

Full text: Brilliant American lawyer Alan Dershowitz recently claimed that Covid-19 was “worse than smallpox”. Not as bad, not almost as bad – worse.
The distinguished professor is an intellectually honest, courageous man, given he endured excoriation by fellow Democrats last year arguing Donald Trump had not incited violence on any reasonable reading of the law.
Yet Dershowitz’s claim about Covid-19 was idiotic, as the most perfunctory research would reveal.
It’s an extreme manifestation of a shocking decline in critical faculties among intelligent people when Covid-19 is being discussed.
“I call it Covid dumb,” a New York friend, art dealer Eli Klein, tells me. “I often separate that phenomenon from generally dumb because you have a lot of actual smart people who are just Covid dumb; they have allowed themselves to be propagandised.” Covid derangement syndrome is endemic among US elites. Its sufferers assert and do things that are patently ridiculous or contrary to the old rules of debate.
On a 34C day in New York’s Bryant Park recently, a healthy-looking besuited young man sat alone fastening his second N95 mask as old men enjoyed boules and children played nearby.
But it’s the Covid-dumb experts who cause the most damage.
CNN’s top Covid expert, Leana Wen, who has said adults shouldn’t hug their kids and grandkids even after they are vaccinated, recently revealed she was driving her children for a family holiday rather than flying, to keep them safe from Covid-19. Statistically, driving is much riskier than flying and children are at little, if any, risk from Covid-19.
Last month fellow expert Celine Gounder, a New York University academic, said Covid-19 was “much worse than the flu” for kids, when even the CDC specifically says it is not.
A year ago Peter Hotez, a dean of medicine at Baylor University in Texas, said it was “simply not possible … (to) open classrooms; within two weeks, teachers and students will get sick, bus drivers will get sick and staff will get sick … no one will show up to work”.
None of that occurred, yet that didn’t stop Hotez from making the same argument two weeks ago. “We know what’s going to happen. Mother Nature told us this over and over again: with each wave of Covid, this thing is going to accelerate with catastrophic consequences,” he said.
It’s almost as if experts can spout any old fearmongering rubbish they like without any concern they’ll be held accountable.
CDS is all too common in Australia. A few days ago, University of NSW strategic health policy consultant Bill Bowtell, revered as a fount of knowledge on how to fight contagious disease, claimed NSW, where the army is ensuring people don’t leave home, had followed a Florida-style approach to Covid. Florida has had, in fact, barely any Covid restrictions for well over a year. Its 22 million people are getting on with their lives.
Yes, cases have surged there recently, as they have in every US state, but more than 10 per cent of the state’s ICU beds are still free. Miami bars and restaurants are pumping, I’m told.
In 2019, before collective psychosis struck with ferocity, Australia’s pandemic influenza plan was updated, a 232-page document carefully put together by relevant experts. It defined a mild pandemic, on page 22, as one where “the major­ity of cases are likely to experience mild to moderate clinical features. People in at-risk groups may experience more severe illness.” That seems a fair description of Covid-19. Yet Abul Rizvi, an otherwise intelligent former deputy secretary of the Department of Immigration, declared days ago that he helped write the plan and he could “see nothing in the (Australian pandemic) plan that supports that assertion”.
By the way, the plan ruled out internal border closures and recommended against school closures except in extreme Spanish flu-type situations. “The level of disruption is likely to outweigh the benefits,” it said, albeit in an era where trade-offs still existed.
There was nothing in it about the army, nothing about locking down whole cities for months.

Buried away at the bottom of the article was a concession: “Interestingly, introduction of masks in Melbourne coincided with a decrease in the growth rate in rural areas, where masks were not introduced.” It’s interesting, indeed, because it demolishes the whole study, which was already farcical because it didn’t mention how the introduction of mask mandates elsewhere in the world had preceded huge spikes in cases.

Rational people used to update their beliefs when confronted with new data.

More or less all experts were emphatically of the view this would not occur, including “Professor Lockdown” Neil Ferguson in Britain, who said earlier a huge Covid-19 outbreak was inevitable. Unfortunately, CDS sufferers block out all data and arguments that undermine totalitarian responses to mild pandemics. I always thought manias were something that happened only in the history books. Let’s hope it’s over soon.

Full text: Brilliant American lawyer Alan Dershowitz recently claimed that Covid-19 was “worse than smallpox”. Not as bad, not almost as bad – worse.
The distinguished professor is an intellectually honest, courageous man, given he endured excoriation by fellow Democrats last January arguing Donald Trump had not incited violence on any reasonable reading of the law.
Yet Dershowitz’s claim about Covid-19 was idiotic, as the most perfunctory research would ­reveal.
It’s an extreme manifestation of a shocking decline in critical faculties among intelligent people when Covid-19 is being discussed.
“I call it Covid dumb,” a New York friend, art dealer Eli Klein, tells me. “I often separate that phenomenon from generally dumb because you have a lot of actual smart people who are just Covid dumb; they have allowed themselves to be propagandised.” Covid derangement syndrome is endemic among US elites. Its sufferers assert and do things that are patently ridiculous or contrary to the old rules of debate.
On a 34C day in New York’s Bryant Park recently, a healthy-looking besuited young man sat alone fastening his second N95 mask as old men enjoyed boules and children played nearby.
But it’s the Covid-dumb experts who cause the most damage.
CNN’s top Covid expert, Leana Wen, who has said adults shouldn’t hug their kids and grandkids even after they are vaccinated, recently revealed she was driving her children for a family holiday rather than flying, to keep them safe from Covid-19. Statistically, driving is much riskier than flying and children are at little, if any, risk from Covid-19.
Last month fellow expert Celine Gounder, a New York University academic, said Covid-19 was “much worse than the flu” for kids, when even the CDC specifically says it is not.
A year ago Peter Hotez, a dean of medicine at Baylor University in Texas, said it was “simply not possible … (to) open classrooms; within two weeks, teachers and students will get sick, bus drivers will get sick and staff will get sick … no one will show up to work”.
None of that occurred, yet that didn’t stop Hotez from making the same argument two weeks ago. “We know what’s going to happen. Mother Nature told us this over and over again: with each wave of Covid, this thing is going to accelerate with catastrophic consequences,” he said.
It’s almost as if experts can spout any old fearmongering rubbish they like without any concern they’ll be held accountable.
CDS is all too common in Australia. A few days ago, University of NSW strategic health policy consultant Bill Bowtell, revered as a fount of knowledge on how to fight contagious disease, claimed NSW, where the army is ensuring people don’t leave home, had followed a Florida-style approach to Covid. Florida has had, in fact, barely any Covid restrictions for well over a year. Its 22 million people are getting on with their lives.
Yes, cases have surged there recently, as they have in every US state, but more than 10 per cent of the state’s ICU beds are still free. Miami bars and restaurants are pumping, I’m told.
In 2019, before collective psychosis struck with ferocity, Australia’s pandemic influenza plan was updated, a 232-page document carefully put together by relevant experts. It defined a mild pandemic, on page 22, as one where “the major­ity of cases are likely to experience mild to moderate clinical features. People in at-risk groups may experience more severe illness.” That seems a fair description of Covid-19. Yet Abul Rizvi, an otherwise intelligent former deputy secretary of the Department of Immigration, declared days ago that he helped write the plan and he could “see nothing in the (Australian pandemic) plan that supports that assertion”.
By the way, the plan ruled out internal border closures and recommended against school closures except in extreme Spanish flu-type situations. “The level of disruption is likely to outweigh the benefits,” it said, albeit in an era where trade-offs still existed.
There was nothing in it about the army, nothing about locking down whole cities for months.

Covid-19 seeping out of eight high-risk LGAs, harsher lockdown measures needed, experts say

Full text: Data analysed by the Burnet Institute suggests Covid-19 has made its way into LGAs adjacent to some of the areas of concern, including Burwood and Strathfield in the inner west.
In an article published in the Medical Journal of Australia’s InsightPlus, titled ‘Sydney avoids 4000 cases, but lockdown must be broadened’, four MJA authors have recommended restrictions be tightened in more LGAs.
The eight LGAs of concern are Blacktown, Campbelltown, Canterbury-Bankstown, Cumberland, Fairfield, Georges River, Liverpool and Parramatta.
“Although the number of cases is still lower outside southwest Sydney, daily cases in the rest of Sydney are now increasing at about the same rate as happened initially in Fairfield – doubling every 4–5 days,” the article reads.
“It is not clear why the rates have accelerated, but this increase is statistically significant (p = 0.02). The NSW Government recognised the increasing problem outside the south west Sydney LHD, and has progressively imposed stringent restrictions on more local government areas (LGAs), such as Georges River, Campbelltown and Parramatta.
“However, the adjacent LGAs of Burwood and Strathfield had higher incidences per capita during 19–26 July than either Parramatta and Campbelltown (Table 1), and Bayside (southwest of Sydney Airport) had a higher rate than the adjacent LGA of Georges River, but have not yet been included in the more stringent restrictions.”
Evidence suggests Sydney’s harsher restrictions have worked given an upward trend in daily cases in southwest Sydney reversed on July 15, exactly when July 9 measures were expected to take effect (Fig 3a).
However, cases in the rest of Sydney have not followed this pattern (Fig 3b).
Significantly, the article also predicts, based on modelling, that despite enhanced restrictions a seven-day average of five cases cannot be achieved until the end of September.
“We sincerely hope we are wrong, and the daily caseload drops much faster,” the article read.
However, there is hope for NSW residents.
Details from the state’s much-anticipated road map out of lockdown have emerged with a hint when pubs could finally reopen.
Senior government sources have told The Sydney Morning Herald the first restrictions set to ease will relate to returning to face-to-face learning, hospitality venues and gyms.
The sources, who are familiar with the plan but not authorised to speak about the details, said once vaccination rates hit between 50 and 60 per cent, students would be able to return to school, outdoor dining for hospitality venues would be able to resume and gyms would reopen with strict Covid-19 safety measures in place.
NSW confirmed 207 new Covid-19 cases on Monday and the death of a man in his 90s from southwestern Sydney.

Brisbane still clear

Full text: TRAVELLERS from Brisbane remain in the clear despite yet another Covid-19 case in the Queensland capital.
The NT News understands health authorities have decided not to make council areas in southeast Queensland hotspots.
Queensland chief health officer Dr Jeannette Young said on Friday there had been 13 separate outbreaks of Covid-19 in the state, the latest involving a 17-year-old schoolgirl who tested positive.
It comes as the Prime Minister announced Australia would move to the next phase of its Covid-19 recovery once 70 per cent of citizens were vaccinated.
Scott Morrison said new targets, agreed to in principle by national cabinet on Friday, would give Australians a guideline of what needed to be achieved to return to normalcy.
“Australia will get this done by working together. The targets are there for us all to achieve and for us all to work towards,” he said.
Leaders were on Friday presented with data from the Doherty Institute that modelled what would occur when a certain percentage of the population was vaccinated, and what impact further outbreaks would have on the health system at that rate.
Mr Morrison commissioned the modelling earlier this month after a meeting of the national cabinet where leaders agreed to a four-stage plan to reopen the nation and return to some sense of normality.
The data, in conjunction with Treasury modelling around the cost of lockdowns, provided leaders with guidelines for trigger points to move into the next stage of the agreed-to four-stage plan.
It comes as the outbreak in New South Wales continues to spread, with coronavirus traces found in sewage plants in Sydney’s north, northwest, inner west and on the Central Coast, prompting fears the virus may be spreading undetected in those communities.
Victoria recorded just three local cases on Friday, but the state is not out of the woods, with concern over several Covid-19 wastewater detections.
A mystery case of Covid-19 has been linked to Victoria’s latest outbreak, but authorities are still scrambling to confirm how the man contracted the virus. There are seven active cases in the NT, all in Howard Springs.

Full text: Stop stalling on vital protection IT’S beyond frustrating that federal and state governments continue to move in slow-motion to adopt the necessary proactive tools required to help protect the community from repeated lockdowns.
While political leaders and many health chiefs describe lockdowns as a last but vital resort — particularly the need for short, sharp interventions to deal with Delta — the full suite of responses needed to prevent us from falling back to crisis mode and facing lockdowns is still lacking.
The most obvious, of course, has been the failure to secure enough alternative supplies of vaccines, consistent and clear messaging to overcome stubborn hesitancy in some demographic sectors and to ensure we accelerate jab coverage, including for all frontline health and aged care workers, teachers, police, other emergency personnel and all aviation staff.
As revealed in today’s Herald Sun, modelling by the Burnet Institute sets a 70 per cent vaccination rate across the adult population aged under 60 and 95 per cent for those older to more widely reopen with safety.
From our current vantage — less than 14 per cent coverage — these appear to be ambitious targets.
But overwhelming rates of vaccination must be fought for.
Consider greater Sydney at present, battling a Covid outbreak where cases soared to 239 on Thursday but 25 per cent of people aged over 70 have still not had their first dose of vaccine.
While previous changes to AstraZeneca recommendations and a delay in 3.1 million doses from Europe earlier this year were beyond federal government control, the current supply issues with Pfizer can be sheeted home to the Morrison government that failed to build enough contingency options into Australia's vaccine response with bigger orders and other suppliers.
But there have also been astonishing oversights in other areas that could help prevent against the eventual need for lockdown.
Chief among those is the abject failure to by now establish purpose-built quarantine facilities outside major capitals, modelled on the highly-successful Howard Springs facility in the Northern Territory.
While the Andrews government has secured agreement with the Morrison government to build such a facility at Mickleham, 18 months after the pandemic erupted is far too long to wait, and the centre will not partially open until the end of the year. Even the Mickleham decision came after months of calls for such a facility, here and in other states, after continual failures in hotel quarantine that sparked repeated lockdowns and billions lost to the economy.
Then there is the numbing pace on establishing domestic capacity to produce mRNA vaccines, like Pfizer, in Australia — whether under licence from Pfizer or Moderna or a homegrown design.
While Prime Minister Scott Morrison recently said anyone who claimed building an “end-to-end” mRNA facility in Australia in less than 12 months was possible “don’t know what they are talking about”, plenty of experts would beg to differ.
Back in April, University of Western Australia Associate Professor Archa Fox — the RnA Network of Australasia president — said Australia could begin local production of COVID-19 mRNA vaccines such as Pfizer within a three-month period. Assoc Prof Fox said while a “conservative” 12-month for Australia was the likely target, the fast-track estimate was based on the precedent of a repurposed factory in Germany that had a 12-week turnaround. “The shopping list for making these mRNA vaccines is essentially money to buy the equipment,” Assoc Prof Fox said.
Again, while the Andrews government has initiated its own $50m program to get mRNA off the ground, the Pfizer technology was authorised for rollout in December of last year in the US and Australia is still a long way off establishing domestic production.
Now, despite the widespread use of rapid antigen testing in Europe for fast on-site screening, its use here is ad hoc and perhaps beginning to be stretched by supply constraints.
While rapid antigen tests produce higher false-negative results than PCR swab testing, as a test that can provide results within 30 minutes they can be valuable broad-screen indicative tools and there is a plan to use them for selected worksites and year 12 students returning to class in Sydney.
True enough, Australia’s relatively low levels of virus — except now for greater Sydney — means there is no appetite for false negative tests while we seek to suppress all Covid cases.
But as part of the armoury, they should not be discounted, particularly longer term as vaccine coverage increases.
The Burnet Institute modelling detailed in the Herald Sun maintains that face masks and some restrictions on gathering sizes will continue to be needed even in the post-mass vaccination stage when significant clusters emerge.
The model aims to limit any future Covid death rates to below that of the annual seasonal flu toll. Projections for long-term control of Covid found if Australia was to “let it rip” and abandon all restrictions once we reach high vaccination rates, about 3000 Victorians would die from the virus a year. In order to prevent high death rates and remain open we must finally get moving faster on our own mRNA production, quicken the wider vaccine rollout and more urgently establish purpose-built quarantine.

Full text: This formula offers the chance to live life in a way that COVID-19 does not dominate every decision.
A plan for a phased exit from the lockdown-prone, closed-border policy of Australia's aggressive suppression strategy was music to the ears of many Australians.
Details were scant, but nonetheless the Prime Minister's road map sets out an aspiration for exit that is appropriately cautious, staged and - crucially - based on epidemiological milestones, not dates. To determine what those milestones are, the Prime Minister was explicit: Australia will rely on modelling.
The first phase is designed to buy time. Time to get vaccinated, in fact time to get enough vaccines into the country to boost coverage, and time to model the scenarios that predict if it's safe to progress to the next phase. Buying time means returning to COVID zero and reducing the likelihood of further lockdowns by addressing leaks from hotel quarantine.
It buys time to "review the national hotel quarantine network"; we hope this includes reviewing the national standard to mitigate against airborne spread in quarantine and in the community.
The current aggressive suppression strategy that underpins COVID zero has served Australia well on all fronts and is easily the best option while we are building vaccine coverage and public health defences. It is the only safe, economically smart and socially relatively open option for the moment.
But it cannot and should not be Australia's long-term plan. So how do we move beyond this point?
The cornerstone of the road map is to achieve high levels of vaccine coverage. With 26 per cent of Australian adults saying they don't intend to get vaccinated, and children under 16 not included in the current strategy, achieving very high coverage will be challenging, even when availability is less of an issue.
Some modelling suggests even with high vaccine coverage, "herd immunity" to stop transmission, illness and death from COVID-19 will only be possible with public health interventions. The level of vaccine coverage required will vary depending on vaccine efficacy against the different variants circulating. Importantly, even with high levels of coverage there will be a group of people in whom the vaccine did not work, or who were unable to be vaccinated, who will not be protected. In addition to vaccine hesitancy, many people remain unvaccinated because of difficulties accessing the vaccine.
Even with high levels of vaccination it will be vital people continue to test regularly and quarantine until they have their test result. Also, on occasions it is likely restrictions will need to be introduced to stop large outbreaks in the community, especially with the emergence of new variants. Further modelling is needed to understand the timing of when to introduce restrictions and the level required to keep control.
Also a critical issue is the management of citizens and residents returning from overseas. Again, models suggest that simply opening the borders will not be possible; there will be a need for ongoing quarantine. . However, the type of quarantine will vary; with improved community vaccination levels and vaccination of people returning to Australia, home quarantine will be possible for some while others may need to stay in government-controlled facilities. This might vary depending on the prevalence of COVID-19 in the country from where the person has travelled, the countries through which they transited and if they have been vaccinated, when and with what vaccine.
Apart from residents returning home, COVID-19 border restrictions have had a significant economic impact with reductions in international students and skilled and non-skilled migrants entering the country. A similar thoughtful approach is required to ensure these groups can travel to Australia without putting the community at risk.
While much remains to be determined and many hurdles remain, starting this discussion at a national level, led by the Prime Minister in collaboration with the premiers, is a significant step. It signifies an ambition to safely reopen in a way that has the potential to be nationally galvanising. With all we will learn from overseas, and with all we know about the effectiveness of public health measures here and elsewhere, Australians should be confident that an appropriate "Vaccines-Plus" formula can be found in the coming months. One that builds on the back of high vaccination coverage to involve judicious use of measures such as masks, home testing, home quarantine for some and purpose-built quarantine for high-risk travellers that mitigates against airborne transmission.
It may be many years, if ever, before we return to our pre-COVID lives, but this formula offers the opportunity to live life in a way that COVID-19 does not dominate every daily conversation and decision, while keeping Australians safe from the worst pandemic pathogen in more than a century.

Full text: If any other Australian state or territory was facing an outbreak of the kind NSW is now confronting, they would already be in lockdown.
That the state government is instead allowing businesses to stay open and people to leave home should give hope to lockdown-weary Australians elsewhere that there may be another way.
Other state premiers and chief health officers have adopted an "abundance of caution" as their North Star but Deakin University epidemiologist Catherine Bennett said NSW has a "fundamentally different" approach. "It doesn't mean that if it works in NSW it will work everywhere, but it certainly tells us it is possible."
In announcing Sydney's latest public health measures to contain an outbreak of the Delta variant of the coronavirus, which spread from an eastern suburbs shopping centre, Premier Gladys Berejiklian and Health Minister Brad Hazzard warned the situation was serious and fast evolving.
Yet, in rejecting the template adopted by other mainland states - where a handful of COVID cases are met with a fast, hard and preferably short lockdown - Berejiklian is sticking to the philosophy that, so far, has separated NSW from the rest.
"We ask people to make individual decisions on their own circumstances. We have put these rules in place, there will always be exceptions, there will always be certain situations which, perhaps, every single health order doesn't cover. We rely on people's common sense as much as what the health orders say," she said.
Instead of issuing public health directives to keep people in their homes and businesses and classrooms shut, the NSW government is urging its citizens to wear masks and avoid travelling to and from suburbs where they know the virus is circulating.
It is an appeal to reason, rather than a resort to heavy regulation.
University of Melbourne epidemiologist Tony Blakely, whose modelling influenced the Victorian government's response to last year's second wave, welcomed the NSW message.
"They are trying to gain compliance by a sense of volunteering," he said.
However, Professor Blakely questioned some of the NSW settings, describing as "bonkers" the permission for people to still go to gyms. He is circumspect about what the ultimate lesson from Sydney will be.
"At this point in time, I would say the chance of NSW controlling this is a bit less than 50/50," he said. "If they achieve that, that will be great, but that doesn't prove this is the best decision-making.
"There is a chance they will succeed. If they succeed, that doesn't mean they got it right, they might have just been lucky ... You would need to have this experiment another 10 times to confidently conclude they got it right. That is the conundrum with COVID."
Professor Bennett noted the contrast in tone adopted by the NSW and Victorian governments at the start of respective outbreaks.
Where both governments stressed the seriousness of the situation and highly infectious nature of the COVID-19 variant they were dealing with, NSW has backed people to do the right thing instead of issuing broad, public health directives to ensure they do.
The Berejiklian government is taking a significant gamble. If Professor Blakely is right, its odds are no better than a coin toss. The only certainty is that, if Sydney wins, all other states stand to benefit.

Shannon Deery: Life in Victoria must continue as Covid spot fires emerge

Full text: The devastating social impacts and dire economic consequences of forcing businesses to close, stopping kids going to school, keeping people locked in their homes and keeping family and friends apart, are now only too well known.
After four lockdowns we might know what to expect, but that doesn’t make it any easier.
Kids Helpline recorded a 184 per cent increase in youth suicide attempts in Victoria from December 2020 to May 2021 compared to one year earlier.
Reasons for the surge included “the impact of isolation and lockdowns” and the “increased stress” of young people not being at school. Consequently, there has been an increase in young people trying to access community-based mental health services.
This was recognised by the state government last week with the immediate injection of $10m into critical mental health services.
After a record $3.8bn investment in mental health announced in last month’s budget, the extra $10m is small money. But it is recognition that critical services need funding right now.
The government is no doubt feeling justified in locking Victorians up for a fourth time.
Modelling by the Burnet Institute, released last week, found that without the action up to 2000 Victorians would have contracted Covid-19 by August.
There can be no arguing the lockdown worked. Of course it did. When people can’t mix, the virus can’t spread. But there must be another way. How can it be that after more than 15 months we’re no more advanced at dealing with this virus?
Fortunately, unlike so many countries around the world still dealing with uncontrollable levels of the virus, Victoria is not in that position.
Just two cases were discovered after more than 80 days of no locally acquired transmissions. Which leaves us in the unique position to be bold with our approach, and experiment with methods that don’t force the state to grind to a halt.
But it will take courage from authorities to let life continue while putting out the spot fires that will no doubt continue to emerge.
Victorian members of the Committees for Cities and Regions are now calling on the state government to develop a long-term Covid readiness plan. They rightly point out staged restrictions and recovery road maps are too often inconsistently applied.
“This unpredictability of government decision-making contributes to the general unease in the community about unforeseeable restrictions that could be imposed upon Victorians at any moment,” they say.
“The lack of a clear and consistent approach to reopening and locking down Victorian communities erodes business and consumer confidence to plan, resulting in damaging effects to local economies, community mental health outcomes and the reputation of Victoria as the place to be.”
Among other things they want “a common set of publicly available and industry-informed standards to be applied to decision-making on Covid restrictions in Victoria.”
The government has long kept the rationale behind its decision-making process secret, saying only it is based on “public health advice”.
But increased transparency over the process will not only instil confidence, but could prompt a public debate about how to move forward. And how to do so without another lockdown.

AND ANOTHER THING It beggars belief that four days after wild storms lashed parts of the state, tens of thousands of Victorians remain in the dark.
More than 250,000 homes in storm damaged areas lost power last Thursday. Thousands were last night still waiting for the lights to come back on. In the middle of winter and with ongoing Covid-19 restrictions in place, they’ve sat for days with no power, no lighting and for many, no heating.
The net of blame could be cast far and wide. But ultimately, this is an act of God and the blame game serves little purpose.
What is hard to fathom is the virtual radio silence over the issue.
The fact that hundreds of thousands of people were left without power, lights and heating is nothing short of a disaster.
But the pandemic is all consuming. The morning after the storms acting Premier James Merlino fronted the media to announce an easing of restrictions. There was reference to the storms, but not much of substance.
The body of a woman previously reported missing has been found in a vehicle in floodwaters near Cobden.
Energy minister Lily D’Ambrosio put out a series of tweets, and thanked energy companies for their efforts in restoring services to normal.
In normal times, it’s hard to imagine Ms D’Ambrosio not fronting the media at least once, but probably multiple times, to update the community and instil a sense of confidence.
It begs the question: With such intense government focus on Covid, what else is being ignored, or given less attention than it deserves?
Carrying on the business of government alongside a pandemic response has been a problem for governments the world over. Taxpayers should be concerned about the reintroduction of the virus, particularly through government error.
Because every time Covid-19 returns through a hotel quarantine breach or similar failure by authorities, the government is forced to again turn all attention to eliminating the scourge. And that can only be to the detriment of other critical functions.

Full text: People have started to look at Nancy Baxter strangely when she meets their attempt at a handshake with an elbow bump.
"There's a sense of 'we're back to normal, we don't deal with all this COVID stuff'," the clinical epidemiologist says.
Australia hasn't seen a significant outbreak of coronavirus since spring last year. In fact, some communities never have, and with just 22 people hospitalised with COVID-19 around the nation, the most tangible sign of the disease is often a bottle of hand sanitiser at the door of the supermarket or cafe.
However, this era is unlikely to last much longer.
The voices calling to open Australia to the rest of the world have been growing in prominence, and alongside it the threat of outbreaks. Leading public health officials say there is little doubt the nation will have to learn to live with COVID-19 in the years to come, once high levels of vaccination are achieved.
"I talk about this as our honeymoon," says Professor Baxter, the head of Melbourne University's School of Population & Global Health.
Maybe we'll be more free in the future, as we can travel internationally, she says, "but we'll be more worried".
Baxter believes even in a best-case scenario, where very high rates of vaccination are achieved, there will still be people in intensive care with COVID-19, and with that worry for those who could be vulnerable.
"What you're not going to get is waves of outbreak ... it won't be a big wave that shuts down the hospital for three months," she says. "But it doesn't mean that you won't get cases."
Other experts paint a range of similar scenarios, largely dependent on the success of vaccination efforts.
Associate Professor James Trauer, from Monash University's School of Public Health and Preventative Medicine, says what will unfold will rely on how much immunity is built and how successful vaccines are at preventing transmission. A worst-case scenario is a disastrous third wave.
"We're absolutely sitting ducks at the moment," he says. "We've got this extremely high risk of huge explosive outbreaks, so people really need to go and get vaccinated."
But if Australia's vaccine coverage continues to rise, Trauer speculates inevitable outbreaks could be curtailed by simple public health measures such as social distancing and good hygiene, rather than punishing lockdowns.
He predicts masks will be part of the Australian look for years to come, with people likely to reach for their face coverings as outbreaks take hold, long after they have been vaccinated.
"There is a strong role for face masks to play for years to come, especially with our growing understanding that aerosol transmission is a major way this virus transmits," he says. "If we can do the basic hygiene measures well, then that and getting vaccinated should be enough to stop us from having to close down the economy and society again."
Baxter says there will also need to be a new focus on ventilation of offices and other buildings to reduce the risk of COVID-19 spreading through the air.
The idea that the virus will become a fixture of life is strongly supported by modelling from Sydney researchers led by computational epidemiologist Professor Mikhail Prokopenko.
The research found that Australia is unlikely to reach herd immunity - when those who haven't been vaccinated are largely shielded from the disease by those who have - with a mixed vaccine regime of the AstraZeneca and Pfizer jabs.
Prokopenko says even with 80 per cent of the adult population vaccinated, there would be millions of Australians unvaccinated and others who are vaccinated but can still transmit the virus, even when they don't fall seriously ill themselves. COVID-19 vaccines are estimated to block instances of people passing on the virus in some but not all cases (around 50 per cent).
He says that means outbreaks could still grow "to quite sizeable levels" requiring fresh social-distancing measures. In this high-vaccination scenario, he says these measures would likely not be as extreme as the lockdowns last year, when pubs, clubs, gyms and cinemas closed, but could necessitate measures such as people working from home some of the time.
"We're talking about outbreaks that could be happening simultaneously in many regions and many localities and many cities," says the director of the Centre for Complex Systems at the University of Sydney. "Had we developed this herd immunity, we would be much more relaxed about it. But because we do not reach herd immunity, we would still need to apply this partial lockdown or partial restrictions - call it what you will."
The Murdoch Children's Research Institute's Professor Fiona Russell, a vaccine adviser to the World Health Organisation, says gradually waning immunity to the virus after infection or vaccination meant it was likely annual COVID-19 vaccinations will be required, much like the flu shot.
"The other important issue is not only our vaccine coverage but whether the vaccines we're using actually cover the variants," she says.
Australia is relying heavily on AstraZeneca to vaccinate its elderly and Russell says some may require booster shots of an mRNA vaccine, such as Pfizer, as new strains of the virus evolve. This is because mRNA vaccines can be tweaked to adapt to new variants far more easily than conventional vaccines.
Of most concern is that some new variants of the virus appear to have what scientists call "immune escape", meaning the virus can bypass existing immunity. It's a phenomenon being observed in Israel, which has positioned itself as the unexpected poster child of vaccinations globally.
About 65 per cent of the adult population in Israel are now vaccinated or have recovered from the coronavirus, a figure that climbs to 95 per cent in those aged over 50.
Epidemiologist Professor Nadav Davidovitch, director of the school of public health at Ben-Gurion University, says while widespread vaccination obliterated the country's recent, disastrous wave, a small number of "silent" infections have been detected in people after they have been vaccinated.
The handful of infections have emerged mostly in people who only had their first dose of the Pfizer vaccine,
he says.
To Davidovitch's knowledge, none of these cases have died or been sick enough to be hospitalised. But worryingly, it appears in some cases, they may have transmitted the virus.
In a post-pandemic world, Trauer predicts, COVID-19 may follow a similar trajectory to endemic coronaviruses that preceded it.
"This is many years away, but the situation that we might end up in is a little bit more similar to the situation that we have with the other older coronaviruses that generally affect children," he says. "It means we won't have the situation where elderly people are encountering the virus for the first time and getting these really severe outcomes and dying."
The head of Melbourne's Peter Doherty Institute, Professor Sharon Lewin, believes it is impossible Australia can keep the door closed on COVID-19 forever. Her ideal alternative to "COVID zero" would see people still getting the virus but very few requiring hospitalisation.
Emerging data from Britain suggests the AstraZeneca and Pfizer vaccines cut the risk of contracting COVID-19 by as much as 70 per cent and dramatically protect against severe illness and death.
"Overall, the more people we have vaccinated the less opportunity there will be for the virus to transmit," says Lewin. "What we really want to do is eliminate any possibility of people getting really sick."
However, with only about 3.5 million vaccine doses distributed for a population of 25 million, and significant hesitancy detected among the public, Lewin cautions "we are a long way from being in that position".
Leading epidemiologists have argued Australia cannot just fling open its borders but that quarantine arrangements should be cautiously eased, first allowing select low-risk travellers to quarantine at home.
It's estimated that to avoid a third wave of the virus, the nation would have to achieve vaccination rates of 70 per cent before COVID was allowed to circulate in the community.
"I think we have the opportunity for the next five to 10 years to still be the country that's able to manage this much better," Baxter says. "But if we take the wrong steps, we have a third wave in Melbourne, and it's not as bad as it would have been but it's still not very good."
Outbreaks of the virus in Victoria have resulted in 20,000 COVID-19 cases and 820 deaths. There have been 910 deaths nationwide.
The Austin Hospital's intensive care unit, which was full of critically ill coronavirus patients last winter, is now overflowing with people recovering from postponed surgeries or delayed medical treatments.
"We are in many respects the busiest we have ever been," says ICU head Dr Stephen Warrillow.
"The confronting reality is that there will be COVID in the community for months and years to come. The ICU systems across the city are already so busy. Even small amounts of coronavirus transmission would have huge impacts on us."
For Associate Professor Jason Trubiano, an infectious disease physician, the memories of 18-hour shifts swabbing hundreds of people a day and gently reassuring anxious, breathless patients in the COVID-19 ward are still raw.
"It felt like a tsunami, but now we realise it was only a ripple," says Trubiano, who oversaw the screening clinic at the hospital during last year's deadly wave. "Thinking back to it all makes me quite emotional."
It took Trubiano months to adjust to walking past Pod C in the hospital in Melbourne's north-east and not seeing beds full of seriously ill patients.
The thought of winter and a growing reluctance among Australians to get tested for flu-like symptoms makes him and his colleagues anxious.
"I can't count the number of people who have said to me recently they had a runny nose or a sore throat and I say, 'well, did you get tested for COVID?' and they haven't," he says. "The complacency is extremely worrying. We must continue to test and vaccinate because without these two critical elements, we are very vulnerable for a third wave and this is something that is so completely avoidable."

Full text: Health officials say Australia will have to learn to live with COVID-19 in the years to come, write Melissa Cunningham and Aisha Dow.
People have started to look at Professor Nancy Baxter strangely when she meets their attempt at a handshake with an elbow bump.
"There's a sense of 'we're back to normal, we don't deal with all this COVID stuff'," the clinical epidemiologist says.
Australia hasn't seen a significant outbreak of coronavirus since spring last year. In fact, some communities never have, and with just 22 people in hospital with COVID-19 nationally, the most tangible signs of the disease are often a bottle of hand sanitiser at the door of the supermarket or cafe. However this era is unlikely to last much longer.
The voices calling to open Australia to the rest of the world have been growing in prominence, and alongside it the threat of surprise outbreaks. Leading public health officials say there is little doubt that the nation will have to learn to live with COVID-19 in the years to come, once high levels of vaccination have been achieved.
"I talk about this as our honeymoon," says Baxter, the head of Melbourne University's School of Population and Global Health.
Maybe we'll be more free in the future as we can travel internationally, she says, "but we'll be more worried."
Baxter believes even in a best-case scenario, where very high rates of vaccination are achieved, there will still be people in intensive care with COVID-19, and worries for those who could be vulnerable, such as patients undergoing chemotherapy.
"What you're not going to get is waves of outbreak ... it won't be a big wave that shuts down the hospital for three months," she says. "But it doesn't mean that you won't get cases."
Other experts paint a range of similar scenarios, largely dependent on the success of vaccination efforts.
Associate Professor James Trauer, from Monash University's School of Public Health and Preventative Medicine, says what will unfold in Australia will rely on how much immunity is built against the virus and how successful vaccines are at preventing transmission. A worst-case scenario is a disastrous third wave.
"We're absolutely sitting ducks at the moment," he says. "We've got this extremely high risk of huge explosive outbreaks, so people really need to go and get vaccinated."
But if Australia's vaccine coverage continues to rise, Trauer speculates inevitable outbreaks could be curtailed by simple public health measures such as social distancing and good hygiene, rather than lockdowns.
He predicts face masks will be part of the Australian look for years to come, with people likely to reach for their face coverings as new outbreaks take hold, long after they have been vaccinated.
"There is a strong role for face masks to play for years to come, especially with our growing understanding that aerosol transmission is a major way this virus transmits," he says. "If we can do the basic hygiene measures well then that and getting vaccinated should be enough to stop us from having to close down the economy and society again."
Baxter says there will also need to be a new focus on ventilation of offices and other buildings to reduce the risk of COVID spreading through the air.
The idea that the virus will become a fixture of Australian life in the future is strongly supported by modelling from Sydney researchers led by computational epidemiologist Professor Mikhail Prokopenko.
The research found that Australia was unlikely to reach herd immunity - the point at which those who haven't vaccinated are largely shielded from catching the disease by those who have - with a mixed vaccine regime of the AstraZeneca and Pfizer jab.
Prokopenko said even with 80 per cent of the adult population vaccinated there would be millions of Australians unvaccinated and others who are vaccinated but can still transmit the virus, even when they don't fall seriously ill themselves.
One of the reasons for this is because COVID-19 vaccines are estimated to block instances of people passing on the virus in some but not all cases (about 50 per cent).
He says that means outbreaks could still grow "to quite sizeable levels", requiring fresh social distancing measures. In this high-vaccination scenario, he says these measures will likely not be as extreme as the national lockdown early last year, when pubs, clubs, gyms and cinemas closed, but could necessitate measures such as people working from home some of the time.
"We're talking about outbreaks that could be happening simultaneously in many regions and many localities and many cities," Prokopenko, the director of the Centre for Complex Systems at the University of Sydney, says.
"Had we developed this herd immunity we would be much more relaxed about it. But because we do not reach herd immunity, we would still need to apply this partial lockdown or partial restrictions - call it what you will."
The Murdoch Children's Research Institute's Professor Fiona Russell, a vaccine adviser to the World Health Organisation, says gradually waning immunity to the virus after infection or vaccination meant it was likely annual COVID-19 vaccinations would be required, much like the flu shot.
"The other important issue is not only our vaccine coverage but whether the vaccines we're using actually cover the variants," she says.
Australia was relying heavily on AstraZeneca to vaccinate its elderly and Russell says some of the population may require booster shots of an mRNA vaccine such as Pfizer as new strains of the virus evolve. This is because mRNA vaccines can be tweaked to adapt to new variants far more easily than conventional vaccines like AstraZeneca.
Of most concern is that some new variants of the virus appear to have what scientists call "immune escape", meaning the virus can bypass existing immunity. It's a phenomenon being observed in Israel, which has positioned itself as the unexpected poster child of vaccinations globally.
About 65 per cent of the adult population in Israel are now vaccinated against or have recovered from the coronavirus, a figure that climbs to 95 per cent in those aged over 50.
Epidemiologist Professor Nadav Davidovitch, director of the school of public health at Ben-Gurion University, says while widespread vaccination obliterated the country's recent, disastrous wave, a small number of "silent" infections have been detected in people after they have been vaccinated.
The handful of infections have emerged mostly in people who had only had their first dose of the Pfizer vaccine, he says.
To Davidovitch's knowledge, none of these cases have died or been sick enough to be hospitalised. But worryingly, it appears in some cases they may have transmitted the virus to others.
"We are learning more about this virus and the vaccines every day," he says.
In a post-pandemic world, Trauer predicts, COVID-19 may follow a similar trajectory to endemic coronaviruses that preceded it.
"This is many years away, but the situation that we might end up in is a little bit more similar to the situation that we have with the other older coronaviruses that generally affect children," he says. "It means we won't have the situation where elderly people are encountering the virus for the first time and getting these really severe outcomes and dying."
The head of Melbourne's Peter Doherty Institute, Professor Sharon Lewin, believes it is impossible Australia can keep the door closed on COVID-19 forever. Her ideal alternative to "COVID zero" would see people still getting the virus but very few requiring hospitalisation.
Emerging data from Britain suggests the AstraZeneca and Pfizer vaccines cut the risk of contracting COVID-19 by as much as 70 per cent and dramatically protects against severe illness and death.
"Overall, the more people we have vaccinated the less opportunity there will be for the virus to transmit," says Lewin. "What we really want to do is eliminate any possibility of people getting really sick and going to hospital."
However, with only about 3.5 million vaccine doses distributed for a population of 25 million, and significant hesitancy detected among the public, Lewin cautions "we are a long way from being in that position."
Leading epidemiologists have argued Australia cannot just fling open its international borders but that quarantine arrangements should be cautiously eased, first allowing select low-risk travellers to quarantine
at home.
It's estimated that to avoid a third wave of the virus, the nation would have to achieve vaccination rates of 70 per cent before COVID was allowed to circulate in the community.
"I think we have the opportunity for the next five to 10 years to still be the country that's able to manage this much better," Baxter says. "But if we take the wrong steps, we have a third wave in Melbourne, and it's not as bad as it would have been but it's still not very good."
Outbreaks of the virus in Victoria have resulted in 20,000 COVID-19 cases and 820 deaths. There have been 910 deaths nationwide.
The Austin Hospital's intensive care unit, which was full of critically ill coronavirus patients last winter, is now overflowing with people recovering from postponed surgeries or delayed medical treatments, a legacy of the pandemic.
"We are in many respects the busiest we have ever been," says ICU head Dr Stephen Warrillow.
"The confronting reality is that there will be COVID in the community for months and years to come. The ICU systems across the city are already so busy. Even small amounts of coronavirus transmission would have huge impacts on us."
For Associate Professor Jason Trubiano, an infectious disease physician, the memories of 18-hour shifts swabbing hundreds of people a day and gently reassuring anxious, breathless patients in the COVID ward are still raw.
"It felt like a tsunami, but now we realise it was only a ripple," says Trubiano, who oversaw the screening clinic at the hospital during last year's deadly wave. "Thinking back to it all makes me quite emotional."
It took Trubiano months to adjust to walking past Pod C in the hospital in Melbourne's north-east and not seeing beds full of seriously ill patients or the bright yellow signs on the window.
The thought of winter and a growing reluctance among Australians to get tested for flu-like symptoms makes him and his colleagues anxious.
"I can't count the number of people who have said to me recently they had a runny nose or a sore throat and I say to them 'well, did you get tested for COVID?' and they haven't," he says.
"The complacency is extremely worrying. We must continue to test and vaccinate because without these two critical elements we are very vulnerable to a third wave and this is something that is so completely avoidable."

Full text: “Queensland, closed one day, asking someone else to pick up the tab the next,” Mr Perrottet said. “People in NSW have not only been banned from entering Queensland, but Queensland wants the taxpayers of NSW to pay for that decision.”
It comes as new figures ­reveal that NSW’s own decision to take a proportionate response to the Christmas virus wave saved up to $9 billion in economic activity.
The NSW government modelling shows that imposing a “hard lockdown” or extending the northern beaches tough stay-at-home orders across greater Sydney could have cost the NSW economy up to $1.5 billion a week.
“That would amount to a $9 billion hit if a hard lockdown had lasted until today.
“The value of keeping our economy open can literally be counted in the billions of dollars,” Mr Perrottet said.
“We continue to fight a dual battle: keeping people safe is a priority but keeping our economy open and ­people in work is vital.”
The Queensland Premier on Friday doubled down on her calls for the federal government to cover coronavirus costs and asked the Prime Minister to take more responsibility for hotel quarantine.
Only a day after she demanded a JobKeeper extension to industries like tourism operators and emphasised “how important” the NSW market was to Queensland business, Ms Palaszczuk asked the Prime Minister to put together a national response for international travellers.
“I am publicly calling on the Prime Minister to take greater responsibility for international quarantine,” she said in a statement.
“A national quarantine plan would mean proper Commonwealth funding as well as adequate Defence Force and Border Force resourcing”.
“Now is the time for the Commonwealth to step up to the plate.”
“With potentially another unpredictable ahead of us, now is the time for the Prime Minister to step up to his responsibilities and put in place a well-funded, adequately resourced, nationally consistent international quarantine plan.”
The requests come weeks after Queensland shut out Greater Sydney over the Christmas-New Year period.
By last April alone, then-Tourism Minister Kate Jones had estimated Queensland tourism had taken a $6.5 billion hit from the pandemic, with newer modelling suggesting the summer of shutting Sydney out had cost Australia $7 billion nationally.
Queensland Tourism Industry Council CEO Daniel Gschwind estimated that his state lost more than $200 million by closing the border to Greater Sydney from December through to January.
He said NSW represented about 30 per cent of the $10 billion generated by tourism in Queensland in 2019, the last year before travel was interrupted.
He said that while the Queensland community had been in favour of tough border measures, the industry needed more support.
“Our industry will still be in desperate need of assistance going forward,” he said.
The federal government is refusing to bow to the demands but Home Affairs Minister Peter Dutton said will consider requests for financial support.
“JobKeeper is coming to an end but the government’s been very clear that, if we need to provide further assistance, we’ll look at that,” he told Channel 9.
“Everybody feels for people, particularly in the tourism, aviation sectors. But other sectors as well.
“It is made harder, when the snap decisions are made to close borders, bookings are cancelled, restaurants have ordered food, they’ve employed staff, they’ve got bookings but need to close that night with no warning at all. We just need to get that balance right.”
Federal Treasurer Josh Frydenberg said the government had already committed billions of dollars worth of support.
“The Morrison government has delivered an unprecedented amount of economic support to Queensland, we have delivered three times the amount of support to Queensland compared to the Queensland government,” he told Sunrise.
“We have committed $27.9 billion of support. Anastacia Palaszczuk’s government has committed $8.8 billion of support.”
Ms Palaszczuk’s plea for that assistance came as she announced the border would open to residents from Greater Sydney from February 1, as she now urged Sydneysiders to seek an “escape” in the tropical far north.
Mr Perrottet said the Queensland request showed how crucial it was to “have a proportionate and measured response to outbreaks”.
“It’s very easy to have a blanket decision to shut borders but there are economic downstream consequences and Queensland are seeing that,” he said.
“At the end of the day, someone has to pay for that.
“It’s the Australian taxpayer, whether its in Queensland or NSW or anywhere else, who they are asking to pick up the tab for their ­decision.
“The money doesn’t come from nowhere. She’s asking us to pay for her decision to lock us out.”
The Sunshine State will open to Greater Sydney from Monday, despite NSW not yet reaching Queensland’s own benchmark for easing border rules: 28 days without any unlinked community transmission.
NSW Treasury has estimated the cost of the Sydney restrictions imposed since December’s fresh outbreaks at around $400 million per week, or about $2.4 billion in total until January 29.
DT Daily News podcast
Mr Perrottet yesterday disputed suggestions a tougher or more widespread lockdown would have lasted less time than the NSW approach.
Tourism and Transport Forum CEO Margy Osmond has backed calls for Job­Keeper to be extended for the sector, saying “continuing ­uncertainty around domestic borders ” made it “impossible” for domestic tourism to compensate for the lack of international travellers.
NSW authorities on Thursday had still not found an epidemiological link ­between our state’s most ­recent local cases and any previous case.

We could be free of virus for months

Full text: VICTORIA’S COVID-free status could continue into the new year, experts say. After reaching the milestone of 28 consecutive days of no new cases on Friday, Chief Health Officer Brett Sutton is confident the state has no active transmission.
The 28-day streak is considered the benchmark for having eliminated COVID-19 from the community.
Professor Sutton wrote on Twitter that was “rightly worthy of celebration”. But he cautioned: “We have to maintain alertness. Not fear, but a precautionary approach and readiness to respond.” University of Melbourne epidemiologist Tony Blakely said the chance of a new community case popping up got lower each day.
“Once we start doing the quarantine again it goes up a little bit. But I think the chance of us having another outbreak before New Year is quite small,” he said.
Professor Blakely, who helped provide modelling for the state government’s road map, said he was “pleasantly surprised” Victoria reached the 28-day mark.
“After we got to zero on the first day I really thought there’d be some more days with a handful of cases but the fact we stayed at zero for 28 days without having some hiccups is just extraordinary.” University of South Australia epidemiologist and former World Health Organisation adviser Professor Adrian Esterman said there was “pretty much no chance” Victoria had any undetected community cases.
“The joker in the pack is the quarantine hotels, so until we sort them out there is simply no guarantee we won’t have another outbreak,” he said. International flights are due to return to Melbourne on December 7.
Professor Blakely said he was hopeful the hotel quarantine program would be improved but he warned it would not be 100 per cent risk-free.
“It’s not impossible it will sneak out again,” he said.
Premier Daniel Andrews said the 28-day milestone was something “all Victorians should be fundamentally proud of”.
“Public health experts have laid out a public health response, the success of which is undeniable and a great credit to the Victorian community,” he said.
Excited Victorians marked the occasion by getting out and about enjoying Friday’s warm weather.
David and Emi Anderson and their children Esan, 7, and Caia, 5, and grandma Noriko Tsuchiya, went out for lunch and a boat ride on the Yarra to celebrate.
“Compared to how it’s going in other places in the world obviously we are lucky and quiet thankful we have gone so far so well,” Mr Anderson said.
Mrs Anderson said she was excited to be able to celebrate Christmas normally next month and to say goodbye to home schooling.
Port Melbourne resident Bernadette Sait went into the city for lunch and said she was happy to visit her favourite bar.
“It’s so hard to see how many shops in the city are actually empty, let’s hope we’re all back in the city they can restart again.” Hospitality worker Dejka Stanojkovic, who lost his job during the pandemic and was out in Southbank on Friday distributing resumes, said it was good to see the city come back to life.
“Now everybody is happy and everything is OK. life continues,” he said. josh.fagan@news.com.au

Melbourne v Sydney: what experts say on the numbers

Full text: It's a tale of two cities: while NSW and Victoria are recording similar numbers of new COVID-19 infections, Sydney enjoys freedoms the like of which Melburnians can only dream.
In the past 14 days, Victoria has recorded 108 new infections and NSW 105. The Victorian government is under pressure from the Morrison government, businesses and state opposition to move faster to wind back restrictions now numbers are comparatively low.
But Premier Daniel Andrews claims the state risks jeopardising the gains it has made in suppressing the virus since its peak in August.
So why do disease experts think Melbourne remains under lockdown while Sydney is open for business?
While the two states' numbers might look similar on the surface, some epidemiologists who spoke to The Age said if you examined the figures closely, there was a difference. For starters, 55 of NSW's cases in the past 14 days were acquired overseas.
Those infected are in hotel quarantine, which in NSW at least, has successfully stopped infected overseas travellers spreading the virus into the community. By contrast, all Victoria's 108 infections in the past 14 days were locally acquired. If you compare apples with apples, Victoria has recorded 108 local cases and NSW 50.
Tony Blakely, a professor of epidemiology at the University of Melbourne, says another difference is the number of mystery cases, where the origins of the infection remain unknown.
NSW has recorded six mystery cases in the past 14 days, Victoria has recorded 12. The infection source of six cases, however, was still being investigated in Victoria, some of which might turn out to be mystery cases. The previous trigger for moving to the next step in Melbourne included there being less than five mystery cases in the state in the past 14 days, although Mr Andrews has now said significant changes will occur on November 2 and that date could come forward.
Professor Blakely said 12 was still a high number of mystery cases.
"Mystery cases speak to the trains of transmission we haven't worked out," says Professor Blakely, who prepared modelling for the Victorian government.
Victorian Chief Health Officer Brett Sutton said at the weekend that NSW eased restrictions after reaching a 14-day rolling average of under four daily cases. As of yesterday, the average number of cases diagnosed in Victoria was 7.7, compared to 3.6 for locally acquired cases in NSW. "We are not in an equivalent position," he said. "We do need that time to see that we have got an average that is actually what all of those epidemiologists are telling us is safe."
Professor Mary-Louise McLaws, a UNSW epidemiologist and COVID-19 adviser to the World Health Organisation, says anything more than a 14-day rolling average of seven cases is considered in the red zone, while five to seven cases is in the orange zone. She says Melbourne is still not in the green zone, which is an average of under five cases in the past 14 days. "Victorians cannot compare themselves to NSW," she says.
Professor Catherine Bennett, the chair in epidemiology at Deakin University, says after 100 days of lockdown in Melbourne, COVID-19 should have died out in most households and small networks, with outbreaks confined to settings such as aged care homes.
She says in some ways Melbourne has had an advantage over Sydney in that the strict restrictions have meant there is more suppression of underlying spread of the virus. "Would we go into lockdown now with these case numbers? No," she says. "Should we open up immediately with these case numbers? No." Professor Bennett says, however, that she believes it is safe for retail and hospitality to reopen in Melbourne with step three restrictions.
Heath Kelly, a former head of epidemiology at the Victorian Infectious Disease Reference Lab, says Victoria has had much more virus in the community than NSW.
"NSW has never been at the levels Victoria had at its peak. There is low-level, widespread virus in the community, I think we can be absolutely confident about that. And we know the daily numbers won't be catching every case."
Dr Kelly says low COVID-19 case numbers, from a low base, as is the case with NSW, is not the same as low numbers from a high base.
If you took a snapshot of where both states are, says Associate Professor Hassan Vally, an epidemiologist based at La Trobe University, you can fairly argue NSW is not too dissimilar to Victoria. But he says the big difference is Victoria has had twice the amount of community transmission as NSW in the past 14 days.

Full text: Victoria should be made to take out a loan to fund this wilful economic vandalism The cruellest thing one can do to Daniel Andrews’s explanation of Victoria’s strategy for dealing with COVID-19 is to read it a second time. After all, given the costs that are being inflicted on Victorians and on the country as a whole, one might assume, on a first reading, that a cogent justification for the strategy lay hidden in the explanatory material Andrews used last Sunday.
Unfortunately, a second reading would show that nothing could be further from the truth. Yes, Andrews’s presentation draws on an article by University of Melbourne professor Tony Blakely and several of his colleagues that has been issued as a preprint in the Medical Journal of Australia; but the modelling it reports merely finds that Victoria’s initial six-week lockdown was unlikely to entirely eliminate the virus.
However, that finding hardly demonstrates that it is sensible to pursue the lockdown until there are almost no new cases.
Indeed, in a paper recently released as a preprint by The Lancet, Blakely himself concludes that the benefits of seeking to eradicate the virus — rather than prudently managing its impacts — fall well short of the costs.
That Victorians have already suffered so much in no way alters that conclusion or makes eradication easier to achieve. Rather, it remains a fact that once the case load comes under control, the incremental gains from attempting to drive the virus’s incidence to zero fall steeply while the economic and social costs soar, making the goal of elimination as unreasonable as it is unattainable.
And with all of the present tests for the virus yielding a non-negligible proportion of false positives, setting very few or no cases as the hurdle for relaxing restrictions can only prolong Victoria’s quixotic quest for complete eradication which, as Blakely’s study and many others show, risks doing more harm than good.
It is, no doubt, on Victorians that the greatest share of the needless harm will fall. But while Andrews jealously guards the state’s ability to chart its own course, he is anything but parochial when it comes to spreading the costs.
To begin with, 20 per cent or more of the immediate macro-economic damage will be borne outside of Victoria, with the extended lockdown reducing gross domestic product in the rest of the country by more than $2bn.
And additional income losses will be caused indirectly, as the demonstration effect of Andrews’s commitment to eradication red­uces the pressure on Queensland and Western Australia to ease their border closures. To make matters worse, just as their incomes shrink, it is Australians outside Victoria who will largely fund the commonwealth transfers without which the state would collapse.
The sums involved are breathtaking: in the course of this fiscal year, the payments for JobSeeker and JobKeeper alone will transfer the equivalent of $7000 to each Victorian man, woman and child, which is 45 per cent more than has been disbursed for those programs, on a per capita basis, in the other jurisdictions.
Adding the other forms of pandemic-related assistance, Victorians will receive almost $11,000 per capita from the commonwealth, vastly exceeding the payments to the other states.
To place those transfers into perspective, they are substantially greater than Victoria’s total public spending in 2019-20.
Nor will the contributions the rest of the country makes to underwriting Andrews’s strategy end there. On the contrary, our system of horizontal fiscal equalisation, which allocates the pool of GST revenue among the states and territories, will, on its present settings, effect an additional large-scale transfer to Victoria from taxpayers in NSW and Queensland.
Calculating the extent of that redistribution is complicated both by the uncertainties surrounding future GST revenues and by the phasing in of the very complex agreement the Turnbull government reached with the states and territories in 2018.
Since the methods used to determine the allocations were already mired in complexities, any estimates are necessarily subject to myriad caveats.
But given that the deterioration in Victoria’s fiscal position over the four-year period to 2022-23 is likely to be 50 per cent larger, on a per capita basis, than that in NSW and almost twice Queensland’s, a greater share of a smaller pool of GST revenue will need to flow to Victoria, and away from NSW and Queensland, for fiscal capability to be equalised.
Based on the likely length and depth of its economic collapse, Victoria could gain as much as $10bn in additional GST revenue between 2019-20 and 2022-23, despite total GST revenues shrinking by some $14.3bn. Meanwhile, NSW and Queensland could lose up to $9.1bn and $3.3bn respectively to fund those transfers, with all of the smaller states facing falling GST revenues as well.
That there are no precedents in Australian history for fiscal redistributions of that magnitude scarcely needs to be said. And it also scarcely needs to be said that were the transfers necessitated by a catastrophe over which the Andrews government had no control — and which it was addressing sensibly and responsibly — the payments Victoria received would simply confirm the benefits of risk-sharing in a federation.
However, no one could claim that Victoria’s woes are the consequence of acts of God; rather, their severity is the consequence of acts of Andrews, with Sunday’s announcement — which was presented to the commonwealth as a fait accompli — once again highlighting the Premier’s utter disregard for the broader costs of his decisions.
With so many of those costs being borne outside Victoria, it is readily understandable that Andrews does little to take them into account. Moreover, a glance at Queensland Premier Annastacia Palaszczuk and WA Premier Mark McGowan would show he is hardly alone in wanting to capture benefits but shed costs.
Alfred Deakin famously thought our system of federal finance, which gave the commonwealth control over revenues while placing spending responsibilities on the states, would bind the states to “the chariot wheels of the central government”. In practice, however, the warped incentives it creates are now tearing those wheels apart.
The underlying problem of our fiscal architecture, which has bedevilled Australian politics for more than a century, certainly won’t be solved overnight. But if the federation is to be preserved, the Morrison government must replace the soft touch with some tough love. Making Victoria take out as a loan a much greater share of the transfers it is receiving would be a good start. So would be freezing the process of fiscal equalisation, whose methodology the crisis has left in tatters. Ultimately, Andrews won’t see reason until he is forced to fully bear the costs of the damage he wreaks. It’s bad enough that the state has lost its way; we shouldn’t fund it to lose its mind.

Full text: The Morrison government's push to ring-fence suburbs with coronavirus outbreaks has been labelled dangerous by the New Zealand government.
The country's Health Minister, Chris Hipkins, said postcode lockdowns had failed in Melbourne and contributed to its "protracted and prolonged stage four-style lockdown".
His critical assessment comes as the Australian government pushes for the states to agree to a similar hotspot strategy, which ring-fences suburbs with positive cases and possibly neighbouring postcodes.
Victoria released its plan at the weekend for Melbourne exiting its stage four lockdowns based on reducing case infections to "very low numbers", raising questions over whether the state was now pursuing an elimination strategy.
Yesterday, Premier Daniel Andrews, who speaks regularly to Jacinda Ardern and who has praised the New Zealand Prime Minister, said Victoria was pursuing the national cabinet's goal of suppressing the coronavirus - not New Zealand's elimination strategy.
New Zealand's second wave outbreak began on August 11 after 102 days of no community transmission. The 173-person cluster is the largest the country has experienced, though case numbers are now declining.
The outbreak prompted Ms Ardern to put Auckland into a level three lockdown and the rest of the country at level two just a day after cases were detected, in stark contrast to the Victorian government's move to a postcode lockdown on July 1, then a stage three lockdown for Melbourne on July 8 and stage four on August 2.
Mr Hipkins said the suburb or postcode lockdown had been rejected by the New Zealand government as too dangerous a strategy that could "potentially allow the virus to get out of control".
"We would have missed a whole lot of cases that popped up around the rest of Auckland, and therefore we would potentially be in a Melbourne-style situation by now," he said.
Ms Ardern has referred several times to Melbourne as she has explained the rapid return to level three restrictions for Auckland.
Mr Andrews said yesterday that he spoke regularly with the New Zealand Prime Minister and that their health departments had worked closely together to investigate an Americold facility in Melbourne as the source of the Auckland outbreak.
The investigation into a Melbourne link, which has since been ruled out, led to a series of phone calls between Ms Ardern and Mr Andrews. However, it wasn't the first time the pair had spoken - they struck up a friendship when Ms Ardern visited Melbourne in July 2019.
The two leaders regularly compare notes on the virus, despite Victoria's stated aim of suppression rather than elimination of COVID-19.
Ms Ardern's political views are far closer to Mr Andrews' than those of Prime Minister Scott Morrison.
In the early stages of the pandemic, during the first meetings of the national cabinet, Mr Andrews was one of the premiers pushing hardest for tougher restrictions, while Ms Ardern moved her country to strict level four restrictions on March 26.
Professor Tony Blakely, an epidemiologist who co-authored Victoria's coronavirus modelling, said he had backed the decision to lock down 10 Melbourne postcodes from July 1, but now concedes that move had been the wrong call.
He said the lesson New Zealand had learnt from Melbourne's postcode lockdown attempt was that "you have to make the hotspot wide" to succeed.

Full text: Victoria has passed the peak of its second wave of coronavirus, modelling suggests, and new case numbers are expected to drop over the next week if Victorians remain vigilant.
Chief Health Officer Professor Brett Sutton said on Saturday that for the first time since June, every positive Covid-19 case in Victoria was infecting less than one other person on average.
Victoria yesterday reported 394 new cases of COVID-19 and a record 17 deaths as the state neared completion of a week of stage-four lockdown restrictions.
Sutton said the state's effective reproduction rate was about 0.9, meaning every 10 cases will infect nine others on average.
Coupled with stage four restrictions introduced in Melbourne last week, he said Victoria should soon push down its seven-day average of 520 cases a day. "I think we're headed in the right direction," Sutton said. "That 0.9 [reproduction rate] really needs to be 0.5. I think stage four restrictions will head us in that direction. How far we can get is a matter for all of us as community members and our behaviours."
Professor James McCaw, an epidemiologist from the Doherty Institute whose team prepares the state government's modelling, said Victoria was in its most promising position since its second wave began in late June.
"We believe we've got to that turning point and we're on our way to a better place," McCaw told The Age.
"We saw continued improvements in the public's compliance with stage three restrictions and there are early signs of really good compliance with stage four.
"I'm confident we are just past the peak or right on it, but there's a long way to go. If you take your foot off the accelerator for a second you come to a halt with this virus."
McCaw said the full impact of stage four restrictions would likely show over the next 10 days. Tighter limits on workplaces took effect over the week. - Nine

Full text: Victoria has passed the peak of its second wave of coronavirus, modelling suggests, and new case numbers are expected to drop over the next week if Victorians remain vigilant.
Chief Health Officer Professor Brett Sutton said on Saturday that for the first time since June, every positive Covid-19 case in Victoria was infecting less than one other person on average.
Victoria yesterday reported 394 new cases of COVID-19 and a record 17 deaths as the state neared completion of a week of stage-four lockdown restrictions.
Sutton said the state's effective reproduction rate was about 0.9, meaning every 10 cases will infect nine others on average.
Coupled with stage four restrictions introduced in Melbourne last week, he said Victoria should soon push down its seven-day average of 520 cases a day. "I think we're headed in the right direction," Sutton said. "That 0.9 [reproduction rate] really needs to be 0.5. I think stage four restrictions will head us in that direction. How far we can get is a matter for all of us as community members and our behaviours."
Professor James McCaw, an epidemiologist from the Doherty Institute whose team prepares the state government's modelling, said Victoria was in its most promising position since its second wave began in late June.
"We believe we've got to that turning point and we're on our way to a better place," McCaw told The Age.
"We saw continued improvements in the public's compliance with stage three restrictions and there are early signs of really good compliance with stage four.
"I'm confident we are just past the peak or right on it, but there's a long way to go. If you take your foot off the accelerator for a second you come to a halt with this virus."
McCaw said the full impact of stage four restrictions would likely show over the next 10 days. Tighter limits on workplaces took effect over the week. - Nine

Virus setback should teach us key lessons

Full text: At the end of May, The Age ran a detailed examination of modelling around the spread of COVID-19. At the time, Victoria and the nation were basking in the glow of far lower case and death numbers than initially modelled. Fast-forward a few weeks and our state is recording more than a dozen new cases a day, sparking talk of a second wave of the virus.
In May, one criticism of the modelling was that "it assumed that every person infected would pass it on to 2.5 others on average". Yesterday, Victorian Health Minister Jenny Mikakos said those recently infected - though still a very small number - appeared to have passed the virus on at that rate.
This alarming setback should teach us two important and related lessons. Firstly, we need to understand that this is not the start of a second wave, for the simple reason that the first wave never went anywhere. It was suppressed by our willingness to change our behaviour and take precautions, many of them economically and personally onerous, to avoid spreading the virus. But this disease does not simply vanish when we grow bored with it. Nor have we developed any vaccine to combat it.
The second lesson is that those who have tried to discredit attempts by scientists to model the pandemic and who portray Australia's comparative success so far in dealing with its effects as proof of an overreaction need to broaden their perspective. The World Health Organisation has said the first wave can only be declared over when there is a worldwide lull in cases. As Dr Anthony Fauci of the US National Institutes of Health pointed out this week, we are nowhere near that point. Life in Australia cannot return to normal unless life returns to normal in the world to which we are so thoroughly connected.
Many experts believe the actual second wave, based on the lessons of our history with such viruses, is likely to arrive around the end of the year, probably over the Australian summer and as winter returns to the other side of the world. Of course such forecasts and modelling for diseases of this type are not infallible; they are meant to provide a guide for likely outcomes, based on the information we have.
One of the most serious forms of complacency is to suggest that a "commonsense" approach would have yielded much the same outcome as the restrictions Victoria and other parts of the country have implemented.
As epidemiologist Dr Craig Dalton told The Age: "People can't see what [was avoided]; they would have been even more fatigued by shutdowns if they happened earlier . . . but I think probably if we left it even a week later, it could have been much, much worse - disastrous."
Those who point to our 103 deaths and just over 7500 cases so far and compare them to other statistics such as our road toll would also do well to look beyond our borders, even to other success stories such as South Korea and Israel, for proof of what is possible. Last Thursday there were 150,000 new cases worldwide, and we are closing in on half a million deaths globally.
It has indeed been difficult to calibrate our response to COVID-19. Professor James McCaw, among the experts at the Doherty Institute in Melbourne advising the government, has said early modelling looked to the examples of SARS and MERS. But while both those coronaviruses are more lethal than COVID-19, they are also less infectious. It is the fact of transmissibility that makes this situation unlike that behind the road toll. As Professor McCaw noted: "This is the same virus as everywhere else. We've seen what it can do."
We have also seen what we can do to stop the virus in its tracks. We must be prepared to do it again for all our sakes.

Second wave, ripples, or something else?

Full text: What's next for the coronavirus pandemic? How long is it expected to last? What is a second wave - and is it likely? Sherryn Groch reports.
Predicting disease outbreak has been compared by more than one weary scientist over the years to weather forecasting. You don't know exactly how big the storm will be or when it will hit, but you know it's coming.
Late last year, the hurricane came to shore: a new coronavirus quickly morphed into the world's worst pandemic in a century. Now it seems the skies are clearing, cases are easing and the world is waking up from lockdown. It's time, as the Prime Minister says, for Australia to come out from under the doona.
Yet, experts warn the storm is far from over.
The global case count is still accelerating; it is expected to reach 6 million by June. While science is moving at record speed, there is still no vaccine or known treatment for COVID-19. And fears are growing that countries inching out of coronavirus hibernation to rescue their economies could trigger a dreaded second wave of infections, such as the resurgence seen during the 1918 Spanish flu.
In Australia, Deputy Chief Medical Officer Professor Paul Kelly is duly on guard but says our success in cutting off outbreaks quickly means we might see "ripples rather than a tsunami", particularly with borders still closed for "the foreseeable future". Health Minister Greg Hunt says the biggest threat now, as states roll back restrictions, is complacency. "We remain an island sanctuary ... but the world is not out of the woods yet."
How prepared are we for a second wave?
Right now, in the eye of the COVID-19 storm, Australia's coronavirus wards are quiet. One of them, a pop-up hospital built in 37 days on a cricket pitch in Canberra, may even be quietly dismantled without seeing a patient.
The healthcare disaster mapped out in early epidemiological models three months ago has not come to pass here - at least not yet. Professor James McCaw is among the experts at the Doherty Institute in Melbourne working on models for government and says that, while Australia has so far avoided the devastating crush of COVID-19 cases seen in hospitals overseas, he winces when he hears an Australian speak of the pandemic in the past tense. "We are still at the very start of this."
The danger is perhaps just harder to see right now - it has become invisible as the virus itself is, epidemiologist Dr Craig Dalton notes, because state and federal leaders acted on those models and their worst-case scenarios. Just weeks earlier, that curve had looked very different, with cases doubling every three to four days.
"People can't see what [was avoided]; they would have been even more fatigued by shutdowns if they happened earlier," Dalton says. "But I think, probably, if we left it even a week later, it could have been much, much worse - disastrous."
The measures have bought Australia time. The stock of lifesaving ventilators has tripled. Extra staff are being trained in intensive care. Testing has been ramped up. And, alongside other early leaders in the COVID-19 fight such as South Korea and Taiwan, Australia now has an army of disease detectives finding and isolating cases mostly imported from overseas. Even large clusters such as those spawned by the Ruby Princess cruise ship debacle in Sydney or the Cedar Meats outbreak in Victoria, have been stopped before they could spiral out of control, McCaw says.
Of course, Australia's low infection rates could make it an unwitting victim of its own success, Kelly says, with a population less exposed, and therefore more susceptible, to the pathogen if a second wave takes hold. "But I'm more hopeful now that won't happen."
How is the pandemic expected to unfold?
In the US, top infectious diseases expert Dr Michael Osterholm often says a virus has its own "gravity", or momentum. If left to its own devices, it would burn through cities and towns until enough of the world's population had recovered with virus-fighting antibodies in their blood to ward off another infection. This is known as "herd immunity" and the magic number is about 60 per cent - generally more than half of a population needs to be exposed to a pathogen before transmission slows. No country is there yet. Even those now overrun with the virus, such as the US, have reached only about 20 per cent. That means every nation is still vulnerable, Kelly and McCaw say.
During the great plagues of the past, humanity had little choice but to let their immunity to disease build naturally. Now we have modern medicine and vaccines to speed things up - but even the most optimistic estimates put a COVID-19 vaccine discovery and roll-out at between
12 and 18 months away.
Osterholm and other experts have predicted the pandemic will last between 18 months and two years. But the virus itself is likely to hang around longer - to be beaten back, over time, through vaccinations or even, perhaps, to persist as a seasonal illness.
"Viral gravity" also means that, like the ocean, outbreaks can occur in waves - an initial surge of cases might peter out only to peak again then crash down in another torrent, and sometimes a third or a fourth, whenever the virus finds a fresh foothold.
The last time the world faced a pandemic of this scale, it was closing out World War I. But it was the second wave of that strange 1918 influenza, known as Spanish flu, arriving months later that claimed the most lives. For Australia, the third wave, in January 1919, proved the most deadly.
During the influenza pandemics since, experts point out that all had a resurgence about six months later, regardless of the season. Many - such as the 1957 flu pandemic and most recently swine flu in 2009 - were even bigger than the first wave.
This is our worst-case scenario for COVID-19. "If we relax restrictions too much, we could get a huge second wave," McCaw says. Still, he remains hopeful for the "slower burn" scenario Kelly is banking on, in which outbreaks flare up in smaller and smaller numbers and are put out by contact tracers.
This virus is more than 10 times deadlier than seasonal flu and all of us will need to be on our guard in a "COVID-safe world" for some time yet.
"For us, eternal vigilance may be the price of survival - as my surgery tutor used to tell me," Kelly says. "At least until we get a vaccine."
But if humanity doesn't get its shot of immunity before the pandemic burns out, Osterholm's research also envisions a third scenario - of more pronounced flare-ups or "mini-waves" that will likely require countries to restore social restrictions, at least here and there.
Early success stories such as Singapore, Germany, Japan, South Korea, even the Chinese city of Wuhan where the virus emerged, have already seen fresh clusters break loose again when public health rules were relaxed.
But the World Health Organisation says we are still in the first wave of the pandemic. If a second surge comes, experts expect it to arrive about the end of the year.
Should we be worried?
During the 1918 Spanish flu, San Francisco acted fast, shutting down while US cities around it were overrun. But when cases receded, it opened up. A second wave hit but San Francisco resisted restoring the restrictions. By the end of the pandemic, for all its early progress, it ranked among the worst-hit cities in America.
Likewise, when the third global wave reached Australia, NSW lifted its shutdowns too early and then delayed reinstating them for weeks, allowing the virus to take hold.
Resurgence is common in the pandemic records, but Kelly says the fear of a larger second wave is still tied to 1918. Some experts argue that virus mutated between its first and second waves to become more infectious. This virus, the first coronavirus on record to break out into a pandemic, is more stable than the wild genetic code of influenza, and it behaves differently.
At first, McCaw says, disease modellers worldwide looked to the other two dangerous coronaviruses, SARS and MERS. But while both strains are more lethal, they are also less infectious. Critically, Kelly notes, they are not known to spread undetected, without symptoms, in the way the new coronavirus (and sometimes flu) can.
While some have questioned the scale of the disaster first predicted for Australia, McCaw says even local data now suggests there would have been a catastrophic outbreak similar to that seen overseas if controls had not been brought in. "This is the same virus. We've seen what it can do."
In the vast jungle of data now growing around COVID-19, Kelly is watching one number in particular - the reproduction rate, which measures how many other people on average each patient will infect. If we can keep it below one in Australia (as it is now), the virus will eventually die out.
Then there's who is getting infected and why - 50 new cases arriving from overseas and going into mandatory hotel quarantine is not as big a concern for Kelly and his team as 50 cases scattered across Australia without a clear source. "That means it's circulating in the community somewhere," Kelly says.
At the Grattan Institute, Stephen Duckett is working on modelling to measure tipping points - when a cluster could break through containment efforts. Both Duckett and Dalton are concerned about large workplaces as more of us return to the daily grind in person. Kelly agrees that good ventilation and hand hygiene will need to come to the fore. Work rosters could also be staggered, Duckett suggests, with one cohort of staff cycling through the office on alternative weeks and deep cleans in between.
Public transport may be all that stands between us and the traffic jams of our nightmares, but in the era of COVID-19 how do we avoid the peak-hour crush without handicapping the network? Some experts suggest we follow the lead of Europe and the US and make masks mandatory on board, but Kelly says solutions around ventilation, passenger limits and staggered timetables would be more effective as masks are often worn improperly.
Dalton says relaxing the rules in relatively "low-risk" settings such as cafes with customer limits or outdoor dining is one thing. "But places like nightclubs, aged care, religious institutions - that's
where we've seen things go
wrong [overseas]."
Will shutdowns come back if cases climb?
Minister Hunt has said it is unlikely states will bring back restrictions. Instead, "ringfences" of containment could be rapidly set up around an outbreak, putting a local area into temporary lockdown.
But some say Australia needs a well-spaced and specific framework in which to measure the impact of reopenings, similar to Germany's "emergency brake" that considers restoring restrictions if cases reach more than 50 per 100,000 people in seven days.
Bringing back wider lockdowns in Australia can't be taken off the table, Kelly says, but it's not part of the plan - which is mostly to reopen Australia by July. "But we're going slow so we don't have to say in a month, 'Whoops, it's out of control'," Kelly says. "[So] we don't have to take out the sledgehammer again."
While states are now easing restrictions at different paces, "none are going dangerously fast", he says. Some have enjoyed consecutive days without recording a new case. Australia did not opt to try for total elimination of the virus, as New Zealand did with its tougher lockdown, but Kelly says it's possible it could be wiped out if our national borders stay up (to all, perhaps, except our Kiwi neighbours under a mooted Trans-Tasman bubble of safe travel).
Kelly "can't imagine any time into the future we'll be getting back to business as usual" at the borders, but at some point, Australia will have to open back up to the world.
And the longer our lives are disrupted by isolation and economic upheaval, the more likely another "wave" of health problems beyond just COVID-19 will build, including suicide. On the economic side of things, at least, analysis by MIT researchers suggests that social restrictions could help countries recover long-term. US cities that locked down early and for longer periods during the 1918 flu had fewer deaths and healthier economies when it was over, as local industries were able to bounce back faster.
McCaw says our leaders listened to the experts in first imposing shutdowns and it likely saved thousands of lives. "If it's between locking down again or having a runaway outbreak, I know what I'd pick."

Full text: DESPITE the impacts from coronavirus, the Wide Bay will need about 3000 fruit and vegetable pickers every month for the remainder of the year.
Minister for Agricultural Industry Development and Fisheries Mark Furner said economic modelling based on survey data and advice from labour hire companies confirmed the required workforce was on hand and keen to start.
“Our agricultural sector needs workers, whether they be local or coming interstate, to guarantee a steady supply of fresh produce,” Mr Furner said.
“At a time when so many people are looking for work, there is major demand in Wide Bay, including the Bundaberg area, with its significant production of tomatoes, capsicums, sweet potatoes and avocados.
“This region is going to need about 3000 people each month all the way through to the end of the year.” Mr Furner said there was also a demand for the citrus harvest in the Wide Bay and Central Queensland regions.
The survey to determine workforce needs was conducted by Queensland peak horticulture body, Growcom with the Department of Agriculture and Fisheries.
Growcom CEO David Thompson said finding employees for harvests was always a challenge but it was magnified by the coronavirus.
“Finding the right people, in the right place and at the right time has always proven problematic for horticulture,” Mr Thomson said.
“As an industry we’re obviously primarily concerned with the health and safety of our employees, but we’re also very mindful of the wellbeing of the residents of regional towns.
“For this reason, we are encouraging growers to consider their workforce needs now, advertise jobs early, and wherever they can, post their vacancies on the Harvest Trail jobs board.” Mr Thompson said workers should not turn up to farms unannounced and should go through formal hiring networks like Jobs Finder Queensland and HarvestTrail.
If workers are entering Queensland and have been in a declared COVID-19 hotspot in the last 14 days, they must self-quarantine at their own expense for 14 days before starting work.To advertise a job on the Harvest Trails jobs board visit jobsearch.gov.au/harvest

States race in elimination stakes

Author: Blakely, Tony

Publication info: Sun Herald ; Sydney, N.S.W. [Sydney, N.S.W]. 24 May 2020: 23.

Full text: As states begin to reopen borders, the risk versus reward of restrictions must be weighed up, writes Tony Blakely.
The eight Australian states and territories, plus New Zealand, are in a horse race. They have rounded into the home straight. NZ, Western Australia, South Australia, the ACT and the NT are leading the pack, with very low or zero COVID-19 cases reported in the past two weeks.
But what really matters is notified cases of COVID-19 that cannot be traced to an already known case - as these signify hidden community transmission. For the two weeks from May 8 to 21, there were zero such cases in the ACT, the NT, WA, Queensland, Tasmania and NZ. SA had two while Victoria had 10 (of a total of 136 cases, mostly associated with known outbreaks) and NSW had six (of 41 total cases).
The winner will be the state or territory that first reaches 28 days of no apparent community-acquired infection. Why? Because this comfortably includes two incubation cycles of COVID-19, and we would assume that if it was still circulating in the community a symptomatic case would have arisen somewhere in 28 days.
Nothing is guaranteed, but modelling has suggested a 95 per cent probability of "elimination achieved" if there are no community-acquired cases after a month. And depending on which way you look at the data, and its quality, the ACT, the NT, Tasmania, WA and NZ may have even crossed the finish line, having reached 28 days with no reported community-acquired cases.
Is the elimination race worth winning? Or is it worth getting across the line to declare elimination - even if you are not the first?
Yes - probably. The advantages of elimination are no direct COVID-19 illnesses and deaths, and that your citizens can return to near-normal life - not entirely normal, because there would still be high vigilance required for an incursion whereby a traveller to your state brought the virus in with them. Surveillance systems would still be high, and apps turned on. But, in principle, your intra-state economy and social life could "snap back".
And then, if two or more states achieved elimination, and they trusted each other's surveillance and border controls, they could selectively open their borders to each other at little risk.
So what are the downsides? First, the effort of getting to elimination. But, as stated, many jurisdictions are close or may even have crossed the line. Second, you then presumably become isolated from the rest of the world that has not eliminated, restricting tourism and some trade. Third, you have put all your eggs in the vaccine exit strategy - if it fails to eventuate in a timely manner, you will be in for very long border control, or needing to switch to another strategy.
At this point in time, though, if elimination is in reach, one should reach out for it as most likely the best option.
And herein lies the conundrum. Throughout the whole pandemic, we have had the irony of many state premiers and chief medical officers talking elimination, and the Prime Minister and federal CMO talking suppression. That is, language such as "we need to learn to live with the virus".
Suppression involves accepting low levels of virus circulation and finding the balance in loosening up our physical-distancing restrictions to the equilibrium point where caseloads are manageable. This balancing act is the intended destination for most of the world, where elimination is simply not thought feasible due to porous borders and internal pressures to open up the economy.
In Australia, caught right in the middle of this are NSW and Victoria - the two states with continuing community transmission. They are well back in the home straight in our horse race - and, frankly, looking likely to pull up before the finish line. Moreover, while partially resisting nudges from Canberra, NSW and Victoria are still slowly opening up.
Premier Gladys Berejiklian announced on Friday that pubs and restaurants will be able to seat up to 50 patrons from June 1, an "important, critical, big step", but it would only be done with strict social-distancing measures in place.
If elimination of the virus from NSW is the goal, the strict social distancing will have to be very good - as opening up is otherwise inconsistent with eliminating the virus. That is, NSW and Victoria look likely to be heading into a suppression way of living - unless excellent contact-tracing can save the day, everyone starts wearing masks, or a partial lockdown is restored.
Let's cast our minds forward a month. It seems plausible (but as with anything in COVID-19, nothing is certain) that we could end up in a situation where NSW and Victoria are living in suppression land with low-level community transmission, but where all other states and territories (and NZ) have met the 95 per cent probability of having eliminated the virus, and are about to form a travel bubble that excludes NSW and Victoria.
Whoops. The two biggest parts of the Australasian economy excluded. This scenario is going to be extraordinarily difficult to manage politically. Should COVID-free states and territories accept travellers from NSW and Victoria? Could the ACT even control its land-locked border with NSW to prevent incursion? Or will the ACT just have to accept occasional incursions and move to join NSW in suppression-land?
Another scenario, if most states and territories and NZ do achieve elimination and borders are protected, is that NSW and Victoria may be forced back into lockdown in a valiant re-attempt at elimination so as to join the rest of Australasia. Or, conversely, all states and territories and NZ could accept the low-circulating suppression world and agree to let travellers in from NSW and Victoria. But states and territories could end up back at the starting line if the virus is reintroduced and not immediately stamped out.
These are challenging issues, politically fraught, and certainly not what the citizens of NSW and Victoria want to hear. But let's not forget, this conundrum that Australasia faces - along with possible future travel-bubble mate states in the Pacific and Asia - is a damn sight better than the likely second wave of the pandemic that most other countries may soon be experiencing.

‘I should’ve canned Grand Prix earlier’

Full text: COMMUNICATION Victoria’s Chief Health Officer has conceded he would make the call to shut down Melbourne’s Formula One Grand Prix earlier if he had his time over, saying occasion­al mistakes and mixed messages have been inevitable given the fast-moving nature of the coronavirus pandemic.
Brett Sutton said he stood by his decision to push hard for an early lockdown, citing the examples of countries overseas where tens of thousands of people have died.
The public health physician's comments in an interview with The Australian come after he was accused by state opposition MP Tim Smith last week of having “more positions than the Kama Sutra” on home-schooling, and of peddling “bullshit” in his defence of Victoria's bans on golf and solo fishing — which are at odds with all other jurisdictions.
While the requirement for Victorians to leave home only for four reasons — shopping for essentials, seeking medical attention, attending work or education, or exercising — have been clearly articulated and received strong community support, Professor Sutton and the Andrews government have been forced to reverse or clarify numerous more specific physical-distancing diktats.
Earlier this month, the CHO overturned a ban on couples who live apart visiting one another within 24 hours of issuing it, amid questions from Victoria Police about how it would be enforced.
Police also opted to withdraw a $1652 fine issued to a 17-year-old learner driver, despite Professor Sutton maintaining that learning to drive was not a legitimate reason­ to leave the house.
A tweet from him stating that it was permissible to “drive directly to a place of exercise if there’s nothing adjacent to your home” contradicted advice on Premier Daniel Andrews’s Facebook page, which said: “You should not be travelling to exercise.” Professor Sutton said he hoped his messaging had become clearer as the pandemic had progressed.
Asked whether some mixed messages were inevitable in such a fast-moving situation, Professor Sutton said: “Yeah, I think so.” “Every state and territory, certainly my counterparts, are all talking about the same issues,” he said. “They’ve needed to clarify stuff, the public health directions that they’re writing gets questioned, and a lot of it can’t be written­ down in fine detail.
“It has a context and there’s a kind of spirit to some of it, so to the extent that it can be clarified through me providing a follow-up message or a change in the directions or clearer legal language or, better, frequently asked questions that are available online, then we’ve done so.” Professor Sutton said “in retrospect”, he would have liked to have flagged his decision to shut down the Grand Prix earlier, rather than waiting until the morning of March 13, when the crowd was queuing to get in.
“Things were changing very rapidly in the world,’’ he said. ­“Europe went from dozens of cases in countries to hundreds in a matter of days, and it absolutely took off, and that changes your view of the travellers that had come to Australia for the Grand Prix and the likelihood of them having ­coronavirus without knowing it.
“In retrospect, I would have liked to have given more time so that the fans weren’t turned away at the door.
“I know that was really difficult for people, and I’m sure people would have been very angry about it, so if I could do it all again I would, but I’m very glad I provided the advice that I did in the end.” Professor Sutton said it was “no secret” that he was “keen that we went early” with physical-­distancing measures.
“I would only reinforce that all of the countries in the world at the moment who are looking successful went early — we’ve got one new case today rather than the US’s 30,000 new cases a day — and so I’m glad that as a nation we’ve gone early,” he said.
“You can’t avoid the hard lockdown of one kind or another, becaus­e almost every country in the world that has managed this has had to do that, and even the countries where it’s gotten away from them, they’ve gotten to a hard lockdown anyway.”
IN THE VIRAL HOT SEAT THE MISSES March 31 Victoria declared that ‘a person must not permit another person to enter their place of residence unless they are a fellow resident, have been directed to live there for self-isolation purposes, or are visiting for work, education, a private real estate inspection, medical or emergency reasons, or their entry is otherwise required by law’.
The rule blocked couples who live apart from seeing each other, and was quickly dubbed the bonk ban. Police Minister Lisa Neville and Premier Daniel Andrews backed the ban on the advice of Sutton. At 10am on April 1, Andrews declared: ‘That’s not work, that’s not care-giving, that’s not medical care, that’s not shopping for the things you need when you need them, and it does not comply with the rules. People should not do that.’ 4.57PM Chief Health Officer Brett Sutton backed down on Twitter: ‘Regarding Stay at Home rules: We have no desire to penalise individuals who are staying with or meeting their partners if they don’t usually reside together. We’ll be making an exemption.
Hope that helps.’ DRIVING TO EXERCISE APRIL 4 Q&A on Stage 3 restrictions on Andrews’s Facebook page: ‘Can I go hiking? No. If you don’t live near a mountain, the answer is no. You should not be travelling to exercise …’ APRIL 5 Sutton tweeted at 7:17pm: ‘Got out for a walk today. Chilly but beautiful.’ Asked where he was, he said: ‘Mountain Ash. Yarra Ranges.’ APRIL 6 Pia Akerman, former journalist with The Australian, tweeted at 6:55am: ‘Hi Brett, beautiful pic and a very well-deserved bit of downtime. I’d love to get out there too - but is a mountain walk permitted if it’s not my local neighborhood?’ SUTTON, 12:13PM ‘Yes, you can drive directly to a place of exercise if there’s nothing adjacent to your home.’ SUTTON, 3:39PM ‘P.S. This is next door to me. I walked there.’ GRAND PRIX The Andrews government fumbled the messaging, allowing thousands of fans to attend the first day of the F1 Grand Prix on March 12 and then failing to act to prevent many returning the next morning and queuing to enter the Albert Park course.
Confusion reigned and it wasn’t until drivers staged a walkout – in the wake of a positive case in one of the teams – that the government cancelled the event.
GOLF APRIL 2 Sutton, DHHS press release: ‘The threat of coronavirus to public health is real and everyone must take physical distancing seriously.
Unfortunately, this means no fishing, no hunting, no boating, no camping, and no golf. Hang up your rods, leave the tinnie in the driveway, and clean your clubs at home.’ APRIL 17 Herald Sun state political editor Shannon Deery tweeted at 4:34pm: ‘Breaking: Golf is not banned. The @VicGovDHHS has advised there is no specific prohibition on playing golf. Can be done with appropriate social distancing. However advice remains consistent, it’s not essential, so stay home.’ DEERY, 5:42PM ‘OK. Despite the @VicGovDHHS advising golf was allowed, government now say that was a blunder. @ VictorianCHO was CCd on the advice. Odd he didn’t flag the problem earlier. Gov says GOLF IS BANNED. It cannot be played in Victoria under any circumstance.’ SUTTON, 7:09PM ‘My view on golf? You can’t play it. There are only four reasons to leave home: food and supplies, medical care and caregiving, basic exercise, and work or education. There are limits on sport and certain recreational activities to protect us all.’ MIXED MESSAGES ON SCHOOLS APRIL 14 Chief Medical Officer Brendan Murphy to New Zealand parliament epidemic response committee: ‘We’re concerned our governments are keeping schools closed not from a health recommendation but almost because of parental fear and some reaction in local governments.’ APRIL 15 Sutton tweeted at 3:40pm: ‘My advice to the Victorian Government was and continues to be that to slow the spread of coronavirus, schools should undertake remote learning for term two. This is because having around a million children and their parents in closer contact with each other, teachers and other support staff has the potential to increase cases of coronavirus not just in schools but across the community. By having remote learning, it can contribute to physical distancing and therefore supports efforts to drive transmission down.’ SUTTON, FOLLOWING AHPPC MEETING, 7:41PM: ‘Schools are not “dangerous places” and parents should feel comfortable sending their kids to school - if they need to. But the mix of onsite & offsite learning supports better physical distancing overall, reducing risk as we drive new cases down. As risk changes, we’ll reassess’.
THE HITS MARCH 10 Sutton announces COVID-19 pandemic plan for the Victorian health sector, setting out four stages including containment, slowing the spread, responding to a severe outbreak and recovering.
MARCH 15 Andrews government announces the fast-tracking of elective surgery for up to 7000 Victorians, and the early commissioning of the new Casey Hospital to bring 140 beds online ahead of the peak of the pandemic. $10m is put forward to boost PPE supplies.
MARCH 16 State of Emergency declared, giving Sutton powers to enforce 14-day isolation requirements for all travellers entering Australia through Victoria and cancel mass gatherings of more than 500 people, as agreed at national cabinet the previous day.
MARCH 18 Indoor gatherings of more than 100 people are banned, as agreed at national cabinet.
MARCH 23 Stage one shutdown of ‘non-essential activity’, as agreed at national cabinet, includes closing pubs, clubs, casinos, gyms, places of worship and cinemas. Restaurants and cafes only open for takeaway.
Andrews government establishes 500-strong police taskforce to enforce the rules. MARCH 25 Stage two restrictions commence, as agreed at national cabinet. Gatherings of more than 10 people are banned. All non-urgent elective surgery is cancelled.
MARCH 28 Andrews government introduces on-the-spot fines of $1652 for individuals and $9913 for businesses that refuse or fail to comply with the Chief Health Officer’s directions.
MARCH 30 Stage three restrictions commence, following agreement from national cabinet. People are allowed to leave their homes only to shop for essential items, receive medical care, exercise or for work or education.
APRIL 3 Andrews government establishes eight-member crisis council of cabinet as the core decision-making forum for all matters relating to the pandemic.
APRIL 7 Andrews government announces ‘children who can learn from home, must learn from home’ when term two two starts the following week.
APRIL 12 Andrews government extends the coronavirus state of emergency for an additional month, to midnight on May 11.
APRIL 14 Testing is expanded to include anybody who has a fever or acute respiratory symptoms. Victoria now has 40 public screening clinics, plus pop-up GP testing clinics across the state.
APRIL 20 Andrews government releases Monash University, Doherty Institute and state health department modelling showing Victoria would have had up to58,000 COVID-19 cases a day and 650 deaths a day at the peak of the pandemic if staying at home and physical distancing requirements were not imposed.

Full text: Scientists are some way off unravelling the deadly mysteries of COVID-19
As doctors see more and more of COVID-19, they are getting a handle on what the coronavirus does to people. It hits seniors much harder than young adults; kills many more men than women; and is inexplicably gentle on children.
But the why of this is another matter.
Four months and more than two million cases worldwide into the pandemic, with deaths nearing 150,000, questions outweigh the few, hard-won answers gleaned from the hit-and-miss of patient care and preliminary lab studies.
A vaccine, the only sure way to stop the disease, is at least a year away and for all the optimism of the researchers nobody can be sure one will emerge. Several repurposed drugs show promise as treatments but they, too, have a long way to go before being proven. For now, Australians can take comfort that the stopgap of border closures, shutdowns and social restrictions are working better than just about anywhere else.
But as the clamps come off in the coming months — assuming the spread of infection continues to be controlled — understanding the ins and outs of the virus, its strengths and weaknesses, will become even more vital in the absence of a vaccine.
Take the best-known feature of COVID-19; lethality to the elderly. From the time the first cases were identified in the Chinese city of Wuhan in December last year, deaths skewed overwhelmingly to the over-70s. No surprise there. Sorry, boomer, but the healthiest septuagenarian still has the immune system of, well, a septuagenarian. What puzzled doctors and scientists were the ancillary outcomes. Babies, small children and pregnant women usually rank with the elderly as the most vulnerable in an epidemic. Yet from day one, COVID-19 largely spared them, as well as teenagers and to a lesser degree young adults. A study of 72,314 patient files in central China’s Hubei province, enfolding Wuhan, found that fewer than 10 per cent of those infected were under 30.
The gender disparity has proved to be even more mystifying. In Italy, men account for 60 per cent of cases and 70 per cent of all deaths, again weighted heavily to the grey and white-haired cohort. New York City counts 43 COVID-19 fatalities for every 100,000 men against 23 per 100,000 women, according to its health department.
Here, the story is much the same. Of Australia’s 65 fatalities to date, 39 have been men, just two of them aged under 60. Interestingly, the number of young women infected is considerably higher in the 20 to 30 age bracket — more than 750 to about 600 men — something that has epidemiologists thinking about smoking. Could it be the missing link?
At first glance, this makes sense. COVID-19 starts as an upper respiratory infection, the virus lodging in the throat and nasal passages, but in its severest form it settles in the lungs to choke oxygen supply, eventually damaging other organs. Men also have higher rates of hypertension, a related risk factor. If an individual has pre-existing pulmonary and/or cardiovascular problems arising from smoking, it stands to reason they would have a tougher time of it.
The theory gained early traction in China because the difference in smoking rates between the sexes there is striking: 61 per cent of men to barely 4.2 per cent of women, according to the World Health Organisation.
However, in wealthy Western societies the discrepancy is much less pronounced: 16.5 per cent of men and 11.1 per cent of women smoke daily in Australia. And here’s the problem when it comes to extrapolating the data to COVID-19: contrary to popular belief, the gender gap widens when it comes to young adults smoking. In 2018, men aged 18 to 24 led their female peers 17.5 per cent to 10.4 per cent in regularly using tobacco products, the Australian Bureau of Statistics reports. So smoking may be part of the jigsaw but it doesn’t solve the puzzle, not here anyway.
Katherine Gibney of the Peter Doherty Institute for Infection and Immunology in Melbourne, where epidemiologists are modelling the epidemic for the federal government, cautions against draw­ing conclusions off a thankfully low base of cases in this country. “Certainly in China it was bit easier to put it down to things like smoking because there was a big gender disparity in smoking there,” she says. “That is not the case in other countries. If you look at some studies of disease burden in Australia they do say there is more disease caused in men than women … but I don’t think there is one clear single reason.” The answer may lie in the immune system itself, how it works differently in men and women, coupled with other compounding factors. Gibney, an infectious diseases physician and medical epidemiologist, says this is apparent with several diseases. It may be that behaviour increases the exposure of men to a particular virus — as is the case with HIV.
Then there is tuberculosis. Men are twice as likely to catch that deadly lung disease because the genes on their lone X chromosome interact differently with the predatory mycobacterium than the double-X combination in women. This can also be a double-edged sword for women, making them more prone to auto-immune diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis and lupus when a hyper-immune response is triggered. Talk about swings and roundabouts. The thinking with COVID-19 is that a more robust immune reaction works for women, empowering their body’s defences to go after the pathogen.
“In very general terms, women’s immune systems may get on top of the disease more effectively than men,” Gibney says.
Another theory scientists are pursuing is that the receptor the coronavirus uses to bind to human cells — known as ACE2, for angiotensin converting enzyme 2 — is more prevalent in older people or shaped in a way that assists it, increasing the patient’s susceptibility. In severe illness, the virus seems to trigger an explosive immune over-response in which proteins called cytokines are rapidly released into the bloodstream, clogging the lungs and compromising other organs in a grim struggle for survival where the person’s odds are at best 50-50.
As for children, there is no explanation for why they generally experience milder symptoms or none at all, a feature of other diseases caused by coronaviruses, such as severe acute respiratory syndrome and Middle East respiratory syndrome. One theory holds that their immune systems, being less developed, don’t have the capacity to overreact and unleash a cytokine storm. Gibney says there is always the possibility that childhood vaccinations confer some cross-immunity to COVID-19. Even though children appear less likely to become dangerously sick, they aren’t insulated from the virus.
“They get the infection, but they don’t seem to be important to spreading it on to others and in most cases they don’t get severe disease,” Gibney says.
She points to another redeeming quality of the virus: its genetic stability. To date, there is no sign that it is as prone as influenza is to mutate, which would compound the already formidable challenge of developing a vaccine and therapeutics.
Perversely, Australia’s achieve­ment in “flattening the curve” of the pandemic serves to underline how dangerous COVID-19 is. With a mortality rate of less than 1 per cent here, it pales against the lethality of MERS, which kills more than a third of those struck by it.
But that’s not the number that counts in pandemic modelling. The R0 — pronounced R-nought — is the basic reproductive number used by epidemiologists to predict how many people will be infected when an epidemic takes hold. COVID-19’s R0 is 2.5. That means 10 carriers will infect 25 others, who will infect 62 more people and so on, increasing exponentially at nearly twice the rate of seasonal flu unless checked.
The good news is the shutdown of borders, workplaces and social activity in Australia has pushed the effective reproductive rate of the virus below 1, a manageable level. Lest we get carried away, Gibney says the danger is far from over. In one sense, COVID-19 would pose less of a collective threat if it killed more people sooner. Yes, it’s a bit to get the head around. But there’s no place for the human heart in these calculations, as Australians will learn in the coming months. “It almost seems like a perfect storm as a disease,” Gibney tells Inquirer.
“It’s reasonably infectious and it causes mild disease in most people, so most people are well enough to be out and about … doing their own thing and spreading it to more people. If it was more like SARS, it would actually be easier to contain … because the majority of people would be much sicker and they would not be going out and spreading it.“So what we have to learn to live with until a vaccine turns up … is that this virus is a very effective reproducer and very effective at infecting and spreading through communities. We can’t afford to underestimate it at any point.”

Lockdown easing in sight with 'epidemic in decline'

Full text: Social-distancing restrictions will be reviewed in less than four weeks following the release of new modelling that shows Australia is on track to eradicate the coronavirus.
The modelling suggests every 10 people infected in Australia are spreading the virus to five more people on average. At that level, the virus would eventually be unable to circulate and would die out within Australia.
Speaking after a meeting of the national cabinet yesterday, Prime Minister Scott Morrison said the state and federal governments had turned their attention to the "road out" of the COVID-19 response, rather than the "road in".
There were just two new cases of COVID-19 diagnosed in Victoria on Wednesday, taking the state's total to 1301, with the death toll unchanged at 14 lives lost and 1137 people having recovered.
Nationally, there were 19 more cases yesterday, bringing the number of confirmed diagnoses to 6468 by 4pm. The death toll stood at 63.
"Our epidemic is in decline," said Professor Jodie McVernon, director of Doherty Epidemiology, which led the team that built the model for the federal government. "But it does not let us be complacent. If we were to release those measures now ... those 10 cases today would produce 25 new cases over the course of their infection, not five."
The national cabinet will use the next four weeks to ensure the nation's health authorities are well placed to respond to a potential second wave of the virus before relaxing some of the protective measures that have closed down much of the economy.
The three federal conditions to begin rolling back measures include increased testing, the elevation of contact tracing to an "industrial level" and strong local response capabilities that would enable any hot spots to be locked down.
The Victorian government and its top medical advisers say any relaxation of the strict stage-three isolation measures is unlikely before May 11, the day the present state of emergency is due to end.
Victoria's Chief Health Officer, Brett Sutton, said continued low numbers of detected cases was making him optimistic that tougher stage-four restrictions could be avoided - if Victorians observe the current social-distancing rules.
Prime Minister Scott Morrison is preparing to develop new policies to "super charge" the Australian economy, driving down unemployment and fixing the federal budget.
After a phone hook-up with state premiers and chief ministers, the Prime Minister warned Australian life would not return to normal overnight.
"It's going to be step by step, there is going to be trial and error, it is completely uncharted territory ... no country in the world has worked this out yet," he said.
Only 3 per cent of Victorian public school students went to classrooms for the first day of term two on Wednesday, a figure Education Minister James Merlino says is proof parents have understood his government's message on schools.
Dr Sutton told a Melbourne City Council business summit yesterday he and his colleagues would need to be satisfied that the pandemic was truly under control - and enough testing was being done - before they recommended a return to class for students or the relaxation of other measures.
"Assuming that is the case and assuming that we have continued drive down in numbers, then I think that May 11 timeline would be appropriate for review and certainly some consideration of the lifting of existing restrictions," Dr Sutton said.
He said any decision about easing restrictions would be made by the national cabinet and the Victorian government's crisis cabinet. But there was no comfort for sports fans, with Dr Sutton saying the first round of relaxations would unlikely allow large gatherings.
The federal government is now considering how to get the post-virus economy growing, with Mr Morrison saying cabinet would look at "very pro-growth" policies.
Reserve Bank governor Philip Lowe and Treasury secretary Steven Kennedy both addressed the national cabinet yesterday, outlining the economic challenges facing the country.
"If you think we can grow the economy under the old settings then we need to think again," Mr Morrison said.
"They also highlighted ... that any sense of business as usual when it comes to the policy framework we had before the election will need to be reconsidered on the other side.
"It will be a different world on the other side of the virus and there will be many challenges."
The national COVID-19 economic taskforce boss, Nev Power, is expected to offer suggestions to boost the economy through new policies, including national building infrastructure and industrial relations reform.
The Prime Minister would not be drawn on what policy changes could be considered, but pointed to talks between the federal government and the states about fast-tracking infrastructure projects.
Chief Medical Officer Brendan Murphy said Australia "cannot afford to do relaxation" of social restrictions until the public health system was bolstered. He said more than half of Australia's confirmed COVID-19 cases had recovered but warned 42 patients remained in hospital on ventilators.
Yesterday, the government's debt agency sold another $13 billion in debt, taking federal debt beyond a record $600 billion.
The full economic fallout of the policies aimed at halting the spread of the coronavirus is now starting to filter through key data.
Unemployment edged up to 5.2 per cent in March, but the Australian Bureau of Statistics survey took place in the first half of the month, before major employers started laying off staff in response to social-distancing restrictions.

Full text: Historic spending to get us through the crisis has bolstered confidence, but voters deserve to know the health objective.
The verdict from one of Canberra's medical experts was direct this week when police in Sydney and Melbourne started warning Australians to leave their local parks and stay indoors.
Peter Collignon, an infectious diseases physician and a professor at the Australian National University, said the state decisions on hard lockdowns looked like "panic by politicians" rather than science.
His advice? Collignon said there was no good reason, other than official quarantine, to prevent someone going outside for fresh air, including exercise, provided they were not in groups and kept two metres away from each other.
It seemed like another small argument over the scale of the social-distancing rules, much like the hamfisted way the Victorian government told single people they could not visit their partners and then reversed the directive hours later. But there is a broader issue at stake in these disputes because the science suggests the shutdowns will last longer than expected. Much longer.
On some projections, the cycle of closing and reopening services will last until next year. Tony Blakely, an epidemiologist and a professor at the University of Melbourne, says the current approach could continue into 2021 in the hope a vaccine arrives.
This does not mean the shutdowns are failing. In fact, the consensus from the experts is that the first ones have worked well and the later ones will have an impact on case numbers over the next 10 days or so. It means confidence in the combined government response to the pandemic has never been more important. What is the endgame?
Is it herd immunity, eradication or a long hibernation until the vaccine comes? What is the strategy to get there?
Confidence is easy to claim but hard to achieve when only 30 per cent of the community trusts the federal government "to do the right thing for the Australian people" - a finding in the annual Scanlon Foundation social cohesion report last November.
So our political leaders will have to change the way they are managing this crisis. We will need more transparency and better governance.
The great boost to confidence this week was the $130 billion wage subsidy from Scott Morrison and Josh Frydenberg. The assistance is broad and the design is simple. No scheme will be perfect in an emergency but employers and unions are backing this one.
As someone on the Labor side of politics put it: "It's a gutsy call." This was said with admiration and an f-bomb. The package shows the Prime Minister and Treasurer are going as far as possible to save jobs.
Another boost to confidence came yesterday when Morrison promised free childcare for workers who can stay in their jobs through the slump. More help is due today for renters and landlords.
But what of confidence in the strategy to end the pandemic that has caused this economic havoc? The fundamental dynamic, as Morrison says, is that the health and economic objectives work against each other. The tougher the action to protect health, the greater the damage to the economy.
But there is another truth. Any action to protect the economy means nothing if governments fail on health. The blunder with the Ruby Princess is a reminder that everything depends on the decisions on health.
Would the shutdowns be different if we did not have 400 coronavirus cases from that ship? Ministers, officials and cruise company executives have to be held accountable for that failure, but that cannot happen if parliaments are suspended for months.
Blakely thinks the current health measures are doing more than flattening the curve to slow the spread of the virus. He says they are "squashing the curve". But he cannot be sure of the final objective. While he believes it is too late for Australia to eradicate the virus, he says "herd immunity" remains a possible outcome - that is, the infection reaches 60 per cent of the population and the country becomes resistant to its spread.
The alternative? "Australia could continue squashing the curve for months and months till sometime in 2021, with a muted epidemic or two along the way, until a vaccine is available," he says.
The number of beds in the intensive care units becomes the key benchmark on which to adjust everything else. Greater capacity not only brings better healthcare but also greater flexibility on shutdowns and the economy.
Senior federal government figures regard herd immunity as "unconscionable" if it means letting the infection rip. Their approach appears to be to suppress the infection for as long as possible in the hope of a vaccine. Can Australians trust this strategy? This question is totally different to one about confidence in the $130 billion wage subsidy, which is easier to measure.
Australians deserve to have the health objective articulated and subject to real scrutiny, with at least two changes. First, Federal Parliament - after it resumes on Wednesday to vote on the economic plan - should have a continuing role in testing the health strategy.
The British Parliament has a committee that has heard testimony from health officials during the crisis. Australia can surely do the same.
Second, state and federal governments need to release their modelling on the pandemic. The Commonwealth's deputy chief medical officer, Paul Kelly, suggested on Tuesday he would do so this week. On Wednesday he backtracked. Voters should be able to see the information.
Morrison and his government have done much this week to shore up confidence. But why stop there?

Full text: For the foreseeable future, Australians must get used to a new way of life
Limited community transmission of coronavirus has begun in northwest Sydney and health authorities are preparing for clusters of transmission around the country. So what lies ahead for Australia, how severely will the coronavirus pandemic hit our health systems, how many people will be infected and how long will the epidemic go on?
There are many unknowns that will impact how easily coronavirus will spread and how many are likely­ to die. The pandemic won’t be endless, however. It will peak, probably sometime during winter, and then begin to decline. But the actions governments and indiv­iduals take now have the potential to significantly influence the size of the peak and the duration of the outbreak.
The aim of authorities is to “flatten the curve” of disease outbreak­ to allow health systems to prepare and hospitals to cope.
If transmission is steep and wide, intensive care units’ capacity will be overwhelmed and there is the real possibility that doctors will have to make agonising decisions about whose lives to save.
Most experts are optimistic that Australia will be able to keep transmissions of COVID-19 to the low end of projections. But even the best-case scenario is grim: NSW’s Chief Health Officer predicted­ this week that 1.5 million people, or 20 per cent of the state’s population, will be infected. At a death rate of 1 per cent, that would mean 15,000 dead in NSW alone.
“You will have a peak and then you will have a decay of the epidemic,” says Australian National University professor Shane Thomas.
“It decays either because everyone’s infected and there’s no one left to infect, or you have control­ measures. So governments and people can in fact alter the risk associate­d with this.
“Country-based mitigation mea­sures will affect the epidemic.” A paper published in The Lancet­ this week canvassed the options available to governments in limiting the spread of the virus. “What has happened in China shows that quarantine, social distancin­g, and isolation of infected populations can contain the epidemic,” the paper says.
“Singapore and Hong Kong … provide hope and many lessons to other countries. In both places, COVID-19 has been managed well to date, despite early cases, by early government action and through social distancing measures taken by individuals.” The options available to ­governments and individuals to slow the spread of COVID-19 are quarantining infected and at-risk people, stopping mass gatherings, the closure of educational institutes or places of work where infection has been identified, and isolation of households, towns or cities.
“School closure … is unlikely to be effective given the apparent low rate of infection among children, although data are scarce,” the Lancet­ paper says. “Avoiding large gatherings of people will reduce the number of super-spreading events; however, if prolonged contact is required for transmission, this measure might only reduce a small proportion of transmissions.
“Therefore, broader-scale social distancing is likely to be needed, as was put in place in China. This measure prevents transmission from symptomatic and non-symptomatic cases, hence flatten­ing the epidemic and pushing the peak further into the future.
“Broader-scale social distancing provides time for the health services to treat cases and increase capacity, and, in the longer term, for vaccines and treatments to be developed.” That means that to reduce the spread of disease in Australia, cancellin­g mass gatherings may not be enough. To really have an impact, governments would have to lock down whole cities or limit the movement of people to within their suburbs, as in China and Italy.
It’s hard to imagine that happenin­g here, Thomas says. “I don’t think we’ll get to that,” he says. “We don’t have a legal or ­political system that would readily allow for that kind of arrangement. And I don’t think it will become necessary.” Modelling has predicted a wide range of scenarios in terms of the proportion of people likely to be infected in Australia. The models say that figure could be anywhere between 25 per cent and 70 per cent of the population. The head of the biosecurity program at the University of NSW’s Kirby Instit­ute, Raina MacIntyre, expects the infection rate to be at the lower end of the projections. But even the low end of projections would see about six million Australian infecte­d.
Most — an estimated four in five — will experience a mild respir­atory illness and will be able to recover at home. Fever, cough, shortness of breath and muscle aches are common symptoms. The elderly are the most vulnerable, with the death rate climbing to as high as 15 per cent among those aged over 80.
“I think the proportion of the population infected will be a fairly low proportion because of all the measures that we’re taking,” MacIntyre says.
Those measures include rigorous contact tracing and wide travel bans. “I think if we continue with the measures that we’ve been imple­menting, we should be able to limit the spread. But it is an epidemic disease, so it will increase exponentially in size. The doubling time of the epidemi­c has been estimated to be six days.
“That means next week we might have 250 cases and the week after we might have 500 and the week after we might have 1000.
“In some modelling that we did, which is not published yet, the peak may be at about 80 to 100 days from the start in Australia, so it could be around June.
“But if we implement a lot more social-distancing measures it could be a lot later and there could be more than one peak as well.” Despite the focus on social distancin­g and contact tracing, Thomas says one of the biggest interventions we can make in limiting the spread of disease is also the simplest: thorough handwashing.
“What we’re trying to do is to minimise the number of cases so that later we will have a vaccine where we can actually prevent cases occurring,” Thomas says.
“But right now, a public health education campaign is really importa­nt and urgent. Messages like ‘wash your hands’ actually is not enough.
“It needs to be wash your hands for 30 seconds. Ten seconds is hopeless, and that’s what most people do, that doesn’t take much virus away at all. Twenty seconds is better than 10, but with 30 seconds of washing, any virus on your hands will be pretty much gone.
“Saying wash your hands for 30 seconds may seem like a trivial thing, but actually telling the population how to do those basic kind of hygiene things can drama­tically reduce transmission and subsequent rates of infection.” The government has committed $30m to a national commun­ication campaign on coronavirus as part of its COVID-19 package.
In the meantime, cancellation of mass events in the near future is all but certain, says the director of the Doherty Instit­ute for Infection and Immunity Sharon Lewin. “Governments don’t do these things lightly,” Lewin says. “They come at enormous inconvenience to everyone and cost.
“Social-distancing measures used to be quite controversial, and it was unclear that they really worked. But in Wuhan and Hubei, it definitely worked.
“I think what the overall policy is aiming to do is to flatten the peak. And if we do that, we will continue to get new cases but we won’t get a massive increase in cases — that’s the hardest thing to deal with.” The ANU’s Thomas predicts the next few months will be some of the most extraordinary times we’ve seen in living memory, and people need to prepare for the idea that the way they live their lives may be temporarily different. That means staying at home more often and curtailing travel.“I’m not telling people what to do. They need to determine their own appetite for risk,” he says. “But I am making bookings in November. That’s my personal view.”
