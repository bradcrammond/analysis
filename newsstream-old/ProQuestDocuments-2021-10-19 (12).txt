Full text: THE battle of the borders has reached new extremes amid accusations of extortion, unfairness and politicians “desperate for a fight”.
Prime Minister Scott Morrison accused the Queensland government of extortion after the Premier linked the state border reopening to getting more hospital funding.
But Health Minister Yvette D’Ath said Queensland was being unfairly targeted as other states had made the same request for funds, and the state needed the money for the hospitals to cope with a surge in cases in the event of a Delta-strain outbreak.
It is despite assurances being made to the Commonwealth, and at a press conference on Sunday, that Queensland’s hospital system was ready.
Federal Health secretary Brendan Murphy said all states and territories had been working with the commonwealth on capacity plans for once the country starts to open up.
He said the states “all feel comfortable that they have well advanced plans to deal with the predicted modelled Covid that will occur in the national plan from the Doherty modelling”.
“Essentially what it’s showing, using the Doherty modelling of the 70 and 80 per cent fully vaccinated rates with various scenarios and the states and territories predicted hospital demand, it’s showing that we can cope with the predicted demand on our health system,” Dr Murphy said.
Mr Morrison on Tuesday morning described the Queensland government linking its reopening of the borders to federal hospital funding as “ransom and to seek to extort from them money on the basis of Covid”.
“I mean to suggest that they’re not going to open the borders unless I send them cash – how else would you like me to call it,” Mr Morrison told the Today show.
When asked to respond to the Prime Minister’s claims, Premier Annastacia Palaszczuk (pictured) said: “I don’t believe that no, not at all.
“These are pressures that are being felt right around the country. We want to make sure that our hospitals are getting ready.”Federal Health Minister Greg Hunt said there was already an ongoing, uncapped 50-50 split of all Covid-related hospital expenses between Canberra and the states plus the private hospital guarantee, which provides more beds and nurses to deal with a surge.
“You get the feeling sometimes that people are desperate for a fight. They cannot complain about vaccines. So now they’re trying to create a diversion,” he said.
“Right now, the focus of the Queensland government shouldn’t be about fighting, but it should be encouraging people to say now’s the ­moment to come forward to be vaccinated.” Ms D’Ath said Mr Morrison was targeting Queensland despite every state and territory leader signing the three letters calling for extra support. “This isn’t just about Queensland,” she said.

Event organisers welcome pass plan

Full text: A leading expert says it would be "extremely irresponsible" to move ahead with mass gatherings and events before vaccine certificates are introduced.
Dr Siouxsie Wiles said the last thing New Zealand needed was a super-spreader event, particularly when less than half of the eligible population had been fully vaccinated.
This comes after Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern announced plans yesterday for a vaccine certificate system that could be operational by November. She said the Government was looking to mandate its use for large festivals, but not for essential services such as medical facilities and supermarkets.
The certificate would be stored on a cellphone or printed, but will come too late for many events planned over the next six weeks including the Christchurch Cup & Show Week, November 8-14.
But even for parts of the country that are in alert level 2, allowing large festivals to go ahead before the vaccine certificate system is in place would be too risky, said Wiles.
The Auckland border was not impenetrable, said Wiles.
"The only way to safely have the South Island at alert level 1 is for it to be entirely cut off from the North Island and that seems unlikely to happen."
Wiles also questioned how South Island hospitals would cope if they were put into the same positions as Auckland hospitals where extra healthcare workers were required to deal with the large influx of cases at the beginning of the outbreak.
Covid-19 modelling expert Professor Michael Plank said he believed it was unlikely that large gatherings or events would be held in areas currently in level 2 before Christmas.
"We need to be prepared for the fact that the Covid-19 situation will get worse rather than better."
Addington Raceway chief executive Brian Thompson said he was planning for Cup & Show Week to take place under level 2 restrictions in mid-November. The event would have races, but only a small crowd of racing industry workers.
Disappointed the vaccine certificate would not be implemented sooner, Thompson said he would make a decision by October 19 on how the event would operate.
"We need to make decisions in the next couple of weeks. We can't afford to wait any longer."
Canterbury A&P Association general manager Tracy Ahern said the vaccine certificate was a "wonderful initiative" but "probably too late" for the show.
Ahern said they would make a call on whether the show would go ahead after Monday's announcement on pandemic control levels, saying the event could be "reimagined" under level 2 restrictions.
Word Christchurch Festival co- director Rachael King said the mid-November event would go ahead as planned, while New Zealand Film Festival trust chair Catherine Fitzgerald said they were working out how their October and November nationwide event might still operate.
However, other festival organisers have welcomed plans for a vaccine certificate, saying it gives them certainty to plan major events this summer.
Team Event director Callam Mitchell, who runs five major events in Christchurch including Electric Avenue in February, said the certificate system meant they could plan events with confidence.
"We encourage everyone who wants to attend events this summer to get vaccinated as soon as possible, bearing in mind it's an eight-week period between doses and the vaccine becoming effective."
Rhythm and Vines Music Festival director Hamish Pinkham said the vaccine certificate was good news for promoters and would give him the clarity he needed to run the December event.
Bay Dreams director Mitch Lowe, who runs two events set for early January in Nelson and Tauranga, also welcomed the vaccine certificate.
"It makes sense that we follow the overseas success in this area," he said.

Fear over cancer, cardiac deaths

Full text: EMERGENCY doctors are fearing a rise in cancer and cardiac deaths if Victoria’s hospital system is soon overrun with Covid-19 cases.
Without improved monitoring of emergency presentations and deaths, researchers warn the impact on the health system will be far greater than scenarios presented in modelling governments are basing reopening road maps on.
In a new paper, Melbourne emergency doctors and researchers from Monash University flag concerns a flood of cases following the end of lockdowns combined with staff shortages will see the ambulance and hospital emergency system quickly overrun.
Because the Doherty Institute modelling only focuses on ventilation in ICU and deaths in the next six months – but fails to account for a predicted demand on the emergency care system – the team led by Monash’s Dr Rob Mitchell believes the wider impact on other severe conditions has been overlooked. “If the health system becomes overwhelmed, the number of preventable deaths may increase dramatically,” the authors wrote.
“Cancer deaths will go up. Cardiac arrest survival will go down. Patients requiring a high level of support for respiratory or cardiovascular disease will not receive treatment quickly.
“Cross infections will occur between patients because of inadequate clinical spaces, and overburdened staff may not have capacity to ensure optimal infection control.” Senior intensive care physicians have also revealed concerns the wider impacts of allowing high numbers of critically ill Covid patients have not been fully appreciated.
Covid patients spend an average of 16 days in ICU, compared to three days for those with other life-threatening conditions, such as recovering from cardiac or cancer surgery.
Therefore, if the hospital system reaches a critical mass of Covid patients the number left untreated or even dying from other serious conditions may multiply.
When Victoria’s Covid restrictions were eased in April-June 2021 hospital emergency departments were flooded with an extra 122,148 patients than they saw a year earlier.
In their analysis inEmergency Medicine Australasia, Dr Mitchell and colleagues Peter Cameron, Gerard O’Reilly and Biswadav Mitra said the reopening of Australia after reaching 70 and 80 per cent vaccination was likely to see a much greater surge in cases.
They warned death rates must be monitored and interpreted closely so the health system can react to any trends.
They called for a national registry tracking emergency demand and outcomes to provide a real time indication of where pressure was building, and where help was needed – similar to surveillance that already occurs in ICU.
It was also critical to measure the delays to care in high-risk groups such as patients with stroke, trauma and coronary syndromes to determine if they were slipping though the cracks caused by Covid, the doctors wrote.
It comes as a survey of more than 1000 essential workers has revealed that 30 per cent of emergency services employees and 20 per cent in healthcare are considering changing their job because of the pandemic.
In Victoria, 79 per cent of essential workers are finding it harder to cope with the pandemic this year than last.
The survey was conducted by independent research company Insightfully in mid-September for Hiver, a new essential workers’ digital bank.
Carolyn Murphy, of Hiver, said: “The people who face up to the very personal impacts of COVID-19 on a daily basis are telling us they are nearing breaking point.” At Friday’s national cabinet meeting, the medical expert panel will unveil its recommendation to make the jab mandatory for all healthcare workers. Under Victorian rules, healthcare workers are already required to have had at least one dose by October 15, and to be fully vaccinated by December 15.

Nurses have 'nervous anticipation' over borders reopening

Full text: Tasmanian nurses are expressing "nervous anticipation" over the potential for state borders to reopen in the coming months allowing COVID to re-enter the state, their union says.
The Australian Nurses and Midwifery Federation Tasmania reports that adequate staffing of intensive care units was among the main concerns, along with being provided support to implement COVID plans.
The Tasmanian Government has set a target of 90 per cent double-dose vaccination by December 1 when borders could be considered to reopen, although Prime Minister Scott Morrison maintains that states have a duty to reopen at 80 per cent - an assertion rejected by Premier Peter Gutwein.
It means COVID could re-enter Tasmania in December or January.
ANMF Tasmania president Emily Shepherd said nurses were understandably nervous about the heightened threat of COVID entering hospitals.
"There's nervous anticipation around our membership over borders reopening," she said.

"We appreciate we are on a path as a country to reopening borders, now with significant vaccination rates we need to look at how we can move forward to live with COVID.
"We might achieve 90 per cent vaccination, but there's still 10 per cent of our population that are at risk, and the reality is that some of those individuals will be infected, and we know that some of those will become unwell and require ICU.
"There's a heightening of that awareness, and the need to put in place protocols and procedures."
On Wednesday, Premier Peter Gutwein said Doherty Institute modelling - when applied to Tasmania on a per capita basis - shows the state could have 14,900 cases, 590 hospitalisations and almost 100 deaths if borders reopened at current vaccination levels.
Tasmania-specific modelling from the Garvan Institute is expected to be released in mid-October.
Earlier this month, the Health Department detailed Tasmania's capacity for 60 ICU beds that can be scaled up to 80, and 267 ventilators with an agreement with the Commonwealth for 100 more if required.
Speaking in Hobart, Labor health spokesperson Mark Butler said staffing, elective surgery waiting lists and emergency department demand have been long-standing issues in Tasmania's health system.
"It's all well and good to have enough machines, enough ventilators, the critical question is what are the staffing arrangements?" he said.
"What has the Tasmanian Government been doing over the last many months to prepare for this moment to make sure that, not only are there the machines, but there are the properly trained in critical care nurses and doctors ready to staff those machines."
Health Department secretary Kathrine Morgan-Wicks said authorities would constantly monitor risks to the capacity of hospitals during the reopening phase.
"For me, it is about can we cope with COVID, or cases, as they are popping up now potentially for the community? Yes, we can. If it's COVID at such serious levels without any kind of restrictions, that's when we have to make choices about our hospital systems and the health services that we are able to safely operate," she said.

Full text: Comment
That long anticipated day when NSW re-opens from its COVID hibernation is drawing closer. But is our health system ready for it?
It will begin with some eased restrictions on the Monday after the state hits 70 per cent double vaccinations.
Even greater freedoms can be expected when that double vaccination rate hits 80 per cent.
The state-wide road map to re-opening is based on modelling by the Doherty Institute, and that first target is shaping up to be mid-October. That's less than a month away.
While at first glance the promise of more freedoms seems like a positive, the big question is 'are our rural, regional and remote communities ready?' More specifically 'is our health system ready?'
How will our health professionals cope with an anticipated increase in patients, in particular COVID-affected patients requiring isolation, and possibly intensive care and ventilation?
The Doherty report notes that "even high levels of vaccination will not be sufficient to stop COVID-19 in its tracks".
The health landscape has changed forever because of this pandemic. And that impacts every one of us.
Many would argue that our health system has been in poor health for quite some time - well before the threat of COVID added significantly to the expectations and burden on our frontline workers such as doctors, nurses and paramedics.
Submissions and witness testimony to a State parliamentary inquiry that began in September last year paint a picture of an already chronically ill system.
Health Services Union NSW Secretary, Gerard Hayes, has been quite clear about his concern that our regional and rural health care services are not prepared for what lies ahead.
"I'm not saying this to be obtuse, but what we have seen over the past decade has been a system tightening its belt constantly and working to be as lean as possible," Mr Hayes said.
Sure there have been millions of dollars allocated to hospital upgrades across the state in recent years, including new Eurobodalla Regional Hospital, but this is all window dressing. More skilled health specialists on the ground are what is really needed.
What good are extra beds in an upgraded hospital if there are not enough staff to adequately support the patients that may occupy those beds?
It is apparent that the powers-that-be have belatedly realised this fact with a recent call out to retired health staff to return to the fold. Quite frankly this may well be too little to late. Our health service should never have been allowed to get to this depleted state.
Dr Debra King, North Coast representative on the Royal Australian College of General Practitioners NSW board fears an increase in general practitioners getting burnt out with the increased workload.
"Our workforce doesn't go up, we just work longer hours," she said.
Meanwhile, our paramedics are being pushed beyond the limit to transport seriously ill COVID patients to a hospital equipped for suitable treatment and isolation. This is on top of a the normal workload typical of a pre-COVID environment.
Burn out among health professionals, pushed beyond the limit to provide care for patients, could well be our next health disaster. We don't have a vaccine for that.
We do have them for COVID-19, though. Ready or not, we must move out of the lockdown phase of the pandemic.
High vaccination rates are key to minimising harm as we do so. So too is an adequately resourced and funded health system.
It is well past time regional, rural and remote NSW had one.

Full text: VACCINATION ROLLOUT: SPECIAL REPORT As co-ordinator general of Operation Covid Shield, I am constantly talking to people from around the country and from all walks of life to ensure our vaccine rollout program is as effective as possible.
It’s always interesting to hear what motivated a particular person to get vaccinated, or if they haven’t yet had the jab, what would encourage them to get vaccinated.
There is a very clear theme to people’s motivation. For people in lockdowns (or who have had to live through them), it’s about getting our freedoms back on a permanent basis so we can return to the way of life we enjoyed before the pandemic struck.
It’s simple things like being able to go out for dinner, instead of getting takeaway.
Or going to the hairdresser again. Or a mate’s place for a barbecue. Or perhaps the footy. Or swinging a golf club.
Or seeing a family member we haven’t been able to see for months. Or getting kids back to school – in part, so they can see their friends.
Of course, it’s also bigger things like having the certainty to plan a wedding without fearing it may have to be postponed – yet again!
For others, who are older or who have medical conditions, the motivation might be self-protection: preventing severe Covid-19, which can be a devastating and fatal illness.
I understand all of these motivating factors and it just underscores why it is so important for everyone who is eligible to get vaccinated.
For me, I am looking forward to spending time with my family and friends, knowing that I am protecting them and myself against Covid-19 by being double-dosed.
The good news is that we are setting new vaccination records almost every day – and I really think the day when we can start to ease restrictions is in sight.
The Doherty Institute modelling has shown if we can hit the 70 and 80 per cent double-dose vaccination marks nationwide, and in every state and territory, we can start to open up the country with less likelihood of us having to go back into lockdowns.
As of Thursday, our first-dose nationwide vaccination rate was 74 per cent, and for second doses, it was 49 per cent.
More than 25.7 million vaccine doses had been administered across the country. We know that more than 80 per cent of Australians are either vaccinated or have indicated an intention to get vaccinated – and the current weekly numbers back that in.
Very importantly, we are protecting the health of our most vulnerable Australians.
More than 93 per cent of Australians aged 70 and over have had a first dose, and more than 75 per cent have had a second dose.
Every residential aged-care facility, nationwide, has had both first and second vaccination clinics visit to protect our senior Australians.
We are also implementing a plan to significantly accelerate the rate Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Australians are vaccinated to match – or achieve rates even higher than – the wider population when we start to hit the 70 and 80 per cent coverages rates across the country.
We now have three vaccines approved for use in Australia: Pfizer, AstraZeneca, and Moderna.
All three are highly effective at reducing the risk of severe illness and death from Covid-19 and all are effective in reducing transmission of the virus.
All three have been approved for use by our medicines regulator, the Therapeutic Goods Administration (TGA), and have been – and will continue to be – incorporated into our rollout program on the advice of the Australian Technical Advisory Group on Immunisation (ATAGI).
Our experts at the TGA and ATAGI are world class – and so you can be absolutely reassured the vaccine you are offered has been rigorously assessed for its safety and effectiveness.
An important part of the vaccine rollout is to protect Australian children, and the TGA and ATAGI have approved the use of the Pfizer and Moderna vaccines for Australians aged 12 and over.
Getting a jab is now even more convenient with Moderna being rolled out through pharmacies across Australia.
Everyone who gets vaccinated is not only protecting themselves, but also their family, friends and community.
Everyone who gets vaccinated also gets us that little bit closer to the 70 per cent mark, and then the 80 per cent mark, to enable us to safely reopen our country.
Australia has a very proud history of vaccination – from our world-leading immunisation rates for children, to ensuring our country is free of awful infectious diseases such as polio.
I encourage every eligible Australian who is not yet vaccinated against the coronavirus to continue this tradition by rolling up their sleeve to get a Covid-19 jab. Lieutenant General John Frewen is co-ordinator general of Operation Covid Shield.

The Doherty model only assumes a case load of around 30 a day in the community, not thousands. The modelling also only uses a framework of vaccination of 18 years and older, not 12-15 year olds or younger. So of course restrictions are going to be maintained. Double vaxxed people need to be allowed greater freedom, to show verification of vaccination, and be allowed to go out, travel, etc. Peter McFee

It makes sense when you look at it all. Yes we would prefer to have everything back to normal but in reality that is not the case. It makes common sense that all business should be about protecting customers as well as the staff they employ .. and it is legal for an employer to protect them while doing so.. as for rights it has always been an employers right to hire those with the right experience and the attitudes they seek no matter how hard one searches the internet to find reasons other wise. It is legal Ken Cowling

Full text: Rebecca Kelly's son Ryan, 10, has Down syndrome and is medically complex, so if he was to catch COVID there is a chance he will die.
Trevallyn-based Dr Kelly, who is the Down Syndrome Tasmania president and a parent advocate on the National Disability COVID Advisory Committee, has an ever-present concern about the devastation the National Plan's vaccination targets could reap on her family.
With the state surging towards opening the state up to the rest of Australia as vaccination rates close in on 70, 80 and 90 per cent, she believes important discussions need to take place to protect a community she said had been neglected so far by the vaccine rollout.
"We'll go from a COVID free state to opening up at 80 per cent ... the consequence of that decision is COVID will mostly impact vulnerable people," she said. "There needs to be better evidence that this community has been thought about."
The vaccination rollout focused on 1a and 1b communities targeted NDIS participants and providers, but Dr Kelly said there were a number of people in the disability community who sought out private providers and had missed out on vaccination accessibility.
Dr Kelly said examples from the mainland where a small percentage of children were being hospitalised with the Delta strain of COVID laid bare what could happen in Tasmania.
Ryan's disability and co-morbidities leave him as one of the more vulnerable people in Tasmania, a place where he has been able to play sport, go to school, and generally go about his life as normal.
Dr Kelly said with the looming changes to the state's COVID approach, she was considering how his life would change, and whether he might need to pull him out of school, and even remove her other children from schooling as well.
Dr Kelly's perspective is nuanced. Not only is she the doting mother of her son and an advocate for people with Down syndrome to varying levels of government, but she is also a mathematician and has a developed understanding of the Doherty Institute's modelling upon which the vaccination rate goal is based on.
"I know how this modelling works, and I know that it's nonsense," she said.
"I'm really concerned about the under-12 age group. There have been outbreaks in schools, Ryan has a six-year-old sister, if she brought COVID home, there's a good chance he'll die. For kids with disability, this will just be furthering the disadvantage they've already faced. It's just another place where they are being held back."
Premier Peter Gutwein was contacted and asked how the government was working to protect the disability community. He was also asked if he would advocate National Cabinet to ensure the disability community in Tasmania was adequately protected.
A government spokesperson said the vaccination process was continuing.
"Tasmanians over 16 years and living with disability or underlying medical conditions, as well as carers and support workers of people with disability, are being prioritised by the Tasmanian government to receive the COVID-19 vaccination," they said. "The Commonwealth rollout in disability residential settings with two or more residents is underway in Tasmania."
A Health Department spokesman said the disability community was not being left out. "We have been committed to providing accessible vaccination opportunities to Tasmanian NDIS participants from the outset of the vaccination program," he said. "We have worked in close partnership with state and federal government departments, the National Disability Service, NDIS providers, and third sector organisations to ensure NDIS participants have had specialised access to COVID-19 vaccination."
Dr Kelly's concern was one echoed by much of the disability and group care sector, an area in which there is a high volume of interaction with people with disability.
St. Giles chief executive Andrew Billings said the organisation was "alert, concerned, and planning for" the state to open up, and COVID cases to start emerging.
"One thing though, from a Tasmanian perspective, is we are able to observe the lessons interstate, and we have a strong vaccination rate," he said. He said St. Giles had been proactive about encouraging staff to become fully vaccinated and had provided a vaccination hub at its workplaces across the state to boost vaccination numbers for workers.
Mr Billings said at least 60 per cent of the workforce was fully vaccinated, and more than 80 per cent of participants had had both doses.
Fellow disability care provider Li-Ve Tasmania maintained similar levels of vaccination coverage as St. Giles.
Operations general manager Nicole Cumine said staff of Li-Ve were almost 60 per cent fully vaccinated, while client rates were about 90 per cent. She said the organisation supported mandatory vaccination to be rolled out in the disability care sector.
Ms Cumine said the concern was obvious throughout the disability community. "Where you see angst is opening up to possible high levels of infection, how does that actually look for us?" she said.

Full text: WE’RE Labor’s lockdown losers, spending more time imprisoned in our homes than people from anywhere else in the world.
Catastrophising health bureaucrats and construction unions are running this state.
Instead of listening to the people, Premier Daniel Andrews is only getting advice from CHO Brett Sutton. The only other group that appears to have any power is construction workers. Unlike schools, which are the first to close and the last to open, construction sites have been open throughout the pandemic.
When cases in the building industry rose, workers were given Covid marshals, shift bubbles, staggered start and finish and now mandatory vaccination. What did school kids get from the road map? Another month mostly studying from home after 20 months of mostly studying from home.
If schools were treated like construction sites, one quarter of students would be back on campus right now. By October 26 half of the state’s one million school students would be back and by November 5 all of them.
Schools are highly regulated, teachers are keen to get vaccinated and students follow the rules, and yet they continue to be the forgotten underclass. Compare this to construction workers responsible for more outbreaks than any other sector who brawled outside their union headquarters on Monday, outraged at being told they had to get vaccinated. They pelted their union boss with crates and water bottles and chanted the pro-choice slogan “my body, my choice” as part of their brutal, illegal protest.
A few days ago, construction workers walked off work sites and held up traffic after they were told they couldn’t use break rooms because they were key superspreader sites. They didn’t care that tea and break rooms have been closed at most work sites – including hospitals and health care services – for 18 months now.
Even rule-abiding, double-dosed Victorians are getting diddly squat from Dictator Dan. Reaching 80 per cent one dose means we can only shop once a day and must be home safely by 9pm tucked up with our teddies. Then when we reach 70 per cent double dose – which is still more than one month away – we get to leave home without having permission from Daddy Dan.
But there’s still a 25km travel limit and we can only meet others and shop outside.
Where’s the incentive to get the reluctant anti-vaxxers over the line when the best you get after 250 days of lockdown is laneway shopping and fitness classes in the park?
People in NSW at the same point will be able to socialise freely, go to the pub and go to the races with 5000 others. Even once we hit 80 per cent double vaccination, we will still be subject to some of the most draconian rules anywhere. We can have only 10 people over and have to wear masks inside at work. However, we can remove our masks to drink alcohol. How infantilising.
We’re being told to put our trust in our leaders, but they aren’t putting any trust in us. Health officials want to keep us locked up even longer.
It’s telling that the Burnet Institute cares more about making sure the health system doesn’t become overburdened at some point in the distant future rather than looking after the mental health of people right now.
In its modelling that underpinned the road map, there’s no mention of looking after the mental health of people or ensuring citizens are not locked up for longer than absolutely necessary. The modelling makes it clear that even at 80 per cent adult vaccination coverage, case numbers, hospital and ICU numbers should determine whether “restrictions can be safely eased consistent with the road map or whether a more staggered approach may be required”. There’s Andrews’ escape clause; the limited freedom we’re being promised is by no means guaranteed.
The Burnet briefing paper notes “An important question is: as vaccine coverage increases, how best can restrictions be eased that prevents health system capacity from being exceeded?” It should instead ask: “As vaccine coverage increases, how best can restrictions be eased so citizens can have their lawful rights and freedom of movement returned to them?” The callous disregard for people’s rights has been demonstrated time and again, most recently with the decision to close public transport to the city to thwart a demonstration.
It’s no wonder people are sick of being told to be grateful for the crumbs we’ve been thrown. After all this time, we deserve more. It’s not a road map, it’s a roadblock and it’s a road to absolutely bloody nowhere.

Full text: A GOLD Coast tourism boss is urging the Queensland Government to stick to a National Cabinet deal to reopen borders once 80 per cent of people are vaccinated for Covid.
Destination Gold Coast chairman Paul Donovan’s plea comes as it emerged on Monday Queensland may not reopen to Australia until it hits a 90 per cent vaccination rate.
It’s understood the Queensland Government Cabinet has endorsed a 90 per cent threshold, after Premier Annastacia Palaszczuk (right) and WA refused to sign up to National Cabinet’s 80 per cent.
Despite NSW and Victoria outlining a road map to opening up, based on an 80 per cent double vaccination rate, Queensland is yet to commit to any blueprint, even with the population likely to hit 80 per cent double jabs by December 5.
Mr Donovan said: “I appreciate the Premier’s position by trying to make sure we are safe but critically we really need a roadmap out and the 80 per cent level is key. I urge all Gold Coasters to get the jab. It’s the only way out of this economic abyss.” CONTINUED P4 Reopen at 80 or ‘abyss’ FROM P1: Chief health officer Dr Jeannette Young and Ms Palaszczuk have shifted in the past week to 90 per cent as their preferred threshold to opening despite Queensland having the worst vaccination rates, it’s understood. Quizzed on the 90 per cent, Ms Palaszczuk said she’d rely on the Doherty Institute modelling to determine when borders would reopen - and it was too early to speculate on vaccination threshold rates to determine border reopening. But she expected to have that Doherty Institute modelling within two weeks to guide a decision. The decision on 90 per cent is being driven by Labor polling showing Queenslanders don’t want to be opened up if it means a mass Delta outbreak, like NSW and Victoria. Two key poll findings are that Queenslanders are angry at the so-called exemptions unit, regarded as “heartless’’, for refusing to allow Queenslanders back into the Sunshine State, but it gives special treatment to wives and girlfriends of footballers. The key finding, however, is Queenslanders love their liberty and freedoms, and the fact Covid is under control – and that is a key driver in Palaszczuk Government thinking.

Full text: Catastrophising health bureaucrats and construction unions are running this state.
Instead of listening to the people, Premier Daniel Andrews is only getting advice from CHO Brett Sutton, who loves a long lockdown.
The only other group that appears to have any power is construction workers and their thug-filled union. Unlike schools, which are the first to close and the last to open, construction sites have been open throughout the pandemic.
When cases in the building industry rose, workers were given Covid marshalls, shift bubbles, staggered start and finish times — and now, mandatory vaccination.
What did schoo kids get from the recent roadmap? Another month mostly studying from home after 20 months of mostly studying from home.
If schools were treated like construction sites, one quarter of students would be back on campus right now. By October 26, half of the state’s one million school students would be back and by November 5, all of them.
Schools are highly regulated, teachers are keen to get vaccinated and for students to follow the rules, and yet they continue to be the forgotten underclass.
Compare this to construction workers responsible for more outbreaks than any other sector
who brawled outside their union headquarters on Monday, outraged at being told they had to get vaccinated.
They pelted their union boss with crates and water bottles and chanted the pro-choice slogan “my body, my choice” as part of their brutal, illegal protest.
A few days ago, construction workers walked off work sites and held up traffic after they were told they couldn’t use break rooms because they were key superspreader locations.
They didn’t care that tea and break rooms have been closed at most work sites – including hospitals and health care services – for 18 months now.
I shouldn’t be surprised. Even rule-abiding double-dosed Victorians are getting diddly-squat from Dictator Dan.
Reaching 80 per cent one dose means we can only shop once a day and must be home safely by 9pm tucked up with our teddies.
Then when we reach 70 per cent double dose – which is still more than one month away –
we get to leave home without having permission from Daddy Dan. But there’s still a 25km travel limit and we can only meet others and shop outside.
Where’s the incentive to get the reluctant anti-vaxxers over the line when the best you get after 250 days of lockdown is laneway shopping and fitness classes in the park?
People in NSW at the same point will be able to socialise freely, go to the pub and go to the races with 5000 others.
Even once we hit 80 per cent double vaccination, we will still be subject to some of the most draconian rules anywhere. We can have only 10 people over and have to wear masks inside at work. However, we can remove our masks to drink alcohol. How infantilising.
We’re being told to put our trust in our leaders, but they aren’t putting any trust in us.
Health officials want to keep us locked up even longer.
It’s telling that the Burnet Institute cares more about making sure the health system doesn’t become overburdened at some point in the distant future rather than looking after the mental health of people right now.
In its modelling that underpinned the roadmap, there’s no mention of looking after the mental health of people or ensuring citizens are not locked up for longer than absolutely necessary.
The modelling makes it clear that even at 80 per cent adult vaccination coverage, case numbers, hospital and ICU numbers should determine whether “restrictions can be safely eased consistent with the roadmap or whether a more staggered approach may be required”.
There’s the escape clause for Dictator Dan.
Even at 80 per cent vaccination rates, the limited freedom we’re being promised is by no means guaranteed.
The Burnet briefing paper notes that “An important question is: as vaccine coverage increases, how best can restrictions be eased that prevents health system capacity from being exceeded?”
It should instead ask: “As vaccine coverage increases, how best can restrictions be eased so citizens can have their lawful rights and freedom of movement returned to them?”
The callous disregard for people’s rights has been demonstrated time and again, most recently with the decision to close public transport to the city to thwart a demonstration.
It’s no wonder people are sick of being told to be grateful for the crumbs we’ve been thrown.
After all this time, we deserve more. It’s not a roadmap, it’s a roadblock and it’s a road to absolutely bloody nowhere.

Good leadership is guiding the way out of pandemic

Full text: A great moment for our country and a celebration of human spirit
Throughout the pandemic we have maintained that good leadership involves more than simply saying no. It is about being prepared to make tough decisions and accept the consequences. The job of a leader is to listen to a range of views from experts, including health authorities, but to have the courage not to always take their advice prescriptively. Unlike special interests, health and security included, decisions on broader matters of public policy and freedoms must be seen through a wider lens. Decisions certainly must be made for reasons greater than perceived political opportunity or self-interest. The bigger picture includes social outcomes such as mental health and child welfare. It involves an economic framework that takes account of circumstances across the whole community, not just the financial welfare of those in protected industries or government-funded jobs.
By and large, NSW consistently has met this challenge, and it is demonstrating leadership once again with its road map to easing restrictions in line with rising rates of vaccination. One blind spot is education, where not enough is being done to get children back to school. The loss of contact with peers and missed quality time in the classroom with teachers continue to be heavy prices to pay for young people, who statistics show would suffer the least health impacts from contracting the virus. It is unreasonable to say citizens can go to pubs before kids can return to the classroom. The most important people in society are those incapable of caring for themselves. Children under 16 are in that category and deserve special consideration. Kindergarten and year 1 students will return to school on October 25. But years 2, 6 and 11 will have to wait until November 1, and years 3, 4, 5, 7, 8, 9 and 10 until November 8. HSC exams, wisely, have been delayed until the second week of November. But with so much time lost, there is a good case, especially for some non-government schools due to finish on December 3, to extend the term. Government schools finish on December 17. Schools in regional areas coming out of lockdown will be allowed to reopen next week.
NSW Premier Gladys Berejiklian did not follow the lead of British Prime Minister Boris Johnson in setting a “freedom day” as such. But she said restrictions would ease considerably across the state on the Monday after vaccination rates hit 70 per cent. As part of the government’s road map, fully vaccinated residents will be permitted to access pubs, clubs and restaurants, as well as retail shopping and ticketed public events. The government also will permit access to hairdressers and beauticians. Gatherings in homes and public spaces will be permitted with up to five visitors allowed in a home where all adults are vaccinated (not including children 12 and younger). Up to 20 people will be allowed to gather in outdoor settings. Businesses will be required to produce a Covid-19 safety plan adhering to reduced capacity, mandatory mask-wearing, compulsory QR check-in and proof of vaccination.
Thursday’s announcement represents a faster timetable than health advisers had wanted. But Ms Berejiklian has been able to see the bigger picture and has done what good leaders do, which is accept responsibility and its attendant risk. The NSW government began laying the groundwork for reopening when it changed the focus away from the daily rollcall of case numbers towards hospital admissions and vaccination rates. The long lead time is designed to encourage as many people as possible to get vaccinated so they can participate fully in the greater freedoms that are planned. There are certain to be teething problems as citizens get used to the idea of a vaccine passport and other intrusions that would have been unthinkable before the pandemic struck. But if the evidence from Britain is any guide, once freedoms have been restored the public quickly will move on and get on with life.
Like Ms Berejiklian, Victorian Premier Daniel Andrews must be congratulated for recognising that a Covid-elimination strategy is no longer possible with the Delta variant. Like NSW, Victoria has eased restrictions for rural residents and is working on a plan to open more broadly when vaccination thresholds are reached. To his credit, Mr Andrews has long said that once everybody has had the opportunity to get vaccinated he is not going to lock down the state to protect those who won’t protect themselves.
Scott Morrison has backed NSW’s reopening plan, describing it as a “careful and safe” road map that is in line with the recommendations of the Doherty Institute modelling to reopen the country. The Doherty Institute has said it will be safe to open the country once vaccination rates reach between 70 and 80 per cent. Currently, 40 per cent of Australia’s eligible populations are vaccinated against Covid-19, with the pace of coverage increasing quickly. Certainly, the federal government has had its challenges with the vaccine rollout. But continued petty squabbling over the detail of early negotiations with Pfizer must be seen for the partisan politics that it is. The federal government is showing leadership with its plans to reopen the nation to the outside world. The Prime Minister has made clear that international borders will open and the ability for citizens to travel will be restored once vaccination rates hit 80 per cent.
All in all, with a pathway to post-Covid life becoming clearer, this is a great moment for our country and an example of good leadership at both a state and federal level. It is also a great celebration of the human spirit where individuals have faith in their leaders at times of crisis. Experience shows that all communities will do what their leaders make them feel comfortable doing. This is what makes it so depressing when lesser leaders trade in the politics of personal opportunity and fear, rather than in hope. It is understandable that premiers in states where there are no Covid-19 cases would want to preserve that for as long as possible. But once the two biggest states are out of lockdown, with open borders and a focus on health outcomes rather than case numbers, it will be only a matter of time before the citizens of the smaller states of Queensland, South Australia and Western Australia demand their leaders follow suit.

Economy holding up but support still needed

Full text: Last year when the initial waves of Covid-19 swept the globe, financial markets seized up, adding to the supply shock to economies from lockdowns.
A notable difference today, despite the emergence of the highly transmittable Delta variant, is the resilience of financial markets, led by continued risk appetite.
This resilience, if it is sustained, is one reason to be cautiously hopeful that the economic downturn in Australia, centred on the lockdowns in southeastern states and the ACT, will be less damaging than during the first Covid wave last year.
Indeed, the latest June quarter national accounts showed strong momentum in domestic spending ahead of the lockdowns.
In particular, the development of vaccines and their subsequent availability in richer nations has allowed major economies with relatively high vaccination rates to remain open.
This has supported risk appetite, allowing global markets to look ahead to continued growth in profits, despite the rebound in infections with the spread of the Delta strain. For example, share prices in the US and Europe are at record levels.
A further differentiating factor is that unlike when the pandemic hit in 2020, monetary and fiscal policies in most economies today are already at emergency levels of stimulus.
With continued gains in financial and asset prices, household and business balance sheets have been fortified while ultra-low interest rates, large dividend payments by companies, and financial injections from governments have backstopped incomes and spending.
In Australia’s case, the lower vaccination rates have meant it has not been possible to avoid lockdowns in jurisdictions where there have been new waves of infections caused by the Delta strain.
Large case numbers, particularly in NSW, have placed significant pressure on the health system, while households, communities and businesses most exposed to lockdowns, restrictions and the closed international border have suffered renewed financial stress.
The September quarter in Australia will see a large drop in production and a sharp rise in underemployment. GDP could fall by 2 to 3 per cent, a recession on any objective measure, and underemployment, which takes account of the reduced hours being worked, could rise to 10 to 11 per cent in the next few months.
Fortunately, there are some early signs that the downturn is not accelerating. Financial conditions have remained highly accommodative, share prices rose further in July and August, albeit at a slower pace than in the US and Europe, and the weekly reads on consumer sentiment have steadied after falling in late July/early August. Further, information from purchasing managers also points to a steadying in service sector activity this month after a sharp drop in July, and at levels well above those during the first wave. Consistent with this, capex plans by companies in service sectors have held up during July and early August.
That said, it is probable that the expected rebound in the final months of the year, as vaccination rates hopefully rise to 70 to 80 per cent, will only partially recover the ground lost during the downturn. This is because lockdowns and restrictions in NSW, Victoria and possibly the ACT are likely to persist into at least part of the December quarter.
Even in NSW where the vaccination rate has jumped sharply, daily case numbers have continued to rise and the 70 per cent vaccination target nominated by Premier Berejiklian to afford some easing of restrictions is not projected to be reached until next month.
There is also uncertainty around the timing and extent to which state borders might reopen even when vaccination rates pass 70 per cent.
Doherty Institute modelling indicated that even with a 70 per cent vaccination rate, if there is ongoing community transmission, contact tracing, isolation and quarantine will only be partially effective in managing cases within the capacity of the health system.
As a result, the modelling showed that strict or moderate lockdowns would be required until the vaccination coverage is assumed to have reached 80 per cent in those jurisdictions with ongoing community transmission.
This means that there could still be a drag on the recovery during at least some of the December quarter of around $1bn per week. The experience of rapid recoveries from previous lockdowns may only partially be the relevant template this time.
Therefore, it is important that direct income support for affected households and businesses is not ended prematurely.
Indeed, the dialling up of additional but temporary support by the federal and state governments as lockdowns and restrictions were reimposed in the past two months was entirely appropriate.
By targeting those most in need and taking advantage of the record low level of funding costs, it also is a more effective response than relying on further monetary policy measures.
Indeed, at last month’s meeting the RBA board acknowledged that fiscal policy is the most appropriate instrument to deal with temporary reductions of income.
It is unlikely to change this view at next Tuesday’s meeting given that rising vaccination rates are still on track to allow the lockdown states to ease lockdown restrictions ahead of the end of the year. Paul Brennan is the chief economist at Suncorp.

For the premiers playing politics of fear, the game’s up

Full text: The diminishing return from the politics of fear is making life hard for some. The latest preposterous excuse from the Queensland Premier for retaining the right to seal her state’s borders signals growing desperation. A number of surveys last week confirmed that the public mood has shifted away from the fantasy of Covid-zero and toward the reality that this uninvited guest will be staying for a good deal longer.
Tolerance for snap lockdowns and closure of state borders is diminishing. A survey by Compass Polling last week found seven out of 10 Australians want border closures to be nationally co-ordinated rather than allowing states to continue to go it alone. It is the view held by six out of 10 Queenslanders.
Annastacia Palaszczuk, however, refuses to let go of the state-versus-state, mate-versus-mate mentality she has adopted since the start of the pandemic. Her new threshold for business as usual is absurdly unachievable: the immunisation of infants with a vaccine not yet approved for use in children under 12 in a state where adults appear unusually hesitant to receive it themselves.
Queensland is firmly anchored at the bottom of the vaccine table alongside WA. By Friday night, 72.6 per cent of people in NSW had had one jab and 40.3 per cent had had two, compared to just 52.7 per cent and 34.1 per cent in Queensland. It begs the question who should be closing their borders against who.
One premier at least is prepared to have the honest discussion, long overdue, that all leaders will have to get around to eventually. The light at the end of the tunnel means “accepting Covid is part of our lives, accepting that, unfortunately, people will die”, said Gladys Berejiklian on Friday, “but they will be less likely to die if everybody is vaccinated. This is the reality”.
The nature of the Delta variant means the number of active cases may rise higher, even when the stipulated vaccination rates are achieved, judging by the experience of others. Israel may be the promised land for the children of Abraham, but not for the vaccinated. Israel’s vaccination rate has reached 78 per cent of those 12 and over, but there were 1100 new cases per million last week compared to 134 per million in NSW.
The Doherty Institute modelling demonstrates that we can expect better protection with an over-16s vaccination rate of 70 per cent and better still at 80 per cent, but the protection gains grow marginally smaller. Part of the honest conversation premiers such as Palaszczuk are reluctant to have is that the vaccines are somewhat leaky.
How leaky they are is beginning to come clear in the weekly surveillance reports from the UK, which tracks and reports data far better than most. There is enough evidence to be confident that a single dose of AstraZeneca reduces the risk of showing symptoms by 55-70 per cent and the chance of dying by 75-85 per cent. A second dose appears to reduce the odds further, although the evidence is less firm.
The question yet to be answered to the satisfaction of British medical scientists is the likelihood that a vaccinated person will transmit the virus to someone else. Their conclusion, that “little evidence is available at present and results are inconclusive”, is hardly the reassurance for which we might have hoped.
The news from abroad, however, is less grim once we look beyond the raw case numbers. The picture is consistent: in the most vaccinated population, deaths are significantly less common and fewer people are treated in hospital. Covid-19 does, indeed, become more like the flu and even less like Ebola, which is something else the fear-mongering premiers find difficult to talk about. Having spent 18 months trying to scare us witless, they are finding it hard to change tack.
Perhaps they can start by un-fudging the figures, as the NSW government has started to do. Last week, we discovered the actual death toll from Covid-19 is almost certainly lower than the one that has been officially reported. NSW deputy chief health officer Jeremy McNulty acknowledged that dying with Covid-19 is not the same as dying of Covid-19 and that the distinction was now being made in the official count. Since most of those who die are elderly and have multiple comorbidities, it is an important detail when assessing the level of risk.
Coming to terms with coronavirus requires us to wrestle with the question of whether it was ever as bad as we thought it was and if the response was proportionate to the risk. The answer will almost certainly be no. Closing our external borders was demonstrably effective. So, too, was the targeted protection of the elderly, particularly in institutional care. The absence of large outbreaks in nursing homes for nearly a year is the main reason deaths in the latest outbreak are thankfully few.
Lockdowns are much harder to justify given the cost to economic and personal wellbeing, a cost that increases exponentially the longer they continue. The evidence they work is much less firm than we might like to think since there is seldom a reliable control group against which results can be compared. The mounting case numbers in NSW after more than two months of lockdown prove nothing. Some will argue the number of cases would have been higher if not for the lockdown, but that is a conclusion based on supposition, not evidence.
At what vaccination level these lockdowns should end is a political judgment, not one that can be based on science. It requires a level of courage few leaders have been prepared to muster so far in this pandemic. The wiser heads in government, however, will have surely concluded by now what is obvious from the experience abroad; that living with Covid-19 means living with an active threat to health, not just a theoretical risk. They will have concluded, too, that this episode in our national life was made more painful by a lack of preparation and the unresolved tensions in the Constitution that were taken as licence by some premiers to play politics at a time of national crisis. Now the pathway back to normality has been agreed upon, the next item on the agenda should be preparing for the next viral threat. Nick Cater is executive director of the Menzies Research Centre.

Full text: Hospitals face major test AS greater Melbourne faces weeks of Covid uncertainty, the Andrews government’s hospital pandemic preparedness is likely to be tested.
As the priority reliance on long and hard lockdowns gives way to the race to vaccinate Victorians, the public is being warned about the potential for rising case numbers.
But lockdown fatigue should not rob greater Melbourne of the essential need to keep Covid transmission in check with continued compliance with restrictions — whether it be stay-at-home rules, masks, distancing, hygiene and the all-important duty to get tested at the slightest sign of symptoms and to isolate when required.
Premier Daniel Andrews’s concession to reality last week that Delta could no longer be eliminated should not mean we let our guard down.
Especially given Victorians have done so much over the past 18 months in fighting Covid.
With ever-increasing supplies of vaccines, albeit after a stumbling start due to early federal missteps on ordering volume and variants to cover contingencies, the target to get to 70 and then 80 per cent double doses for people aged 16 and over is within sight.
If the public can continue to help suppress Covid spread over coming weeks and months — with incremental easing of restrictions as we move to those trigger points — we can all help reduce the load on our hospital and health systems.
The key will be tapering off restrictions in areas where Covid case rates can be maintained and hopefully reduced, areas generally accepted to be outdoor activities.
The state’s beleaguered hospitality sector is keen and creative in its approach to reopening opportunities, including open-air, and the state government must consult closely to get the industry back off its knees and allow people to regain some sense of normality and freedom in personal and family lives.
Again, as Victoria passes 60 per cent first dose coverage for eligible adults and creeps towards 40 per cent double-vaccinated, the rules for vaccinated people, customers and business openings should keep pace.
While it is accepted that the Doherty Institute modelling in the national road map for Covid-normal advises that 40 and 50 per cent full vaccination still loses control of Covid, further more targeted modelling, including that which takes account of vaccine passports in hospitality and family settings, needs to be undertaken. After such a rollercoaster 18 months and six crushing lockdowns, each and every freedom that can be returned, as soon as it safely can be returned, should be.
The other area where government, health authorities, industry and community leaders need to get more proactive is ensuring more people come forward at the onset of symptoms. Even now, as few as 40 per cent of people get tested at the first sign of symptoms. And, still, the infection hot spots remain in Melbourne’s northern and western suburbs where a more mobile, younger demographic, a high migrant community, with insecure work and employees in essential services represent the bulk of transmission cases. More must be done to double-down on the health messaging across language barriers and to underline the financial support for those who are required to isolate.
With 8-10 per cent of people infected requiring hospital treatment, the evidence is clear that too many people wait too long to get tested.
Worryingly, as reported in the Herald Sun, Melbourne’s designated Covid hospitals expect patient numbers to double over the next week.
Our health workers have done an amazing job to date, but the rest of 2021 may be the toughest yet.
Equally inspirational AUSTRALIA’S Paralympians have done themselves and their nation proud. An elite level of athleticism, pure talent and grit was shown across the full range of disciplines and, separate to the incredible standing in the medal tally, the personal stories from the Tokyo Games — and what it took to get there — are inspirational stuff.
Take Dylan Alcott, who again celebrated yesterday, the greatest wheelchair tennis player, winning gold in the singles quads final and now looking to the US Open in the hope of completing an ultra-rare Golden Slam after winning this year’s Australian Open, French Open, Wimbledon and Paralympic titles.
Then there is former soldier Curtis McGrath, who lost his legs when a mine exploded while he was serving in Afghanistan, winning his second successive gold medal in para-canoe.
Australia also won six medals in table tennis, two golds and four silvers, with great performances from Ma Lin, Lina Lei and Yan Qian, while Paige Greco claimed bronze in the women’s C1-C3 cycling road race. But when Prime Minister Scott Morrison committed to equal reward for Paralympians to match the country’s Olympian achievements, it was swimming hero Ellie Cole, who now has 17 career medals, who perhaps defined the spirit of these games: “I just really wanted to thank Australia so much for seeing us as equal.”

For the premiers playing politics of fear, the game’s up

Full text: The diminishing return from the politics of fear is making life hard for some. The latest preposterous excuse from the Queensland Premier for retaining the right to seal her state’s borders signals growing desperation. A number of surveys last week confirmed that the public mood has shifted away from the fantasy of Covid-zero and toward the reality that this uninvited guest will be staying for a good deal longer.
Tolerance for snap lockdowns and closure of state borders is diminishing. A survey by Compass Polling last week found seven out of 10 Australians want border closures to be nationally co-ordinated rather than allowing states to continue to go it alone. It is the view held by six out of 10 Queenslanders.
Annastacia Palaszczuk, however, refuses to let go of the state-versus-state, mate-versus-mate mentality she has adopted since the start of the pandemic. Her new threshold for business as usual is absurdly unachievable: the immunisation of infants with a vaccine not yet approved for use in children under 12 in a state where adults appear unusually hesitant to receive it themselves.
Queensland is firmly anchored at the bottom of the vaccine table alongside WA. By Friday night, 72.6 per cent of people in NSW had had one jab and 40.3 per cent had had two, compared to just 52.7 per cent and 34.1 per cent in Queensland. It begs the question who should be closing their borders against who.
One premier at least is prepared to have the honest discussion, long overdue, that all leaders will have to get around to eventually. The light at the end of the tunnel means “accepting Covid is part of our lives, accepting that, unfortunately, people will die”, said Gladys Berejiklian on Friday, “but they will be less likely to die if everybody is vaccinated. This is the reality”.
The nature of the Delta variant means the number of active cases may rise higher, even when the stipulated vaccination rates are achieved, judging by the experience of others. Israel may be the promised land for the children of Abraham, but not for the vaccinated. Israel’s vaccination rate has reached 78 per cent of those 12 and over, but there were 1100 new cases per million last week compared to 134 per million in NSW.
The Doherty Institute modelling demonstrates that we can expect better protection with an over-16s vaccination rate of 70 per cent and better still at 80 per cent, but the protection gains grow marginally smaller. Part of the honest conversation premiers such as Palaszczuk are reluctant to have is that the vaccines are somewhat leaky.
How leaky they are is beginning to come clear in the weekly surveillance reports from the UK, which tracks and reports data far better than most. There is enough evidence to be confident that a single dose of AstraZeneca reduces the risk of showing symptoms by 55-70 per cent and the chance of dying by 75-85 per cent. A second dose appears to reduce the odds further, although the evidence is less firm.
The question yet to be answered to the satisfaction of British medical scientists is the likelihood that a vaccinated person will transmit the virus to someone else. Their conclusion, that “little evidence is available at present and results are inconclusive”, is hardly the reassurance for which we might have hoped.
The news from abroad, however, is less grim once we look beyond the raw case numbers. The picture is consistent: in the most vaccinated population, deaths are significantly less common and fewer people are treated in hospital. Covid-19 does, indeed, become more like the flu and even less like Ebola, which is something else the fear-mongering premiers find difficult to talk about. Having spent 18 months trying to scare us witless, they are finding it hard to change tack.
Perhaps they can start by un-fudging the figures, as the NSW government has started to do. Last week, we discovered the actual death toll from Covid-19 is almost certainly lower than the one that has been officially reported. NSW deputy chief health officer Jeremy McNulty acknowledged that dying with Covid-19 is not the same as dying of Covid-19 and that the distinction was now being made in the official count. Since most of those who die are elderly and have multiple comorbidities, it is an important detail when assessing the level of risk.
Coming to terms with coronavirus requires us to wrestle with the question of whether it was ever as bad as we thought it was and if the response was proportionate to the risk. The answer will almost certainly be no. Closing our external borders was demonstrably effective. So, too, was the targeted protection of the elderly, particularly in institutional care. The absence of large outbreaks in nursing homes for nearly a year is the main reason deaths in the latest outbreak are thankfully few.
Lockdowns are much harder to justify given the cost to economic and personal wellbeing, a cost that increases exponentially the longer they continue. The evidence they work is much less firm than we might like to think since there is seldom a reliable control group against which results can be compared. The mounting case numbers in NSW after more than two weeks of lockdown prove nothing. Some will argue the number of cases would have been higher if not for the lockdown, but that is a conclusion based on supposition, not evidence.
At what vaccination level these lockdowns should end is a political judgment, not one that can be based on science. It requires a level of courage few leaders have been prepared to muster so far in this pandemic. The wiser heads in government, however, will have surely concluded by now what is obvious from the experience abroad; that living with Covid-19 means living with an active threat to health, not just a theoretical risk. They will have concluded, too, that this episode in our national life was made more painful by a lack of preparation and the unresolved tensions in the Constitution that were taken as licence by some premiers to play politics at a time of national crisis. Now the pathway back to normality has been agreed upon, the next item on the agenda should be preparing for the next viral threat. Nick Cater is executive director of the Menzies Research Centre.

The hits and misses in national cabinet

Full text: It was David Koch, breakfast TV's longtime barometer of middle Australia, who last week articulated best the frustrations of so many about the fractured federation and seemingly dysfunctional national cabinet.
Sparring with Scott Morrison while Australians devoured their Wheaties, the Sunrise host asked if the PM was feeling like a lame duck. "You really can't get Queensland and WA to toe the line?" Kochie said.
"Should you have imposed a health emergency so ... we have consistent rules for everyone right across the country?"
Morrison's response hinted at an underlying exasperation. "There is not that power in Australia ... It just doesn't exist. So, I can't sort of play fantasy government," he said.
While political brawling between premiers and prime ministers is nothing new, the coronavirus pandemic has introduced a new generation of Australians to the complexities of the federation. Daily press conferences have elevated state and territory leaders to
day-time TV celebrities in the weekly build-up to national
cabinet meetings.
Formed in March 2020, as death tolls mounted in Europe, the national cabinet - compromising of all state and territory leaders - was assembled to co-ordinate a national response. Its early success has made it a permanent, but to many problematic, part of the landscape.
As the pandemic progressed, the patience and general politeness of those early days have dissipated as leaders traded barbs. Morrison took on Victoria's Daniel Andrews over contact tracing and Defence troops. Andrews upset South Australia's Steven Marshall by suggesting no one wanted to visit his state anyway when it closed its borders. For months, NSW's Gladys Berejiklian and Queensland's Annastacia Palaszczuk were engaged in a bitter brawl over border closures.
Berejiklian's perceived schadenfreude towards Victoria's second wave ensured Andrews returned the favour when it was NSW's time to lock down. Western Australia's Mark McGowan picked a fight with most of the east coast over his hardline border stance.
While Morrison has dismissed many of these grievances as nothing more than premiers playing to their own voters, whatever faint illusion of camaraderie was left has been shattered by damaging leaks out of the Prime Minister's own state in recent weeks.
First came the anecdote that a cranky Morrison had let fly at the NSW Treasurer Dominic Perrottet during a meeting, swearing in displeasure over negotiations to upgrade COVID-19 financial support. Then, at the weekend, there were claims Berejiklian had called Morrison a "bully" and "evil". The NSW Premier told reporters to "not believe what you read". But the damage was done.
There is little doubt Berejiklian did not appreciate the suggestion being planted in the media that she only went harder in her lockdown strategy at Morrison's urging.
The relationships between Morrison and the leaders of the two biggest states has been rocky since the 2019 bushfires. Both sides "briefed" differing accounts to journalists about the other's claimed incompetencies.
However, those who sit in the national cabinet each week insist the process is working.
"You know what happens every week before national cabinet, every week the stories appear, 'oh they're disagreeing, nothing's happening', etcetera, etcetera," Morrison told Koch. "Everybody lays in. Then we get together in the room on the Friday and we sort it out."
In the room
Those who sit in the room stress the public dynamic is rarely the way things play out when the secure video links fire up.
Although some say privately that meetings have become more "sombre", "tense" or even "a little emotional" in recent times amid fierce debate about vaccinating children and a plan based on the Doherty Institute modelling to ease restrictions when vaccination rates hit 70 to 80 per cent.
The forum, several leaders say, operates at its best when the differences between states and territories are acknowledged.
Neither is there always an alliance between Labor and Liberal leaders.
One leader says: "I think if aliens came down and watched the debate, they wouldn't be able to tell who is in a red shirt [Labor] or a blue shirt [Liberal]. Morrison knows which leaders he can corral on certain issues and he starts from there to win support."
It is in this situation where Morrison has been aided by the return of Andrews from his lengthy stint on the sidelines.
While the optics may have changed, the dynamic between the pair remains the same. They are both prepared to be pragmatic for the greater good. "Their personal politics are different, but they know they need to work together," another source says. "Daniel knows that having a direct line to the Prime Minister is important and Morrison knows it's important to have a Labor premier he can work with ... [who] can move the dial in terms of the other Labor states."
Despite initially showing some outward hesitancy towards easing restrictions when vaccination rates hit 70 to 80 per cent, Andrews has been one of the strongest proponents of the plan.In Queensland, WA, Tasmania and SA, there remains an incentive to go hard on restrictions.
Palaszczuk's decision to differentiate herself on the vaccine advice, particularly with AstraZeneca, has left many fellow leaders exasperated. They have accused her of fuelling hesitancy.
"There has been a lot of frustration expressed towards Annastacia from every state," one fellow Labor leader said. Another said: "Put bluntly, at times she's really given people the shits."
IS IT WORKING?
While federal Labor has attacked Morrison for his attempts to make the inner workings of national cabinet a secret, it is the conservative side of politics whose criticism of the process has grown louder of late.
Former prime minister Tony Abbott, who once advocated in favour of the Commonwealth seizing powers from the states, said he believed that the federal-state relationship was a "dog's breakfast". Abbott says there's no clear definition of responsibilities — "who is in charge" and "who is to blame" — as premiers duelled over border closures and blamed Morrison for quarantine and vaccine rollout failures.
But federal West Australian MP Ben Morton, who has become known as Morrison's problem solver, remains a staunch believer that the national cabinet has worked despite the petty rivalries and parochialism. The Assistant Minister to the PM says the system treats premiers and chief ministers as willing partners with the federal government - which was the antithesis to its predecessor, the Council Of Australian Governments, where progress was based on the agreement of all states to the lowest common denominator.
That is the view from the biggest states, Victoria and NSW, who believe it remains fit for purpose - despite any personal differences - and while premiers express frustration outside the cabinet room, it works.
As the deteriorating situation in Victoria has slowly shifted the debate away from eradicating the virus, all agree vaccinating the nation remains the priority.
But don't expect the bickering to subside any time soon.

Victoria's sacrifices are not in vain

Full text: There have been plenty of big news days in Victoria over the last 18 months. This week could have seen the most significant of them all.
After more than 210 days of lockdown for Melbourne, and longer in some hotspot suburbs, Premier Daniel Andrews declared on Wednesday that the dream of "COVID Zero" was over. It's unlikely that coronavirus case numbers can be brought down, at least for the short term.
Whatever your views on the restrictions we have faced, this news could have left you feeling like the sacrifices we've made since March last year have been for nothing. And the sacrifices have been considerable.
But it has not been a waste. Our collective efforts have saved many thousands of lives; and those Australians living in relative freedom in other states can partly thank Victorians for that.
Modelling recently conducted by the Burnet Institute found that lockdown six has already prevented more than 6000 local COVID cases in this latest outbreak.
But the scenario that we avoided in 2020, before any vaccines had arrived, remains our greatest achievement to date. While about 800 people died in Victoria's second wave, you only need to look at places like Britain and the US to realise it could have been far worse. If we'd seen deaths at a similar rate to those experienced in Britain in Victoria, there could have been roughly 15,000 socially distanced funerals.
Stephen Warrillow, the director of intensive care at Melbourne's Austin Hospital, said while he'd love to say hard-working doctors and nurses had saved the day, the real credit lay with the community at large. "I guess it's easy to forget what happened in northern Italy, the United Kingdom and the United States," said Associate Professor Warrillow. "We would have our own particular version of the situation here in Victoria. Intensive care would have absolutely been full of COVID and we would have struggled to manage anything else."
Crucially (and this is perhaps the main point) Melbourne's 110-plus days in lockdown in 2020 also bought Victoria and the rest of the country valuable time for vaccination.
This is probably best illustrated by NSW's second wave, which is now much larger than Victoria's 2020 outbreak, but has seen far fewer deaths because by the time it took hold, a large proportion of the older population had received at least one vaccination dose.
About 1 in 220 people diagnosed with COVID in NSW since June have died, well below the usual death rate from the disease. Compare that to Victoria last year, when by the end of the second wave about 1 in 25 people had died. The virus hasn't got any less deadly, we've just had time to largely ring-fence our nursing homes with vaccinations. This week Melbourne's intensive care units have been dusting off their surge plans and reconfiguring spaces to make room for new COVID patients. Like all of us, the staff are exhausted.
But, again, they will be relying on the Victorian community. They need us all to get vaccinated. Unfortunately, they also need us to stay in lockdown for a little longer.
We've saved thousands of lives. We've made it safer for other states to enjoy freedoms and better economies. We bought time for the entire nation to vaccinate the most vulnerable and make a good start on the rest. There are people alive today that wouldn't have been, if it wasn't for the actions of us all. So thank you Victoria, for everything.

Full text: It’s time to let us live again IT is beyond time lockdown was revisited — in all states (Open up the borders, 1/9).
Because of a few problem areas of Sydney, all of NSW is needlessly incarcerated. With proper care — masks, hand sanitising and social distancing — something better than ‘baby steps’ is surely possible.
Small businesses are groaning under the impact, some closing never to reopen. Individuals cannot see family or travel much beyond town limits.
Worst of all is the debilitating impact lockdown is having on our children, with so many having to go to hospital for mental health reasons. I won’t be around when our young folk look at the world we left them but I feel they might be justified in cursing us for recalcitrant rigidity and gutless lack of leadership.
Ron Sinclair, Bathurst
Set a date for an end to these tough restrictions Your editorial (Our passports to freedom, 1/9) sums up precisely how voters are feeling right now in ­respect to opening up this country once again. We have had enough and we want to go back to ‘normal’ life. We want life as we once knew it — the one our forefathers and ourselves have worked so hard to ­secure. That’s not unreasonable.
We have had enough of politicians and senior bureaucrats playing political games with us. The power-trip some state leaders are on has reached a point where our tolerance has been stretched to the limit.
The majority have accepted Prime Minister Scott Morrison’s considered plan to open up at 70-80 per cent vaccination, with one key amendment — set a date.
A date that gives us at least six weeks to ­prepare for a ‘normal’ Christmas. Melbourne Cup Day has a ring to it, PM!
Those Premiers who think they can continue locking us up or prevent us crossing their state borders beyond this time without serious backlash need a rethink.
People power is a prized and powerful tool in a democracy — politicians and bureaucrats would do well to remember this.
John George, Terrigal
Get tough on rogue states It is interesting that our politicians accept without question the modelling on climate change but are not prepared to accept modelling from the Doherty Institute on when lockdowns should end and borders reopen (Christmas in balance as Premiers retain border powers, 1/9).
The PM has to get tough and when the milestones are reached, which shouldn’t be long with the way people are rolling up their sleeves, tell these “dictators” that if they want to run their “own ­countries” they had better find their own income streams.
John Stuart, St Fillans
Queensland’s cruel rules I am absolutely appalled by federal Labor and it’s state counterparts — they have destroyed our nation and divided us all (Open up the ­borders, 1/9).
When the pandemic began, it would have been wise for Labor to side with the federal Government. No one knew how to handle a pandemic such as Covid, including ­politicians. However, as Covid ­continued and worsened with the Delta strain, Labor turned it into a political debate.
Wednesday’s Daily Telegraph shows an article about a woman with thyroid cancer, unable to return home to Queensland after attending her mother’s funeral in Victoria ­because she drove through NSW (WAGs’ border pass stuns ill woman, 1/9). She is rightly upset, particularly when the NRL’s players’ wives, girlfriends and children are allowed over the border to Queensland.
Australians, we are all in this ­together – yeah, right!
Barbara Thompson, Online
Forgotten in race for jabs It appears those aged over 60 with underlining health challenges have been forgotten.
For example, my sister in her 60s is in remission for stage three breast cancer and has blood clot issues ­determined after several operations.
She has a letter from her GP to confirm and he told her to only take the Pfizer vaccine. She has lobbied the Health Department after being told on the booking app she will have to wait.
I’m sure there are other individuals over 60 who need Pfizer and want to do the right thing, but have been forgotten. Is there any hope they will receive the vaccine before the 70 per cent target is reached so she/they can enjoy what we all want – freedom?
Terry Smart, Hillsdale
Biden’s catastrophic failure Miranda Devine castigated Joe Biden for his lack of empathy at the “dignified transfer” of the last 13 US service personnel who died in ­Afghanistan last week (Gone with a whimper – Opinion, 1/9).
A British military historian, Sir Basil Liddell Hart, theorised the ­dichotomy of defeat: “Errors at the tactical and operational level may be redeemable, but those at the strategic level are usually catastrophic.” Now the US President has ­defended that he presided over a success in ending a war and bringing the troops home.
If that is the case, what then is the new woke definition of failure? Mike Fogarty, Weston, ACT
Taliban armed to the teeth It beggars belief that the Americans would vacate Afghanistan leaving behind a treasure trove of modern military equipment (Fortress USA now a jihadi HQ, 1/9). The Taliban is now the best equipped radical/terror organisation in this troubled region.
How horrifying it must be for the allied families who lost loved ones to see a bunch of murderous fanatics strutting about in American uniforms. I despair.
Len, Lithgow
Dog act should hound Joe President Biden’s decision to cut and run in such a shambolic manner was truly repugnant (Gone with a whimper — Opinion, 1/9). He has abandoned innocent allies and even some of his own citizens.
Even more contemptible was the abandonment of 51 army dogs (Dogs of war left to die, 1/9). The cruelty of the Taliban towards their own ­people is surpassed by their cruelty towards animals.
Andrew Miles, Manly
Blinken insults a key ally If US Secretary of State Anthony Blinken saw fit to acknowledge the service of the coalition of countries which sent troops to Afghanistan, neglecting to mention our contribution (and loss of 41 lives and the 261 injuries to our service personnel) it might be worth remembering this appalling oversight next time the US finds itself in yet another long-term war or intervention (Blinken missed it — Editorial, 1/9). Not even a later apology for the oversight or a thanks for Australia’s assistance in evacuating over 3000 people from Kabul.
Seriously, why would we want to be in the trenches with such an ungrateful entity which couldn’t recognise the services of a staunch, dependable, reliable and brave ally.
If there is another skirmish and our assistance is called for, we might do well to remember this.
Marg Swindells, Castle Hill
Briefly...
The US army left 51 dogs in Afghanistan (Dogs of war left to die, 1/9). The army didn’t leave just dogs behind — they left 51 members of the army. To train those dogs costs hundreds of thousand dollars, and how many soldiers’ lives have been saved by those dogs?
George Orban, Breakfast Point ●●● It’s starting to look like blocked ­borders is a vote-catcher with some state premiers. So, to take away any idea this might be true, I suggest we postpone the next state elections for two years. It will also save some money we don’t have.

Full text: It’s time to let us live again IT is beyond time lockdown was revisited — in all states (Open up the borders, 1/9).
Because of a few problem areas of Sydney, all of NSW is needlessly incarcerated. With proper care — masks, hand sanitising and social distancing — something better than ‘baby steps’ is surely possible.
Small businesses are groaning under the impact, some closing never to reopen. Individuals cannot see family or travel much beyond town limits.
Worst of all is the debilitating impact lockdown is having on our children, with so many having to go to hospital for mental health reasons. I won’t be around when our young folk look at the world we left them but I feel they might be justified in cursing us for recalcitrant rigidity and gutless lack of leadership.
Ron Sinclair, Bathurst
Set a date for an end to these tough restrictions Your editorial (Our passports to freedom, 1/9) sums up precisely how voters are feeling right now in ­respect to opening up this country once again. We have had enough and we want to go back to ‘normal’ life. We want life as we once knew it — the one our forefathers and ourselves have worked so hard to ­secure. That’s not unreasonable.
We have had enough of politicians and senior bureaucrats playing political games with us. The power-trip some state leaders are on has reached a point where our tolerance has been stretched to the limit.
The majority have accepted Prime Minister Scott Morrison’s considered plan to open up at 70-80 per cent vaccination, with one key amendment — set a date.
A date that gives us at least six weeks to ­prepare for a ‘normal’ Christmas. Melbourne Cup Day has a ring to it, PM!
Those Premiers who think they can continue locking us up or prevent us crossing their state borders beyond this time without serious backlash need a rethink.
People power is a prized and powerful tool in a democracy — politicians and bureaucrats would do well to remember this.
John George, Terrigal
Get tough on rogue states It is interesting that our politicians accept without question the modelling on climate change but are not prepared to accept modelling from the Doherty Institute on when lockdowns should end and borders reopen (Christmas in balance as Premiers retain border powers, 1/9).
The PM has to get tough and when the milestones are reached, which shouldn’t be long with the way people are rolling up their sleeves, tell these “dictators” that if they want to run their “own ­countries” they had better find their own income streams.
John Stuart, St Fillans
Queensland’s cruel rules I am absolutely appalled by federal Labor and it’s state counterparts — they have destroyed our nation and divided us all (Open up the ­borders, 1/9).
When the pandemic began, it would have been wise for Labor to side with the federal Government. No one knew how to handle a pandemic such as Covid, including ­politicians. However, as Covid ­continued and worsened with the Delta strain, Labor turned it into a political debate.
Wednesday’s Daily Telegraph shows an article about a woman with thyroid cancer, unable to return home to Queensland after attending her mother’s funeral in Victoria ­because she drove through NSW (WAGs’ border pass stuns ill woman, 1/9). She is rightly upset, particularly when the NRL’s players’ wives, girlfriends and children are allowed over the border to Queensland.
Australians, we are all in this ­together – yeah, right!
Barbara Thompson, Online
Forgotten in race for jabs It appears those aged over 60 with underlining health challenges have been forgotten.
For example, my sister in her 60s is in remission for stage three breast cancer and has blood clot issues ­determined after several operations.
She has a letter from her GP to confirm and he told her to only take the Pfizer vaccine. She has lobbied the Health Department after being told on the booking app she will have to wait.
I’m sure there are other individuals over 60 who need Pfizer and want to do the right thing, but have been forgotten. Is there any hope they will receive the vaccine before the 70 per cent target is reached so she/they can enjoy what we all want – freedom?

Full text: letters to the editor
IT has been three weeks now since I reported the suffocation of Edmunds Bay, Blackalls Park, pictured.
With the latest king tide, and now the heat, it has become a health hazard, it is starting to rot and stink.
All of the elected councillors on this side of the lake have been sent emails, but no response. Council finally responded, saying it could take four weeks for someone to look at it. If this was Warners Bay would it take four weeks? As I said previously Belmont Bay was scraped clean within a week.
Robert Baxter, Blackalls Park Truth, transparency on the outer THE ABC Health Report recently had a podcast featuring Norman Swan and an interesting interview with Director of the Doherty Institute, Professor Sharon Lewin.
While previous discussions about the wisdom of "opening up" at 70-80 per cent have suggested the modelling isn't really very much affected by the efficiency of testing and tracing, I am starting to wonder how much of this is really just wishful thinking.
Previous comments seemed to suggest relatively high case numbers would not have a significant impact on the modelling outcomes but now with the NSW Premier saying things will get worse before they get better, and October may well be the really difficult time, I wonder. October is as far away in the future as the date this second wave started taking off is in the past.
We are now climbing quite fast beyond a 1000 cases a day, a point when contact tracing is becoming very difficult. Indeed, NSW now says that regular reporting of case status is meaningless. With exponential growth, a less effective tracing system and still a large number of the overall population unvaccinated what next?
We were promised 40 million doses of Pfizer between now and Christmas but now we are doing deals with Poland and Singapore to get our hands on any extras, even those approaching expiry date.
One minute Gladys is saying the health system will easily cope, having prepared over the last 18 months, and the next that things could get difficult.
I can appreciate that getting a balance between the medical, psychological and economic issues is not easy, but it feels to me that transparency and truth are disappearing faster than the proverbial bathwater. Who is going to rescue the baby?
Vic Davies, Tighes Hill Case for delaying opening up I HAVE a question as to the legal liability that may be faced by Gladys Berejiklian, John Barilaro, Brad Hazzard and possibly Kerry Chant.
If the state acts to open up when we reach the 70 or 80 per cent of adult population vaccination level, are they open to charges of "By Negligent Act Cause Death" if people who have been trying to get vaccinated with an age appropriate vaccine, but have been unable to because of the supply shortage issue, become infected with COVID and die what could be seen as an avoidable death, as a result of the state opening up too soon.
Are the Premier and other state officials responsible for making that decision immune from prosecution for each and every resultant avoidable death?
If the opening up is delayed several months until vaccine shortages are overcome for age specific groups, as recommended by the Australian Advisory Group, and everyone who wants a vaccine gets one, many thousands will avoid the risk of serious illness or death from COVID.
The continuing lockdowns are certainly having a negative effect on the economy, but does that override any criminal liability that may arise?
Mal Sinclair, Cameron Park All of a sudden it's become a race ANTHONY Albanese continues to be taken to task by the Fox TV stable of talking heads for suggesting Prime Minister Scott Morrison had failed the two important public health tasks required of him since 2020 - ensuring a functioning roll-out of the COVID vaccines and, the establishment of discrete COVID quarantine facilities nationwide.
Truth be told, Albanese is correct on both issues. The roll-out of COVID vaccines most probably would have been better had more quantities of vaccines been sourced as far back as mid-2020.
But rather than admit to such an outrageous failure of policy, an arrogantly dismissive Scott Morrison was telling the nation COVID vaccination "was not a race" and quarantine facilities were a second order of importance issue.
Now with COVID raging virtually out of control among the Indigenous residents of Wilcannia, Morrison is saying COVID vaccination "is a race".
With Indigenous COVID victims of Wilcannia forced to rely upon tents pitched in their yard for quarantine purposes, Morrison's failure to recognise the urgent need for discrete COVID quarantine facilities nationwide is blindingly obvious.
Barry Swan, Balgownie Fears deputy premier out of touch PETER Cooper, (Short Takes, 30/8), John Barilaro, lately appears to be spending a large percentage of his time, and taxpayers money, on having the Fixated Persons Unit monitor a YouTuber (Jordan Shanks, better known as FriendlyJordies) for posting content parodying him, and attempting to sue both Shanks, and the global juggernaut Google for allowing the content to stay online.
Barilaro being so consumed by something so frivolous fills me with no confidence in his ability to carry out his job properly. His priorities appear to be with his public image rather than the people he governs over, and residents of the Hunter are probably pretty low on his list of priorities.
He may have built a big chunk of his platform on supposedly being all about the bush, but I wonder how he can actually relate to concerns of regional areas like the Hunter when he rents an apartment in Rushcutters Bay.
I also wonder how helpful he could ever be completely locking down Sydney, or how much of a concern it would ever be for him when even his own daughter broke COVID restrictions. Twice.
Adz Carter, Newcastle We can't forget about Afghanistan THE sudden and unexpected success of the Taliban has caused much anguish and soul searching among western nations but as well as searching for answers we should be considering our future relations with Afghanistan.
It is after all a nation torn apart by decades of war and now faces starvation from a prolonged drought. Providing food aid, even though it will not be distributed fairly, will be essential as will foreign aid because the Taliban's income is at present largely from drug supply.
There is also the real possibility that if we don't help financially Afghanistan will become a vassal state of China, something they are keen to do because that nation is rich in minerals - including iron and coal - that can be easily exploited. This aid may even have to extend to military funding because the Taliban have an internal war with extremist groups like the ISIS - K who are a potential terrorist threat to the west.
These are decisions that have to be made soon and they are going to be more contentious than our clumsy withdrawal.
Don Owers, Dudley SHORT TAKES GLADYS has failed the Hunter again by allowing tree loppers from Sydney to come up whilst in lockdown. They have tested positive to COVID and visited a medical centre at Charlestown. I cannot say how angry this makes me as not only is it not an essential service, but there are local tree lopping businesses that they are taking work off and forcing us into longer lockdowns. I wonder how many of them have been vaccinated.
Debra Forbes, Wickham COLES is copping a caning for its outsourcing of its fresh meat offer to a third party, to the detriment of long-term meat packers and butchers in their individual shops, all for the sake of cost savings on their bottom line. Other major supermarkets have done exactly the same thing in recent years with little to no blow back from unions and industry experts. Lots of angst for long-term dedicated professionals all for the sake of saving a buck. No wonder customers continually gravitate back to their local butcher.
Tony Morley, Waratah THIS new COVID C1.2 variant seems to have manifested itself all over the world and it appears to be more virulent than the Delta strain. Question; how does it pop up at the same time, and more potent. Is it manmade? Is someone, or a country, trying to reduce the world population to resolve climate control?
Graeme Kime, Cameron Park WHILE I don't consider myself to be medically qualified in any way, I do people to read the article by John Tierney (Get AZ ASAP, Opinion, 1/9). From my point of view the article makes a lot of sense and while there are so many people (through no fault of their own) waiting on the Pfizer vaccine, they are, in fact, playing Russian Roulette when AZ is readily available. Please read the article and form your own opinion.
Col Parkins, Wallsend EVERY Australian should be challenging the Morrison government, demanding why they have not thrown everything they have got at manufacturing the vaccine in Australia. We know the LNP government likes to spend money overseas. But this is an emergency, or to us the people affected it is.
Gary Hayward, Cardiff CAN someone tell me how many of the Knights' past five games have been against top four or even top six teams? Also, how many times have they played the top four sides compared to other teams?
Bruce Cook, Adamstown I AGREE with Brian Roberts, (Short Takes, 1/9). The pen is mightier than the sword. ScoMo has the opportunity to prove this in the case of the Biloela family. Their temporary visa will expire at the end of this month, 563,000 have signed Change.org. At a time of daily bad news we deserve some good.

Full text: Gladys tries a distraction amid hospital warning HEALTH-care workers have little hope for the coming months after Premier Gladys Berejiklian urged citizens to pay no mind to the “rollercoaster of case numbers” on the same day the state ­recorded 1218 Covid infections, six deaths and 813 people in hospital.
Ms Berejiklian initially said the focus should switch from case numbers to hospitalisations at a vaccination rate of 80 per cent but on Sunday said it was time to be optimistic at just 35 per cent of the adult population ­double dosed.
“I don’t want people to go through the daily rollercoaster of numbers going up and down. Of course, it’s concerning when they go up instead of going down. But the most relevant number is what is the vaccination rate,” she said. “It’s a scary time, but it’s also a time for us to look to the future with optimism.” In the same breath, she suggested NSW had not yet seen the peak of ICU admissions which would likely come in October – the month Ms Berejiklian is expected to start opening the state up to vaccinated residents.
“I suspect in October we’ll probably have the highest number that we do in intensive care. I suspect we’ve not reached the peak yet there at all,” she said.
Among the new deaths was a man in his 80s who died after getting the virus at an outbreak in Nepean Hospital, the fifth fatality linked to that cluster and the 19th among people who caught the virus at a hospital.
Surgeon and co-chair of the Illawarra-Shoalhaven Covid taskforce Bruce Ashford said while vaccinations would help decrease future hospitalisations, the plan also needed to consider the length of hospital stays.
“If you get really sick with Covid, regardless of your pre-morbid state, you’ll be in ICU for a long time, and it will be a rocky road,” Dr Ashford said.
“There will be less cases because of vaccinations but the truth is those in ICU at the end of October will be in hospital for about a month longer … I think it’s fair to say that for the next few months we will be in a pattern where a lot of our resources are devoted to the treatment and containment of Covid patients.” Dr Ashford said the health system would have to contend with lingering hospitalisations along with the backlog of other health ­services that were canned to accommodate resource intensive Covid patients.
“Whether we can handle things at 70 and 80 per cent, I would defer to the Doherty Institute and say we don’t know, and we just need to see how long the tail of hospitalisation of Covid will be,” he said.
“Our job in health is to look after Covid patients but also not forget everyone else. Every hospital has had to limit other services because of, not just the current burden of Covid, but the preparations of a higher burden of Covid. It’s not rocket science to imagine that things will increase.” NSW Nurses and Midwives’ Association general secretary Brett Holmes said the daily case number remained “critical” for healthcare workers.
“Our system is stretched; our members are exhausted. Every day there’s another challenge being put to them. While they do their best to keep up, they certainly won’t be looking forward to the next few months when some projections of peak hospitalisation are yet to come,” he said.
“(Workers) are seeing ­directives coming out to expand the number of Covid wards … they are dying for a break, and they don’t see it coming.
“The Doherty modelling doesn’t give us a clear indication that the healthcare system won’t be absolutely flat chat looking after those people who aren’t vaccinated. Twenty per cent of our population getting Covid and needing health care is a scary thought.” Heath Services Union general secretary Gerard Hayes said he did not think the system could cope when lockdown lifted in October.
“There is massive pressure. Why wouldn’t you just hold until November and utilise spring to get into summer in the best shape possible?” he said.
“The ambulance service has been on ‘status three’ for three days which means it’s overwhelmed and a critical job could take two hours or more.” The Australian Paramedics Association reported 17 ambulances were waiting to offload patients at Westmead Hospital on Sunday.
Opposition leader Chris Minns said while Labor supported the national plan, the Premier could not“simply ignore thousands of cases a day and tragically the deaths that follow”.
“The stress on the health system is already high – and it will only get worse in coming months. The government should also return to daily community transmission numbers and health alerts on exposure sites for Greater Sydney,” he said.
Health-care workers said the government was putting “on a brave face” while workers crashed and burned with increasing speed.
“They are really underplaying it. Putting on a brave face to make everyone feel this normal. I don’t think we are any way near the peak yet. Everyone is feeling it,” one hospital nurse told The Daily Telegraph. “December is quite busy because everyone gets their surgeries before surgeons go on leave. Will everyone not bother getting them or will everyone completely crash the system? ”

Full text: Gladys deflects attention from record case numbers
HEALTHCARE workers have little hope for the coming months after Premier Gladys Berejiklian urged citizens to pay no mind to the “rollercoaster of case numbers” on the same day the state ­recorded 1218 Covid infections, six deaths and 813 people in hospital.
Ms Berejiklian initially said the focus should switch from case numbers to hospitalisations at a vaccination rate of 80 per cent but on Sunday said it was time to be optimistic at just 35 per cent of the adult population ­double dosed.
“I don’t want people to go through the daily rollercoaster of numbers going up and down. Of course, it’s concerning when they go up instead of going down. But the most relevant number is what is the vaccination rate,” she said. “It’s a scary time, but it’s also a time for us to look to the future with optimism.” In the same breath, she suggested NSW had not yet seen the peak of ICU admissions which would likely come in October – the month Ms Berejiklian is expected to start opening the state up to vaccinated residents.
“I suspect in October we’ll probably have the highest number that we do in intensive care. I suspect we’ve not reached the peak yet there at all,” she said.
Among the new deaths was a man in his 80s who died after getting the virus at an outbreak in Nepean Hospital, the fifth fatality linked to that cluster and the 19th among people who caught the virus at a hospital.
NSW Nurses and Midwives’ Association general secretary Brett Holmes said the daily case number remained “critical” for healthcare workers.
“Our system is stretched; our members are exhausted. Every day there’s another challenge being put to them. While they do their best to keep up, they certainly won’t be looking forward to the next few months when some projections of peak hospitalisation are yet to come,” Mr Holmes said.
His comments came as NSW Health began discussions to extend its use of retiree nurses to bolster the struggling workforce. The department is seeking to expand the pool of retirees to nurses who have left the workforce over the past decade, The Australian reported.
Mr Holmes said hospital workers were “dying for a break”.
“The Doherty modelling doesn’t give us a clear indication that the healthcare system won’t be absolutely flat chat looking after those people who aren’t vaccinated. Twenty per cent of our population getting Covid and needing health care is a scary thought.” Surgeon and co-chair of the Illawarra-Shoalhaven Covid taskforce Bruce Ashford said while vaccinations would help decrease future hospitalisations, the plan also needed to consider the length of hospital stays.
“If you get really sick with Covid, regardless of your pre-morbid state, you’ll be in ICU for a long time, and it will be a rocky road,” Dr Ashford said.
“There will be less cases because of vaccinations but the truth is those in ICU at the end of October will be in hospital for about a month longer … I think it’s fair to say that for the next few months we will be in a pattern where a lot of our resources are devoted to the treatment and containment of Covid patients.” Dr Ashford said the health system would have to contend with lingering hospitalisations along with the backlog of other health ­services that were canned to accommodate resource intensive Covid patients.
“Whether we can handle things at 70 and 80 per cent, I would defer to the Doherty Institute and say we don’t know, and we just need to see how long the tail of hospitalisation of Covid will be,” he said.
“Our job in health is to look after Covid patients but also not forget everyone else. Every hospital has had to limit other services because of, not just the current burden of Covid, but the preparations of a higher burden of Covid. It’s not rocket science to imagine that things will increase.” Health Services Union general secretary Gerard Hayes said he did not think the system could cope when lockdown was lifted in October.
“There is massive pressure. Why wouldn’t you just hold until November and utilise spring to get into summer in the best shape possible?” he said.
“The ambulance service has been on ‘status three’ for three days which means it’s overwhelmed and a critical job could take two hours or more.” The Australian Paramedics Association reported 17 ambulances were waiting to offload patients at Westmead Hospital on Sunday.
Opposition leader Chris Minns said while Labor supported the national plan, the Premier could not“simply ignore thousands of cases a day and tragically the deaths that follow”.
“The stress on the health system is already high – and it will only get worse in coming months. The government should also return to daily community transmission numbers and health alerts on exposure sites for Greater Sydney,” he said.
Health-care workers said the government was putting “on a brave face” while workers crashed and burned with increasing speed. “They are really underplaying it. Putting on a brave face to make everyone feel this normal. I don’t think we are any way near the peak yet. Everyone is feeling it,” one hospital nurse told The Daily Telegraph.

Berejiklian must reveal plan to reopen economy

Full text: The last thing the federal government wants as it heads into an election year is a recession, but that is looking increasingly likely as lockdowns in NSW, Victoria and the ACT roll on with no end in sight. Treasurer Josh Frydenberg expects Australia's economy to contract by 2 per cent this quarter, but some senior economists predict almost double that contraction.
After all, NSW and Victoria are the engine rooms of the economy, contributing more than 50 per cent of the nation's gross domestic product, and they've been out of action for months. The technical definition of a recession is two consecutive quarters of negative growth. This means that whether the economy falls into recession depends on what happens on either side of the doomed September quarter. The nation finds out the June quarter results on Wednesday. Mr Frydenberg will be holding his breath.
Spooked by the prospect of recession, the Morrison government has been pushing hard for the states to stick to the Doherty Institute roadmap out of this pandemic. The Doherty modelling calls for a reopening once 70-80 per cent of Australians aged over 16 are fully vaccinated. At this level, lockdowns can be avoided and the healthcare system will not be overrun with COVID-19 cases. Herald polling last week found 62 per cent of voters support this action.
For Mr Frydenberg and Prime Minister Scott Morrison, opening up at this threshold gives the economy a fighting chance of recovery by May 21, the last day the government can hold an election. The government is already likely to be punished at the ballot box over its disastrous vaccine rollout, which looms large as a cause of the lockdowns. A recession on top of that failure will not do them any favours.
But a recession is not just a political problem for the government. It's a problem for all of us. Recession leads to higher unemployment, lower wages and less tax revenue for the government to spend on social services. Those who have lost work or whose businesses have been forced to close may have done so in the name of avoiding an awful, deadly disease but they are being asked to shoulder a different, and difficult burden.
To minimise these harms, the NSW government must commit to a detailed plan to reopen the state economy - and share that plan with the public.
The state government has been on the back foot since the Delta outbreak began, rushing out harried policy responses which have done little to promote confidence in the economy - particularly when it has just as quickly walked back commitments such as returning HSC students to the classroom this month or allowing hairdressers to reopen. Even the school reopening plan announced on Friday seems tainted with uncertainty.
The state government has flagged limited trials of one-on-one services, such as hairdressing, for fully vaccinated people in the coming weeks. But what about the hospitality sector that wants to reopen to vaccinated patrons? Or the live performance industry which has been shut down for the best part of 18 months?
Customers and businesses need certainty from the government if they are going to commit to spending money and help grow the economy.
Meanwhile, states such as Western Australia and Queensland should remember how much they benefit from the NSW economy before protesting against this reopening. After all, this is a plan to which all the states and territories agreed, and an open, growing economy is in the national interest.
As Premier Gladys Berejiklian has made clear, we're all going to have to get used to living with COVID-19. For her part, it would help if she could tell the people of NSW when and how they'll be able to do that.

Full text: YEAR 12 students are in a race against time to be vaccinated, with many rising at dawn and queuing up all day to get their first jabs.
A lack of school-based vaccination sites and no priority lanes for year 12s led many hundreds of students to log into classes from long queues on Friday.
With the NSW government unveiling a plan for its students to return to school on October 25, the Andrews government remained tight-lipped on Friday on when Victorian students would return to classrooms, with an announcement expected next week.
By 9.30am, one venue, Malvern Town Hall, closed the line to new people due to vaccine supplies running out. Other walk-in sites across the city ­reported similar scenes.
Many students are just weeks away from exams.
Those at Malvern included Ben Sparrow, 18, and his sister Emily, 16, who spent more than seven hours lining up at the hall.
Mr Sparrow, a year 12 ­student, said he wanted to get vaccinated to ensure he was protected in the lead-up to his final exams and to help get Victoria out of lockdown.
“I want to get to 80 per cent, so restrictions can be eased,” he said. Premier Daniel Andrews says he wants all year 12s vaccinated by the start of exams.
The race to vaccinate the nation has seen a marked shift between the two biggest states since the crisis in NSW deepened. National data released daily shows that in the past seven days there were 803,000 jabs in NSW compared with 428,000 in Victoria.
Despite the growing gap in the rate of inoculations, Victoria has accelerated its rollout and almost 54 per cent of people have had one dose.
Tina King from the Australian Principals Federation said parents, staff and students in Victoria were at a crisis point and “couldn’t keep living on hope alone”.
Spokeswoman for parents lobby group Shadow Pandemic Jacquie Blackwell said there was a need to “open the discussion and ensure our children’s mental health, wellbeing and access to education is front and centre”.
Victorian Student Representative Council spokeswoman Nell MacColl said “not knowing what is happening, particularly for those undertaking VCE and VCAL assessments, has been a huge burden”.
It comes as the Doherty ­Institute reiterated to national cabinet on Friday that it would be safe to fully reopen Australia when 80 per cent of people 16 years and over were fully vaccinated, regardless of case numbers.
After a week of back and forth between the federal government and the states and territories over the vaccination levels required to banish lockdowns, national cabinet was given another briefing from Doherty’s Professor Jodie McVernon on the institute’s modelling scenarios.
But national cabinet was also told that some public measures, such as mask wearing, contact tracing and localised “moderate restrictions” would be necessary at between 70 and 80 per cent of vaccination coverage.
Victoria reported 79 new cases on Friday, with 13 of the mystery cases still under investigation.
Authorities are now facing a massive challenge fencing in an outbreak around Melbourne’s western suburbs, where cases around Newport and Hobsons Bay were discovered weeks ago.
The region had appeared to be under control but over the past week Covid-19 commander Jeroen Weimar has flagged serious concerns for the area.
He said 60 per cent of Friday’s cases could be traced to Melbourne’s western suburbs, including 12 in Wyndham and 11 in the Newport area.
“This is a significant area of concern,” he said.
“We believe there are multiple chains of transmission and we’re looking at quite significant community transmission that’s ongoing.” Thirty-seven Victorians are in hospital, 14 are in ICU and nine people are on ventilators.
Victoria has recorded 453 new cases of Covid-19 over the past seven days, while 130 people have recovered from the virus.
Health Minister Martin Foley would not be drawn on whether the 79 cases would lead to the state’s lockdown being extended past September 2. susie.obrien@news.com.au

Full text: This week, despite all the failures with the Covid-19 vaccine rollout and associated pandemic blunders, the opposition managed to make a meal of its own political and public policy strategy when attacking the Morrison government. Anthony Albanese was forced into a backdown. His attempt to divide and conquer was re-routed by a ghost of Labor leaders past.
The Opposition Leader had hoped to side with breakaway premiers by throwing mud at the Doherty Institute’s targets for lifting restrictions. He’d been working up to such a stance for weeks.
The intent wasn’t to undermine the reputation of the institute. Throwing doubt on the modelling – indeed, claiming that the advice from the institute was changing, with material implications for how and when we open up – was all about making political life that little bit harder for Scott Morrison, feeding into the problems the Prime Minister has had controlling the agenda recent­ly.
Then former Labor leader Bill Shorten entered the fray, siding with Morrison and the plan originally agreed to at national cabinet. The news landed with a thud on Wednesday, with those close to Albanese privately accusing Shorten of deliberately playing the role of wrecker. Shorten supporters weren’t going to let that criticism go unanswered, reminding anyone who would listen that Albanese wasn’t exactly Shorten’s most loyal lieutenant during the six years the latter led the party.
With some of the premiers having attempted to crab-walk away from national cabinet’s staged targets for opening back up – yes, Mark McGowan, we are looking at you – Albanese hoped to be the beneficiary of such parochialism by egging on the contrarianism. But once Shorten belled the cat, doing so would have divided the federal opposition more than it would the relationship between Morrison and the premiers.
Albanese was forced to retreat, all the while claiming he wasn’t retreating. Of course the federal opposition supports the reopening plan agreed to at national cabinet.
Albanese had hoped to be able to continue to box Morrison into a corner on what happens next in dealing with Covid, but instead he was outflanked. Yes by Morrison (armed with focus group research on community attitudes showing a shift is under way), but also by Shorten (who still has a leadership baton in his backpack, as Kevin Rudd used to say).
Make no mistake, Shorten is coming for Albanese. He may not be able to seize the leadership this side of the next election or after. But he is happy to use his authority as a former leader to stir trouble when he believes he’ll be on the right side of history eventually. This was one of those moments.
Either way, Shorten forced Albanese explicitly to back the national plan, and thus back the Prime Minister. Maybe we really are all in this together.
Shorten did so despite Albanese starting the parliamentary week casting doubt on the modelling and the consequences of opening up later this year.
A week is a long time in politics after all. Of course, there is a long way to go until election day, the timing of which is at the Prime Minister’s discretion. By the time election day does roll around, any Australian who wants to be vaccinated will be. Those who aren’t won’t be able to blame the government. There will have been ample vaccinations available for long enough, such that few can reasonably complain that opening the economy up isn’t fair.
That will be the climate in which the next election campaign will be fought. Because of the furore inside Labor this week, including the backdown by Albanese, Morrison will point out Albanese wanted to keep fully vaccinated Australians wrapped in cotton wool, long after the botched vaccination rollout had been fixed.
But that is a lesser of evils for Albanese compared with sticking to his guns arguing against opening things up, only to be left stranded when community sentiment shifts. Assuming that does happen – as both Morrison and Shorten are convinced it will – Albanese really should thank Shorten for the valuable service he performed this week. Messy, yes. Awkward, no doubt. Humiliating, maybe. But necessary to save Albanese from himself? Absolutely.
Most Australians do not live on taxpayer-funded salaries, guaranteed whether we are in lockdown or not, with a generous super scheme they know will get them by no matter what. They are nervous about their economic future, the mental health of their children; indeed, their own mental health. The health risks remain real but, once they are vaccinated, people aim to be hopeful. Hence Australians are rapidly shifting their thinking, wanting restrictions lifted so they can get on with their lives in a world of Covid.
Albanese has cleverly avoided Sydney since parliament rose for the winter recess, allowing him to campaign around much of the country. He therefore hasn’t experienced the Sydney lockdown. It has left a blind spot.
While people are angry and frustrated with the failures of a slow lockdown in Sydney and a botched vaccine rollout nationally, the only thing that would make these failures even worse would be if once fully vaccinated we still weren’t let out of our cages. That was Albanese’s emerging position before Shorten intervened.
On another topic, the debacle that has been our withdrawal from Afghanistan continues to worsen. We now know many of the locals who helped us while Australian troops were deployed will not secure asylum on our shores. Some will eke out an existence under Taliban rule, others will be killed.
Morrison likes to erode the uniqueness of the welcome to country for Indigenous Australians by including a thanks to those who have served in our armed forces. I could tolerate the departure from custom if such platitudes were supported by something substantial.
For a long time our military personnel had been warning the government it needed to act with haste to secure safe passage for Afghans who supported us. They were ignored. As Morrison has said, we knew that once US troops left, the Afghan army would capitulate to the Taliban soon enough. Why then were we too late? There are no excuses.
Whatever your view on the war in Afghanistan, the manner in which we have left has been handled badly. Peter van Onselen is a professor of politics and public policy at the University of Western Australia and Griffith University.

Full text: YEAR 12 students are in a race against time to be vaccinated, with many rising at dawn and queuing up all day to get their first jabs.
A lack of school-based vaccination sites and no priority lanes for year 12s led many hundreds of students to log into classes from long queues on Friday.
With the NSW government unveiling a plan for its students to return to school on October 25, the Andrews government remained tight-lipped on Friday on when Victorian students would return to classrooms, with an announcement expected next week.
By 9.30am, one venue, Malvern Town Hall, closed the line to new people due to vaccine supplies running out. Other walk-in sites across the city ­reported similar scenes.
Many students are just weeks away from exams.
Those at Malvern included Ben Sparrow, 18, and his sister Emily, 16, who spent more than seven hours lining up at the hall.
Mr Sparrow, a year 12 ­student, said he wanted to get vaccinated to ensure he was protected in the lead-up to his final exams and to help get Victoria out of lockdown.
“I want to get to 80 per cent, so restrictions can be eased,” he said. Premier Daniel Andrews says he wants all year 12s vaccinated by the start of exams.
The race to vaccinate the nation has seen a marked shift between the two biggest states since the crisis in NSW deepened. National data released daily shows that in the past seven days there were 803,000 jabs in NSW compared with 428,000 in Victoria.
Despite the growing gap in the rate of inoculations, Victoria has accelerated its rollout and almost 54 per cent of people have had one dose.
Tina King from the Australian Principals Federation said parents, staff and students in Victoria were at a crisis point and “couldn’t keep living on hope alone”.
Spokeswoman for parents lobby group Shadow Pandemic Jacquie Blackwell said there was a need to “open the discussion and ensure our children’s mental health, wellbeing and access to education is front and centre”.
Victorian Student Representative Council spokeswoman Nell MacColl said “not knowing what is happening, particularly for those undertaking VCE and VCAL assessments, has been a huge burden”.
It comes as the Doherty ­Institute reiterated to national cabinet on Friday that it would be safe to fully reopen Australia when 80 per cent of people 16 years and over were fully vaccinated, regardless of case numbers.
After a week of back and forth between the federal government and the states and territories over the vaccination levels required to banish lockdowns, national cabinet was given another briefing from Doherty’s Professor Jodie McVernon on the institute’s modelling scenarios.
But national cabinet was also told that some public measures, such as mask wearing, contact tracing and localised “moderate restrictions” would be necessary at between 70 and 80 per cent of vaccination coverage.
Victoria reported 79 new cases on Friday, with 13 of the mystery cases still under investigation.
Authorities are now facing a massive challenge fencing in an outbreak around Melbourne’s western suburbs, where cases around Newport and Hobsons Bay were discovered weeks ago.
The region had appeared to be under control but over the past week Covid-19 commander Jeroen Weimar has flagged serious concerns for the area.
He said 60 per cent of Friday’s cases could be traced to Melbourne’s western suburbs, including 12 in Wyndham and 11 in the Newport area.
“This is a significant area of concern,” he said.
“We believe there are multiple chains of transmission and we’re looking at quite significant community transmission that’s ongoing.” Thirty-seven Victorians are in hospital, 14 are in ICU and nine people are on ventilators.
Victoria has recorded 453 new cases of Covid-19 over the past seven days, while 130 people have recovered from the virus.
Health Minister Martin Foley would not be drawn on whether the 79 cases would lead to the state’s lockdown being extended past September 2. susie.obrien@news.com.au

Full text: A RATHER alarming press release landed in the inboxes of journalists this week. It was from the Australian National University, detailing new modelling on the national cabinet’s plan to reopen the country once Covid-19 vaccination targets are met.
The bottom line? “Assuming 80 per cent vaccination coverage for only those over 16, as per the national plan, there could be approximately 25,000 fatalities,” an ANU professor said.
At this point, there are two things you need to know. A scientific model is not a crystal ball – it does not describe the future, but it offers an educated guess. In that sense, the ANU’s work could be a useful contrast to the Doherty Institute model which underpins the national plan.
It could – and this is the part you really need to know – if it wasn’t based on an assumption divorced from reality. In the words of Walter and Eliza Hall Institute Professor Ivo Mueller, the ANU model is unrealistic, unhelpful and irresponsible. Why? Because it assumes that once vaccination thresholds are reached, Australia will let Covid rip.
The national cabinet’s plan mandates ongoing low-level restrictions, likely to include masks, density limits and QR code check-ins. Authorities will persist with testing, tracing, isolation and quarantine to contain the virus.
The Doherty Institute forecasts that even if these containment measures are overrun once 80 per cent are vaccinated, 761 people will die in six months – not 25,000. If these measures work effectively, the predicted death toll is six.
Others sought to twist the Doherty work this week by highlighting a table from their report which purported to show Australia would remain in lockdown 31 per cent of the time once the 80 per cent vaccination threshold was reached if tracing and testing did not keep up.
This overlooked another table which predicted the figure would be 0 per cent – no more lockdowns – if low-level restrictions were maintained, as the national cabinet agreed to do.
Science can be spun in many directions. It was a point Anthony Albanese made to Labor MPs this week as he encouraged them to read the national plan, not “Morrison’s spin on it”.
There are some legitimate arguments to be had about the way forward. Parents are rightly concerned about reopening when their children are unvaccinated. That’s why Scott Morrison is pushing as quickly as the medical advice will allow to open jabs for kids over 12. No country in the world is vaccinating children younger than that, but trials continue.
The NSW and Victorian outbreaks have also sparked questions about whether the Doherty model would be skewed by reopening with hundreds of cases a day. The institute’s experts have now affirmed this situation does not alter the required vaccination thresholds.
Pollsters judge Morrison has also correctly captured the mood of the country. “If not at 70 per cent and 80 per cent,” he asked this week, “then when? We must make that move … the lockdowns now being endured are taking an extremely heavy toll.” Albanese may think this is spin, dubbing Morrison the “gaslight on the hill”, but if he disputes the national plan then the PM will paint him as Covid-zero zealot supporting indefinite lockdowns.
Labor cannot afford for that to stick. The questions about the plan need to be resolved, and they have prompted complaints from WA and Queensland that threaten to derail the national agreement.
On Saturday, Morrison will reach another milestone as the longest-serving PM since John Howard. If he wins the next election, he’ll move well into the top 10 of all time. For someone still seen by some to be an accidental leader, this would be rare air.
Morrison won his first election with a small-target strategy. He will only win again by meeting the most important target of all. Tom Minear is Herald Sun national politics editor

PM’s bold gamble could lock in the election

Full text: It will be very hard for Scott Morrison to win next year’s election if the Covid crisis is not substantially resolved because campaigning around restrictions would be an admission of failure.
Actually, it was always going to be hard to win, given the Coalition is seeking a fourth term while defending a paper-thin majority and facing an adverse redistribution, plus strong and aggressive Labor governments in the key states of Western Australia and Queensland. But by finally moving to take on the lockdown-addicted Labor premiers this week, the Prime Minister at last has given himself a fighting chance.
As Malcolm Turnbull discovered in 2016, elections are contests, not coronations. You don’t win by minimising differences with the other side and expecting to be rewarded for past achievements. You win only when you’re able to persuade voters that, on balance, their lives will be better with you and your party in government. Having invented the so-called national cabinet at the start of the pandemic to play himself into the formulation and co-ordination of public health policy, it’s understandable that Morrison felt obliged to minimise friction with the Labor premiers, even when they played fast and loose with national cabinet decisions.
In the acute phase of this crisis, voters would not have rewarded rank politicking, so he was right to build bridges, not burn them. But as the harm from lockdowns grew and the Covid cure became worse than the disease, giving up the mantle of national leader to become a mere chairman of a Covid co-ordinating council has come at a cost to Morrison’s standing in the polls and his character in the eyes of the electorate.
With close to 15 million Australians under virtual house arrest, and with everyone else’s lives subject to instant up-ending at the first sign of an outbreak, cynically opportunistic Labor premiers successfully have pinned the blame on Morrison (personally, not just the federal government) for not rolling out the vaccine fast enough. It’s not their fault people are locked up, they’ve said, but the Prime Minister’s for not giving them any alternative.
But with the vaccine rollout now gathering speed, and with NSW, especially, well on track to hit 70 per cent double-jabbed within two months, the Labor premiers may have overplayed their hand. Certainly, Anthony Albanese now fears that, hence Wednesday’s sudden conversion to the Doherty Institute’s formula for opening up. Provided he holds his nerve, Morrison has a window to change the contest from an argument over how well he has managed the rollout to an argument over who wants to keep us locked up more or less forever.
Don’t be surprised if the federal Opposition Leader goes to the election saying he wants the lockdowns ended as quickly as possible, even while Labor premiers continue to impose them. Labor is more than capable of playing a ruthless political double game, especially in those states that have had their elections safely out of the way – and blaming the PM for the confusion.
Until last weekend, it has been hard to tell that Morrison is a Liberal prime minister, at least from his handling of the pandemic.
In terms of the initial lockdowns nationally and the pre-vaccine Victorian second wave, he probably didn’t have much choice but to support restrictions and to pay for their economic consequences – despite the obvious clash with the normal Liberal instinct for smaller government and greater freedom.
But even after the national cabinet had agreed on a plan out of restrictions – essentially to end statewide lockdowns once vaccination reached 70 per cent and to end state border closures once vaccinations reached 80 per cent – Morrison stayed a lockdown supporter, with his initial response to the current NSW second wave almost falling into a tautology: “If you’re in a lockdown, the lockdown has to work.” But that all seemed to change last weekend. Last Sunday, Morrison declared in a newspaper column that “a one-eyed focus on just case numbers overlooks the fact that (fewer) people are getting seriously ill, let alone dying” thanks to vaccines. He went on: “These lockdowns are imposing a heavy toll. They are sadly necessary for now … but they won’t be necessary for too much longer.” Since then, with ever-greater clarity and vigour, he has been stressing that we will have to “live with Covid”, including some hospitalisations and deaths; and putting himself increasingly at odds with the Labor premiers who still insist that, for opening up, it’s necessary that the virus be “crushed and killed”.
It’s now pretty clear that in NSW at least, from the end of October when vaccination hits 70 per cent, businesses will reopen, some school classes will resume and restrictions will be minimal. Well before that, it’s likely that the double-jabbed will get some relief from stay-at-home orders. It’s also pretty clear that in Victoria, under the world’s harshest lockdown, where even sunset-watching is verboten, without a return to Covid zero there’ll be no release from house arrest until vaccination rates reach at least 80 per cent.
Given the Labor premiers’ fixation on Covid zero, unless NSW gets to 80 per cent vaccination and also eliminates the virus, it’s all but certain that Queensland, WA and Victoria will keep their borders shut tight.
In fact, the Labor states are trying to retrofit the national cabinet decision to add a new require­ment for opening up: not just 70 per cent-plus vaccination but zero Covid, too – even though the decision was based on Doherty Institute modelling that was quite specific that high levels of vaccination could not be expected to prevent more than 100 hospitalisations and more than 10 deaths a day on average due to Covid, around Australia.
The Labor premiers are obviously revelling in a spotlight that state leaders haven’t had for a generation. As long as they can maintain a sense of crisis, they keep their opposition marginalised and public concerns muted about all other policy failures and budget spending. They also know the federal government is held to a higher standard than they are.
It won’t be enough for Morrison to exploit the politics of this crisis as they have. He’ll have to fix it, even though so much of the politics of it is outside his control.
The Labor premiers will continue to make opening up all about risks to health from Covid spreading through the community. By contrast, Morrison needs to make it all about risks to mental health and jobs from Covid restrictions staying in place.
But it won’t be enough for Morrison merely to side with voters increasingly demanding their lives back. As the country’s paramount leader, he will be expected to deliver; to make the national cabinet decision, for once, actually stick; and the only lever he has is financial.
Within a few months of the federal election, could Morrison credibly threaten Queensland and Western Australia with funding cuts if they don’t stick to the national cabinet plan for reopening? If it’s a matter of political life or death, maybe he could. That would require a level of steel from him not seen since, as Tony Abbott’s border minister, he helped to stop the boats.

Sticking to a unified plan for the common good

Full text: Leaders must rise above politics to usher in a post-lockdown world At times of great uncertainty for the nation it is important that political opponents are able to put aside their ideological differences to focus on a unified plan for the common good. The Covid-19 pandemic represents a national crisis of a magnitude equal to any experienced before, including in wartime. Budgetary decisions taken today will have impacts that will be felt for generations. Restrictions aimed at curbing the spread of the Covid-19 virus are having unintended consequences on both physical and mental wellbeing that carry great cost.
Also at stake is the trust between levels of government and a creeping loss of community respect for those who are supposed to serve them. The national cabinet was created as a measure to cross party divides and bring together all states and the federal government. But, rather than create cohesion and promote co-operation, the national cabinet has exposed the limits to federal authority and highlighted the hubris and excesses of state leaders who default to state of origin politics over genuine leadership.
With the nation’s two most populous states in lockdown, businesses shut and workers on government emergency support, the evidence is that, rather than coming together, political opponents are moving further apart. Victorian Premier Daniel Andrews is blaming NSW publicly for the rising number of Covid cases in his state. “If we could send it (the virus) back to NSW we would,” he said on Tuesday. Queensland and Western Australia, where case numbers are low, are questioning the strategy already agreed at national cabinet to lift restrictions once the number of vaccinations reaches 70 or 80 per cent.
As leaders squabble over border closures and the way ahead, the public is starting to show where it stands. A survey by the Institute of Public Affairs shows that 37 per cent of people want restrictions ended as soon as possible and a further 34 per cent want them ended when vaccine thresholds are met. Just 10 per cent of people think we should stay in lockdown until everyone (including children) is vaccinated. The research found only 13 per cent of respondents believed Australia should continue to pursue a “Covid zero” eradication strategy, and 62 per cent believed it was unlikely Covid-19 would ever be permanently eradicated in Australia.
The federal government is using Doherty Institute modelling to build the case to reopen, arguing elimination is a failed strategy. On Monday, Doherty Institute director Sharon Lewin said reopening with the large case numbers was still valid at 70 to 80 per cent vaccination rates. In a separate statement, the institute said: “Once we reach 70 per cent vaccine coverage, opening up at tens or hundreds of cases nationally per day is possible; however, we will need vigilant public health interventions with higher caseloads.” Former Labor leader Bill Shorten made a welcome intervention on Tuesday, expressing a personal view that there couldn’t be a return to zero Covid-19 cases after lockdowns were lifted and nominating an 80 per cent vaccination rate as a threshold for reopening. Incumbent Labor leader Anthony Albanese is still indulging in the politics of blame, criticising the government for the slow vaccine rollout. But opposition health spokesman Mark Butler says the federal ALP supports “the idea that we get vaccination rates up to a point where we can see life starting to return to normal. Australians need an end to these constant debilitating lockdowns.” Citizens are voting with their feet, and arms, with vaccination rates of 215 a minute. As Dennis Shanahan wrote on Tuesday, after weeks of damaging attacks for the delayed vaccine rollout, criticism from both extremes about liberty and freedom, and facing blame-shifting from the premiers for outbreaks, Scott Morrison is seizing the relative recent success of vaccinations accelerating and the proximity of reaching target vaccination levels of 70 and 80 per cent to launch his own campaign. Shanahan says it is a pivotal political moment for the Morrison government and the fate of the national economy. As Paul Kelly writes on Wednesday, the transition will be high risk but the Prime Minister and Josh Frydenberg must lead the country away from a futile hermit island fate. All leaders must rise above politics to make a decision on how we are going to move forward as a nation into the post-lockdown world.

Full text: Vaccinated Australians would be granted access to restaurants, planes, sporting venues and bars under uniform standards, with national cabinet preparing a list of exemptions for inoculated people under its four-phase reopening plan.
National cabinet will also move to fast-track jabs for high-school students under a push to have the majority inoculated before the Christmas holidays.
After the Australian Technical Advisory Group on Immunisation finalises its interim advice on vaccinating 1.2 million children aged 12 to 15 for Friday’s national cabinet meeting, all students aged 12 and over will be eligible for vaccines from next week.
Access to Pfizer and Moderna jabs is expected to be through GPs, state hubs and schools.
A national cabinet subcommittee, consisting of Victoria, Tasmania and the Northern Territory, will report on Friday with preliminary recommendations supporting a uniform range of exemptions for vaccinated residents across states and territories. The Australian understands a decision on exemptions is unlikely this week.
Australian companies, including Qantas, have moved to order mandatory vaccines for workers and offer incentives for vaccinated people, while in France residents need to provide proof of vaccination before accessing bars, restaurants, trains, planes and other venues.
Gladys Berejiklian said NSW was developing technology allowing residents to check-in and prove their vaccination status in one process. “My message to everybody is, if you want to get back to normal, please get vaccinated,” the Premier said. “It’s your choice if you don’t but … if you want to do certain things in the future vaccination will be key as part of that process.” National cabinet leaders, who have fractured over their four-phase reopening strategy, will ­receive updated advice from the Doherty Institute within 48 hours reinforcing that spiralling Covid-19 cases will not affect existing vaccine targets.
The Australian understands the advice will say that surging Delta variant cases in NSW, Victoria and the ACT would bring the curve forward for peak cases and deaths but not alter the 70 and 80 per cent double dose vaccine targets required to move the nation out of the suppression phase.
The Doherty Institute was expected to provide direction around baseline restrictions and test, trace, isolate and quarantine measures as the country transitions away from lockdowns and border closures. The national cabinet, which agreed to the reopening plan on July 30, is expected to clarify the positions of states pursuing Covid-zero policies.
As vaccine supply ramps up over the next two months, the majority of teenagers are expected to receive at least one jab by December with no impact on the vaccination program for Australians aged 16 and over. Under existing approvals about 8000 children aged 12 to 15, with underlying medical conditions and those in indigenous and remote communities, have been vaccinated.
Scott Morrison stepped up his defence of the national reopening strategy after West Australian Premier Mark McGowan and Queensland Premier Annastacia Palaszczuk declared they would reserve their lockdown rights to keep Covid out of their states.
Speaking to the joint Coalition party room meeting, the Prime Minister told MPs they must confront Australia’s Covid reality.
Mr Morrison said that once the 70 and 80 per cent vaccine thresholds were achieved, lockdowns would do more harm than good.
“The idea of Covid zero, that’s not the issue once you get to 70 and 80 per cent,” he said. “Any state and territory that thinks that somehow they can protect themselves from Covid with the Delta strain forever, that’s just absurd. New Zealand can’t do that. They were following an elimination strategy. They’re in lockdown.” Ms Palaszczuk hit back at Mr Morrison, declaring that Queenslanders were not living in a cave.
“Have a look out in Queensland at the moment. You can go to work, you can go to school, you can go and watch sport, you can play community sport, you can go to a restaurant. We haven’t given up,” Ms Palaszczuk said.
While she agreed with the 70 and 80 per cent national cabinet targets, she wanted to see the updated Doherty modelling.

SHOWDOWN AS PM TAKES ON STATES

Full text: MORRISON’S BACK AS THE MAN WITH A PLAN FRIDAY’S national cabinet is set to be a showdown as Prime Minister Scott Morrison seeks to “hold premiers to account” on the national plan for easing restrictions, with insiders saying a line has been drawn in the sand.
There will be a ground-up approach, with the pressure expected to come from the public who want a pathway and clear goalposts.
Premier Annastacia Palaszczuk on Monday would not back down from her deputy’s comments that Queensland might not open its border to NSW even when vaccination rates hit 80 per cent.
Updated modelling from the Doherty Institute is likely to be used to reinforce the existing plan to start easing restrictions at 70 and 80 per cent, even with NSW battling hundreds of cases a day.
The vaccination plan for children aged 12-16 and those younger will also be discussed at national cabinet, as it shapes up as the next flashpoint issue.
Seeking to fire up the public’s support for the national plan, Mr Morrison said “this groundhog day has to end”.
“There has to be a plan out, there is a plan out and we have to move forward with that plan,” he said.
“The national plan is our deal with all Australians. It is the understanding that we have with Australians making their sacrifices now, and who have made them over such a long time, that that sacrifice will get them to the next step.
“Because if not at 70 per cent and 80 per cent, then when? Then when?” Mr Morrison said there would be those who would seek to undermine the national plan, but denied he was talking about states such as Queensland where the Premier has been crab walking away from the deal.
The reinvigorated Prime Minister’s fired-up performance has been welcomed by his colleagues, who had become increasingly concerned about his lacklustre showings, with premiers having kept him on the ropes in recent weeks.
Cases continued to rise across the country, with NSW recording 818 cases in a day, Victoria and the ACT ­remaining in lockdown and even New Zealand admitting it may not achieve zero Covid under the Delta strain of Covid.
NSW Premier Gladys Berejiklian urged people “not to have the rollercoaster of ­emotions at case numbers every day”, saying that was not the most important thing to consider.
“Every state is going to have to go through this ­transition, one way or another because once you open your borders, we can’t live in isolation forever,” she said. Ms Palaszczuk would not be drawn on how Queensland will open up once vaccination rates hit 80 per cent, saying we’re in “uncharted territory”.
Ms Palaszczuk said everyone was still aiming for the 70 to 80 per cent vaccination goal, but that there was also an agreement for extra ­modelling based on the current situation.
“They have commissioned more research because the goalposts have changed. It was premised on there being 30 cases in the community and now there are thousands,” Ms Palaszczuk said of the Doherty research.
She said that her goal was ­always to suppress the virus and so there would be some limited and specified ­restrictions and lockdowns in the future.
“This is a book that hasn’t been written, folks,” Ms Palaszczuk said. “This is uncharted territory.” Ms Palaszczuk said Delta was incredibly infectious, and the other concern was children.
“We have to get children vaccinated, especially in those high school years … because we know that it can be spread.” “This is a big job,” she said.
Business Council of Australia chief executive Jennifer Westacott called on leaders to “stick to the numbers” around reopening the country and slammed the “constant state of uncertainty” created by Queensland’s threat to withdraw from a national Covid-19 ­reopening plan.
“If leaders walk away from the national reopening plan or make the targets meaningless, it will cripple community and business confidence and send a terrible signal to the rest of the world,” she said. “The longer we stay as Fortress Australia, the slower and shallower our recovery will be as we deter foreign investment and major projects, due to the lack of skilled workers; as we put a ‘not welcome’ sign up to tourists; and as we say no to international students.”

Premier refuses to divulge plans for post-jab-target restrictions

Full text: Annastacia Palaszczuk will not say what Covid restrictions will ­remain once Australia reaches its vaccination target of 80 per cent, as Queensland readies for ­increased Pfizer supplies.
The Queensland Premier said Delta had “moved the goalposts” on reopening plans and national cabinet agreed new modelling was needed before decisions could be made on when to abolish lockdowns and border closures.
State and territory leaders last month agreed to vaccination rate thresholds recommended by the Doherty Institute, which were based on there being 30 active cases in the community.
“We continue to back the ­nationally agreed plan for lockdowns to be minimised and ­restrictions to be limited when vaccination rates reach 70 to 80 per cent,” Ms Palaszczuk said.
“(The federal government) has commissioned more research ­because the goalposts have changed.
“So the goalposts have changed in the fact that it was premised on there being around 30 cases and now we have thousands of cases.” Ms Palaszczuk said her state was still pursuing a suppression strategy and was aiming for 80 per cent vaccination.
“But even 70 per cent and 80 per cent vaccination rates, as I have said and as is in the modelling as well, there will be some limited restrictions and some limited, or specified, lockdowns.” Ms Palaszczuk said “everyone on national cabinet”, which ­includes Scott Morrison, agreed extra modelling was now needed.
Under the Prime Minister’s freedom plan, lockdowns are still possible when 70 per cent of the population is vaccinated.
Mr Morrison said he was ­advised by Doherty Institute professor Jodie McVernon at the weekend that high case numbers would not change the overall plan.
“There is further sensitivity work that’s being done around that,” he said. Meanwhile, Queensland’s Health Minister fears Pfizer doses will go to waste if more people do not join the state’s vaccine waitlist.
Yvette D’Ath said the state vaccinated 112,397 people in the past week and there were only 70,000 people in the jab queue.
Ms D’Ath said those aged 16-59 years who wanted the Pfizer vaccine were very likely to get a booking slot in the next fortnight. “We have Pfizer and we want you to come forward and get vaccinated,” she said.

Premier Annastacia Palaszczuk on Monday would not back down from her deputy’s comments that Queensland might not open its border to NSW even when vaccination rates hit 80 per cent.
Updated modelling from the Doherty Institute is likely to be used to reinforce the existing plan to start easing restrictions at 70 and 80 per cent, even with NSW battling hundreds of cases a day.
The vaccination plan for children aged 12-16 and those younger will also be discussed at national cabinet, as it shapes up as the next flashpoint issue.
Seeking to fire up the public’s support for the national plan, Mr Morrison said “this groundhog day has to end”.
“There has to be a plan out, there is a plan out and we have to move forward with that plan,” he said.
“The national plan is our deal with all Australians. It is the understanding that we have with Australians making their sacrifices now, and who have made them over such a long time, that that sacrifice will get them to the next step.
“Because if not at 70 per cent and 80 per cent, then when? Then when?” Mr Morrison said there would be those who would seek to undermine the national plan, but denied he was talking about states such as Queensland where the Premier has been crab walking away from the deal.
The reinvigorated Prime Minister’s fired-up performance has been welcomed by his colleagues, who had become increasingly concerned about his lacklustre showings, with premiers having kept him on the ropes in recent weeks.
Cases continued to rise across the country, with NSW recording 818 cases in a day, Victoria and the ACT ­remaining in lockdown and even New Zealand admitting it may not achieve zero Covid under the Delta strain of Covid.
NSW Premier Gladys Berejiklian urged people “not to have the rollercoaster of ­emotions at case numbers every day”, saying that was not the most important thing to consider.
“Every state is going to have to go through this ­transition, one way or another because once you open your borders, we can’t live in isolation forever,” she said. Ms Palaszczuk would not be drawn on how Queensland will open up once vaccination rates hit 80 per cent, saying we’re in “uncharted territory”.
Ms Palaszczuk said everyone was still aiming for the 70 to 80 per cent vaccination goal, but that there was also an agreement for extra ­modelling based on the current situation.
“They have commissioned more research because the goalposts have changed. It was premised on there being 30 cases in the community and now there are thousands,” Ms Palaszczuk said of the Doherty research.
She said that her goal was ­always to suppress the virus and so there would be some limited and specified ­restrictions and lockdowns in the future.
“This is a book that hasn’t been written, folks,” Ms Palaszczuk said. “This is uncharted territory.” Ms Palaszczuk said Delta was incredibly infectious, and the other concern was children.
“We have to get children vaccinated, especially in those high school years … because we know that it can be spread.” “This is a big job,” she said.
Business Council of Australia chief executive Jennifer Westacott called on leaders to “stick to the numbers” around reopening the country and slammed the “constant state of uncertainty” created by Queensland’s threat to withdraw from a national Covid-19 ­reopening plan.
“If leaders walk away from the national reopening plan or make the targets meaningless, it will cripple community and business confidence and send a terrible signal to the rest of the world,” she said. “The longer we stay as Fortress Australia, the slower and shallower our recovery will be as we deter foreign investment and major projects, due to the lack of skilled workers; as we put a ‘not welcome’ sign up to tourists; and as we say no to international students.”

Kelly joins Palmer party for access to war chest

Full text: Former Liberal MP Craig Kelly has joined Clive Palmer's United Australia Party so he can access a war chest of funds to more widely share his controversial views over the handling of the coronavirus pandemic.
Mr Kelly resigned from the Coalition in February after criticism he had been sharing misinformation about COVID-19 and the treatments for the virus. He will now share his views on a national stage as the front man for the United Australia Party, and when he fights his NSW seat of Hughes.
"The crude reality is that I'll have greater resources [with the United Australia Party]," Mr Kelly said. In the last election, mining magnate Clive Palmer donated a record of more than $80 million to his party in a bid for federal parliament, with much of the money splashed on major advertising campaigns across newspapers, billboards and other media.
"I have been screaming this stuff from the rooftops for a long time. It's very hard to get this message through," Mr Kelly said.
"We have a huge war chest, we can run television commercials, ads, we can finance a proper campaign that no other minor party or independent can," he said.
Mr Kelly said his advertisements would be considered party political advertisements and in his view blocking them would be a breach of the constitution.
"I think it's important that there's more debate about the current policies and direction where the country is going," Mr Kelly said, adding that both the Labor and Liberal parties seemed to broadly agree on lockdowns, masks and vaccinations.
"I think the policies are all flawed. I think they're causing an absolute disaster across the country," he said. "The laser-like focus on case numbers ... it's as though the nation has been hypnotised."
He said there was not enough focus on the damage the lockdowns cause in comparison to the benefits of reducing hospitalisations and deaths, and not enough focus on treatments. This includes malaria treatment hydroxychloroquine and parasite treatment Ivermectin. Mr Kelly was banned from Facebook after posting about these treatments as its moderators said this constituted a repeat violation of its misinformation rules. Australian health authorities do not recognise either medication as treatments for COVID-19.
Mr Kelly also said the Doherty Institute modelling that national cabinet is using to plan the path out of the pandemic was "completely flawed" as it relied on the high efficacy rates of the vaccine.

Chief Medical Officer’s hint on when Australia can reopen

Author: Priest, Evin

Publication info: News.com.au ; Sydney, N.S.W. [Sydney, N.S.W]. 22 Aug 2021.

Full text: Professor Kelly addressed media on Sunday as 891 new locally acquired infections were recorded around the country.
There are 554 Australians in hospital with Covid-19 while there are an estimated 10,223 active cases in the country.
As both new infections and vaccinations soar in Australia, Professor Kelly said there were lessons to be learned in places such as Israel where outbreaks have surged but hospitalisations and deaths have been limited due to vaccination.
Professor Kelly backed the federal government’s claim that restrictions could lift once key vaccination targets are met, regardless of case numbers.
NSW was the state with the most Covid-19 hospitalisations but admissions were also beginning to climb in other states.
“They (rising numbers of cases) are starting present to hospital and intensive care are also increasing,” Professor said.
“Particularly in NSW but also in other jurisdictions. This is something we've (hospitals) been planning for, for 18 months, and we know that our hospitals, particularly our intensive care, are ready for this.”
Professor Kelly praised Australians for reaching 52 per cent of people (older than 16) having received at least one dose of the vaccine (10.8 million doses) while 30 per cent (6.2 million) of the same age group are fully vaccinated.
Those figures come after Australia gave out 196,000 doses of vaccinations on Saturday.
“1.1 million doses in four days, we're getting close to 2 million a week and it is close to what we are planning to do in the coming weeks,” he said.
“That is extraordinary, thank you have one involved.”
Professor Kelly said lessons could be learned from the UK and Israel and their experiences with vaccinations and opening up.
Israel has fully vaccinated 80 per cent of its adult population but the country registered 7600 new infections overnight.
Some Australian premiers have expressed hesitancy towards lifting restrictions once 70 or 80 per cent of Australian adults are vaccinated, warning the modelling used by national cabinet uses low case numbers in the community.
“Does this need to go back to the drawing board? The answer is absolutely not,” Professor Kelly said.
“The assumption is of course all modelling can be changed and sensitivity analysis, that’s the technical terms for what’s being done by the Doherty Institute, can be relatively easily done.”
Professor Kelly said expectations were always for case numbers to rise as the country opens but stressed the importance of vaccination.
“(There are) lots of lessons; when the UK decided to open up, they did have an increase in cases but not an increase in any great extent in deaths or in hospitalisations or ICU except in some small pockets of the population, particularly in the Midlands, where they had lower than the national average vaccination rates,” he said.
“They have actually done what we are proposing to do at that around 80 per cent rate of vaccination.
“Israel similarly, they recently have seen an increase in cases but the death rates in hospitalisation rates have not increased the great extent.
“We’ve absolutely looked at those (countries) every day and every week and are learning from their experiences.”

PM urges states to stick to deal on lockdowns

Full text: Scott Morrison has warned state and territory leaders not to breach a compact with Australians by locking down after vaccination rates reach 80 per cent, as he ­attempts to salvage the nation’s four-step pandemic recovery plan amid open division within the ­national cabinet.
The Prime Minister said the ­national plan, which would terminate lockdowns once vaccination rates hit 80 per cent, was a “deal with Australians” to encourage take-up of the jab.
“You’re taking the instructions. You’re making the sacrifices. You’re getting tested. You’re isolating. You’re getting vaccinated,” Mr Morrison said. “And the ­national plan is a deal with Australians, which says when we achieve those marks of 70 per cent and 80 per cent, there’ll be changes. And I’m committed to that plan.
“And premiers and chief ministers have signed up to that plan, but they haven’t signed up with me. They’ve signed up with the Australian people.” There have been 16.5 million doses of Covid-19 vaccines administered in Australia, including 1.7 million over the past week.
With NSW and Victoria facing tougher lockdowns, Josh Frydenberg cautioned leaders not to ­expect ongoing federal economic support from once their populations reached the 70-80 per cent vaccination threshold.
West Australian Premier Mark McGowan has reserved the right to continue lockdowns when the vaccination rates are above 80 per cent, while other leaders have given conflicting advice on the path out of Covid.
NSW Premier Gladys Berejiklian said she was examining minimal easings of restrictions for September, but that these and further freedoms for October would be outlined next week.
Asked how people would be able to prove their vaccinated ­status – in the event that vaccinated people were given greater freedoms – Ms Berejiklian said her government was developing technology to make it possible. “At the moment you can go through Medicare and verify that you’ve been vaccinated – but NSW is also working on an easy-to-use feature which will be linked into QR codes.” Victorian Premier Daniel Andrews said the “game-changing” vaccination rate was 80 per cent, at which point he was willing to ease restrictions. “Every leader in the country, regardless of what political party they’re from, is committed to that national plan,” he said.
He said letting the virus rip was not an option and said the “narrative” that Australians could live with the virus was unhelpful.
Queensland Deputy Premier Steven Miles said the need for lockdowns was “less likely” when 70 to 80 per cent of the population was vaccinated, but could not rule them out completely.
“The modelling is based on a number of assumptions. It was done at a time when transmission in the community was very, very low and that is not the case now,” he said. “We cannot predict the future.” Mr Andrews and ACT Chief Minister Andrew Barr criticised Mr Morrison for his surprise ­announcement on Thursday that Pfizer vaccines would be available for people aged 16-39 at the end of August. “I wouldn’t be banking on anything being here in two weeks, like I haven’t seen that stock,” Mr ­Andrews said. “Is it even here?” Mr Morrison said he was awaiting interim advice on opening the vaccination program for 12 to 16-year-olds.
Opposition health spokesman Mark Butler called on Mr Morrison to “set a clear case number ­target for when restrictions are lifted”. “The Doherty Institute modelling does not assume restrictions can be lifted in the way they outline if case numbers are still in the hundreds,” Mr Butler said. “So what is that number?”

Full text: Some of the most populated parts of Sydney and Melbourne could fall short of key vaccination targets despite rapid inoculation rollout, potentially leaving hundreds of thousands of people in at-risk communities exposed to COVID-19.
Health experts say it's crucial to know which areas are falling behind so concerted efforts could be made to increase rates, but also to know where future outbreaks could occur.
The federal government has set a target for the nation and all states and territories to fully vaccinate 70 per cent of the eligible population before Australia can move into the "transition" phase of the planned four-phase recovery from the pandemic.
The country can move to the third "consolidation" phase with fewer restrictions once vaccination rates reach 80 per cent.
The target is a jurisdiction-wide average and does not take into account possible differences within a state or territory.
In Sydney, vaccinating communities in the western suburbs will be key to reaching 70 per cent.
Doherty Institute infectious diseases epidemiologist James McCaw said granular vaccination data was vital to knowing what areas should be targeted with extra immunisation efforts.
"There is no one uniform, safe vaccine coverage level when you start looking at it at this smaller geographic and social level," he said.
Almost 31 per cent of the state's 6.6 million people aged 16 or more live in Sydney's western suburbs.
The city's south-west and the North Sydney-Hornsby areas are both home to about 430,000 vaccine-eligible people.
Across North Sydney, more than 37 per cent of people are already fully vaccinated but across the south-west just 21.9 per cent are double dosed. So important are Sydney's western suburbs that the state will find it almost impossible to reach its vaccine target without the region hitting the 70 per cent and 80 per cent benchmarks.
Professor McCaw, part of the Doherty team which will produce more detailed modelling in coming weeks, said it was important health authorities knew of differences between regions such as the make-up of those communities.
The federal government is preparing for differences between when the states and territories reach the 70 per cent target.
NSW could hit the 70 per cent mark a month earlier than WA, for example.
But within states, the expectation is that incentives - such as easing of restrictions - could be used to encourage particular parts of a city or region to get vaccinated.
Prime Minister Scott Morrison said it was a "fair assessment" that some regions could be left short of the targets even if the overall state reached those levels.
He said this meant those at-risk communities would have to be targeted in coming weeks and months.
"As we move into those 70 per cent and 80 per cent phases ... that where communities in particular remain vulnerable because of lower vaccination rates, then we will have to be more careful in those places," he said on Tuesday.

Focus will be on key areas in bid to reach 70% vaccination level

Full text: Some of the most populated parts of Melbourne and Sydney could fall short of the federal government's key vaccination targets despite the rapid rollout of inoculations, potentially leaving hundreds of thousands of people in at-risk communities exposed to COVID-19.
Health experts say it's crucial to know what areas are falling behind so efforts can be made to increase vaccination rates, but also to know where future outbreaks could occur.
The federal government has set a target for the nation and all states and territories to fully vaccinate 70 per cent of the eligible population before Australia can move into the "transition" phase of the planned four-phase recovery from the pandemic. The country can move to the third "consolidation" phase with fewer restrictions once those vaccination rates reach 80 per cent.
The target is a jurisdiction-wide average and does not take into account possible differences within a state or territory. In Victoria, lower vaccination rates in parts of the capital mean an effort is needed to pull the state up to that target, while in NSW, vaccinating communities in Sydney's western suburbs will be key to reaching 70 per cent.
Doherty Institute infectious diseases epidemiologist and University of Melbourne professor James McCaw said granular vaccination data was vital to knowing what areas should be targeted with extra immunisation efforts.
Melbourne's north-east, north-west and western suburbs are home to more than 27 per cent of Victoria's 5.4 million residents aged 16 or older. Yet the full vaccination rate for these three areas is just 22 per cent, the lowest rate in the state.
It's a similar story in Melbourne's south-east suburbs, which are home to more than 800,000 people.
So many people live in these parts of Melbourne that if one or both fall short, the entire state will struggle to meet the 70 per cent target. There's a shortfall of almost 150,000 people in the western suburbs alone if just 60 per cent get fully vaccinated compared to a 70 per cent rate. In the south-eastern suburbs, the shortfall is close to 120,000 people.
In NSW, almost 31 per cent of the state's 6.6 million people aged 16 or more live in Sydney's western suburbs. The city's south-west and the North Sydney-Hornsby areas are both home to about 430,000 vaccine-eligible people. Across North Sydney, more than 37 per cent of people are fully vaccinated but across the south-west just 21.9 per cent are double dosed. So important are Sydney's western suburbs, the state will find it almost impossible to reach its vaccine target without the region hitting 70 per cent and 80 per cent benchmarks.
Professor McCaw, part of the Doherty team which will produce more detailed modelling in coming weeks, said it was important health authorities were conscious of the differences between regions such as the make-up of those communities.
University of Sydney professor Julie Leask, an adviser to the World Health Organisation, said regional vaccination rates need to factor into the wider aim for good coverage.
"National coverage levels must also have a metric that accounts for or answers to how well we're dealing with inequity in access to vaccination services," she said.
The federal government is preparing for differences between when the states and territories reach the 70 per cent target. NSW could hit the 70 per cent mark a month earlier than WA. But within states, the expectation is incentives - such as easing restrictions - could encourage particular parts of a city or region to get vaccinated.

Overnight success or overreach: Views divided on curfew

Full text: Experts say it's extremely difficult to work out what effect an overnight curfew had on reducing Melbourne's case numbers during its second wave but say it's likely the reintroduced measure limits overall movement.
The return of 9pm to 5am stay-at-home directions by the state government on Monday reignited debate about curfews, with the state opposition describing it as an "unnecessary overreach" and the police union and civil liberty group Liberty Victoria both also opposing the measure.
Concerns have also been raised about the disproportionate effect tough enforcement measures such as a curfew could have on groups such as those from non-English-speaking backgrounds, people in insecure work and young people, with many still struggling to pay fines from last year's lockdown.
Some health experts have backed the tough restrictions, warning they were the only way for Victoria to avoid following NSW into a disastrous outbreak, but others are more sceptical.
Experts involved in modelling of COVID-19 for the Victorian and federal governments said it was hard to work out what effect the curfew had during the second wave last year because it was introduced in August 2020 as part of a package of measures, which included a five-kilometre travel limit and limits on exercise.
Further complicating matters, a week later the government ordered thousands of shops, offices and factories to close.
"So it's difficult to pull apart," said the University of Melbourne's Jason Thompson, who worked on the Victorian government's epidemic modelling.
Rohan Byrne, who has spent much of the past 18 months tracking mobility across Melbourne, said the entire package "certainly did have an emphatic and immediate effect" on case numbers. "But we didn't hit rock bottom until the tightening of the 'essential businesses' criteria a week later."
Victoria is the only state or territory that has imposed a curfew as part of lockdown restrictions.
A paper published in Nature Human Behaviour in November, looking across 79 countries, found movement restrictions - which included curfews - had a small but significant effect on limiting the spread of COVID-19.
Research funded by the state government found mandatory masking made the largest difference in controlling the second wave. Physical distancing - which includes the effects of curfew - played a lesser role.
"It is very hard - read: impossible - to decouple all the effects and get curfew on its own," said Dr Michael Lydeamore, a Monash University researcher and co-author of the paper.
Tiffany Overall, advocacy and human rights officer at YouthLaw, said she was concerned about the way the curfew would be enforced, and called on police to continue to apply discretion with young people, particularly the homeless or those fleeing family violence.

Full text: ANNASTACIA Palaszczuk has refused to detail whether she’ll open up the state and let the virus run once most of the community is fully vaccinated.
The Premier was repeatedly asked whether she would continue to pursue a no-Covid policy once 80 per cent of the population is vaccinated, or whether she’d let the virus run.
But while she said she agreed that hitting that threshold would allow an easing of restrictions, she repeatedly said that was a long way away and would not answer what her strategy would be at that point. “These are decisions that are being talked about at national cabinet,” Ms Palaszczuk said. “We are provided constantly with advice from the Doherty Institute and what the Doherty Institute is saying is that 80 per cent national threshold is what we are aiming towards. So we haven’t reached that yet.” The Doherty Institute modelling expected 80 per cent of the population to be vaccinated by the end of November. The modelling revealed even if we hit an 80 per cent vaccination rate, about 1300 people would die over six months in an out-of-control outbreak.

Full text: The strict week-long snap lockdown from 5pm Saturday was announced two hours prior in a shock tweet by Deputy Premier John Barilaro.
Queensland ramped up its border restrictions with only essential workers able to cross the border.
The short notice has left Tweed businesses devastated and forced to throw out thousands of dollars of stock.
Burleigh MP Michael Hart warned one southern Gold Coast school would face a significant staff shortage, with more than 28 of its staff living in NSW and unable to cross the border.

Palm Beach Currumbin State High School is facing a shortfall of 28 teachers when classes resume on Monday with the school warning parents most students would “a change in their teaching and learning experiences”.
Palm Beach Currumbin SHS principal Peter Hughes said where a student’s regular teacher was not able to attend school most classes would be delivered virtually under supervision or by a replacement teacher.
If a student from a border town was not able to attend school the teacher would contact the student to outline a plan for remote learning, Mr Hughes said.

Mr Hart, had declined to name the school, said: “I spoke to the principal and they have spent all weekend planning for what they are going to do, they have a lot of teachers who live in NSW,” he said.
“They are hoping to get by but I want to know whether the government actually has a plan for what is happening.
“If this is just one school in my electorate, then how many others across the Gold Coast are going to be impacted?”
Tweed councillor James Owen said some NSW residents who work in Queensland had even attempted to relocate across the border for the duration of the lockdown.
He said Tweed residents were struggling under the weight of the lockdown, which came despite the region not recording any positive cases.
“It is going to be a tough week and it is going to put businesses under massive financial stress,” he said.
“Everyone is exhausted from it, people have to let staff go, people they’re close to, because they cannot pay the rent or bills.
“There is a real sense of shock and we are on the ropes, because we do not know how long this is going to go for.”
The Australian's Editor-at-Large Paul Kelly says NSW coronavirus numbers are "alarming" with the trend continuing to increase which is now a "threat" to the national recovery."The premiers are now attacking NSW on the basis that it risks conflicting with the national cabinet's decision," Mr Kelly told Sky News Australia."They are concerned about what Gladys Berejiklian might do at 50 per cent vaccination in terms of easing conditions."They are concerned that the national agenda to open up at 70 per cent is going to be compromised if there is still many, many cases in NSW."This is also a grave concern to Scott Morrison."
Prime Minister Scott Morrison on Sunday refused to comment when grilled about whether he supported the NSW government’s decision to announce it was putting all of regional NSW into lockdown via a tweet rather than by a live press conference as all other states had done.
Mr Morrison said he backed the decision to shutdown the regional areas, including Tweed Heads.
“I confirmed the decision of the New South Wales government to have a statewide lockdown, consistent with the advice that I had received from the chief medical officer that the government has considered and had been discussed with the NSW government,” he said.
Prime Minister Scott Morrison says Australia has secured an additional 1 million Pfizer doses and will prioritise 530,000 for the 12 Sydney local government areas of concern. “We have been in discussions with the Polish government now for several weeks, and we have secured an additional just over 1 million doses of Pfizer and they will start landing in Australia from tonight,” he said.“These doses are on top of the 40 million Pfizer doses that Australia has already contracted to be delivered, and of course will be ramping up again significantly in the fourth quarter of this year.“Now the 1 million doses – I’ve discussed this with the NSW premier yesterday – will be targeted to Australians aged 20 to 39 years of age who are identified in the Doherty modelling as the peak transmitters for COVID-19. “530,000 of these doses will be prioritised for express delivery to the 12 city local government areas where the COVID-19 outbreak continues to grow. “Further doses will turn up over the course of this week, and the balance of the doses will be provided to the remaining states and territories on a per capita basis, not including NSW of course, because they will have received those first 530,000 doses.”
NSW Premier Gladys Berejiklian defended the decision, saying she had acted on “health advice”. “To be frank, by yesterday most of the state was locked down already,” she said. “It was just a few local government areas in regional and rural communities.
“In a pandemic, you have to act on the health advice you receive and we had received advice yesterday about many people moving from the ACT to the southern parts of New South Wales which was a concern given what is happening in the ACT so that advice was provided to me yesterday and we took that advice immediately.”
But Mr Owen said the suddenness of the lockdown had caught many Northern Rivers residents by surprise and caused significant grief.

Gold Coast Mayor Tom Tate warned the Tweed lockdown would make life harder for the thousands of people who cross it daily for work.
“The Covid crisis spreading across New South Wales right now is the biggest wake up call we can all get,” he said.
“Now, more than ever, is the time for everyone to get vaccinated. Only a vaccinated community will bring an end to these harsh lockdowns that are destroying economies across Australia.
“I urge all Gold Coasters to do two things: get vaccinated and spend locally. These two steps will go a long way towards helping every Gold Coast business through this economic and social challenges.”
Tweed MP Geoff Provest said the lockdown was “quite devastating.”

Full text: The formless threat of future Covid variants tests our hopes, our ingenuity and our resilience
Round each turn on the Covid road – and the number of turns ever multiplies like a cancer – the view ahead glistens with hope. The hope is of predictability, of a timetable, of a plan that can be trusted to work – in short, confidence about the end of uncertainty. The need for order is primary among humans. With pandemic, as with war, minds can easily become obsessed with the fantasy, fed by anxiety, of an end in sight. When there is no end in sight, recurring panic attacks may follow.
Australia has just plunged into a new phase of formless free-floating panic – at the sheer uncertainty that faces us. It may be glimpsed in the faces of state and federal political leaders, and in their tone. The fear is starting to grow that there may be no end in sight. And who knows what levels of unease, and worse, are rising behind closed suburban doors across the eastern states, with the streets ominously empty once again.
On each turn on the pandemic road so far, hopes have proved illusory. Covid-19 is staying true to type – a slippery elusive monster that almost seems to delight in outwitting us humans, in mockery of our pride in scientific reason and technological ingenuity. Hope so far has fizzled out every time, in decisive rebuff.
The latest turn has been the hope for vaccine salvation. 2020 became focused on a vaccine being available by the end of the year, a vaccine that would quickly negate the virus threat. Now, eight months into 2021, and with majority populations vaccinated in a handful of countries, a new wave of uncertainty threatens. Israel, Singapore and Holland have opened up only to see rapid acceleration in infection numbers, followed by a growing threat to hospitals, forcing those countries to reimpose restrictions. The same is happening across the United States – Florida hospitals are full. Britain is being watched around the world with fascination, as it tries the same perilous experiment of staring down the virus monster, challenging it do its worst as the public begins to socialise freely.
A further dimension of uncertainty has been added with the Delta variant. The young who were, with earlier strains, seen to be relatively safe from the virus are now vulnerable. More are needing hospitalisation, some intensive care. And, serious for the longer term, the young are becoming prime carriers.
Learning to live with Covid, the futuristic sci-fi devil that became manifest, is tortuously difficult. Given future unknowns, it is not even clear what, in reality, the bleakest scenario might entail. Some degree of herd immunity will come. But even that is ambiguous. Many assume that once a person is vaccinated, they are safe. Multiply that up to 80 per cent of a total population then the virus is contained.
But a person vaccinated against, say, measles is more likely to catch measles in an unvaccinated population than an unvaccinated person in a predominantly vaccinated population. This means, to take the critical case, that an unvaccinated population of schoolchildren may become the next frontier of Covid infection, that is whenever most adults have been vaccinated. Combating the Delta variant in the short to medium term may necessitate home schooling becoming the norm rather than the exception.
Above all, what will come to constitute a tolerable level of herd immunity is likely to be a complex sum of vaccination patterns and sequences through all age groups, in combination with other types of immunity. This complex, viewed from today’s standpoint, is a perplexing unknown.
Many claim their rights are being infringed and that governments are cavalierly increasing their powers under the cloak of emergency. Surely, in answer, the liberal principle remains supreme: that individuals should be free to do whatever they choose unless their act harms others. Lockdown does curtail individual freedoms but does so in order to limit the widespread social harm of illness and death. Likewise, mass vaccination is justified in enabling herd immunity which will, in the end, work for the greater good.
One sign of the generalised social panic in the air is the flight by normally rational people to social media sites spreading sensationalist untruths about Covid and its prevention.
It is less clear how coercive a society should become in punishing the tens of thousands who flout prudent law to attend anti-lockdown demonstrations, or in enforcing vaccination among those who resist. In the end, how many of the hesitant get vaccinated will depend on social cohesion. The collective conscience proved strong in Victoria last year, reflected in high acceptance of lockdowns, and compliance, so I think we can be confident that 80 per cent of Australians will agree to vaccination. Science, smart management and common sense have proved our best tools in the current war. Victoria has handled its recent Covid outbreaks much better than in the past because of efficient QR codes, faster and higher volume contact tracing and testing, and a more refined quarantining system – it has learnt from past mistakes. It is only fair to acknowledge this, especially by those many commentators, including myself, who were critical of the Andrews government and its shambolic Health Department last year.
And, as a nation, we have benefited from the federation structure. It has been vindicated in this pandemic, with management functioning more efficiently on a smaller, more local scale, decentralised down to the states. Differences of opinion among the premiers have actually helped the public debate about alternative strategies in defending against Covid.
Science is not infallible. With pandemic anxiety triggering a rush to spurious certainty, it has itself shown irrationalities. ATAGI, in cutting back its AstraZeneca recommendation to those over 60 – the AZ vaccine which saved Britain – showed a bewildering inability to weigh up risk probabilities of vaccine versus infection. It behaved like a timid bureaucracy with no big picture vision.
Also, furious epidemiological modelling is proceeding to plot possible future infection paths and rates, with the federal government currently pinning some policy hopes on the results. Good luck with that! Mathematical modelling was used last year in the long Victorian lockdown with spectacular irrelevancy.
The greatest uncertainty of all, one that faces the entire globe, is the fear of virus mutation into a variant resistant to current vaccines – Professor Peter Doherty has recently voiced just such a worry. The mega-spread of Covid internationally brings significant threat of mutation. If so, what will follow Delta? And then, what will the delays be in discovering and producing new effective vaccines. Even with Delta, Israeli statistics are showing the Pfizer vaccine less effective in limiting its spread. And on, and on, cycling out into the distant future, magnifying uncertainty.
There have been modest positives. After 18 months of sparring with the virus, grandstanding commentary has become wearisome. We still hear cries of outrage about lockdowns, and their excessive limits on individual freedom, business viability, children’s education, and mental health. But we know, faced with the slippery virus monster, as surely now as night follows day that there is no alternative to lockdown. Those distressed may storm up and down, stamp the feet, even cry out, but they need to grit their teeth and accept what is.
We also know that political decision-making has been devilishly difficult. Perhaps the main Melbourne lockdown last year went longer than necessary, and Victoria would have been better off then with the softer touch of the NSW Premier.
Almost certainly, Sydney would have been better off currently with the firmer hand of Daniel Andrews at the wheel, with his more authoritarian go-hard, go-early disposition. Indeed, Gladys Berejiklian’s soft touch has turned into dithering – globally proven to be disastrous with Covid. On a third front, the federal government was forced last year into rushed juggling of different vaccine options and was unlucky. Probably, it should have moved with greater urgency on Pfizer this year, and its messaging has been haphazard and poor. The Prime Minister himself, understandably eager to provide a timetable, has valiant hopes that the country will be 70 per cent vaccinated by the end of the year. Whether or not he achieves that goal, the leading truth about government in this country, in these pandemic times, is the old cliche that it’s easy to be wise after the event.
Sydney has no foreseeable end to its current lockdown, one which could well extend for months. It might come to learn, as Melbourne might have last year, from Joseph Conrad’s allegory of life suddenly stopped in its tracks. In his novella The Shadow Line, a young captain finds purpose in life as he takes command of a sailing ship in Bangkok. But all his eager ambition is thwarted by a lack of wind. He just manages to get the ship out to sea, precipitated by his own restlessness and the tropical fever that is spreading among his crew. Becalmed for an interminable 14 days adrift in cloying tropical heat, the atmosphere on board becomes fetid, with the chief mate going mad and all the crew, apart from one, falling sick and becoming useless.
Conrad draws the conclusion that in such a state of personal and social stagnation everybody should enter into a searching intimacy with their own self. To learn not to be faint-hearted. To be able to stand up to bad luck, mistakes, and their own conscience. Face-to-face with themselves and their fate, the recommendation is for realism, honesty and resilience, if the person has it in them. Life becalmed in shutdown, long or short, with the outside bleak and motionless, and new opportunity and hope closed off, the future unknown, may require its own searching intimacy with the self. And a long patience. We are at a point with Covid of having to live with uncertainty – a social state without precedent over the last eighty years. It is now futile to behave like the nervous traveller, who has eyes only on the destination. Or the obsessive person, wanting to chart the steps on the life path, in order to tick them off one by one, as if that is living. Such devotion to fruitless, abstract planning can only aggravate incipient psychopathology. Wise advice today might rather suggest: enjoy the journey as best as you can, make the most of it, unlike the bushwalkers whose minds are so focused on the mountain peak ahead they forget to take in the view along the way. In any case, our peak keeps disappearing from view and shifting.
The craving for order and certainty is strange in a species troubled by its own mortality, troubled to the degree that all its religions focus on finding a meaning for death, that there be more to it than dust and ashes. With death, that one ultimate and inescapable human necessity, the timing is usually quite uncertain. Further, to know in advance when the grim reaper will finally strike would be a curse that could well paralyse the life. Much better to live blithely, in ignorance. In this domain, uncertainty is a blessing.
Of course, the fact that Covid-19 triggers fears of acute illness and death changes things. It threatens to bring forward the final date, lifting the saving veil of uncertainty. So, a kind of metaphysical equation is scripted, in hope: predictability and safety in the foreseeable future, that is certainty now, in order to protect the nature and timing of the unforeseeable final departure, including its mystery. The pandemic continues to scoff at all such equations. We seem mere playthings in a new normal, one in which uncertainty prevails and Covid is master.

Full text: How sick must nation become before we are well again?
Steve Waterson’s brilliant column continues his consistent theme from the get-go: that the coronaviru cure can’t be worse than the disease and that some trade-offs will have to be confronted (“Politicians have abdicated responsibility for this crisis”, 7-8/8).
A business leader broached this very reality, but Scott Morrison branded it as “insensitive”. Yet, as Waterson asks of our political leaders, “How many fruitful young lives are you happy to waste to keep those Covid numbers low? How many small businesses are you ready to see disappear? How many suicides will you tolerate? How many bankruptcies? How many children should forgo their formative primary education and socialisation? How many deaths from other untreated illness are acceptable to you? How much sorrow are you willing to impose on your subjects? How many grief-stricken families must bury parents and children without ceremony, like backyard pets? How many tears will soften your stony, self-righteous hearts?” By failing to lead the difficult discussions, a squeamish PM plus a deafening silence from his federal government colleagues is making our nation more sick.
Mandy Macmillan, Singleton, NSW
Steve Waterson makes the point that the recent modelling that the Doherty Institute has done is essentially limited to considering the direct health downside of Covid under various vaccination scenarios. However, the less direct consequences are not measured, nor the consequences of lockdowns. Surely citizens’ lives fractured, sickness induced by stress, businesses destroyed and so on are worth measuring? This can be balanced against saved lives.
It may be considered Orwellian to attempt to put an economic measure on human pain and suffering or relief from it. However, this is done regularly by the federal Department of Health in assessing the costs and benefits of taxpayers’ money being spent on new expensive drugs. If we are to have modelling, it should consider all major factors on both sides of the equation. The outcome will be approximate, but worth doing.
Mark Sibree, Canterbury, Vic
Another brilliant article by Steve Waterson articulating the thoughts, I hope, of most Australians. I am only guessing here, but I think many of the older Australians who died with Covid on top of their comorbidities would have been far happier to say goodbye to their loved ones, thank them and wish them good fortune rather than be cast aside as statistics for the likes of our premiers and health official to bleat on about at their fearful press conferences.
Tony Pearce, Wynnum, Qld
The virus is the guilty party here. Covid has become more infectious as it now spreads by aerosol mist so the 1.5m separation rule is not as effective. Covid also is spreading among vulnerable populations with poor language skills and a fear of authority.
You can lay the blame at the feet of the politicians if you wish, but the answer is right in front of us. Get vaccinated with AstraZeneca or Pfizer. These vaccines will save your life. Between now and Christmas we are in for a wild ride. Take care of your own health. It is your individual responsibility. Stop blaming everyone else and just get vaccinated.
Alan Woodward, South Melbourne, Vic
It is an employer’s responsibility to provide a safe workplace. Medical science proves that a Covid jab will make a safer one. Unions should be embracing the opportunity to get a free jab that delivers safety for their members, their families and the community.
Bruce Crowhurst, Burnside, SA
On reading Steve Waterson’s column, a quote from Voltaire sprang to mind: “Those who can make you believe absurdities can make you commit atrocities.” This is what we are slipping into. Hope, logic, reason, kindness, caring, all jettisoned for a cruel, mindless grab for power by the lustful few.
Ros Tooker, Bald Knob, Qld
If I wish to work in an industry that requires child safe practices I am required to obtain a Working with Children Check. Is it asking too much that in order to work in a job that requires contact with other humans (especially the elderly and the sick), food production, attendance at events, entry to services or air and other forms of travel that we are asked to produce a Vaccination Check to ensure safety?

Locking in a bleak few months

Full text: The more honest and upfront our leaders are with us about our future, the better it will go for them.
On Thursday, the Prime Minister was asked how he thought Australians would cope with at least another five months of yo-yo lockdowns.
Scott Morrison, with a small smile on his face, said the journalist was making a forecast - looking into the future. "What right now we're dealing with is a lockdown in NSW and in south-east Queensland."
That was true. But a few hours later, Victoria entered its sixth lockdown. Now reports suggest the lockdown will be extended.
That press conference moment seems to capture the point we have reached: political leaders unable or unwilling to see even a few hours into the future, with pretty much everyone else turning their minds to frank consideration of how bleak the next few months are likely to be.
I have found myself, in recent days, hitting a new point of anger with our politicians. I made the mistake, not long ago, of watching the hit comedy special Inside, which deals with the situation of being stuck in a single space for a year. It was everything promised: funny, claustrophobic, bleak.
But I realised, half an hour in, that many people watching - from America or England, say - were watching as they made their way out of lockdowns.
The grimness had passed and could be laughed at.
I had not until then felt overly frustrated by our recent lockdown - I can work, I'm fine - but something about watching what was, in some ways, a farewell to a period of time, while still stuck inside that time, was deeply unpleasant.
What "being stuck inside that time" feels like varies from place to place. For Victorians, it means constant awareness, even on zero-COVID days, that a lockdown could be imminent.
For people in NSW, right now, it means the feeling that this lockdown is likely to stretch out far, far longer than it first seemed.
Gladys Berejiklian has lately been the prime offender on the confusing optimism front. A week and a half back, modelling for national cabinet laid out 70 and 80 per cent vaccination rates as thresholds for certain freedoms.
A few days later, Berejiklian began talking about 50 per cent vaccination as a line at which some restrictions might lift. Then, for a few days, that vanished.
Did this mean the 50 per cent threshold was gone, replaced by the national cabinet thresholds? And when would we reach those thresholds?
The Prime Minister had suggested the end of the year was possible for 70 per cent but, more recently John Frewen, the military man in charge of the rollout, suggested it might be earlier.
What did that mean for lockdown duration? Were we looking at several months or something shorter?
To her credit, yesterday, Berejiklian began to knit these elements together.
Fifty per cent was still the immediate aim. It would not bring the same freedoms associated with the higher thresholds, but the government was still looking at "options moving forward into September about how we can live more freely".
This was, she said, in line with the modelling done for national cabinet. It is true this is still vague; it is also true that it is clearer than late last week.
No doubt leaders think that we expect the world of them. How can they offer certainty when everything is so uncertain? The problem, though, is that they swing wildly back and forth between the two.
Berejiklian gives us a 50 per cent target, then seems to take it away, then gives it back, kind of.
Morrison says lockdowns will be a last resort, then barracks for lockdowns, then dismisses talk of ongoing lockdowns as speculation.
Daniel Andrews tweets "Zero" and then, a day later, his state enters lockdown.
It is jarring, confusing and increasingly frustrating.
The other ridiculous element is the way we are all forced to take on the role of amateur sleuths. No single political figure tells us what we want to know. Instead, we must stitch together what Morrison says, with what Berejiklian or Andrews says, with what John Frewen says, with what the modelling says, and so on and so forth until we all go mad.
Berejiklian's press conference yesterday had one more aspect worth noting. Her rhetoric around vaccinations as the one path out of lockdown - with its implication of blaming Morrison - seemed to soften. This was as much tone as substance but seemed to indicate a truce of sorts may have been reached in the blame war between the two leaders.
For Morrison, that truce comes at the right time.
Last week was a busy, busy week. The Doherty modelling was released, there were the several lockdowns and their related developments, Berejiklian began to talk about living with COVID, and the federal government announced new draconian restrictions on Australians wanting to come home.
Yet, amid the cacophony, Anthony Albanese managed to do what he has struggled to do for two years: cut through, with his promise of $300 for each person vaccinated. There are arguments for and against the idea, but politically the contrast was what mattered: two Liberal leaders squabbling with each other while Albanese put forward a clear proposal.
If that journalist's forecast is right, and we are stuck in yo-yo-ing lockdowns for the months ahead, the anger the public feels right now will only grow. The more honest and clear our political leaders are with us right now about our future, the better it will go for them.

To her credit, yesterday, Berejiklian began to knit these elements together. Fifty per cent was still the immediate aim. It would not bring the same freedoms associated with the higher thresholds, but the government was still looking at "options moving forward into September about how we can live more freely".
This was, she said, in line with the modelling done for national cabinet. It is true this is still vague; it is also true that it is clearer than late last week.
No doubt leaders think that we expect the world of them. How can they offer certainty when everything is so uncertain? The problem, though, is that they swing wildly back and forth between the two.
Berejiklian gives us a 50 per cent target, then seems to take it away, then gives it back, kind of.
Morrison says lockdowns will be a last resort then barracks for lockdowns then dismisses talk of ongoing lockdowns as speculation.
Daniel Andrews tweets "Zero" and then, a day later, his state enters lockdown. It is jarring, confusing and increasingly frustrating.
The other ridiculous element is the way we are all forced to take on the role of amateur sleuths. No single political figure tells us what we want to know. Instead, we must stitch together what Scott Morrison says, with what Berejiklian or Andrews says, with what John Frewen says, with what the modelling says, and so on and so forth until we all go mad.
Berejiklian's press conference yesterday had one more aspect worth noting. Her rhetoric around vaccinations as the one path out of lockdown - with its implication of blaming Morrison - seemed to soften. This was as much tone as substance but seemed to indicate a truce of sorts may have been reached in the blame war between the two leaders.
For Morrison, that truce comes at the right time.
Last week was a busy, busy week. The Doherty modelling was released, there were the several lockdowns and their related developments, Berejiklian began to talk about living with COVID, and the federal government announced new draconian restrictions on Australians wanting to come home.
And yet, amid the cacophony, Anthony Albanese managed to do what he has struggled to do for two years: cut through, with his promise of $300 for each person vaccinated. There are arguments for and against the idea, but politically the contrast was what mattered: two Liberal leaders squabbling with each other while Albanese put forward a clear proposal.
If that journalist's forecast is right, and we are stuck in yo-yo-ing lockdowns for the months ahead, the anger the public feels right now will only grow. The more honest and clear our political leaders are with us right now about our future, the better it will go for them.

Full text: After its one-week suspension for breaching Google's COVID-19 misinformation policies, Sky News Australia returned to YouTube on Thursday evening with a dramatic all-singing, all-dancing assault on the American-owned tech giant.
"When big tech censors opinion for some but not for others, it's a dark day for free speech," boomed an ominous voice over. "Will you allow it? Freedom of debate and conversation should not be cancelled. Your freedom to think should not be extinguished."
Sky News digital editor Jack Houghton went on to lament that "conservatives seem to be the only people ever to be locked out of the national conversation", and while YouTube might be great at coding, "tech geeks in Silicon Valley are not very well-versed at nuance on difficult social issues".
And host Chris Kenny put it this way: "This is cancel culture writ large. This is censorship ... a US company banning Australians talking to Australians and the rest of the world".
In one of the banned videos, veteran broadcaster Alan Jones claimed COVID-19 was not by definition a pandemic and that India's death toll was not really as bad as portrayed. The World Health Organisation declared COVID-19 a pandemic in March 2020. Other clips promoted hydroxychloroquine and ivermectin as COVID-19 treatments.
This firebrand commentary has a particular appeal among the world's far-right and anti-vaxxers, and has helped give Sky News Australia a global platform with 1.9 million YouTube subscribers.
But is it dangerous enough to be banned? And in a sea of misinformation and competing claims related to COVID-19, who gets to decide which contentions and opinions get censored and which are disseminated to the public?
Nick Coatsworth, Australia's former deputy chief medical officer and now executive director of medical services at Canberra Health Services, says advocacy of "zero-COVID" and misleading statements about the AstraZeneca vaccine in mainstream media are just as dangerous as anti-vaccination propaganda on pay TV.
Coatsworth was critical of the ABC's coronavirus commentator Norman Swan after he told ABC News Breakfast on Tuesday that Sydneysiders were "guinea pigs" in an experiment of using vaccination to try to arrest an outbreak. "I don't think this has been tried anywhere else in the world," Swan said.
"No, Dr Swan, they are not guinea pigs," Coatsworth responded. "Rapid vaccination during an epidemic is part of epidemic control. And it's what every other country has done with COVID-19."
Coatsworth says Swan's comments - as well as infectious diseases expert Michelle Ananda-Rajah's remarks on Q+A in February that mass vaccination with AstraZeneca was a "population-level experiment" - are as bad as right-wing conspiracies about COVID-19 or vaccines. "There is no difference between that and an anti-vaxxer saying 'you're conducting experiments without knowing the consequences'. What is the difference? It's exactly the same language," Coatsworth says.
"The problem with the pro-lockdown, zero-COVID view is although it seems like it's a lot nicer and a lot more credible than anti-vaxxer [content], you could still end up in a pretty dark place if you try and push for COVID-zero against the Delta variant."
Coatsworth does not advocate censorship in either case but says people who hold themselves up as experts need to be held to account firmly and publicly. Meanwhile, Swan stands by his remarks, saying NSW's approach would show whether the Doherty Institute's modelling for reopening based on vaccination levels would work. "I can be criticised for calling that an experiment," Swan says. "I wasn't sure that was the right word to use - but we don't know yet the extent to which it will work."
At News Corp, which owns Sky News Australia, some high-profile commentators circled the wagons in defence of their colleagues. The Australian's columnist Peta Credlin called YouTube's decision "a serious infringement on liberty". Censorship wasn't necessarily wrong on every single occasion "but it certainly shouldn't be [left to] the commercial or political judgment of a functionary in California against which there's no recourse," she wrote. The same newspaper's investigations editor Sharri Markson said Sky's suspension was "the most extreme cancellation of free speech imaginable".
But Chris Mitchell, a long-serving former editor-in-chief of The Australian, takes a somewhat different view. He recalls watching an Alan Jones interview with independent (and former Liberal) MP Craig Kelly in which they misrepresented the UK's COVID-19 data to assert the Delta strain was far less deadly than portrayed - without accounting for the UK's very high vaccination rate.
"I follow the figures pretty closely. They misread the numbers quite badly, which is pretty dangerous."
Sky News issued a correction and removed the segment from its platforms. Jones was slammed by 2GB's Ray Hadley and the ABC's Media Watch over the "breathtaking" broadcast.
Mitchell says that's a fair cop: Jones got it wrong. But YouTube's move against Sky was surprising "given the amount of mad right-wing conspiracy stuff" that appears elsewhere on the platform, he says. "There's a lot of QAnon stuff on YouTube that's a lot harder to the right than anything Alan Jones has ever said." However, Mitchell doesn't think YouTube's decision is as serious as some commentators, including those inside News Corp, make out. "I'd say to all of them: this is not a huge deal, [it's] seven days and a handful of videos."
Neither does Mitchell see any reason for misinformation to be left online. "At one level, free speech is an important value and all journalists should support free speech and free media. But that doesn't really include the freedom to spread untruths knowingly."
So should YouTube be the sole arbiter of what Australians can see on its platform, even when that content is produced by a large media company? Or is there a role for the government regulator, the Australian Communications and Media Authority (ACMA), to get involved?
Chris Chapman, a former chair of ACMA and now president of the London-based International Institute of Communications, says these are big questions for lawmakers around the world, who need to consider whether it is satisfactory that a social media platform can make these editorial decisions and whether there is enough transparency around how they make their decisions. The same issues were at play in Facebook's decision to suspend Donald Trump's account, says Chapman, who argues there is a growing need for parliaments to "reassess all legislation to test whether it is 'fit for purpose' in what is now in reality a post-digital world, and rebuild from a 'first principles' perspective".
Executive director of the free market Institute of Public Affairs, John Roskam, has by his own declaration a "pretty extremist" attitude to free speech. But while he is no fan of YouTube's censorious decision, he says it is not a freedom of speech issue.
"There is a difference between a private organisation publishing or not publishing something, and saying something that is unlawful," says Roskam. "A private organisation such as YouTube must have the right to decide what is on its platform. Is it censorship? Yes it is. Should it be regulated? Probably not.
"The alternative of giving the government the power to decide what is on private organisations' platforms is much worse than any private censorship. The idea of [Communications Minister] Paul Fletcher ringing up Google to say 'fix up YouTube in Australia' is a joke."

Full text: AUSTRALIA’S top doctor has praised Queensland’s control of its Covid-19 outbreak, saying he was “much less concerned” about the cluster than of other states.
The comments by chief medical officer Paul Kelly (pictured) came as national cabinet signed off on Australia’s pathway to living with Covid-19, based on vaccination rates.
Prime Minister Scott Morrison and state and territory leaders stopped short, however, of committing to laws that would allow employers to make the jab compulsory across the board.
Queensland recorded 10 new locally acquired cases of coronavirus on Friday, bringing the current Delta strain cluster to a total of 89 infections.
Of the new cases, only two had been in the community for a single day. Professor Kelly, emerging from a meeting of national cabinet, said he was “much less concerned” about South East Queensland’s outbreak than he was about the growing crisis in NSW and the mystery cases impacting Victoria.
“Most of the cases (in Queensland) are being diagnosed whilst in quarantine and not infectious in the community and that control seems to be working,” Professor Kelly said.
He warned, particularly in the case of NSW, that Covid-19 had become a “pandemic of the unvaccinated”.
National cabinet has also signed off to the blueprint – based on Doherty Institute modelling – that will result in Australia “living with the virus” and limiting lockdowns to isolated occasions once 70 per cent of the community is vaccinated.
“Today it was confirmed and fully agreed that the national plan, that pathway to the position where we live with this virus,” Mr Morrison said.
He said while employers could make a “reasonable directive” for employees to get vaccinated, any direction would have to be “consistent with the law”.
Mr Morrison flagged particular scenarios where employers could mandate vaccinations for staff, including airline workers who can come into contact with people carrying the virus.
Other sectors could include people who work with the vulnerable – such as in aged care – and people who have public-facing roles, like retail, supermarkets and essential occupations.
“But ultimately employers need to consider these matters and make their own decisions remembering we do not have a mandatory vaccination policy in this country,” he said.
National cabinet also discussed the use of rapid antigen tests, with Mr Morrison signalling the tests were not appropriate while the country was still in the suppression stage of its Covid-19 response. Countries such as Singapore have rolled out at-home rapid antigen test kits so people can tests themselves for Covid-19, but Mr Morrison said at this stage it was vital health authorities were able to pick up all positive cases and deal with contact tracing.

Full text: FLIGHT CENTRE CEO GRAHAM ‘SKROO’ TURNER REVEALS HIS PLAN TO DELIVER AUSSIES FROM THIS COVID MESS AND RETURN THE COUNTRY TO THE FREEDOMS WE ALL ENJOY THE widespread lockdowns that we are once again experiencing may be frustrating and costly, but they may also finally provide the much-needed boost our Covid-19 shot-in-the-arm program requires to ensure as many Australians as possible are vaccinated as quickly as possible.    As lockdown frustration has intensified and as the costs – financial, mental and emotional – have skyrocketed, attention has inevitably turned to finding more sustainable ways to safely and sensibly navigate our way out of the pandemic and to return to a degree of normalcy in our everyday lives, while protecting the vulnerable and minimising hospitalisations.    The near-term solution, as things currently stand, is obviously the vaccination program and it appears that it is now starting to gain some real momentum, after a fairly sluggish start.
Politicians at all levels of government are talking about fast-tracking the roll-out and people are seemingly recognising the potential benefits and displaying an increased willingness to roll up their sleeves.
Roll them up Vaccinations are, of course, the fuel that will drive us along Prime Minister Scott Morrison’s recently released roadmap out of the pandemic.  When this four-phase roadmap was unveiled a little over a month ago it initially attracted a fair degree of criticism (roadmap rage) in the media, the opposition and certainly among the travel and tourism industries.
It initially appeared that the plan was wishy washy on timetables and milestones and seemingly lacking in urgency.
In essence, it lacked key information that is integral to any roadmap – namely, the timelines as to when we can expect to turn the next important corner and the significant milestones that we will pass along the way.   Late last week, the Prime Minister and the national cabinet provided some of this information, along with detailed modelling undertaken by the Doherty Institute.
THE PATH AHEAD There are, of course, many moving parts – not least the current outbreaks in NSW and Queensland – but I think that the path the national cabinet has advocated can lead us out of the Covid mess Australia is in now and that most of this pathway can potentially be achieved relatively quickly, as covered in greater detail a little later.   This will help prevent us from being rapidly left behind the rest of the western world in our freedoms through random lockdowns, tight restrictions on normal activities and widespread border restrictions.     Our understanding of the roadmap is that it requires us to initially ramp up vaccinations and trial home quarantine for the fully vaccinated, then move from elimination to suppression, accepting that there will be some endemic infection.      We can significantly limit hospitalisations and deaths by ensuring the vulnerable (the elderly and those with pre-existing health conditions) are vaccinated if they want to be as quickly as possible, followed soon after by other lower risk groups among the general population.   Assuming this all goes to plan, we can then stop lockdowns as Covid-19 is suppressed, not eliminated, and hospitals are coping with the case load, which effectively means we are living with the virus in a similar way we live with many other infectious diseases.  living with it  To be living with the virus, returning to normalcy and opening Australia back up to the world in the next five or six months, we really need two things to happen.     Firstly, the elderly and the vulnerable need to be protected. Once this is achieved, hospitalisations among adults will largely be vulnerable people who do not want to be vaccinated.
 Secondly, public servants, politicians and the public in general will need to accept that as some stage we have to live with the virus in the community under a suppression, rather than total elimination, regimen and in a safe and sensible way.  This was acknowledged in the Doherty Institute’s report and Australia has probably reached this point now.
VAX DEATHS RARE On a positive note, vaccinated deaths appear to be very rare.  As of early July, 99.5 per cent of Covid-19 deaths in the US were in unvaccinated people, according to Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) director Dr Rochelle Walensky.   Of 157 million people who had been vaccinated, 733 died of Covid-19, per CDC data noted recently by Insider’s Andrea Michelson and Mia de Graaf.  By comparison, there had been more than 600,000 deaths from Covid-19 in the US, according to Johns Hopkins University data.  timetable and Milestones  Around the same time as the Prime Minister initially unveiled his four-phase roadmap, Flight Centre Travel Group, with the support of the travel, cruise, tour operators, airports, airlines, education, mining and farming industries, released a plan that was in some ways similar to the national cabinet’s blueprint.  The FCTG and industry plan though has possible timelines attached to it, as outlined below.    If this plan goes to “plan” – and nothing seems ironclad in the Covid-19 world – it’s possible that we could have a return to freedom and a level of normalcy well before Christmas 2021.    Phase One is built around fast-tracking vaccinations and piloting a home quarantine model during the next couple of months.    This involves vaccinating the vulnerable and old (1a and 1b) and expediting the overall vaccination rates to perhaps 7 million a month.
During this first phase, Vaccination Passports will be introduced and a home quarantine model piloted for the fully vaccinated.     Fast forward to the end of October and some 14 million people should be fully vaccinated (70% of adults) and 4 million more should have had one vaccination (20%).     If the phase one timeline relies on having those who are vulnerable (and who want the vaccination) protected, we are on track to achieve this milestone by the end of next month. 
PHASE TWO  Phase Two focuses on minimising hospitalisations and fatalities and we expect to start to see the benefits of this in August and September.    As outlined above, all vulnerable people should have been offered a vaccination by now, along with a sizeable percentage of the overall community.    Increased vaccinations and successful home quarantine trials for those who have been fully vaccinated should take pressure off hospitals and hotel quarantine facilities, which would allow for the current the caps on returning residents to be lifted and for international students to return. 
PHASE THREE Phase Three will see Australia learn to live with the virus in the community and eliminate the need for further lockdowns.    Assuming vaccinations continue to prove effective and that vulnerable people who want to be vaccinated have been, this could take place across September and October. 
PHASE FOUR    Phase Four will see a return to normal life in many ways, as most of the restrictions that are currently in place will no longer be required given that the vulnerable and many others will be fully vaccinated.    My suggestion is that this might be possible during the fourth quarter of this calendar year if we can ramp up the vaccination program as expected to about 7 million per month.   From a travel perspective, we should be able to safely open the international borders to fully vaccinated travellers without quarantine but subject to some other safeguards, including a negative antigen or PCR test. 
PASSPORT TO FREEDOM We are already seeing this in other parts of the world, including North America and the UK-Europe.    The challenge will be families with unvaccinated children unless the Therapeutic Goods Administration approves the vaccine for children.    We are, of course, dealing with a never-before-seen challenge that is evolving, so there can be no guarantees.    There is, however, cause for optimism that we can return to a more normal life in the near-term assuming that vaccinations do continue to prove successful in minimising the virus’s spread and reducing hospitalisations and fatalities.

DELTA A SWORD ABOVE OUR HEADS

Full text: HEALTH authorities have declared Victoria is on the edge, with coronavirus case numbers expected to rise on Saturday.
The Saturday Herald Sun understands new positive cases will be in the double digits, with contact tracers scrambling to get on top of the latest outbreak that has sparked a seven-day lockdown.
The state government holds serious concerns the virus may have already escaped the western suburbs, with the pandemic’s testing commander, Jeroen Weimar, warning the number of exposure sites will continue to rise.
“We did not go into lockdown because we were worried about a few cases in the western suburbs,” he said. “We are worried about a Delta penetration again here in Victoria.
“We’re worried that it might be seeding out quite widely; we’re worried it might be going to places we haven’t yet seen.” The state opposition called on the government to change its approach to lockdowns, to instead shut down hot spots rather than the entire state.
“The government needs to be a lot more targeted and a lot fairer to people living in areas where there’s no Covid,” Opposition Leader Michael O’Brien said. “This is too important. We can’t keep living like this. There’s no confidence left, there’s no hope left, there’s no optimism left.” Authorities were forced to admit “possible” unauthorised home visits had occurred and may have contributed to spread across both outbreaks.
But the government stood by its stance that rulebreakers would not be fined or publicly shamed, despite anti-lockdown protesters being told they would face justice.
“We are not going to win this by turning on each other or by fining our way through,” Mr Weimar said.
Victoria recorded six new locally acquired cases on Friday, all linked to reported cases in the Hobsons Bay and Maribyrnong outbreaks but none were in quarantine throughout their infectious period.
Genomic sequencing confirmed both clusters carried the highly infectious Delta strain, but the initial source of transmission for both clusters remained a mystery.
It was not known if either index case had any links to the Moonee Valley testing site worker, whose acquisition source also remains unknown.
Three new cases are linked to the Maribyrnong cluster, the other three – including two announced on Thursday – to Hobsons Bay.
A dedicated public health team, charged with responding to outbreaks in “sensitive settings”, is supporting the Warringa Park specialist school community after it was revealed one new case attended the Hoppers Crossing facility.
“It’s very concerning … It’s the first sensitive setting we’ve seen in this outbreak,” Mr Weimar said.
Another case, a man who lives with the Maribyrnong case, was a cleaner at Epworth Hospital in Richmond, but in the administration area and not on a general ward.
The worsening outbreak prompted Health Minister Martin Foley to call on his federal counterparts to urgently bring forward 150,000 Pfizer doses in the national allocation. “Victoria is in a precarious position when it comes to where this particular series of outbreaks are,” he said.
Prime Minister Scott Morrison warned that bosses wanting to force their workers to get vaccinated would need to comply with federal discrimination legislation after national cabinet decided against setting hard-and-fast rules about who could be ordered to get the jab.
Mr Morrison said the question of what bosses were allowed to do would turn on the question of reasonableness, such as where employees were in “regular contact” with the general public.
National cabinet has “fully agreed” to live with the virus once 70 per cent of the population is vaccinated, under the Doherty Institute’s modelling, which should mean lockdowns are limited to isolated occasions and abandoned when the country reaches 80 per cent.
Meanwhile, almost 100,000 struggling businesses will have cash payments automatically paid to them under a jointly funded $400m support package announced on Friday.
Another $2800 grant will be automatically deposited to 90,000 businesses, while almost 9000 hospitality venues will receive another round of funding between $5000 and $20,000.
An extra $54m will be added to the small business Covid hardship fund, which provides grants of up to $8000 for small businesses not eligible in other schemes which have experienced a 70 per cent reduction in turnover.
Workers who lose more than 20 hours over the next week are also eligible for a $600 Covid-19 disaster payment, to be delivered through Services Australia, while those missing out on less than 20 hours can receive $375.
Victorian Chamber of Commerce and Industry CEO Paul Guerra said the new funding package, while welcome, would not replace the losses.
Small Business Australia executive director Bill Lang said the latest business support package had come “too little, too late and for too few”. mitchell.clarke@news.com.au

Full text: EDITORIAL CHIEF health officer Jeannette Young saying that she now believes people under 60 should consider getting an AstraZeneca vaccine is a victory for common sense.
Queensland is facing its biggest threat from Covid in at least a year, with the virus spreading rapidly for the first time among children – and then their families. The situation has changed dramatically and quickly, and our response now needs to adapt in the same way.
Dr Young has been heavily criticised in recent times for holding firm on her opinion that she did not want young people to get AstraZeneca because she did not want to see a young person die from its main potential side-effect – the very rare clotting episodes that we know occur in about five in every million people to have the jab.
This risk decreases if you are aged over 60 – and this fact led the national technical advisory group ATAGI to recommend that in normal circumstances the AstraZeneca jab not be given to those under 60, as the risk of illness from the jab outweighs the risk of serious illness from Covid. But that is in normal circumstances.
The advice goes on to say that when you reach a “large outbreak”, then people aged under 60 should consider having an AstraZeneca jab after a conversation with their doctor – considering it is the only Covid vaccine currently available in sufficient numbers in Australia.
In Dr Young’s opinion, South East Queensland is now on the verge of a “large outbreak”, prompting her to yesterday change her controversial – but technically correct – position on the vaccine for under-60s.
Dr Young, it turns out, has just been following the medical advice. The problem is that by being so absolutist in her publicly stated position up until yesterday, Dr Young has fuelled vaccine hesitancy – and that is something everyone in authority must be cautious to avoid in these most troubling of times.
The only way we are going to end this cycle of economy-destroying and mentally challenging lockdowns is when 80 per cent of us are fully vaccinated against Covid. That is the plan signed off by the Prime Minister and premiers at their last national cabinet meeting.
But 30 per cent of Queenslanders say they are now vaccine-hesitant (the highest in the nation), according to research by the Melbourne Institute – and of those, 16.7 per cent say they are not only hesitant, but they are simply unwilling to get the jab. That is way too close for comfort when chasing a target whereby 20 per cent of the population remains unprotected.
As the state’s chief health officer during a pandemic, Dr Young has a very big megaphone. She should have nuanced her language with that in mind when previously asked – repeatedly – whether young people should get AstraZeneca (which is, again, the only Covid vaccine currently available in Queensland to all but those in special priority categories).
By being so definitive, Dr Young has sowed seeds of doubt. It will now be very hard to turn that around. And yet a steep decline in that vaccine hesitant group will be critical, because we also learnt yesterday that getting younger people vaccinated is a central tenet of the Doherty Institute modelling relied upon by national cabinet for its roadmap out of lockdowns. The modelling says the vaccine rollout must be expanded to 30-39-year-olds by early September – meaning the Pfizer doses on order will have to arrive right on time, or a lot of young people are going to have to accept an AstraZeneca jab.

Why attention is turning to vaccinating the under 40s

Full text: The spread of the virus among children in Brisbane is a new worry
Doherty Institute modelling calling for 20- to 39-year-olds, considered “peak transmitters” of the Delta variant of Covid-19, to have their jabs brought forward has given health authorities and governments an important road map. And it converges well with Australia’s current pandemic and vaccine situation. The Doherty research, released by Scott Morrison and the institute’s Jodie McVernon, shows prioritising the vaccination of all adults, not just the oldest, would have a strong positive effect on the number of deaths and intensive care unit and hospital admissions in any major outbreak when the nation reached 70 per cent vaccine coverage.
Protection rates among older Australians are edging up. About 80 per cent of people over 70 have had one jab, more than 40 per cent are fully vaccinated. The comparative figures for ages 16 and older are just under half those levels. In view of the NSW and Queensland lockdowns, and the easy spread of Delta, we need to catch up urgently. And we are. More than 200,000 people were vaccinated in the 24 hours to Tuesday afternoon. Australians, who traditionally are strong supporters of childhood immunisation, appear to be rolling up their sleeves, despite initial supply problems with the vaccines and some mixed messaging.
A new lightning response vaccination unit to step up vaccines in areas suffering infection outbreaks promises to be an effective part of the Morrison government’s battle plan. The new National Response Option will be dispersed nationally and be on call to move quickly to support states and territories by providing between 2000 and 3000 additional vaccinations daily across two weeks. It will include about 50 clinical staff as well as support staff. Such a practical initiative should help get vaccine numbers up during outbreaks when citizens become deeply concerned about the virus. It makes eminently more sense than Anthony Albanese’s proposal to pay out $300 in public money to every Australian, regardless of their means, who gets vaccinated by December 1. Such a $6bn cash splash would set a bad precedent for future vaccine campaigns. It also reveals a tawdry disregard on the part of the opposition in terms of what motivates Australians and for common sense. The “bubble without a thought”, as the Prime Minister described it, put the opposition on the back foot during question time on Tuesday. Some countries are dallying with the idea of financial inducements to maintain vaccine momentum. But protecting their health, and that of their families, is the incentive that motivates most people to be vaccinated. So does the prospect of resuming life as it was until 18 months ago, especially freedom of movement, in Australia and overseas. Bonus frequent-flyer points and discounts could be handy sweeteners if businesses want to provide them.
While the nation’s path to protecting itself against Covid is becoming clearer, many Queenslanders are frustrated and anxious, feeling stranded in a different bubble. On Monday, as the outbreak in Queensland’s southeast worsened, chief health officer Jeannette Young repeated her comments discouraging young people from having the AstraZeneca ­vaccine. “I said I didn’t want 18-year-olds to have AstraZeneca and I still don’t,” Dr Young said. Epidemiologists and federal officials repudiated her comments, which were at odds with official advice from the Australian Technical Advisory Group on Immunisation. ATAGI recommends all adults in hotspots should “strongly consider” speaking to their doctor about being vaccinated. Deputy chief medical officer Michael Kidd said the southeast Queensland outbreak, which has put 11 local government areas under lockdown, met the threshold to be considered significant. University of Queensland ­infectious diseases expert Paul Griffin said authorities needed to be careful to avoid increasing vaccine hesitancy. On Tuesday, Dr Young shifted her rhetoric slightly. She said she believed the state was “on the verge of a large outbreak” and conceded “now is the time” people under 60 should consider talking to their GPs about having AstraZeneca. With 10 of 16 new Delta cases revealed on Tuesday occurring in primary and secondary students, including five children under 10, the Brisbane outbreak poses new challenges. As it unfolds, epidemiologists are looking at the possibility of new advice on masks and vaccine guidelines. As the world has seen before, the virus has a track record of producing unexpected, nasty surprises.

State’s five-week race to freedom

Full text: Federal health officials believe NSW is on a trajectory to reach 70 per cent vaccination cover in as little as five weeks, with Gladys Berejiklian tying the relaxation of Sydney’s lockdown to hitting significant inoculation targets.
“Once you get to 50 per cent vaccination, 60 per cent, 70 per cent, that triggers more freedoms. We can turn this around in four weeks,” the NSW Premier said after the state reported a record 239 Covid-19 cases on Sunday.
With more than 82,000 doses distributed in 24 hours, commonwealth officials are more optimistic that weekly vaccinations in NSW could rise to 650,000, paving the way for the 70 per cent cover level to be hit in September.
At the current trajectory of about 450,000 doses weekly, however, NSW would reach the 80 per cent cover ­figure used by Ms Berejiklian as the threshold for a return to pre-pandemic ­settings only in mid-November.
The push to accelerate inoculations in Sydney – and in particular the city’s southwestern and western suburbs hard hit by the current outbreak – comes as the scientist in charge of the nation’s Covid-19 road map said she was optimistic Australians would embrace the vaccine program.
“I am still optimistic that once we have really good supply, we won’t be facing the challenges we have and that we are seeing in some countries overseas,” said Sharon Lewin, the director of Melbourne’s Doherty Institute.
It was Professor Lewin’s team that provided national cabinet with modelling that underpins plans for post-pandemic normalisation, with a vaccine coverage target of 70 per cent before the country can move out of the ­current virus suppression phase. When coverage reaches 80 per cent, restrictions on vaccinated Australians will largely be lifted and international travel will begin to return to previous levels.
“I am optimistic that we will not see the same hesitancy that we’re seeing in countries like the US here in Australia,” Professor Lewin told The Australian.
While a number of US states have fully vaccinated more than 70 per cent of their populations, others have struggled with ­hesitancy and a low take-up rate.
Ms Berejiklian said while the NSW government wanted to ease restrictions “as much as possible”, it would be possible only with higher vaccination rates.
“There is no place in the world that has been able to live with the Delta virus and not have higher rates of vaccination. We have to be very clear about that,” she said.
The existing lockdown across Sydney is due to expire on August 28, although this is likely to be extended with some changes in areas that continue to record higher rates of transmission.
Prior to the most recent extension, Treasury officials produced economic modelling about the impact of a lockdown that would extend until September 17.
Federal officials believe the 70 per cent target is achievable ­because vaccination hesitancy has waned since updated Australian Technical Advisory Group on ­Immunisation advice on the safety of the AstraZeneca vaccine.
So far, Ms Berejiklian has avoided discussing carrot-and-stick approaches to vaccine ­hesitancy but she has hinted that the lockdown would be eased if high rates of immunisation were achieved in the coming weeks.
Of the 239 cases recorded on Sunday, 61 were known to be ­infectious in the community at some point and the isolation ­status of a further 98 people is under investigation.
Officials said 124 cases had not been linked to known sources, with investigation continuing.
Sending a strong signal that ­restrictions could be eased ­within weeks, Ms Berejiklian said high rates of vaccination during August would provide immediate pathways out of lockdown and potentially end their use.
“We have the month of August to get the vaccination rates as high as possible. Let August be the month where we break records with the vaccination,” she said.
NSW Labor leader Chris Minns on Sunday backed the ­government’s vaccination drive but criticised a decision to divert Pfizer doses from the Hunter and Central Coast regions to inoculate students in Sydney’s western and southwestern suburbs.
NSW Health decided on ­Friday to reallocate Pfizer vac­cines from non-metropolitan ­regions to maximise vaccinations in communities under strain, resulting in booking cancellations, including for frontline workers.
“This is in no way a desirable action by the Ministry of Health but access to supplies for NSW have become so constrained that they have been left with no alternative,” an internal email ­obtained by The Australian read.
Mr Minns said he would seek a “commonsense solution” to the problem through consultation with the government. “After all, we all need to remember these communities are in lockdown just as most of Sydney is in lockdown. It’s not a similar situation to ­regional NSW,” he said.
Ms Berejiklian said a rise in vaccinations would prevent the state from re-entering a lockdown after it emerged from the current restrictions.
“Other states might be facing regular lockdowns in and out all the time,” she said. “We want this to be the last lockdown we have and we can make that happen if we get vaccinated.
“Our strategy for NSW is to get vaccination rates to 60, 70, 80 per cent. That means we can live with the Delta variant and we won’t have to go in and out of ­lockdown.” Michael Kidd, the acting ­commonwealth chief medical ­officer, said 4.5 million Covid-19 vaccines had been administered in July, compared with 3.2 million in June and 2.1 million in May.
Professor Kidd said only 15 of more than 2700 local cases linked with the current Sydney outbreak had been fully vaccinated.
“There have been no notified cases of people who are fully vaccinated who have required admission to hospital apart from the small number of residents of residential aged-care facilities moved out of their facility and into hospital as a precaution to optimise their care and to prevent the risk of further spread to other residents,” he said. “No fully vaccinated people have been admitted to intensive care units.” Highlighting the difficulty in hitting a high vaccination target is the experience of other countries, including the US, which is expected to hit 70 per cent coverage only in early November.
Figures compiled by US organisation Our World in Data shows Britain and Singapore both have a vaccination coverage rates of about 57 per cent.
The most recent federal Health ­Department data, for July 31, showed 19 per cent of Australia’s adult population was now fully vaccinated.
A further 41 per cent had received one dose of either the Pfizer or AstraZeneca vaccine.
The take-up of AstraZeneca vaccines to people aged between 16 and 39 in NSW has risen dramatically in July, the Australian Immunisation Register shows.
Asked whether Australia would reach a 70 per cent coverage level by the end of the year, Professor Kidd would only say: “I’ll let you do the maths.” ADDITIONAL REPORTING: JAMIE WALKER

That means we can live with the Delta variant and we won’t have to go in and out of ­lockdown.” Michael Kidd, the acting ­commonwealth chief medical ­officer, said 4.5 million Covid-19 vaccines had been administered in July, compared with 3.2 million in June and 2.1 million in May.
Professor Kidd said only 15 of more than 2700 local cases linked with the current Sydney outbreak had been fully vaccinated.
“There have been no notified cases of people who are fully vaccinated who have required admission to hospital apart from the small number of residents of residential aged-care facilities moved out of their facility and into hospital as a precaution to optimise their care and to prevent the risk of further spread to other residents,” he said. “No fully vaccinated people have been admitted to intensive care units.” Highlighting the difficulty in hitting a high vaccination target is the experience of other countries, including the US, which is expected to hit 70 per cent coverage only in early November.
Figures compiled by US organisation Our World in Data shows Britain and Singapore both have a vaccination coverage rates of about 57 per cent.
The most recent federal Health ­Department data, for July 31, showed 19 per cent of Australia’s adult population was now fully vaccinated.
A further 41 per cent had received one dose of either the Pfizer or AstraZeneca vaccine.
The take-up of AstraZeneca vaccines to people aged between 16 and 39 in NSW has risen dramatically in July, the Australian Immunisation Register shows.
Asked whether Australia would reach a 70 per cent coverage level by the end of the year, Professor Kidd would only say: “I’ll let you do the maths.” ADDITIONAL REPORTING: JAMIE WALKER

Full text: Federal health officials believe NSW is on a trajectory to reach 70 per cent vaccination cover in as little as five weeks, with Gladys Berejiklian tying the relaxation of Sydney’s lockdown to hitting significant inoculation targets.
“Once you get to 50 per cent vaccination, 60 per cent, 70 per cent, that triggers more freedoms. We can turn this around in four weeks,” the NSW Premier said after the state reported a record 239 Covid-19 cases on Sunday.
With more than 82,000 doses distributed in 24 hours, commonwealth officials are more optimistic that weekly vaccinations in NSW could rise to 650,000, paving the way for the 70 per cent cover level to be hit in September.
At the current trajectory of about 450,000 doses weekly, however, NSW would reach the 80 per cent cover ­figure used by Ms Berejiklian as the threshold for a return to pre-pandemic ­settings only in mid-November.
The push to accelerate inoculations in Sydney – and in particular the city’s southwestern and western suburbs hard hit by the current outbreak – comes as the scientist in charge of the nation’s Covid-19 road map said she was optimistic Australians would embrace the vaccine program.
“I am still optimistic that once we have really good supply, we won’t be facing the challenges we have and that we are seeing in some countries overseas,” said Sharon Lewin, the director of Melbourne’s Doherty Institute.
It was Professor Lewin’s team that provided national cabinet with modelling that underpins plans for post-pandemic normalisation, with a vaccine coverage target of 70 per cent before the country can move out of the ­current virus suppression phase. When coverage reaches 80 per cent, restrictions on vaccinated Australians will largely be lifted and international travel will begin to return to previous levels.
“I am optimistic that we will not see the same hesitancy that we’re seeing in countries like the US here in Australia,” Professor Lewin told The Australian.
While a number of US states have fully vaccinated more than 70 per cent of their populations, others have struggled with ­hesitancy and a low take-up rate.
Ms Berejiklian said while the NSW government wanted to ease restrictions “as much as possible”, it would be possible only with higher vaccination rates.
“There is no place in the world that has been able to live with the Delta virus and not have higher rates of vaccination. We have to be very clear about that,” she said.
The existing lockdown across Sydney is due to expire on August 28, although this is likely to be extended with some changes in areas that continue to record higher rates of transmission.
Prior to the most recent extension, Treasury officials produced economic modelling about the impact of a lockdown that would extend until September 17.
Federal officials believe the 70 per cent target is achievable ­because vaccination hesitancy has waned since updated Australian Technical Advisory Group on ­Immunisation advice on the safety of the AstraZeneca vaccine.
So far, Ms Berejiklian has avoided discussing carrot-and-stick approaches to vaccine ­hesitancy but she has hinted that the lockdown would be eased if high rates of immunisation were achieved in the coming weeks.
Of the 239 cases recorded on Sunday, 61 were known to be ­infectious in the community at some point and the isolation ­status of a further 98 people is under investigation.
Officials said 124 cases had not been linked to known sources, with investigation continuing.
Sending a strong signal that ­restrictions could be eased ­within weeks, Ms Berejiklian said high rates of vaccination during August would provide immediate pathways out of lockdown and potentially end their use.
“We have the month of August to get the vaccination rates as high as possible. Let August be the month where we break records with the vaccination,” she said.
NSW Labor leader Chris Minns on Sunday backed the ­government’s vaccination drive but criticised a decision to divert Pfizer doses from the Hunter and Central Coast regions to inoculate students in Sydney’s western and southwestern suburbs.
NSW Health decided on ­Friday to reallocate Pfizer vac­cines from non-metropolitan ­regions to maximise vaccinations in communities under strain, resulting in booking cancellations, including for frontline workers.
“This is in no way a desirable action by the Ministry of Health but access to supplies for NSW have become so constrained that they have been left with no alternative,” an internal email ­obtained by The Australian read.
Mr Minns said he would seek a “commonsense solution” to the problem through consultation with the government. “After all, we all need to remember these communities are in lockdown just as most of Sydney is in lockdown. It’s not a similar situation to ­regional NSW,” he said.
Ms Berejiklian said a rise in vaccinations would prevent the state from re-entering a lockdown after it emerged from the current restrictions.
“Other states might be facing regular lockdowns in and out all the time,” she said. “We want this to be the last lockdown we have and we can make that happen if we get vaccinated.
“Our strategy for NSW is to get vaccination rates to 60, 70, 80 per cent. That means we can live with the Delta variant and we won’t have to go in and out of ­lockdown.” Michael Kidd, the acting ­commonwealth chief medical ­officer, said 4.5 million Covid-19 vaccines had been administered in July, compared with 3.2 million in June and 2.1 million in May.
Professor Kidd said only 15 of more than 2700 local cases linked with the current Sydney outbreak had been fully vaccinated.
“There have been no notified cases of people who are fully vaccinated who have required admission to hospital apart from the small number of residents of residential aged-care facilities moved out of their facility and into hospital as a precaution to optimise their care and to prevent the risk of further spread to other residents,” he said. “No fully vaccinated people have been admitted to intensive care units.” Highlighting the difficulty in hitting a high vaccination target is the experience of other countries, including the US, which is expected to hit 70 per cent coverage only in early November.

Full text: ALMOST 40 per cent of South Australia’s 1.4 million adults have received their first dose of Covid-19 vaccine, which is among the nation’s best rates, official new figures show.
But fewer than a fifth are fully protected with two jabs.
Commonwealth Health Department figures show SA’s rate of 39.84 per cent of the adult population having a first dose is the second highest of mainland states.
Victoria’s is 40.89 per cent while Tasmania is highest at 47 per cent, ahead of the ACT on 46 per cent.
SA’s second-dose rate of 17.63 per cent ranks middle of all states, with Queensland and Western Australia lower.
SA ranks among the worst for protecting people older than 70, despite more than three quarters having a first jab.
More than a quarter of SA adults in their 40s are fully vaccinated, which is among the nation’s best rates for that age group, according to the federal breakdown published nationally for the first time.
Only a small percentage of those aged under 40 have been vaccinated due to not being eligible in metropolitan areas.
Separate state government figures show a 15 per cent surge in vaccine doses during the lockdown – 79,609 were administered, compared with 69,143 jabs the previous week.
Chief public health officer Nicola Spurrier said the key to preventing outbreaks was having people aged between 16 and 40 – especially those younger than 30 – jabbed.
Only those in this age bracket living in regional SA can access a Pfizer vaccine.
Prof Spurrier said SA’s rollout was restricted by commonwealth supply constraints.
“Our team is going to be ready to get everybody vaccinated as soon as possible, once we have more vaccines,” she said.
“I will really be celebrating the day that we can open up … to every adult.” Latest supply details were unavailable.
Premier Steven Marshall said being vaccinated was “our doorway out of the pandemic”.
“It is fantastic to see South Australians continue to embrace the vaccine and roll up their sleeves when it is their turn,” he said.
A new priority Pfizer vaccine clinic for residential aged-care staff will open at Enfield today. Another will open at Fullarton on Monday that will also jab disability care workers.
Labor is urging the state government to better promote the vaccine rollout. Opposition Leader Peter Malinauskas said a series of ideas to boost rates, released today, included diverting advertising money. An official $1.195m infrastructure campaign was better spent highlighting jab benefits, he said.
“We’ve been right to be going hard and … early with lockdowns but we’re wrong to be going slow and late on the vaccination rollout,” he said.
Prime Minister Scott Morrison suggested Australians could largely be free of Covid-19 restrictions by Christmas if vaccine targets were reached.
He said lockdowns would likely “become a thing of the past” by the end of the year.
Mr Morrison said Australia had supply, distribution, pharmacists, GPs and local clinics to provide every person older than 16 a jab this year.
“We make a gold-medal run all the way to the end of this year,” he said. SA Health wants at least 80 per cent of local adults vaccinated by October.
“Lockdowns become a thing of the past when you’re at that level,” said Mr Morrison, who last week apologised for the sluggish rollout.
Doherty Institute modelling will help develop benchmarks on when restrictions could ease based on vaccination rates. The modelling will be presented to national cabinet on Friday.

States hold keys to freedom as business pushes premiers to honour national cabinet deal

Full text: The nation’s most senior business leaders are warning that Scott Morrison’s four-step plan to reopen Australia is captive to the setting of realistic and achievable vaccination targets by medical experts and the willingness of premiers to honour them.
While the Prime Minister on Friday clinched a deal at national cabinet for a path back to normality where Covid-19 is treated like other infectious diseases, business is pushing the government to go further by scrapping lockdowns and reopening the international border by the start of next year.
On Sunday Qantas chief executive Alan Joyce said having “clear metrics” about the next phase of the recovery was critical but he warned the public was “not of a mindset to say lockdowns should be continuing into next year”.
Australian Industry Group chief executive Innes Willox said state governments needed to abide by the plan and open up when the new vaccine thresholds were met. He said “business have had enough of lockdowns” and “the thought of more lockdowns this winter quite frankly terrifies people”.
“Our federation is already fragile enough without a premier or their chief medical officer taking it on themselves to think that they know best,” Mr Willox said.
Business Council of Australia chief executive Jennifer Westacott warned precise vaccine targets and timetables would work only “if all the states and territories agree to end the patchwork of restrictions and work together in the national interest”.
“People are depending on national cabinet to work together quickly to develop a realistic plan with achievable targets, based on the best health advice and in line with the supply of vaccine,” Ms Westacott said.
The push from business groups came as deputy chief medical officer Michael Kidd said 500 GPs across the nation would begin offering the Pfizer vaccine to those aged 40 to 59 from this week, as the government ramped up the rollout amid criticism it had been too slow.
“During this month another 800 general practices will come online with the Pfizer vaccine as well as the AstraZeneca vaccine,” Professor Kidd said.
“This includes many Aboriginal community-controlled organisations, which will be offering the Pfizer vaccine progressively through July and August.” There were 16 new Covid-19 cases reported in NSW on Sunday, with Queensland and Western Australia each recording one case.
Speaking on Sunday, NSW Premier Gladys Berejiklian said more specifics were needed about the four-step reopening plan unveiled by Mr Morrison on Friday.
“The public would like to see some time frames, and I look forward to being part of those discussions,” Ms Berejiklian said.
“If national cabinet has determined a unified approach across the nation, I’m more than happy to support what that unified approach is, but I think we need to be ambitious and we also need timelines to give to the community.” Ms Berejiklian previously has flagged a vaccination target of 80 per cent of the adult population before NSW begins reconsidering Covid-19 public health measures.
But Mr Willox said any new vaccine targets – to be set by the COVID-19 Risk Analysis and Response Taskforce based on scientific modelling conducted by the Doherty Institute – needed to be realistic or the whole four-step agreement would fail.
“We don’t want to set ourselves up to fail. What is agreed has to be achievable and in a reasonable time frame,” he said. “To have a percentage target that is too high just defeats the purpose of having an agreement.” Grattan Institute health program director Stephen Duckett said Ms Berejiklian’s goal of 80 per cent was realistic but any vaccine threshold needed to apply to the entire population, including children. He conceded the task of coming up with the “magic number” would be a “complex equation” due to the varying risk factors for different age groups, with the government ideally aiming for “very, very high levels” of vaccination among those who were vulnerable and “moderate” levels of vaccination for less affected cohorts.
“When you’re setting the threshold you’re trying to make Covid look more like the flu, where you might have 1000 deaths a year. You would hope to convert Covid from a really deadly disease into something we’re more used to accepting,” he said.
Mr Joyce told The Australian there was potential for national cabinet to “find common ground” on vaccination thresholds, saying he agreed with Victorian Premier Daniel Andrews when he said last week that lockdowns should end when “everyone who wants to be vaccinated has been given an opportunity to do that”.
“If the logic of Dan Andrews and (Queensland Premier) Annastacia Palaszczuk applies, once we’ve got every adult who wants a vaccine to be vaccinated, then surely that should be the threshold,” he said. “I support that logic.” Mr Joyce also pushed for a 2022 reopening of domestic and international borders given Mr Morrison’s view that every Australian in want of a vaccine would have one by the end of the year.
“Most people should be vaccin­ated before the end of the calendar year,” he said. “Hopefully they can meet that time frame.” Anthony Albanese, however, said the lack of detail in the four-step deal announced on Friday “says it all”.
“The fact is that the rest of the world is opening up, Australia continues to be locked down in large part,” the federal Opposition Leader said. “That’s a direct result of the failure of the government on two issues: on failing to roll out the vaccine effectively and failing to put in place appropriate fit-for-purpose quarantine facilities.” Deloitte Access Economics partner Chris Richardson said Australians were “stuck under the doona” because the population was “terrified” by Covid-19, arguing the success of the four-step plan unveiled by Mr Morrison would depend on overcoming vaccine hesitancy and the ability of premiers to honour the deal.
“The four-stage plan is fine but there are many potholes on that path out from whether it is individuals who will remain too scared around vaccines, and we simply won’t hit the percentage targets that the Doherty Institute eventually gives us, to states who might sign on to the four stages in theory but not necessarily in practice,” Mr Richardson said. “The question is whether it’s achievable.” Tony Shepherd, who headed Tony Abbott’s commission of audit in 2014, said the “unfortunate thing in this crisis is that competitive federalism may be working against what is good for the whole”. “And what’s good for the whole is, while protecting the health of everybody, to return the economy to full speed as full as possible,” Mr Shepherd said. “Politicians have realised in this that they can build community support by demonstrating that they are safe and sensible leaders … but at some stage we have got to put the national good above the state good.”

Full text: The nation’s most senior business leaders are warning that Scott Morrison’s four-step plan to reopen Australia is captive to the setting of realistic and achievable vaccination targets by medical experts and the willingness of premiers to honour them.
While the Prime Minister on Friday clinched a deal at national cabinet for a path back to normality where Covid-19 is treated like other infectious diseases, business is pushing the government to go further by scrapping lockdowns and reopening the international border by the start of next year.
On Sunday Qantas chief executive Alan Joyce said having “clear metrics” about the next phase of the recovery was critical but he warned the public was “not of a mindset to say lockdowns should be continuing into next year”.
Australian Industry Group chief executive Innes Willox said state governments needed to abide by the plan and open up when the new vaccine thresholds were met. He said “business have had enough of lockdowns” and “the thought of more lockdowns this winter quite frankly terrifies people”.
“Our federation is already fragile enough without a premier or their chief medical officer taking it on themselves to think that they know best,” Mr Willox said.
Business Council of Australia chief executive Jennifer Westacott warned precise vaccine targets and timetables would work only “if all the states and territories agree to end the patchwork of restrictions and work together in the national interest”.
“People are depending on national cabinet to work together quickly to develop a realistic plan with achievable targets, based on the best health advice and in line with the supply of vaccine,” Ms Westacott said.
The push from business groups came as deputy chief medical officer Michael Kidd said 500 GPs across the nation would begin offering the Pfizer vaccine to those aged 40 to 59 from this week, as the government ramped up the rollout amid criticism it had been too slow.
“During this month another 800 general practices will come online with the Pfizer vaccine as well as the AstraZeneca vaccine,” Professor Kidd said.
“This includes many Aboriginal community-controlled organisations, which will be offering the Pfizer vaccine progressively through July and August.” There were 16 new Covid-19 cases reported in NSW on Sunday, with Queensland and Western Australia each recording one case.
Speaking on Sunday, NSW Premier Gladys Berejiklian said more specifics were needed about the four-step reopening plan unveiled by Mr Morrison on Friday.
“The public would like to see some time frames, and I look forward to being part of those discussions,” Ms Berejiklian said.
“If national cabinet has determined a unified approach across the nation, I’m more than happy to support what that unified approach is, but I think we need to be ambitious and we also need timelines to give to the community.” Ms Berejiklian previously has flagged a vaccination target of 80 per cent of the adult population before NSW begins reconsidering Covid-19 public health measures.
But Mr Willox said any new vaccine targets – to be set by the COVID-19 Risk Analysis and Response Taskforce based on scientific modelling conducted by the Doherty Institute – needed to be realistic or the whole four-step agreement would fail.
“We don’t want to set ourselves up to fail. What is agreed has to be achievable and in a reasonable time frame,” he said. “To have a percentage target that is too high just defeats the purpose of having an agreement.” Grattan Institute health program director Stephen Duckett said Ms Berejiklian’s goal of 80 per cent was realistic but any vaccine threshold needed to apply to the entire population, including children. He conceded the task of coming up with the “magic number” would be a “complex equation” due to the varying risk factors for different age groups, with the government ideally aiming for “very, very high levels” of vaccination among those who were vulnerable and “moderate” levels of vaccination for less affected cohorts.
“When you’re setting the threshold you’re trying to make Covid look more like the flu, where you might have 1000 deaths a year. You would hope to convert Covid from a really deadly disease into something we’re more used to accepting,” he said.
Mr Joyce told The Australian there was potential for national cabinet to “find common ground” on vaccination thresholds, saying he agreed with Victorian Premier Daniel Andrews when he said last week that lockdowns should end when “everyone who wants to be vaccinated has been given an opportunity to do that”.
“If the logic of Dan Andrews and (Queensland Premier) Annastacia Palaszczuk applies, once we’ve got every adult who wants a vaccine to be vaccinated, then surely that should be the threshold,” he said. “I support that logic.” Mr Joyce also pushed for a 2022 reopening of domestic and international borders given Mr Morrison’s view that every Australian in want of a vaccine would have one by the end of the year.
“Most people should be vaccin­ated before the end of the calendar year,” he said. “Hopefully they can meet that time frame.” Anthony Albanese, however, said the lack of detail in the four-step deal announced on Friday “says it all”.
“The fact is that the rest of the world is opening up, Australia continues to be locked down in large part,” the federal Opposition Leader said. “That’s a direct result of the failure of the government on two issues: on failing to roll out the vaccine effectively and failing to put in place appropriate fit-for-purpose quarantine facilities.” Deloitte Access Economics partner Chris Richardson said Australians were “stuck under the doona” because the population was “terrified” by Covid-19, arguing the success of the four-step plan unveiled by Mr Morrison would depend on overcoming vaccine hesitancy and the ability of premiers to honour the deal.
“The four-stage plan is fine but there are many potholes on that path out from whether it is individuals who will remain too scared around vaccines, and we simply won’t hit the percentage targets that the Doherty Institute eventually gives us, to states who might sign on to the four stages in theory but not necessarily in practice,” Mr Richardson said. “The question is whether it’s achievable.” Tony Shepherd, who headed Tony Abbott’s commission of audit in 2014, said the “unfortunate thing in this crisis is that competitive federalism may be working against what is good for the whole”.
“And what’s good for the whole is, while protecting the health of everybody, to return the economy to full speed as full as possible,” Mr Shepherd said. “Politicians have realised in this that they can build community support by demonstrating that they are safe and sensible leaders … but at some stage we have got to put the national good above the state good.” More reports P4-5 EDITORIAL P8 COMMENTary P9 WORLD P11

Full text: BUT IT ALL HINGES ON GETTING JABS AUSTRALIA has a new “pathway” out of Covid-19 that includes no more lockdowns or border closures, with the four-phase plan hinging on one thing – getting vaccinated.
Prime Minister Scott Morrison said the “new deal” struck by national cabinet would be linked to specific immunisation targets that give vaccinated Australians greater freedom.
At the core of the plan is pivoting from suppressing community transmission of coronavirus to treating the virus like the flu once enough people get the jab.
“So, what it means is, Australia gets vaccinated, Australia is able to live differently,” Mr Morrison said.
“We keep the pace up and we’ll get this done, Australia.
“We get this done, Australia, and you can see what is on the other side.” But the plan does not yet include time frames or specify what vaccination rates need to be reached, with the data to be known “in the next few weeks”.
Chief medical officer Paul Kelly, working with the Doherty Institute, will work to determine the threshold based on scientific evidence.
Mr Morrison said the threshold “won’t be based on people’s opinions, or their politics, it will be based on that scientific evidence”.
There is also no target set for when all Australians will be vaccinated, only that it should be “as soon as possible”.
Mr Morrison said on current rates of vaccination, and with significant jab resupply coming shortly, he believed this could be achieved by the end of the year.
About 8.3 per cent of Australians have been fully vaccinated so far. The country is currently in phase one – “vaccinate, prepare, pilot” – where the virus is suppressed through restrictions such as lockdowns while the nation’s single biggest and most complex inoculation campaign in history gathers steam. In the current phase, leaders have agreed that lockdowns should be used only as a “last resort”– a threshold also to be defined by vaccination rates.
During this phase alternative quarantine measures, such as seven-day home quarantine for vaccinated returned travellers, will be trialled.
South Australia has put its hand up as a trial site. International arrival caps have also been slashed in half after significant pressure from the premiers of Queensland, Western Australia and Victoria. Only 3035 people will be allowed in each week, with Queensland to take 500 arrivals a week, down from 1000.
The new limits will kick in on July 14 and could stay in place until enough of the population is vaccinated — likely to be in early 2022.
A digital vaccination authentication system will be introduced at national borders.
Once the yet-to-be determined vaccination threshold is met, Australia will move to the “post-vaccination” phase.
This is when the focus will be on stemming mass hospitalisations from Covid-19, with measures such as lockdowns to be used “only in extreme circumstances”.
“Once we get to a position of the post-vaccination phase, I think we’ll have made a quantum leap in where we are now,” Mr Morrison said.
People will start getting Covid vaccine booster shots and it’s envisaged those who are vaccinated will be less hindered by restrictions such as domestic border closures.
International arrival caps for vaccinated returning travellers will significantly increase and alternative quarantine arrangements will be put in place. A limited number of international students will also be able to return.
In the third phase, Covid-19 will be treated “just like the flu” and there won’t be lockdowns, or restrictions on people in Australia.
Vaccinated people can travel overseas without restriction and more travel bubbles, with countries including Singapore and other Pacific nations, will open. International arrival caps for unvaccinated people will be removed, as long as they undertake pre-flight and on-arrival testing.
The government’s Covid-19 risk analysis and response taskforce, led by Department of Prime Minister and Cabinet Secretary Philip Gaetjens, will finalise the plan for the travel rules.
Opposition Leader Anthony Albanese said he was “somewhat stunned” by the announcement that a plan was being formulated 18 months into a pandemic.
“(Mr Morrison) should have had one in place a long time earlier,” he said. “The key is doing more (vaccine) deals and getting more vaccines into more people’s arms now because, as I have said, it is vaccinations that save lives, not vaccines. That is the key to opening up.” The road map has been welcomed by the nation’s peak retail body, with Australian Retailers Association chief executive Paul Zahra saying it was “a long time coming”.
“Lockdowns are not long-term sustainable solutions for businesses when it comes to containing the virus. We have to learn to live with Covid and manage things in a responsible way that doesn’t decimate people’s businesses and livelihoods,” he said.
PHASE 1 “Vaccinate, prepare and pilot” – Continue to suppress the virus and offer every Australian an opportunity to be vaccinated as soon as possible. Slash international arrivals by half, funnel them to the Howard Springs facility in Darwin. Trial the introduction of alternative quarantine options, including home quarantine for returning vaccinated travellers. Lockdowns to be only used as a last resort.
PHASE 2 The post-vaccination phase will be entered once Australia reaches a threshold of vaccination to be determined by a modelling process. “This will be a scientific number,” Mr Morrison said. Easing restrictions for vaccinated people and lifting arrival caps. Lifting rules for outbound travel
PHASE 3 The consolidation phase, to manage Covid-19 like other infectious diseases. “The hospitalisation and fatality rates that you would see from Covid-19 would be like the flu,” Mr Morrison said
PHASE 4 “Complete back to normal, where you have measures that may include allowing uncapped inbound arrivals for all vaccinated persons without quarantine and allowing uncapped arrivals of non-vaccinated travel subject to pre-flight and on-arrival testing.”

Full text: After weeks of conflicting vaccine advice and criticism over Australia falling behind the rest of the world, the Prime Minister has announced the country has a new plan.
But unlike earlier plans, Scott Morrison has kept things deliberately vague - shying away from firm targets and guarantees for the moment.
What Mr Morrison did promise, however, was that Australia's state and territory leaders would move toward a new approach to dealing with COVID-19.
It's an approach that would result in a shift away from suppression of the virus - the lockdowns - and a move to treating COVID-19 as "an infectious disease like any other in our community".
Friday's announcement was more concept than locked-in roadmap but it marks a major step forward in what the population can expect in the coming 12 months as vaccines roll out and the world tries to reopen once more.
What's the new plan for Australia's road to returning to 'normal'? Mr Morrison emerged just before midday on Friday to announce national cabinet had reached an agreement on a plan to introduce a four-phased approach to how it deals with COVID-19.
State and territory leaders would work with the Commonwealth to reach vaccination targets before progressing to the next phase.
Each stage of the process would peel back some of the strict restrictions many have faced since March 2020 until the fourth and final stage, which Mr Morrison said would be a "return to normal".
The first and current phase focuses on suppressing the virus and vaccinating the population with lockdowns only being used as a last resort, he said.
In the second phase, leaders agreed vaccinated Australians would face eased restrictions in the event of future outbreaks and lockdowns and a limited number of international students would be allowed into the country.
The third phase would result in lifting restrictions for vaccinated people travelling internationally and extending the travel bubble to include countries such as Singapore, the Pacific and others deemed suitable.
It's expected caps on international students and humanitarian visa holders would also be increased.
The goal was to reach the fourth and final phase - a near return to normal but with additional measures, such pre-and post-flight testing for the virus, while parts of the population remained unvaccinated.
Ultimately, the phases reflect a two-tiered population - those who are vaccinated and those who are not.
Instead of blanket restrictions and border closures, those who have had the jab would be placed under eased restrictions, allowing more free movement.
Those who haven't yet would need to deal with more of the same as subsequent outbreaks occurred during the rollout as seen in recent weeks.
While the outlook is promising for many hoping to soon travel without the fear of sudden lockdowns and quarantines, we're still a way off from that being reality.
The prime minister was hesitant to provide concrete deadlines - something being determined by expert modelling - but signalled the country could enter phase two next year.
"I hope we're getting in that second phase next year," he said on Friday.
For now, Australia remains in phase one and could so for at least the next five months.
What's changing for now? Phase one, Mr Morrison said, was what the country would continue to remain in until vaccination rates increased.
On Thursday, Health Department figures showed nearly 8 per cent of the eligible population had received the required two doses while nearly one-third had received their first dose.
"The first phase is the one we are in. Vaccinate, prepare and pilot. We continue to suppress the virus," Mr Morrison said.
"That involves the implementation of the national vaccination plan to offer every Australian an opportunity to be vaccinated with the necessary doses of the relevant vaccine as soon as possible."
But the prime minister flagged other changes that would occur in the meantime as a result of Friday's meeting.
To deal with the highly infectious Delta strain, commercial international flights would be halved while the government would commit to increasing repatriation flights.
A trial to allow vaccinated travellers to home quarantine would also be considered as a measure to lift the pressure hotel quarantines in states and territories have been facing.
When will I be able to leave the country again? Mr Morrison's announcement signalled the idea of vaccine passports for both domestic and international travel. Phase two, which he said he hoped Australia would reach "next year", will allow those vaccinated to face eased restrictions and domestic border controls while the third phase would entirely exempt them.
The third phase will also mean the restrictions on vaccinated Australians leaving the country will be lifted and the travel bubble extended.
Once the fourth phase is reached, both vaccinated and unvaccinated people will be allowed to travel to the country with the latter still subject to pre-flight and on-arrival testing.
The missing puzzle piece is when this might happen. No dates were set as they relied on modelling to be provided by the Doherty Institute determining the population percentages needed to meet each phase's threshold.
But once that is announced, Australia's ticket to a return to normal was fairly simple, the prime minister outlined: get vaccinated and the country can get on with the show.

Full text: Five days after Prime Minister Scott Morrison blindsided state and territory leaders with his pronouncements on AstraZeneca and sparked days of confusion and criticism, he tried to present a united front.
After a second national cabinet meeting at the end of a week of crisis, he outlined a new plan for the country to tackle the momentous task of vaccinating the population and reopening Australia to the world.
Mr Morrison laid out the new outlook with four phases on Friday - one that would see governments move away from lockdowns and hard border closures and move towards allowing COVID-19 to become just another seasonal virus. But the plan requires crucial boxes to be ticked along the way before that end goal is reached.
Vaccination percentage thresholds are the missing puzzle piece Australia needs in order to progress to each new phase, and one the Prime Minister shied away from committing to just yet.
A vague indication suggesting the country would start to slowly ease restrictions for vaccinated people - the second phase - next year was flagged, but it could hardly be seen as a commitment. While the plan sounds otherwise promising - a clear outline of Australia's staggered return to normal - it feels all too familiar.
At the start of the year, the Prime Minister and Health Minister Greg Hunt had confidently predicted 4 million Australians would be vaccinated by the end of March. In reality, by that time the rollout had barely reached a quarter of the government's initial hopes.
A short few months later, the government's end-of-year vaccination target had been dropped entirely due to supply issues and concerns over rare side effects occurring for some taking the AstraZeneca vaccine.
The Health Department released figures this week showing about 8 per cent of the eligible population had received the required two doses.
Nearly one-third of eligible people over the age of 16 had received their first dose 132 days after the first vaccine was administered in February.
Australia, once a nation envied by the world for our low COVID-19 cases numbers, has fallen badly behind on vaccination. All while others, such as the United Kingdom, have more than half their population fully vaccinated, and are returning to relatively normal life.
So, what will make the public believe the government this time? After a so-far shambolic rollout and recent confusion over which vaccine should be taken, it's a tough sell.
Filling in the gaps on dates or vaccination percentage targets might be the only move the government has left to make. Mr Morrison said those details would be provided by the Doherty Institute once its modelling on targets had been completed.
By placing the load on health experts, the government has returned to its tried-and-tested method of dealing with the pandemic - looking to expert advice.
With expert modelling as the basis for the roadmap, it's a lot harder to argue the government's failures if targets are missed or plans fall apart.
If things go to plan, we can assume we will see a return to international travel - for leisure, not necessity - at the earliest some time next year. But as the experience of the pandemic has showed, plans fall apart. More and more variants of the virus are also emerging, and so optimistic forecasts are made at peril.
Right now, the challenge for the Prime Minister is to win back trust and build credit with Australians confused and frustrated by recent events. For the sake of any re-election hopes his government entertains, and far more importantly for the sake of the nation, we have to hope for fast progress on this new roadmap.

Full text: After weeks of conflicting vaccine advice and criticism over Australia falling behind the rest of the world, the Prime Minister has announced the country has a new plan.
But unlike earlier plans, Scott Morrison has kept things deliberately vague - shying away from firm targets and guarantees for the moment.
What Mr Morrison did promise, however, was that Australia's state and territory leaders would move toward a new approach to dealing with COVID-19.
It's an approach that would result in a shift away from suppression of the virus - the lockdowns - and a move to treating COVID-19 as "an infectious disease like any other in our community".
Friday's announcement was more concept than locked-in roadmap but it marks a major step forward in what the population can expect in the coming 12 months as vaccines roll out and the world tries to reopen once more.
What's the new plan for Australia's road to returning to 'normal'? Mr Morrison emerged just before midday on Friday to announce national cabinet had reached an agreement on a plan to introduce a four-phased approach to how it deals with COVID-19.
State and territory leaders would work with the Commonwealth to reach vaccination targets before progressing to the next phase.
Each stage of the process would peel back some of the strict restrictions many have faced since March 2020 until the fourth and final stage, which Mr Morrison said would be a "return to normal".
The first and current phase focuses on suppressing the virus and vaccinating the population with lockdowns only being used as a last resort, he said.
In the second phase, leaders agreed vaccinated Australians would face eased restrictions in the event of future outbreaks and lockdowns and a limited number of international students would be allowed into the country.
The third phase would result in lifting restrictions for vaccinated people travelling internationally and extending the travel bubble to include countries such as Singapore, the Pacific and others deemed suitable.
It's expected caps on international students and humanitarian visa holders would also be increased.
The goal was to reach the fourth and final phase - a near return to normal but with additional measures, such pre-and post-flight testing for the virus, while parts of the population remained unvaccinated.
Ultimately, the phases reflect a two-tiered population - those who are vaccinated and those who are not.
Instead of blanket restrictions and border closures, those who have had the jab would be placed under eased restrictions, allowing more free movement.
Those who haven't yet would need to deal with more of the same as subsequent outbreaks occurred during the rollout as seen in recent weeks.
While the outlook is promising for many hoping to soon travel without the fear of sudden lockdowns and quarantines, we're still a way off from that being reality.
The prime minister was hesitant to provide concrete deadlines - something being determined by expert modelling - but signalled the country could enter phase two next year.
"I hope we're getting in that second phase next year," he said on Friday.
For now, Australia remains in phase one and could so for at least the next five months.
What's changing for now? Phase one, Mr Morrison said, was what the country would continue to remain in until vaccination rates increased.
On Thursday, Health Department figures showed nearly 8 per cent of the eligible population had received the required two doses while nearly one-third had received their first dose.
"The first phase is the one we are in. Vaccinate, prepare and pilot. We continue to suppress the virus," Mr Morrison said.
"That involves the implementation of the national vaccination plan to offer every Australian an opportunity to be vaccinated with the necessary doses of the relevant vaccine as soon as possible."
But the prime minister flagged other changes that would occur in the meantime as a result of Friday's meeting.
To deal with the highly infectious Delta strain, commercial international flights would be halved while the government would commit to increasing repatriation flights.
A trial to allow vaccinated travellers to home quarantine would also be considered as a measure to lift the pressure hotel quarantines in states and territories have been facing.
When will I be able to leave the country again? Mr Morrison's announcement signalled the idea of vaccine passports for both domestic and international travel. Phase two, which he said he hoped Australia would reach "next year", will allow those vaccinated to face eased restrictions and domestic border controls while the third phase would entirely exempt them.
The third phase will also mean the restrictions on vaccinated Australians leaving the country will be lifted and the travel bubble extended.
Once the fourth phase is reached, both vaccinated and unvaccinated people will be allowed to travel to the country with the latter still subject to pre-flight and on-arrival testing.
The missing puzzle piece is when this might happen. No dates were set as they relied on modelling to be provided by the Doherty Institute determining the population percentages needed to meet each phase's threshold.
But once that is announced, Australia's ticket to a return to normal was fairly simple, the prime minister outlined: get vaccinated and the country can get on with the show.

Full text: Five days after Prime Minister Scott Morrison blindsided state and territory leaders with his pronouncements on AstraZeneca and sparked days of confusion and criticism, he tried to present a united front.
After a second national cabinet meeting at the end of a week of crisis, he outlined a new plan for the country to tackle the momentous task of vaccinating the population and reopening Australia to the world.
Mr Morrison laid out the new outlook with four phases on Friday - one that would see governments move away from lockdowns and hard border closures and move towards allowing COVID-19 to become just another seasonal virus. But the plan requires crucial boxes to be ticked along the way before that end goal is reached.
Vaccination percentage thresholds are the missing puzzle piece Australia needs in order to progress to each new phase, and one the Prime Minister shied away from committing to just yet.
A vague indication suggesting the country would start to slowly ease restrictions for vaccinated people - the second phase - next year was flagged, but it could hardly be seen as a commitment. While the plan sounds otherwise promising - a clear outline of Australia's staggered return to normal - it feels all too familiar.
At the start of the year, the Prime Minister and Health Minister Greg Hunt had confidently predicted 4 million Australians would be vaccinated by the end of March. In reality, by that time the rollout had barely reached a quarter of the government's initial hopes.
A short few months later, the government's end-of-year vaccination target had been dropped entirely due to supply issues and concerns over rare side effects occurring for some taking the AstraZeneca vaccine.
The Health Department released figures this week showing about 8 per cent of the eligible population had received the required two doses.
Nearly one-third of eligible people over the age of 16 had received their first dose 132 days after the first vaccine was administered in February.
Australia, once a nation envied by the world for our low COVID-19 cases numbers, has fallen badly behind on vaccination. All while others, such as the United Kingdom, have more than half their population fully vaccinated, and are returning to relatively normal life.
So, what will make the public believe the government this time? After a so-far shambolic rollout and recent confusion over which vaccine should be taken, it's a tough sell.
Filling in the gaps on dates or vaccination percentage targets might be the only move the government has left to make. Mr Morrison said those details would be provided by the Doherty Institute once its modelling on targets had been completed.
By placing the load on health experts, the government has returned to its tried-and-tested method of dealing with the pandemic - looking to expert advice.
With expert modelling as the basis for the roadmap, it's a lot harder to argue the government's failures if targets are missed or plans fall apart.
If things go to plan, we can assume we will see a return to international travel - for leisure, not necessity - at the earliest some time next year. But as the experience of the pandemic has showed, plans fall apart. More and more variants of the virus are also emerging, and so optimistic forecasts are made at peril.
Right now, the challenge for the Prime Minister is to win back trust and build credit with Australians confused and frustrated by recent events. For the sake of any re-election hopes his government entertains, and far more importantly for the sake of the nation, we have to hope for fast progress on this new roadmap.

2000 jab doses at risk after outage

Full text: THOUSANDS of Covid-19 vaccines have been “quarantined” and could be thrown out after storm damage cut power to a key jab centre.
The Health Department confirmed 2000 AstraZeneca doses had been quarantined for “further assessment of ­viability”, after power was lost at the Eastern Health Lilydale vaccination site.
“This is a small fraction of the AstraZeneca doses we currently have in stock and it will not impact the broader vaccine rollout,” a spokeswoman said.
It is understood at least one elderly woman was turned away from receiving her first scheduled jab.
“She turned up for her ­appointment and was told the power was out and all the vaccines in the fridge had to be thrown out,” the woman’s son said.
Melburnians enjoyed their first taste of partial freedom, with no new locally acquired cases on Friday. Certain ­restrictions remain in place over the long weekend.
City restaurants are limited to groups of no more than 10, and only 50 people indoors, with no visitors at homes and masks mandatory indoors and out.
It was revealed on Friday that despite NSW allowing Victorians to fly there, local ­restrictions barred them from driving to the airport if they lived more than 25km away.
Acting Premier James Merlino and chief health officer Brett Sutton defended the state’s ongoing restrictions, saying the risks were “nowhere near over”.
Professor Sutton warned new cases were likely to emerge among new close contacts in coming days, but said it was “not a concern as they are all quarantined for the entire period”.
Elective surgery will resume next week after tens of thousands of procedures were ­cancelled.
New government modelling has predicted the latest lockdown prevented Covid-19 being transmitted to thousands of Victorians.
Based on the cluster pattern when Melbourne went into lockdown on May 27 the Burnet Institute modelled four ­restriction scenarios. It found that without lockdown and only mask rule and working from home restrictions ­enforced, there would have been up to 2000 cases by August.
Authorities are still investigating how a Covid-infected Melbourne couple escaped to Queensland, sparking concerns across three states. Five other Victorians have been caught breaking restrictions by entering the Sunshine State since May 28.

Full text: Getting it right at pandemic pointy end It’s commendable the government has not yet relinquished the goal of vaccinating the nation by October because so much is now, by design, riding on its expeditious rollout — least of which is the country returning to a semblance of normality (Let’s give it a shot, 15/3).
However, while the government sees widespread vaccination a key objective, a good news story, it must ensure vaccine reserves and protocols are in place to deliver the necessary second jab (from the same manufacturer) within the recommended time frames.
Data on what extra time between shots does to the vaccines’ effectiveness is not yet fully understood.
Jack Dikian, Mosman ●● ● Anyone with a shred of commonsense and understanding would accept the reality of the ‘jab’ rollout (Let’s give it a shot, 15/3).
This is a complex program with many moving parts — some the government can control, others it can’t.
Scott Morrison is committed to rolling out the program as quickly as circumstances allow.
Of course Anthony Albanese is chafing at the bit looking for glitches in the program so he can throw a political brick or two.
Thankfully Morrison can and is riding above this and getting on with the job. Full marks PM.
John George, Terrigal
More the merrier when countering China threat We are slowly waking to the possible danger of an increasingly aggressive China and sensibly seeking allies (The Quad: a crucial squad to keep China at bay — Opinion, 15/3).
Hence the Quad discussions and belated moves to engage with India. Yet nowhere does there appear to be obvious moves to involve two significant near neighbours i.e. Indonesia and The Philippines.
Both these countries face the same potential dangers as us.
Their involvement would strengthen the ‘alliance’ in deterring further incursions into our region as well as provide further opportunities to promote trade with them as a side benefit.
I appreciate things are not simple but we are heading into times that we have not seen since the Cold War and quick action is now needed to prevent returning to that blighted world.
Errol Milner, Figtree
Alarm bells ringing Former defence minister Christopher Pyne has reminded readers that the US, India, Japan and Australia are alarmed by China’s increasing belligerence in the Indo-Pacific, prompting the recent quadrilateral security dialogue (The Quad: A crucial squad to keep China at bay — Opinion, 15/3).
The indices are up. China has avowed its ambition to incorporate Taiwan. But China will fear the moral force of this new collective entity.
Mike Fogarty, Weston, ACT
Clear thinking on nuclear Nuclear energy is a discussion we now need to have (Energy Minister supports nuclear option, 15/3).
Clearly, wind, solar and hydro have reliability issues and cannot, as yet, take the place of coal-fired power stations as they are decommissioned.
NSW Energy Minister Matt Keane is excited about what’s happening on the nuclear front, especially if modern small modular reactors become commercially feasible.
With many in the political huddle calling for carbon-cutting solutions, it’s time we seriously consider modern nuclear power generation as a viable base load power alternative.
Peter Cattlin, Freshwater
Sitting on electric fence Perhaps ‘each-way’ Albo has a competitor in NSW Energy Minister Matt ‘each-way’ Kean who suddenly — under pressure from commonsense — thinks that nuclear power might be OK after all (Energy Minister supports nuclear option, 15/3).
But, with modelling for his energy road map kept secret, and a history of deriding nuclear and coal, are we really expected to believe that Minister Kean has seen the light and is now excited at “things happening on the nuclear front”.
A minister who believes “wind, solar, batteries, gas and pumped hydro” are the basis for a stable NSW power supply, but hides modelling and costings, really cannot, and should not, be believed.
Bob Partington, Wahroonga
No normal the new normal So statistics no longer have the normal curve (‘Normal’ rinsed away — Tim Blair, 15/3).
So I cannot be over the normal weight, no more normal behaviour, no normal heart rate, no normal greetings, no normal standards for anything.
No more laws or punishment needed since nothing can be judged as normal for comparison. At least, Tim Blair is correct … and normal.
Michael Sobb, Rydalmere
Heads up about curly issue Yes, Tim Blair, no more normal on Unilever labels (‘Normal’ rinsed away — Opinion, 15/3).
Well if your hair isn’t fine, frizzy, dandruff-ridden, oily, dry, coloured or damaged, then how else would you describe it other than normal.
Today’s latest change in describing shampoo and conditioner seems a tad unnecessary but if it gets Unilever the publicity it wants, the changes to packaging benefit designers, the product relaunch helps suppliers and the woke brigade are appeased, why would my opinion matter.
Remember the old tune from the musical South Pacific sung by Mitzi Gaynor — I’m Gonna Wash That Man Right Out Of My Hair. She might now have a problem deciding which shampoo can do the job.
Marg Swindells, Castle Hill
Green not go for Libs The clear message for federal and state LNP coalitions from the decimation of the Liberals in the WA election is that the more green ideology policies they adopt, the more supporters they will lose to minor parties or even the ALP (Liberal leader’s brutal honesty after defeat — Online, 15/3). Once it was thought a safe bet that the Morrison government would be re-elected but now it is looking less likely unless it makes moves on water and energy security using our natural resources that it is happy to export.
Being tough on illegal immigration won’t work anymore.
A cabinet reshuffle is also needed starting with moving the Defence Minister on and replacing her with Andrew Hastie.
Brian Whybrow, Wanniassa, ACT
Briefly … Lost your job as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic and struggling to find another one? May I suggest a career in the virtue signalling and victimisation industries. Both are absolutely booming in today’s society with more and more people taking up one, the other or even both as a new career.
B Thompson, Cowra ●● ● With the ongoing controversy as to the Oprah Winfrey interview with Meghan and Harry, not to mention the Megxit saga, the question needs to be asked, who really cares? I most certainly don’t.
Matthew Geary, Lithgow ●● ● Muhammad Ali was the quickest heavyweight boxer of all time and was filmed delivering 14 straight jabs in 3 ½ seconds. Perhaps the people in charge of the vaccine rollout in Australia could learn something about delivering jabs from watching archival footage of the great man (Let’s give it a shot, 15/3).
Peter Penglis, Kambah ●● ● About the women marching on Parliament House, I would say, let no man stand in their way, because their need is great and their cause is just … but under the circumstances, might they be better off having a quiet word with Mrs Morrison, the keeper of the Prime Ministerial conscience to get their important message through (Brittany Higgins takes swipe at PM during women’s march — Online, 15/3)?

Full text: Getting it right at pandemic pointy end It’s commendable the government has not yet relinquished the goal of vaccinating the nation by October because so much is now, by design, riding on its expeditious rollout — least of which is the country returning to a semblance of normality (Let’s give it a shot, 15/3).
However, while the government sees widespread vaccination a key objective, a good news story, it must ensure vaccine reserves and protocols are in place to deliver the necessary second jab (from the same manufacturer) within the recommended time frames.
Data on what extra time between shots does to the vaccines’ effectiveness is not yet fully understood.
Jack Dikian, Mosman ●● ● Anyone with a shred of commonsense and understanding would accept the reality of the ‘jab’ rollout (Let’s give it a shot, 15/3).
This is a complex program with many moving parts — some the government can control, others it can’t.
Scott Morrison is committed to rolling out the program as quickly as circumstances allow.
Of course Anthony Albanese is chafing at the bit looking for glitches in the program so he can throw a political brick or two.
Thankfully Morrison can and is riding above this and getting on with the job. Full marks PM.
John George, Terrigal
More the merrier when countering China threat We are slowly waking to the possible danger of an increasingly aggressive China and sensibly seeking allies (The Quad: a crucial squad to keep China at bay — Opinion, 15/3).
Hence the Quad discussions and belated moves to engage with India. Yet nowhere does there appear to be obvious moves to involve two significant near neighbours i.e. Indonesia and The Philippines.
Both these countries face the same potential dangers as us.
Their involvement would strengthen the ‘alliance’ in deterring further incursions into our region as well as provide further opportunities to promote trade with them as a side benefit.
I appreciate things are not simple but we are heading into times that we have not seen since the Cold War and quick action is now needed to prevent returning to that blighted world.
Errol Milner, Figtree
Alarm bells ringing Former defence minister Christopher Pyne has reminded readers that the US, India, Japan and Australia are alarmed by China’s increasing belligerence in the Indo-Pacific, prompting the recent quadrilateral security dialogue (The Quad: A crucial squad to keep China at bay — Opinion, 15/3).
The indices are up. China has avowed its ambition to incorporate Taiwan. But China will fear the moral force of this new collective entity.
Mike Fogarty, Weston, ACT
Clear thinking on nuclear Nuclear energy is a discussion we now need to have (Energy Minister supports nuclear option, 15/3).
Clearly, wind, solar and hydro have reliability issues and cannot, as yet, take the place of coal-fired power stations as they are decommissioned.
NSW Energy Minister Matt Keane is excited about what’s happening on the nuclear front, especially if modern small modular reactors become commercially feasible.
With many in the political huddle calling for carbon-cutting solutions, it’s time we seriously consider modern nuclear power generation as a viable base load power alternative.
Peter Cattlin, Freshwater
Sitting on electric fence Perhaps ‘each-way’ Albo has a competitor in NSW Energy Minister Matt ‘each-way’ Kean who suddenly — under pressure from commonsense — thinks that nuclear power might be OK after all (Energy Minister supports nuclear option, 15/3).
But, with modelling for his energy road map kept secret, and a history of deriding nuclear and coal, are we really expected to believe that Minister Kean has seen the light and is now excited at “things happening on the nuclear front”.
A minister who believes “wind, solar, batteries, gas and pumped hydro” are the basis for a stable NSW power supply, but hides modelling and costings, really cannot, and should not, be believed.
Bob Partington, Wahroonga
No normal the new normal So statistics no longer have the normal curve (‘Normal’ rinsed away — Tim Blair, 15/3).
So I cannot be over the normal weight, no more normal behaviour, no normal heart rate, no normal greetings, no normal standards for anything.
No more laws or punishment needed since nothing can be judged as normal for comparison. At least, Tim Blair is correct … and normal.
Michael Sobb, Rydalmere
Heads up about curly issue Yes, Tim Blair, no more normal on Unilever labels (‘Normal’ rinsed away — Opinion, 15/3).
Well if your hair isn’t fine, frizzy, dandruff-ridden, oily, dry, coloured or damaged, then how else would you describe it other than normal.
Today’s latest change in describing shampoo and conditioner seems a tad unnecessary but if it gets Unilever the publicity it wants, the changes to packaging benefit designers, the product relaunch helps suppliers and the woke brigade are appeased, why would my opinion matter.
Remember the old tune from the musical South Pacific sung by Mitzi Gaynor — I’m Gonna Wash That Man Right Out Of My Hair. She might now have a problem deciding which shampoo can do the job.
Marg Swindells, Castle Hill
Green not go for Libs The clear message for federal and state LNP coalitions from the decimation of the Liberals in the WA election is that the more green ideology policies they adopt, the more supporters they will lose to minor parties or even the ALP (Liberal leader’s brutal honesty after defeat — Online, 15/3). Once it was thought a safe bet that the Morrison government would be re-elected but now it is looking less likely unless it makes moves on water and energy security using our natural resources that it is happy to export.
Being tough on illegal immigration won’t work anymore.
A cabinet reshuffle is also needed starting with moving the Defence Minister on and replacing her with Andrew Hastie.
Brian Whybrow, Wanniassa, ACT
Briefly … Lost your job as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic and struggling to find another one? May I suggest a career in the virtue signalling and victimisation industries. Both are absolutely booming in today’s society with more and more people taking up one, the other or even both as a new career.
B Thompson, Cowra ●● ● With the ongoing controversy as to the Oprah Winfrey interview with Meghan and Harry, not to mention the Megxit saga, the question needs to be asked, who really cares? I most certainly don’t.
Matthew Geary, Lithgow ●● ● Muhammad Ali was the quickest heavyweight boxer of all time and was filmed delivering 14 straight jabs in 3 ½ seconds. Perhaps the people in charge of the vaccine rollout in Australia could learn something about delivering jabs from watching archival footage of the great man (Let’s give it a shot, 15/3).
Peter Penglis, Kambah ●● ● About the women marching on Parliament House, I would say, let no man stand in their way, because their need is great and their cause is just … but under the circumstances, might they be better off having a quiet word with Mrs Morrison, the keeper of the Prime Ministerial conscience to get their important message through (Brittany Higgins takes swipe at PM during women’s march — Online, 15/3)?

Full text: NSW taxpayers told to pay after being shut out
NSW Treasurer Dominic Perrottet has accused Queensland of asking taxpayers to bail the state out for the economic hit from its own hardline border closures as Annastacia Palaszczuk called on the federal government for a JobKeeper extension to prop up her ailing tourism industry.
“Queensland, closed one day, asking someone else to pick up the tab the next,” Mr Perrottet said. “People in NSW have not only been banned from entering Queensland, but Queensland wants the taxpayers of NSW to pay for that decision.” It comes as new figures ­reveal that NSW’s own decision to take a proportionate response to the Christmas virus wave saved up to $9 billion in economic activity.
The NSW government modelling shows that imposing a “hard lockdown” or extending the northern beaches tough stay-at-home orders across greater Sydney could have cost the NSW economy up to $1.5 billion a week.
“That would amount to a $9 billion hit if a hard lockdown had lasted until today.
“The value of keeping our economy open can literally be counted in the billions of dollars,” Mr Perrottet said.
“We continue to fight a dual battle, keeping people safe is a priority but keeping our economy open and ­people in work is vital.” Ms Palaszczuk, the Queensland Premier, yesterday called for the federal government to extend JobKeeper to industries like tourism ­operators “as a matter of ­urgency” while emphasising “how important” the NSW market is to Queensland businesses, after weeks of shutting out Greater Sydney over the Christmas-New Year period.
By last April alone, then Tourism Minister Kate Jones had estimated Queensland tourism had taken a $6.5 billion hit from the pandemic, with newer modelling suggesting the summer of shutting Sydney out had cost Australia $7 billion nationally.
The Queensland Tourism Industry Council’s CEO Daniel Gschwind estimated that his state lost more than $200 million by closing the border to Greater Sydney from December through to January.
He said NSW represented about 30 per cent of the $10 billion generated by tourism in Queensland in 2019, the last year before travel was interrupted. He said that while the Queensland community had been in favour of tough border measures, the industry still needed more support.
Ms Palaszczuk’s plea for that assistance came as she announced the border would open to residents from Greater Sydney from February 1.
She went on to urge Sydneysiders to seek an “escape” in the tropical far north: “There are going to be a lot of people in that greater Sydney region that want to come back and see family and friends.” She said tourism operators in the far north “are doing it tough … especially with JobKeeper ending at the end of March”.
“Maybe JobKeeper does need to be extended for those industries (that are struggling),” she added.
However, federal treasurer Josh Frydenberg blasted the request, as new figures revealed how the state spent the lowest amount on COVID-19 stimulus across the nation.
The federal government injected $27.9 billion in direct economic support to homes and businesses in Queensland — more than three times the $8.8 billion in health and economic measures spent by Ms Palaszcuk’s government.
“The Morrison Government has delivered an unprecedented amount of economic support to the people of Queensland during the COVID crisis, a multiple of what has been delivered at about state level,” he said.
Mr Perrottet said the Queensland request showed how crucial it was to “have a proportionate and measured response to outbreaks”.
“It’s very easy to have a blanket decision to shut borders but there are economic downstream consequences and Queensland are seeing that,” he said.
“At the end of the day, someone has to pay for that.
“It’s the Australian taxpayer, whether its in Queensland or NSW or anywhere else, who they are asking to pick up the tab for their ­decision. The money doesn’t come from nowhere. She’s asking us to pay for her decision to lock us out.” The Sunshine State will open to Greater Sydney from Monday despite NSW not yet recording 28 days without any unlinked community transmission: Queensland’s own basis for easing border rules.
NSW Treasury has estimated the cost of the Sydney restrictions imposed since December’s fresh outbreaks at around $400 million per week, or about $2.4 billion in total until today.
Mr Perrottet yesterday disputed suggestions a tougher or more widespread lockdown would have lasted less time than the NSW approach.
Annastacia in the red corner Annastacia Palaszczuk, August 18 2020: People living in NSW, they have NSW hospitals. In Queensland we have Queensland hospitals for our people Annastacia Palaszczuk (in response to Berejiklian), November 4 2020: “Queenslander” Annastacia Palaszczuk, December 20 2020 “If you are from Greater Sydney, now is not the time to come to Queensland.” Annastacia Palaszczuk, January 28 2021: We know how important that New South Wales market is as well. So for those viewers that are currently in Sydney and you’re looking for an escape, well, there’s no better place to come than the tropical far north
WHAT ANNASTACIA LOST Queensland’s losses by closing its borders to Sydney residents from December to January
Gladys in the blue corner Gladys Berejiklian, January 19 2021 (in Tweed) Of course we don’t even mind when people north of the border come to use our health facilities because that’s the kind of state we are Gladys Berejiklian (text to Palaszczuk), October 31 2020: “Hi Annastacia Congratulations on your election win. I can imagine how difficult that was during a pandemic! Hope we can work together to get our borders open. Gladys.” Gladys Berejiklian, January 12 2021: “I don’t believe keeping your borders closed and inflicting pain and suffering on thousands of people is the way to go
WHAT GLADYS SAVED $7b Money potentially saved by avoiding NSW hard lockdown: around $7 billion.

Zeroing in on Victoria's success in suppression

Full text: Victoria's achievement in bringing down daily coronavirus numbers from 700 new cases a day in August to none in the past nine days has led Ireland and other European countries to seek our experts' advice on how the state did it.
Introducing measures including a five-kilometre travel limit, a curfew and school and business shutdowns, are now being eyed by northern hemisphere countries as their case numbers climb rapidly.
Chief Health Officer Brett Sutton said yesterday he had been asked by authorities in Ireland to host a "virtual town hall" next week, which other European countries would join, to learn how Victoria had stemmed its outbreak.
So what will he tell them? How did we manage to achieve such a steep drop in cases?
"If there are lessons for anyone, it is that it's achievable, and the real benefit is getting to those sustainable low numbers, and using the lessons you've learnt over that period of time to keep them there," Professor Sutton said.
Minimising the huge risk factors in sectors such as aged care - where almost all of Victoria's 819 COVID-19 deaths have occurred - was another major lesson, he said.
"We've obviously learnt a lot about what the challenging settings were," he said. "Aged care [is] enormously vulnerable, and those amplifying environments of abattoirs and food distribution centres and other warehouse centres with a large working population who are very mobile."
Professor Sutton said Melbourne's lockdown was only one of a range of measures that had helped drive down our tally.
"Stage four restrictions are not the science - that was the tool that was used," he said. "But the lesson from Melbourne is everything that we did in that time as we drove numbers down. The way that we worked on the turnaround time for testing, the way that we worked on reducing the time for case and contact management and outbreak management, the agent-based modelling that has informed where we get to and how we get there."
The transition to successive days of no new cases has been so dramatic there are signs the state might be on the path to eliminating the virus, some epidemiologists believe. The government has been at pains to state that its policy is not one of elimination, and that even talking about it is dangerous.
Testing chief Jeroen Weimar has characterised the policy as one of "aggressive suppression", and warned that Victoria was "not heading for elimination and no one should think we are on top of this".
Victoria's ninth consecutive day of zero new cases yesterday marks the state's longest COVID-free run since February. There were just four active cases in Victoria yesterday, down from a peak of 6767 on August 8.
As he announced the further easing of restrictions, Premier Daniel Andrews said that while it was a day to celebrate, it was also a reminder to remain cautious.
"The most important thing of all that all of us has to do is to stay the course on this, to be as stubborn as the virus," he said. "But no one can assume that because ... we have had nine days of zero, it is gone and somehow those numbers are the same as a vaccine against this deadly virus. They are not."
Despite the caution, there is the sense that Victoria has witnessed a big turnaround from two weeks ago, when many were dismissive of the chances of reaching zero.
Professor Sutton said at the time that Victoria's remaining cases had been among "the trickiest in the world" to beat. But rather than having a "stubborn tail", Victoria's epidemic curve shows our highest peak was followed by an equally sharp drop.
The daily number of Victorians who tested positive peaked at 725 on August 5. Two weeks later, the number was down to 208; two weeks after that it was 87.
In the first two weeks of October, the state averaged fewer than 10 cases a day. The first zero day was on October 26.
That was driven by dramatic improvements in contact tracing, not just by months of lockdown and mask wearing, according to Adrian Esterman, a biostatistician at the University of South Australia.
"Victoria has only done what all the other states and territories have been able to do apart from NSW - which is get to zero and keep it there," he said.
Professor Tony Blakely, one of the authors of the modelling that underpinned the government's response, said much credit should go to the decision not to reopen from lockdown until cases were averaging five a day or fewer, as well as "top notch contact tracing ... and, of course, a good dose of luck".

Full text: THE state government is considering relaxing mask rules.
It is understood they will be on the table at Saturday’s the crisis council of cabinet meeting, examining which restrictions can be eased.
Advice has circulated among senior public health officials that Victorians could safely ­remove masks when outdoors and alone or not near anyone else.
But the advice says there would be an ongoing requirement to continue to carry a mask at all times.
It would mean Victorians could potentially remove masks when out walking or sitting in a park or at the beach alone.
Premier Daniel Andrews has left the door open for further restrictions to be eased on Sunday, after a week of no new coronavirus cases.
But he has repeatedly spruiked the significant benefit of wearing masks and has said he has no intention of changing current mask restrictions.
However he could face new pressure in light of the public health advice, with division among the cabinet over certain restrictions and how long they should stay in place.
It is understood the Saturday meeting will focus on long-term planning of COVID-normal and what thresholds there should be for the future easing of restrictions.
“I’m very hopeful on Sunday that we can make announcements as we foreshadowed, we may be able to add a little bit there,” Mr Andrews said.
“Perhaps more importantly, we’ll then be able to talk about what the rest of November looks like.” Leading epidemiologists predict the state will move to a “smart masking” policy and use common sense to dictate when they will be worn.
Melbourne University’s Professor Tony Blakely — an epidemiologist and public health specialist who worked on the modelling used by the state government to control Victoria’s second wave — said the next step would come into play when the virus was considered under control.
“If we meet the working definition of elimination — 28 days [of zero cases and transmission] – then we can just put masks aside,” he said.
“But between now and then it can be rationalised to using in busy or crowded places.
“They will be (needed) on public transport or places like Smith Street, if you’re watching a band.” Prof Blakely said it would be “advisable” to wear them when feeling sick. Chair of epidemiology at Deakin University, Prof Catherine Bennett, said masks had played a vital role.
“We saw our reproduction numbers drop as masks were introduced in Melbourne, then Geelong, and then again in the rest of regional Victoria,” she said.
“They do make a difference, and Victorians wear them well enough for this to have helped us contain the second wave.” She said it was likely they would still be used in settings where it was not possible to keep a social distance.
“As we move from outbreak- response mode into prevention, masks will still have a place in closed indoor settings and public transport,” she said.
“If someone does attend an indoor venue with the virus, then the risk of transmission is reduced, and it is less likely that this will grow into a larger outbreak.” “I am hoping that we will have normalised people staying home if unwell,” she said.

$1 billion council merger failures

Publication info: Sydney Morning Herald ; Sydney, N.S.W. [Sydney, N.S.W]. 31 Oct 2020: 1.

Full text: The state government's controversial council merger policy is in crisis, with the 20 amalgamated councils losing $1.03 billion in three years and ratepayers facing hikes in rates and cuts in services.
As some merged councils battle for survival, others are under fire for overspending and mismanagement of questionable projects - including Bayside Council, which spent nearly $7 million of a government grant on astroturf in two neighbourhood parks, and Inner West Council, which spent almost $10 million on an IT project without going to tender.
The Coalition introduced the "Fit for the Future" merger policy in 2015 with a $627 million carrot to make councils more efficient, deliver better services and infrastructure, and address concerns that more than two-thirds of councils were losing money at an operating level and relying on state and federal government grants to stay afloat.
Then-premier Mike Baird argued it was "in the long-term interests of every ratepayer in this state".
But a failure to properly manage the mergers has resulted in at least two merged councils considering legal action and another, Central Coast Council, requesting a government bailout to pay thousands of staff and suppliers. The state government suspended the council yesterday and appointed an administrator. Inner West lost its chief executive last week as its finances deteriorated.
LSI Consulting - which has analysed the performance of councils for three decades and provided consulting services to councils across the country to find efficiencies - said the problems emerging in NSW councils in recent weeks were the tip of the iceberg.
"Mismanagement, a lack of transparency and inefficiencies due to a failure to control costs and understand efficiencies and productivity sums up what's going wrong with councils," LSI principal Ian Fahy said.
He said not only merged councils but councils across the country needed an overhaul. Mr Fahy said COVID-19 would put further pressure on council finances, leaving ratepayers to foot the bill through increased rates, which had outpaced inflation in the past decade in NSW and Victoria. "Rates will have to rise because councils have lost so much money. They will either have to get the money from state or federal grants or apply for a special rate variation."
He said there was little appetite from state and federal governments to make councils more accountable and productive, with at least half the councils in NSW and Victoria going backwards financially in the past three years.
A NSW government spokesman said the government did not commission the report and could not comment on its findings. He said the government provided record funding to support the new councils with more than $627 million provided towards upfront costs of amalgamation and infrastructure.
"Northern Beaches Council, for example, is on track to almost double the estimated savings from amalgamation with a projected $161.6 million saving over 10 years," the spokesman said, adding the government was committed to strengthening the sustainability, performance, integrity, accountability and transparency of NSW local government.
Using the published audited financial statements of the state's 128 councils, LSI created a productivity index to measure the operating performance of councils dating back to 2016, when NSW forced the super council mergers.
Using a definition of measuring productivity approved by the Productivity Commission it found that more than half had gone backwards over the period. LSI also analysed the accounts and calculated that accumulated operating losses across the 128 councils was $1.5 billion, excluding state and federal grants as they include handouts rather than operational income. The index measures councils' output relative to input. Output measures the services delivered by each council relative to the income they receive from rates, parking fees and other regulatory income. Input is what each council pays to deliver the services.
These figures, released exclusively to the Herald, reveal that 19 of the 20 super councils have lost money since the merger and chronically underperformed the remaining 108 NSW councils that weren't forced to merge.
LSI's figures reveal that, of NSW's 128 councils, eight of the 10 worst-performing were merged councils.
The data showed that the productivity index of the 20 merged councils went backwards 16 per cent since amalgamation, compared with a deterioration of almost 1 per cent for the remaining 108 NSW councils.
Overall the 20 councils reported a $1.03 billion operating loss, excluding grants, between 2016 and 2019.
The government said at the time of the mergers that they would not result in redundancies for three years and that hundreds of millions of dollars in sweeteners would be granted to the councils to help with the costs of merging. However, some councils said the sweeteners were not enough to fund the mergers and a lack of adequate funding is a reason for the poor performance.
Mr Fahy said the problem was councils weren't given a blueprint or model on how to merge. "Three years later there should be improvements but the figures aren't indicating that."
The worst-performing council in NSW was Bayside Council, formed by the merger of Botany Bay and Rockdale City councils. Its productivity has gone backwards since the merger, losing the equivalent of $155.7 million in productivity losses over three years.
The second worst-performing council in NSW was Inner West Council, formed from the merger of Marrickville, Leichhardt and Ashfield councils, which has lost the equivalent of $124 million since the merger; followed by Parramatta City Council, which has lost $113.5 million in productivity; Central Coast, which blew $113 million in declining productivity over three years and Northern Beaches, which lost $105 million in productivity.
Bayside has been criticised by residents for spending nearly $7 million of a $10 million government grant on astroturf for two neighbourhood parks, a project that was not raised by anyone at an outsourced community consultation.
"At no time did the community ever ask or request for synthetic turf to be installed at either Arncliffe Park or Gardiner Park," resident Garnet Brownbill said. "This went against consultants' recommendations and advice due to flooding and other concerns ... and has meant costs have blown out."
A council spokesperson said the Gardiner Park upgrade was selected to meet the growing demands of the community. Of the council's overall financial performance, the spokesperson said: "On a cumulative basis, for the past four financial years since amalgamation, Bayside has reported an operating surplus of $162.5 million (including capital grants and contributions) or a surplus of $17.9 million (excluding capital grants and contributions)."
Mr Fahy disputed the council's figures and said part of the deterioration in productivity since the merger was due to a blowout in labour and other costs.
At the Inner West Council, the amalgamation has meant merging three different systems for rates, library services, swimming pools and gyms, waste collection, street cleaning, fees and charges for sports grounds, and computer systems.
The council is still running three separate rates systems, though it will need to harmonise rates before the state government's deadline of July 2021. Central Coast Council is in financial strife and said it needed more than double what it was given by the state government. Announcing the appointment of administrator to the council yesterday, Minister for Local Government Shelley Hancock said: "There is a clear need for greater oversight and control over the council's budget and expenditure to restore its financial sustainability and importantly reinstill the community's trust in the effective functioning of their council."
Cumberland Council mayor Steve Christou described the merger as a "dud deal". He said the promised savings had not materialised and the government had not provided enough funding to cover the merger costs.
Cumberland ranked seventh-worst in NSW, losing $81.6 million since the merger. Mr Christou said the council was dealt a further financial blow when the government changed boundaries, stripping it of the industrial rates collected from Silverwater, which was allocated to Parramatta. He said the council had embarked on a huge productivity drive and was hoping to be in the black next year.
Mr Fahy said there were warning bells for the Central Coast Council, formed by the merger of Wyong and Gosford councils, well before COVID-19 hit.
On October 6, a draft interim report to the council indicated an expected budget deficit of $89 million, doubling an expected $41 million deficit. It has blamed the liquidity issues on the merger and COVID-19. There are also indications funds may have been misappropriated, with an investigation under way.
Linda Scott, president of Local Government NSW, the group representing the state's 128 councils, said the government needed to address concerns.
"If this government stands by their decision [to force amalgamations], the onus is on them to support forcibly merged councils through the full 10-year period their own modelling predicted it would take to achieve any financial benefit," Ms Scott said.
Professor Joseph Drew - an expert in local government from the University of Technology, Sydney - said at least half a dozen amalgamated NSW councils were, or would soon be, experiencing similar problems to the Central Coast Council, while those that had not been merged were feeling the financial strain of the coronavirus crisis.
"I'd like us to get proactive and give them the help they need before it gets to a disaster situation. And there are a lot of danger signs," he said. "When councils fail, people suffer. Where I see this heading is a lot of people getting hurt."
The state government's Stronger Communities Fund was intended to prop up councils affected by mergers by issuing grants for community projects but is now under investigation by the Auditor-General and the subject of a parliamentary inquiry over claims its $250 million grants round was used for pork-barrelling tool in the 2019 state election.
Inner West mayor Darcy Byrne said the government's promised financial savings from the forced amalgamations "have never materialised in any amalgamated councils".
"Many of the costliest decisions about staffing and IT at amalgamated councils were made after elected representatives had been sacked and the government's handpicked administrators were installed," he said.
"The truth is that amalgamations are very costly and very difficult, and the government should have fully funded these mergers instead of leaving councils to fight for scraps to survive."

State's contact tracing to face its biggest test

Full text: Victoria's contact tracing system is set to undergo its biggest test yet, as the state declares itself open for business.
Experts say yesterday's milestone of zero new cases is vindication of the government's hardline lockdown strategy.
Australian Medical Association Victorian president Julian Rait said he was cautiously confident that future outbreaks could be brought under control, after contact tracers were able to shut down several concerning outbreaks.
"But they have done this in the context of significant restrictions on movement," Associate Professor Rait said. "The test is when they open up."
For the first time since June 9, there were no new cases of coronavirus announced yesterday, prompting Premier Daniel Andrews, who had been waiting anxiously on testing results from the city's north, to declare "now is the time to open up".
La Trobe University epidemiologist Associate Professor Hassan Vally said contact tracers would face new challenges now that Victorians could go shopping and dine out again from tomorrow.
"As soon as you start opening up, people will have contact with more people, so the amount of work involved with interviewing every case potentially will increase," he said.
But he believes the state's tracing team are up to it.
"If you look at what has happened over the last couple of weeks with the response to this northern suburbs outbreak, the response to Shepparton and Kilmore, that's proof I would have thought that we should have every confidence in the public health response."
Only two weeks ago University of Melbourne Professor Tony Blakely, one of the authors of the modelling behind Victoria's road map, told The Age he thought it unlikely the state would ever get daily numbers down to zero.
"I'm pleasantly surprised we got down here. I thought it was a big ask to get to them by now. It's gone extremely well. It's a bouquet for [Chief Health Officer] Brett Sutton and [Deputy Chief Health Officer] Allen Cheng for saying 'let's go hard'."
Victoria's contact tracing system has come under fire for failing to control the state's second wave, but multiple experts said they now believe it is up to the job.
"Their contact tracing is now way better than it was even a month ago," said Dr Stephen Duckett, health program director at the Grattan Institute.
"A lot of people said zero is an impossible goal. And they called on the government to relax restrictions before it was safe to do so because they were so short-sighted and they did not care about the long-term and the risk of a third wave."
Victoria's head of contact tracing, Professor Euan Wallace, told The Age recent improvements were a "genuinely a good news story".
"If you look at Kilmore and Shepparton outbreaks, they got through literally hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of interviews in a matter of a couple of days, something that if we rewind the clock back to the beginning of July, we could just never have delivered."
But while Victoria has zero new cases, the virus has not been eliminated. Professor Blakely's modelling suggests the chances of a serious virus resurgence by Christmas were now around 3 per cent.
"What we can expect more generally, is unless we get really really lucky and eliminate this thing - which is possible but a low probability - what's going to happen is we're going to have cases bubbling along in the same way as NSW."

City in battle to reach target

Full text: Melbourne has a 50 per cent chance or less of meeting thresholds for coronavirus restrictions to be eased on October 19, according to Doherty Institute modelling.
As Chief Health Officer Brett Sutton insists he has trust in Victoria's contact-tracing systems, the modelling released yesterday showed it would be a tight call on whether Victoria reached a 14-day average of five cases per day by next Monday.
The research reflects more cautious rhetoric this week from Professor Sutton and Premier Daniel Andrews as case numbers bounced between single and double digits.
Professor Jodie McVernon and Professor James McCaw, the lead researchers from the Doherty Institute, said their modelling was based on the trajectory of recent case numbers.
They suggest Melbourne should follow a number of measures to safely reopen, including increasing the focus on "super-spreaders".
"It's clear Melbourne cannot stay in lockdown indefinitely," they said. "Lockdowns are an emergency brake on widespread community transmission."
The comments come amid concern over the outbreak in the town of Kilmore, where families say they were given conflicting and confusing advice from the state's contact tracing team.
Professor Sutton said his department would take feedback on board, but he had faith in the contact-tracing team that has been bolstered to more than 2000 people after being swamped during the second wave of the virus.
"I accept there will always be gaps and things that we need to tighten up, things that we need to review because there's feedback about what isn't working," he said.
Yesterday's 11 new cases took the statewide 14-day average to 9.9 cases per day, with just over a week to drive the average towards five. In the next 10 days, the state must record fewer than 28 new cases - or an average of fewer than three cases a day - to reach the target.
Six of yesterday's new cases have been linked to known outbreaks. The other five cases remain under investigation.
There are now 195 active cases in the state, the first time it has been below 200 since June. Regional Victoria now has four active cases after a case in Mildura reported on Thursday was rejected.

Full text: Victoria is on track to record about 30 new daily cases of COVID-19 at the end of the stage four lockdown.
A leading epidemiologist says the numbers are now low enough to enable contact tracers to get on top of their caseload.
As Premier Daniel Andrews expressed optimism about the daily coronavirus count dropping to its lowest levels in five weeks, modelling by University of Melbourne epidemiologist Tony Blakely sheds light on the number of new daily cases we can expect to see within a few weeks. "We are falling at a crackingly good pace," he says.
However, there are limitations to the projections, which use trends over the past 10 days to predict the next few weeks before stage four restrictions are set to end on September 13. Professor Blakely says the virus might keep spreading among essential workers in hospitals, aged care and distribution centres, slowing the rate of decline.

Panic Room

Full text: On the day Daniel Andrews announced all of Melbourne would return to lockdown, he was asked whether failings in hotel quarantine were to blame. His answer, put simply, was that he didn't know.
Victoria's Premier spoke of the mysteries and riddles of the virus. "Sometimes you will never know where things came from," he mused. The genomic picture, DNA tracing used to plot the origins and spread of an outbreak, remained incomplete. "There is no further information I can provide to you," he told journalists. "When I can then of course we will."
Andrews was not being untruthful. The genomic picture is never complete during a pandemic. Every time a new case emerges, it takes on average five days for scientists from Melbourne University's Microbiological Diagnostics Unit (MDU), a public health lab that pre-dates the Spanish flu, to break down the viral genome and match it to others in its database. It is science both on the edge and forever playing catch-up.
Nor was the Premier being entirely honest.
On the same day Andrews announced Melbourne's return to lockdown, senior figures leading Victoria's COVID-19 response were briefed on the latest developments. This briefing contained information from the Intelligence Section of the COVID-19 Public Health Incident Management Team which, every week, receives genomic data from the MDU.
This information went beyond what the Premier had publicly revealed a week earlier when he said a "significant number and potentially more" of the outbreaks in Melbourne's northern suburbs were attributable, via genomic sequencing, to quarantine hotel staff. It was now clear that, when the virus first broke out of Rydges Hotel on Swanston Street and subsequently the Stamford Plaza Hotel in Little Collins Street, Victoria was all but COVID-free.
The entire second wave - every known infection - had been traced back to these quarantine hotels.
If not for the failures in quarantine, Melbourne would have been emerging from the social and economic ravages of the pandemic instead of plunging into a second, more deadly COVID-19 crisis. This, to borrow a phrase from Andrews, was further information he could have made public.
Victoria's trust in its political leadership was tested in two significant ways this week. As details of the hotel quarantine debacle emerged in the Coate inquiry, Andrews' integrity was drawn into sharp focus by Defence COVID-19 Taskforce Commander Lieutenant-General John Frewen's testimony to the Senate about the ADF's preparedness to put boots in the lobbies of Victoria's quarantine hotels, if only we had asked.
Andrews is not alone in having to account for previous things said in the pandemic. Prime Minister Scott Morrison's defence against accusations the federal government failed to prepare the aged care sector for outbreaks - that the abrupt standing-down of all management and staff at nursing homes like St Basil's could not have been anticipated or considered - appears at odds with advice provided by his own government to aged care providers two months ago.
Yet it is in Victoria and particularly Melbourne - which remains under crippling stage four restrictions and a curfew - where the stakes are highest.
All of us have a shared interest in the Andrews government successfully leading Victoria out of this crisis. There is a political compact at work which acknowledges the scale of the problems being confronted, the speed with which decisions must be taken and the inevitability that mistakes will be made. But if a leader is not entirely truthful about decisions they are taking, do they undermine the additional political licence given to them in an emergency?
When the genomic picture finally did finally emerge, tendered as an exhibit in the inquiry into hotel quarantine chaired by Justice Jennifer Coate, it revealed a story both sad and maddening. It is a graph which, at first glance, appears a confusing mess of dots. When you look at it long enough, the tragedy of Victoria's pandemic emerges like a gestalt puzzle.
The bottom half of the graph plots Victoria's first wave of infections. It shows that nearly every strain had disappeared from the chart by early May. Melbourne's second wave epidemic starts with the band marked "Transmission network 2".
This is the Rydges on Swanston outbreak started by four orange dots - a family of four returned from overseas. Transmission network 3 and the cluster labelled 45A relate to the Stamford Plaza. That mass of black dots stretching from June into July and August represents outbreaks at housing commission towers, schools, meat works, logistics centres and aged care centres. Every black dot is a person. When the graph was prepared for the Coate inquiry, more than 200 of them had died in the second wave.
The Coate inquiry has heard evidence from nurses, security guards and guests from quarantine hotels describing a shambolic approach to infectious disease control. As compelling as some of this testimony was, the most damning evidence was contained in a bland two-page document, developed by the DHHS-led Operation Soteria taskforce responsible for hotel quarantine, advising security guards on the use of PPE.
Professor Lindsay Grayson, the director of the Austin Hospital's infectious disease department, told the hearing that staff and security guards working at quarantine hotels should have adhered to the same standards of PPE required by healthcare workers at the Austin whenever dealing with people suspected of having the virus.
This means that security guards working in the lobby and stationed on hotel floors should have been dressed in full PPE including level 2 surgical masks, safety glasses or face masks, long-sleeve, single-use gowns and single-use latex gloves. Masks should have been changed at the start of each shift, the end of the shift, after every meal break and otherwise at least every four hours. Security guards should have been shown how to don and doff their PPE without contaminating themselves and fellow workers.
The advice to security guards contained in the Operation Soteria document fell woefully short of this standard. As of June 8, after the virus had broken out of the Rydges and was breaking out at Stamford Plaza, Operation Soteria was telling security guards that so long as they stayed 1.5 metres away from returned travellers, there was no need to wear any PPE in the hotel lobby, on the hotel floors and even in the doorway of rooms occupied by hotel guests.
When Grayson was shown the advice by the Unified Security Group's counsel, Arthur Moses, SC, he was incredulous.
On this evidence alone, the most shocking thing about Victoria's hotel quarantine program is not that guards and staff were infected at two hotels; it is that breakouts occurred at so few hotels.
The consequences of this are being felt by every household and business in Victoria. Nick Economou, a senior lecturer on politics at Monash University, believes the political implications are also likely to be significant.
"The core problem for Daniel Andrews is the administration of quarantine on his watch. It is very hard to get away from that," Economou says. "I actually think his position is bad and getting worse and I expect him not to be the leader at the next election."
Does this help explain why we had to wait this long to see the genomics data?
Over the past two months, Andrews and Victoria's Chief Health Officer Brett Sutton have been asked about this modelling. Each time they proffered reasons for why it could not be released.
On July 14, Sutton said the data was not his to release: "It's not my genomic sequencing data, it belongs to the Peter Doherty Institute." He said he wouldn't comment on the data because it would be subject to a judicial inquiry.
On August 6, the day after Coate issued a statement clarifying there was no legal impediment to anyone discussing matters before her inquiry, Andrews was again asked about the data. "The genomic sequencing report is not a document that I hold, it is not a product that I have," he said.
Andrews and Sutton did not lie. But neither were they entirely truthful.
The genomic sequencing provided to the Coate inquiry is owned by the MDU, housed inside Melbourne University's Doherty Institute. The data is shared on a weekly basis with the DHHS, which funds the MDU and is free to use it as it sees fit.
Professor Ben Howden, the director of the MDU, told the hearing: "I understand the data, and related information and reports, are provided to the [DHHS] and the department is able to use that information, including by publishing it for public health purposes."
An MDU spokeswoman confirmed to The Age: "The MDU does not place restrictions on what DHHS can do with data provided to it by the MDU."
Sutton, a senior public servant within the DHHS, should have known this. Earlier this year, he co-authored with Howden and Dr Charles Alpren, a DHHS epidemiologist, a study based on genomic analysis of Victoria's first wave infections. That study and the genomic data it contains have been published on an open access platform since May 16. The Victorian Premier doesn't need to "hold" a document paid for and provided to his government to authorise its release.
The importance of the genomic data to our understanding of Victoria's second wave was underscored by Alpren, who told the Coate inquiry that 99 per cent of all current COVID-19 cases in Victoria had arisen from either the Rydges or Stamford Plaza hotels. For all the riddles of this virus, there is no mystery as to why Andrews wanted this publicly known later rather than sooner.
Andrews' dispute with the ADF is another matter.
When the Premier told a Victorian parliamentary committee on August 11 "I don't believe ADF support was on offer" for hotel quarantine, he was calling into question the sincerity of previous public statements made by the Prime Minister, ADF top brass and, perversely, himself.
When challenged on this, Andrews cited a carefully phrased statement from Victoria's Emergency Management Commissioner Andrew Crisp, who said that, in the co-ordination and planning meetings he chaired on March 27 and 28, "I did not seek nor did representatives of the ADF offer assistance as part of the hotel quarantine program".
Frewen cut through these word games. He told the Senate it was "made plain" that ADF assistance was available to all states and territories to help establish the regime and confirmed that in Victoria, 100 ADF personnel were "stood to" for this purpose.
Andrews refused to budge. The day after the general's testimony, he said "no one has ever questioned" whether ADF troops were put on standby.
No one other than Andrews. It was he who, five days earlier, when asked to respond to the reports of troop readiness carried in this newspaper, replied: "I am not sure who has confirmed that 100 troops were on standby. I see some reports but there are no names associated with any of those reports."
There was one name associated with those reports; the order to put 100 troops on standby in Victoria was given by Australia's most senior soldier, ADF chief General Angus Campbell.
Andrews cannot change his position now. To do so would be to admit he misled parliament. The opposition is already calling for him to resign on that basis.
The issue before the Coate inquiry is why Victoria chose not to make use of ADF personnel within quarantine hotels.
Does it matter whether Andrews is being entirely truthful about these episodes?
Monash University associate professor of politics Paul Strangio, in contrast to Economou, doubts whether public faith in the Premier has been shaken.
"I think there is a bit of a disjunction with the way the public is looking upon this moment and how the media is looking upon it," he says. "We do have to give some allowance for the complexities of leadership and government in a situation like this. Mistakes are going to be made. There is a massive, bureaucratic machinery working at a hyper pace and politicians don't always have all the answers."
James Paterson, the Liberal senator who questioned Frewen about the quarantine hotels, is less charitable. "We are asking for unprecedented things from Australians and from Victorians. You would think the bare minimum they deserve in response to that is complete honesty about what we are doing and why we are doing it. Either withholding information or trying to play cute games to try to get around responsibility for decisions we have made is not in that spirit."
Rebecca Huntley, the head of Vox Populi Research, says it is difficult to read the public mood in a fast-moving pandemic. Like Economou, she believes we are approaching a point where the public no longer accepts it is living in a crisis and the normal rules of political engagement resume. When that happens, whatever emergency compact we have had with government will become null and void. In the meantime, further prevarication won't help Andrews.
The Socialist Left faction of the Victorian Labor Party, to which Andrews belongs, has a simple creed which could just as easily be a bumper sticker for 2020. It is "Live to fight the next day".
Strangio says that through this pandemic we are seeing the strengths and weaknesses of the Premier's political style writ large. He bulldozes through controversy and doesn't admit mistakes. He vows to accept responsibility for whatever emerges in the Coate inquiry yet remains unapologetic for decisions he has taken.
"He is convinced that by his hard work he will be judged and prevail," Strangio adds.
Are enough Victorians still similarly convinced?

Full text: Victoria is on track to record about 30 new daily cases of COVID-19 at the end of the stage four lockdown.
A leading epidemiologist says the numbers are now low enough to enable contact tracers to get on top of their caseload.
As Premier Daniel Andrews expressed optimism about the daily coronavirus count dropping to its lowest levels in five weeks, modelling by University of Melbourne epidemiologist Tony Blakely sheds light on the number of new daily cases we can expect to see within a few weeks. "We are falling at a crackingly good pace," he says.
However, there are limitations to the projections, which use trends over the past 10 days to predict the next few weeks before stage four restrictions are set to end on September 13. Professor Blakely says the virus might keep spreading among essential workers in hospitals, aged care and distribution centres, slowing the rate of decline.

Virus bans ease amid fears of new wave

Full text: Victoria will forge ahead with loosening coronavirus restrictions on Monday as experts worry the state could be at the "tipping point" of a second wave of infections.
Thirteen new COVID-19 cases were reported in Victoria yesterday - the third successive day with a double-digit rise.
Five new cases were among security guards at city quarantine hotel the Stamford Plaza, where lax hygiene has been blamed for a cluster of seven cases that medical experts expect to spread.
Victoria has recorded 52 active cases in the past three days, bringing the state's tally to 91 and increasing the national count to 412 after months of steady decline.
The increase began on Monday and has continued every day this week as medical experts urge Australians to be vigilant against the risk of a second wave of infections.
Victoria's Deputy Chief Medical Officer, Dr Annaliese van Diemen, said more than 200 Stamford Plaza workers were in self-isolation and it "won't be a huge surprise" if more cases emerge.
The Stamford Plaza has been hosting a large number of returned travellers in quarantine.
"There's been some closer mingling of these guards than we would like in the workplace," Dr van Diemen said. "It would appear that the consequences had already begun, unfortunately. It's not good news we have the outbreaks but reassuring to know there is a clear source for that particular outbreak."
The Stamford Plaza is the second Melbourne quarantine hotel where poor hygiene has been blamed for an outbreak. Staff at Carlton's Rydges on Swanston - the source of 18 cases - have spoken publicly about a failure to enforce safety protocols.
On Thursday, Dr van Diemen cast some doubt on the Andrews government's plans to ease restrictions from Monday as the number of cases surged. By yesterday, however, Dr van Diemen was echoing the government's promise, confirming the weekend's case numbers would not affect plans to allow gyms and cinemas to re-open and restaurants to host up to 50 people.
"Two days are not going to make a huge difference to be honest, so the current plan is to go ahead," Dr van Diemen said, adding yesterday's numbers were "less concerning" than Thursday's, given there were fewer with an unknown source.
Of yesterday's 13 new cases, two are linked to a new family outbreak, six to known outbreaks, one is a returned overseas traveller in hotel quarantine, three were found through routine testing and one remains under investigation.
Victoria recorded 52 new COVID-19 cases since Wednesday, which notably included 19 without a known source - the key metric authorities examine to understand the spread of the virus. Twenty-two were returned travellers in quarantine.
Professor James McCaw, an epidemiologist with the Doherty Institute who has worked on government modelling during the pandemic, said it was fair to ask whether Victoria should be loosening the rules on June 22. "The situation in Victoria is hard to understand right now. We don't know if this is the earliest phase of more widespread transmission, or if this is just a statistical fluctuation - a blip," Professor McCaw said yesterday.
Cases reported from the last few days would have been transmitted one to two weeks ago, he said.
Professor McCaw said that if cases continued to rise on the weekend and those cases were not connected to a single cluster, then "that would feel to me strongly suggestive of increasing community-level transmission".
Catherine Bennett, chair of epidemiology at Deakin University, said community transmission cases caught by routine testing showed "the virus is still circulating".
"I think it's potentially a tipping point, if you like, the fact that we're finding more cases through routine testing," Professor Bennett said.
"It's a ticking time bomb, if you like, while we've still got the virus circulating."
But Professor Bennett said case numbers were still low compared to the rest of the world, and Victoria had been aggressively testing the community. "The numbers are still low, but we are right to worry."
Peter Collignon, an infectious diseases physician and a professor at the Australian National University, said the reversing trend of infection showed eradication was unlikely.
"Most of the active cases are returned travellers, but the ones that worry me are the ones where there is not an obvious association - they're in the community," he said.

Police state driven by overreaction and alarmism

Full text: ANNALIESE Van Diemen’s tweet exposes the coronavirus gang. What kind of extremists have turned Victoria almost into a police state?
Her tweet abusing Captain James Cook helps to explain why Victoria has Australia’s toughest coronavirus laws, and why we’ll all pay as its Labor Government destroys its economy and looks to China for rescue.
Van Diemen is Victoria’s deputy chief health officer, helping to fight the coronavirus. Yet at 10.16am last Wednesday, she took time out to attack the 250th anniversary of Cook’s landing at Botany Bay.
She tweeted: “Sudden arrival of an invader from another land, decimating populations, creating terror. Forces the population to make enormous sacrifices & completely change how they live in order to survive. COVID19 or Cook 1770?” Most critics attacked just one half of Van Diemen’s astonishing analogy – the one showing that this graduate of James Cook University is amazingly ignorant of Cook himself.
Cook spent just one week at Botany Bay and killed nobody. Instead, he describes in his journal repeatedly trying to befriend Aborigines: “We left several articles such as Cloth, Looking glasses, Combs, Beeds (sic) Nails &c.” But look at the other side of Van Diemen’s crazy analogy – that this virus is “decimating” our population.
This virus has so far killed just 94 Australians, half aged 80 or older and many already sick. In comparison, 1255 Australians died of the flu in 2017.
This is where we should start feeling scared of the kind of people who’ve imposed Australia’s harshest coronavirus bans, stopping Victorians even from playing golf, visiting their children or going to school. None of those bans are likely to make any real difference to the transmission of a virus that is very rarely spread outdoors, rarely infects children, and has just 50 or so Victorians sick right now – all either safely in hospital or in quarantine.
Van Diemen’s boss chief health officer Brett Sutton has huge powers under Victoria’s state of emergency to impose coronavirus bans, yet still found time in March to publish a paper warning that global warming, too, was an “existential threat”.
He recommended tough “whole-of-government” crackdowns to save us from alleged disasters such as “flooding, coastal inundation, bushfire, extreme wind, soil movement and extreme heat”.
Hmm. Sutton, like Van Diemen, seems prone to catastrophising. Indeed, just two weeks ago he was still claiming his coronavirus bans had saved 36,000 lives, when the NSW Government was modestly claiming to have saved just 700.
Sutton was clearly still relying on discredited modelling by the Peter Doherty Institute, which used dodgy Chinese data to warn the virus would kill between 50,000 and 150,000 Australians. That modelling so panicked the Victorian Government that it spent $1.3 billion to create 4500 intensive care beds. Just seven beds are being used.
Sutton and Van Diemen report to a premier, Daniel Andrews, who shares not just their politics, but their alarmism.
Andrews signed on to the “belt and road initiative” of China’s dictatorship, which aims to increase China’s reach and power through trade, investments and access to ports. Through a spokesman, Andrews last week said we now needed this deal even more: “(These) opportunities will be more important than ever as we rebuild from this crisis.”So what Andrews destroyed with his bans, China will be invited to help rebuild. Does this not worry you, too?

Cook spent just one week at Botany Bay and killed nobody. Instead, he describes in his journal repeatedly trying to befriend Aborigines: “We left several articles such as Cloth, Looking glasses, Combs, Beeds (sic) Nails &c.” This alone suggests Van Diemen may form her opinions by consulting not the facts but political fashions, as when she berates Australia as a “racist nation”.
But look at the other side of Van Diemen’s crazy analogy — that this virus is “decimating” our population.
Again, she is catastrophising. This virus has so far killed just 94 Australians, half aged 80 or older and many already sick. In comparison, 1255 Australians died of the flu in 2017.
This is where we should start feeling scared of the kind of people who’ve imposed Australia’s harshest coronavirus bans, stopping Victorians even from playing golf, visiting their children or going to school.
None of those bans are likely to make any real difference to the transmission of a virus that is very rarely spread outdoors, rarely infects children and has just 50 or so Victorians ill right now — all either safely in hospital or in quarantine.
But it turns out Van Diemen is far from alone in wildly exaggerating dangers we face.
Take her boss. Chief Health Officer Brett Sutton has huge powers under Victoria’s state of emergency to impose coronavirus bans, yet still found time in March to publish a paper warning that global warming, too, was an “existential threat”.
He recommended tough “whole-of-government” crackdowns to save us from alleged disasters such as “flooding, coastal inundation, bushfire, extreme wind, soil movement and extreme heat”.
Hmm. Sutton, like Van Diemen, seems prone to catastrophising. Indeed, just two weeks ago he was still claiming his coronavirus bans had saved 36,000 lives, when the NSW government was modestly claiming to have saved just 700.
Sutton was clearly still relying on discredited modelling by the Peter Doherty Institute, which used dodgy Chinese data to warn the virus would kill between 50,000 and 150,000 Australians. That modelling so panicked the Victorian government that it spent $1.3 billion to create 4500 intensive care beds. Just seven beds are being used.
Victoria overreacted because Sutton and Van Diemen report to a Premier, Daniel Andrews, who shares not just their politics but their alarmism, and has a disturbing streak of authoritarianism.
Andrews, of Labor’s Socialist Left faction, already had Australia’s most absurdly tough global warming policies, and now has the most absurd coronavirus laws as well.
He even defended his golf ban as a matter of life or death: “I don’t need to play golf, and me playing golf is not worth someone’s life.” What a mad rationalisation. Golf with social distancing would kill nobody. Nor do we “need” to do anything that makes life worth living, including visiting family and friends, or just sitting at the beach to watch the sun go down.
Andrews’ response shows little respect for freedom. Nor does his solution to the economic devastation he is causing.
Alone among Australia’s leaders, he signed on to the “belt and road initiative” of China’s dictatorship, which aims to increase China’s reach and power through trade, investments and access to ports.
Through a spokesman, Andrews last week said we now needed this deal with the dictatorship even more: “(These) opportunities will be more important than ever as we rebuild from this crisis.” So what Andrews destroyed with his bans, China will be invited to help rebuild. Does this not worry you, too?
COOKING THE BOOKS TO mark James Cook landing at Botany Bay 250 years ago, the ABC somehow found activist Teresa Ardler.
Ardler said stories that Cook fired into the air to stop Aborigines throwing spears were “not the true history, because my grandfather was shot.” Wow. Her grandfather must have lived to 200.
Amazingly, SBS, also taxpayer-funded, interviewed Rodney Kelly, also claiming descent from the man Cook stung with small shot.
Kelly claimed his ancestors said “Cook left casks of dynamite on the shore, rigged to blow up”. But dynamite wasn’t invented until 1867.

Gyms, nightclubs could be last in line

Full text: Gyms, nightclubs and international travel should be among the last services to reopen in any rollback of Australia's coronavirus lockdown restrictions, according to a public health expert advising the federal government.
Conversely, the closure of parks, beaches, restaurants and professional sporting competitions could be among the first measures to be reversed, along with the removal of limits on the size of public gatherings.
In a sign the Australian government is considering how a loosening of restrictions might be handled, it has asked 80 experts to prepare a report, expected to be finished by April 20, to advise on the benefits and risks of rolling back various social restrictions.
The Victorian government, however, says it has no foreseeable plans to reduce restrictions, despite the state recording just 106 new cases since Monday.
Associate Professor Adam Kamradt-Scott, an expert in health security with the University of Sydney who is a member of the government advisory panel, said any loosening of rules will be highly dependent on the public adhering to social distancing measures.
"Public spaces like beaches and gardens are not problematic themselves. We just have to avoid scenes like at Bondi Beach, where people ignore the social distancing rules. That's our big challenge," Dr Kamradt-Scott said. COVID-19 survives on stainless steel for up to 72 hours, making gyms and their equipment potent virus spreaders, he said.
Opening borders to international travel raises the risk of new infections entering the country, while nightclubs, as an area where high numbers of people congregate in a closed environment, would also be problematic.
"It might be the government decides to take a different track, such as that people could move around during business hours but there's a curfew from say 7pm, to prevent people congregating in bars and nightclubs and so forth," Dr Kamradt-Scott said.
Maximilian de Courten, a global health expert with Victoria University and former World Health Organisation staff member, said reducing the two-person gathering limit would be a logical starting point. "We might go to five people, then to 10. That means we could have private gatherings in houses, then it could be reflected in certain professions - in shops where only five people can be inside, that could go up to 10," he said.
Dr Kamradt-Scott said restaurants may be allowed to reopen as they can self-police social distancing guidelines by only allowing a certain number of guests.
Professor James McCaw, an epidemiologist with the Peter Doherty Institute who has worked on modelling provided to the government, said it was tough to distinguish which restrictions should be lifted first because they were applied in such rapid succession.
He said Australia would be watching countries such as Austria and Denmark, who slightly loosened their lockdowns this week. Professor McCaw warned that "when we do roll anything back, we won't know if it was a safe decision or not for a few weeks".
"So each change would be well separated from one another," he said. "It would be inevitable that we will roll something back and realise we shouldn't have, then put it back on. It's essentially an experiment."
Economist Chris Richardson said he expected the government would look to reopen "gateway sectors" that free up or stimulate other industries as a priority.
"I would say the first thing to open is schools. A whole bunch of kids at home means there are a whole bunch of parents who can't work or work as they would otherwise do," he said.

Full text: The sane, definitive way out of this crisis is an effective treatment and a scalable vaccine, writes NADIA LEVIN.
Not since World War II has Australia and the world been under such strict constraints, with limits on where we can travel, what we can buy and who we can socialise with.
Our scientists, like our health workforce, are working around the clock, racing to find the best possible solutions to this global health crisis. As our Prime Minister has said, this crisis could last for six months and indeed beyond. It is in these trying times that Australians look to health and medical researchers for answers.
Our world-leading researchers have been helping explain what this virus is, how it behaves and spreads, how to detect it and how we can protect ourselves. For more than 80 years, we Australians have been investing in our research workforce; via the National Health and Medical Research Council, the CSIRO, and more recently, the Medical Research Future Fund. It is in times like these that we reap the returns.
The sane, definitive way out of this crisis is an effective treatment for those infected and the development of a vaccine scaled up and produced en masse to protect the wider population. As Deputy Chief Medical Officer Paul Kelly said this week, it is impossible to defeat the coronavirus without a vaccine.
Australia is leading the charge in many respects. We have research leaders such as Professor Raina MacIntyre, a Professor of Global Biosecurity at UNSW's Kirby Institute, tracking Australia's circumstances against the spread of COVID-19 in other nations so we can plan the next phase. James McCaw, a Professor of Mathematical Biology at the University of Melbourne, is using mathematical modelling to develop scenarios that assist that decision-making.
Professor Sharon Lewin, Director of the Doherty Institute, has her team isolating, growing and monitoring how our immune system responds to the virus. UQ's Professor Paul Young is leading the team that is developing candidate vaccines, and they aim to commence a trial by July. They believe that by bringing vaccine manufacture forward, to run in parallel with clinical trials, they could have a vaccine ready by as early as January. Reducing the vaccine development time to 12 months would be a remarkable achievement.
Researchers and experts have been able to give us information we need to empower us to assert some control; exercising basic hand hygiene, working remotely and physical distancing or isolation if exposed to the virus.
And while our leaders need to make the big decisions, they are emphasising that they are acting on expert advice. And this is critical to our confidence in them, because this is what we as a community expect - that the response to a pandemic is based on science, it is rational and it is implementable.
Saturday's announcement by ministers Greg Hunt and Karen Andrews of a $230 million upgrade to the CSIRO's Australian Centre for Disease Preparedness is a welcome nod to the core role our scientists play in the response to this pandemic, and the pandemics that follow - because there will be other pandemics.
Together, our community - political, business and community leaders; health care providers; individuals and families - will come through this current crisis, and the contributions being made by our researchers, medics and nurses are helping ensure the best possible outcome for us all.
We are in a very different place to where we were a century ago when the Spanish Flu struck, as we can rapidly respond using evidence-based research. This pandemic shines a spotlight on the crucial importance of investment in health and medical research in Australia. It is vital for our health and our national security. We are proud of our research and medical workforce and exceptionally grateful that they are here.
Nadia Levin is the chief executive and managing director of Research Australia, the national peak body for Australian health and medical research.

Full text: The blue-and-white tents that quietly went up outside Australia’s largest hospital are deserted for now. It won’t last.
This is what a coronavirus fever clinic looks like, the plastic chairs for the sick and scared spaced 1.5m apart, side flaps raised to allow ready access from the emergency department of Royal Brisbane and Women’s Hospital.
Dozens of them will be established to deal with the anticipated onslaught of COVID-19.
Across the nation, plans that have been in the making since the virus erupted out of China last ­December are being fast-tracked, with health authorities all too aware the crunch has arrived with the onset of person-to-person ­infections here.
The Weekend Australian has gone inside the mobilisation effort in Queensland to gauge how the public health response will unfold. Fever clinics are the tip of the spear, designed to triage symptomatic patients when they present to public hospitals.
Some will be under canvas such as at RBWH in central Brisbane, where work continued on Friday to ready the tented reception centre. Inside the sprawling hospital, surgeons have operated through weekends to clear elective lists, making space for the ­expected influx of COVID-19 ­patients. Intensive care capacity has been doubled.
At Prince Charles Hospital in the city’s north, masked and gowned nurses were on hand to assess the steady stream of ­anxious people seeking attention.
Of the 90 cases so far handled by its fever clinic, three have tested positive. “We are prepared for the worst and hoping for the best,” said infectious disease director Alex Chaudhuri. “Our plan is to be adaptable and resilient and … we are certainly increasing our ­capacity in the fever clinic as part of that strategy to deal with the ­increasing numbers.” Public and private pathology services have geared up to screen thousands in clinics as well as at home, a key feature of the containment plan.
In the absence of a vaccine, Queensland, like other states, is stockpiling antiviral drugs developed for HIV to help the most seriously ill; hotels will be pressed into service as makeshift treatment centres for those less at risk if the hospitals are overwhelmed.
“We have planned, we have got everything in place, we will be able to do much, much better than China,” Queensland chief health officer Jeannette Young said.
“They were in the middle of it before they even knew they had it. We have got all of those processes happening now.” The virus is taking hold with confronting speed. Person-to-­person transmission wasn’t supposed to happen for another six weeks, according to modelling for Queensland Health, but within a day of the first homegrown cases being confirmed in Sydney, a 95-year-old nursing home resident was dead at Dorothy Henderson Lodge in suburban Macquarie Park, where three other elderly patients and two staff members are down with COVID-19, among the 64 Australians to test positive to date.
Dr Young said Queensland Health assumed that at least a quarter and up to a third of the state’s population would be hit in the “first wave” of the epidemic — between 1.25 million and 1.7 million people. Thankfully, 80 per cent of them would experience no more than mild cold-like symptoms, based on the international experience.
That would still leave up to 300,000 people moderately to critically ill, many requiring hospitalisation. Dr Young said the imperative was to slow the rate at which the virus burned through the citizenry: by “flattening” the wave of infection over months if not a year or more, time could be bought for the health system.
“We want to push it out … so that the same number of people still get it, but they won’t all get it at the same time,” she said.
Much will depend on public buy-in to the strategy to isolate the infected and those with whom they have been in close contact. The last thing the health ser­vices want is for panicked people to mob hospital fever clinics at the first sign of a cough or running nose.
“We know for the vast majority of people who get this they are quite well for the first five days,” Dr Young said. “It is just a sniffle, a low-grade fever. And then, for the 20 per cent of people who don’t do as well, that’s when people start to get sick.” In most cases, symptomatic ­patients would be asked first to see a GP who would either screen them on site or arrange testing through a pathology service.
The state was also in discussion with the federal government to fund under Medicare virtual fever clinics, an expansion of telehealth services used in the bush, Dr Young said.
The major telehealth providers in Queensland, QML Pathology and Sullivan Nicolaides Pathology, would set up extra testing ­stations and support a “home hospital” program for people to have the oral and nasal swabs taken without stepping outside the front door.
Only if the results were positive would patients be directed to a fever clinic. Ideally, they would be taken straight into a single room to be seen by a doctor. If there was a wait, they would sit on chairs spaced at least 1.5m apart to minimise the risk of cross-infection.
“There is no way we want ­people with flu getting mixed with people who might have COVID-19,” Dr Young said.
“People won’t be sitting in a waiting room mixing their viruses … that won’t happen.” The early HIV medication Kaletra had been used on a group of Chinese tourists who fell ill on the Gold Coast in late January, and the antiretroviral’s active ingredient, lopinavir, was being cached to treat severely affected coronavirus patients.
The medical jury is still out on the effectiveness of the drug, which has shown promise against the coronaviruses of SARS and MERS, as well as in the lab.Sharon Lewin, director of Melbourne’s Peter Doherty Institute for Infection and Immunity, said lopinavir was not “super potent but it definitely works”, while a spokesman for the federal Health Department said clinical guidelines would be issued when enough data came in.
