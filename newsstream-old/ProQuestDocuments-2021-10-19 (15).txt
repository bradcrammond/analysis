Full text: Victoria is close to reaching the peak of its third coronavirus wave but epidemiologists say there is no reason why a cautious reopening cannot go ahead next week as planned, despite the state reaching a grim milestone yesterday of 2297 new infections recorded in a day.
Experts predict case numbers could begin to fall within days, coinciding with the first significant lifting of restrictions next week. Under the changes, fully vaccinated Melburnians will be allowed to get a haircut and dine and shop outside.
Premier Daniel Andrews confirmed that the reopening next Thursday would not be affected by the high case numbers, saying the government had a "fundamentally really important agreement with the Victorian community" that if the public was vaccinated, the state would open up.
Victorians are forecast to hit the 70 per cent double-dose milestone as soon as next Thursday, at which point in Melbourne, hospitality venues will reopen to 50 patrons outdoors, the 9pm curfew will be dropped and permitted outdoor gatherings will increase to 10 people.
Yesterday, 11 more deaths were reported. About 87.6 per cent of eligible Victorians aged 16 and over have now received at least one vaccine dose and 62 per cent both doses.
"That's why we're going to be opening up, because people have got vaccinated in record numbers, in record time, and they should be proud of that," Mr Andrews said.
James McCaw, an epidemiologist and mathematical biologist with the University of Melbourne, said Victoria was on the cusp of hitting its peak of infections, meaning there was no need to re-evaluate the opening plan.
"Maybe it won't be today or tomorrow, maybe it will be in five days' time, but the epidemic is very close to its peak," said Professor McCaw, whose team has been carrying out modelling for the government since the start of the pandemic. "It is far more likely the numbers will start to go down within the next week than it is to continue to rise."
Professor McCaw said while case numbers were higher in Victoria yesterday than he had hoped, he had taken heart in promising signs the outbreak was on the verge of plateauing.
For the first time during this outbreak, the transmission potential, which measures how capable the virus is of spreading, by analysing movement and vaccine coverage, dipped to below one.
"This means the virus is just not able to spread," he said.
But the most reliable indicator of whether the epidemic was growing or declining was the effective reproduction number, which measures how many people each infected person passes the virus onto.
Professor McCaw said this number had also dipped this week to its lowest point since August. For cases to drop, this number needs to fall below one. It is currently hovering just above one. "This is good news," Professor McCaw said.
His view was backed by epidemiologist Adrian Esterman, who said the effective replication number was 1.02 - up from 0.99 on Wednesday - meaning every 100 people infected collectively pass the virus on to roughly 102 others.
Despite the slight increase in the replication number, Professor Esterman was hopeful it was just a "bump in the road to the peak."
"I'm expecting these numbers could go up a little bit, but it's fairly clear that the peak is in sight. We might have even reached it," the former adviser to the World Health Organisation said. Asked whether another upward surge in infections could upend Victoria's plan to reopen next week, the professor of biostatistics at the University of South Australia was optimistic this would not be the case.
Melbourne University clinical epidemiologist Professor Nancy Baxter said the restrictions loosening in Victoria at 70 per cent were "pretty low risk" and the reopening could go ahead as planned.
"We could never do the loosening that they've done in NSW. That would be an unmitigated disaster," she said.
But Professor Baxter warned that any easing of restrictions would drive cases up again and the state could expect a surge in the weeks after opening up.
This is in line with modelling commissioned by the Victorian government and released alongside the state's road map to reopening, which forecast new cases would reach about 2000 a day on October 10 before plateauing, then jumping again when lockdown lifted at the end of October.
The end point of the Burnet Institute's projections is worrying, predicting a peak hospital demand of 3150 patients, ICU demand of 706 and a better than one-in-two chance of the healthcare system being overwhelmed later this year.

From slow start, Australia is now powering its way to vaccination

Full text: Victoria, NSW and Australia as a whole appear to be well on track to exceed 80 per cent vaccination rates and perhaps push towards 90, an unexpected development that will have major implications for the way the country lives with COVID-19.
The country's slow initial rollout, combined with the emergence of side-effects linked to AstraZeneca's jab, has led to months of speculation Australia might face a major vaccine hesitancy problem.
That has not come to pass. More than 80 per cent of adults have been vaccinated at least once, with Victoria reaching 84 per cent on Friday and NSW almost at 90 per cent.
The speed of the uptake has surprised everyone, and is credited as a major reason for NSW avoiding a predicted overwhelming of its hospital capacity.
"I had predicted we'd be lucky to get 60 per cent two-dose coverage for over 16s by the end of the year. That was before the Delta outbreaks took hold. I said I would be happy to be wrong: and I was so wrong," said University of Sydney leading vaccine hesitancy researcher Professor Julie Leask.
"Looking at the current trajectories, particularly in NSW and Victoria, I am increasingly confident we could reach a coverage level of 90 per cent for two doses.
"Australia is a very pro-vaccination country. You look at our support, our coverage rates for kids, and you see a lot of willingness - almost a fierceness in defending vaccination."
Doherty Institute modelling, commissioned by the national cabinet and released in July, assumed Australia would reach a vaccination rate around 90 per cent. However, the pace has substantially exceeded its projections.
The institute predicted Australia would manage a little over 1 million doses a week until mid-September, rising to 1.5 million doses in October, before peaking just below 2 million weekly doses in late October.
Instead, Australia managed to reach the 1.5 million mark in mid-August, hitting more than 2 million doses a week by late September. Some 1.8 million doses were handed out last week.
"It's the timing: greater supply and Delta coming at a similar time, flipping that balance of risk and benefit with that vaccine with the outbreaks, the changed ATAGI recommendations, the increased confidence from providers: all those things have helped us increase our rate of vaccination," said Professor Leask.
There are several causes. First, the number of people saying they are unlikely to get a jab has plunged to record lows, from 29 per cent in May to 9 per cent in September, per The Age's Resolve Political Monitor.
Second, the arrival of Delta. NSW's Delta outbreak accelerated steeply in mid-August; the average national number of weekly vaccinations jumped 21 per cent and continued to rise quickly.
Third, supply. Australia secured an extra million doses of Pfizer from Poland in mid-August, and another 4 million from the UK in September.
The unforeseen increase in pace of the rollout was credited by NSW Health with keeping the state's hospitalisation and ICU numbers much lower than predicted.
Vaccination is also slowing Victoria's outbreak - although that is being counteracted by increasing levels of population mixing.
Victoria's transmission potential has been reduced by 25 per cent by vaccination so far, said Professor James McCaw, who supplies modelling to the federal government, while NSW had been cut by 35 per cent.
"Those effects in both states will be much larger within a few weeks as second doses increase.
"The transmission potential has remained fairly steady - it just so happens that over the past few weeks the small reduction due to vaccination has balanced out by the small increase due to more mixing."
Australia has vaccinated 67 per cent of its population, including children - good for 18th in the world. Of countries with populations over 20 million, Australia ranks 13th, just behind the UK and ahead of the US.
How much does reaching 90 per cent over-12 vaccination, compared to 80 per cent, matter?
Quite a lot. It cuts hospitalisations per million people from 1162 down to 682, according to modelling by Professor George Milne of the University of WA - a 41 per cent drop. Add in social distancing measures and other restrictions, and you cut that to just 329 people.

Full text: Vaccination rates for children in NSW and Victoria have surged ahead of an easing of pandemic ­restrictions and an early return to school in the country’s largest state.
Dominic Perrottet, in one of his first major acts as NSW Premier, on Thursday unveiled an accelerated easing of restrictions that will have students back in schools by October 25, and double the number of visitors allowed in a home from Monday.
Fully vaccinated NSW residents will be able to welcome 10 visitors to their home, up from a limit of five, and socialise in groups of 30 outdoors, up from a cap of 20, from Monday, under a revised road map that Mr Perrottet ­labelled “measured and sensible”.
Mask requirements in offices will be scrapped at 80 per cent vaccination, slated for October 18, rather than 90 per cent.
The moves come as new commonwealth data obtained by The Australian shows 63 per cent of children between 12 and 15 years old in NSW have already received one dose of Covid-19 vaccine, less than a month after that age group became eligible.
In Victoria, that figure is 59 per cent, while more than 80 per cent of children in the ACT have also had their first vaccination.
Those rates are considerably higher than the national average – 49 per cent – and more than ­double those of other major states, including Queensland and Western Australia.
As NSW reached its 70 per cent double-dose target, Scott Morrison on Thursday said the rising vaccination rates demonstrated supply challenges had been ­addressed and the country was “on the home stretch”.
“I believe Australia can achieve much higher vaccination rates than the 70 and 80 per cent that we’ve set out in the national plan and that will only give us greater confidence and enable us to move even more quickly as we open the country up,” the Prime Minister said.
The Australian Technical Advisory Group on Immunisation is on Friday expected to announce that the immuno-compromised should be given a third dose of the Covid-19 vaccine, following moves in the EU that approved an extra dose 28 days after the second.
A recommendation by ATAGI on third jabs for the wider population is unlikely until next year, as health authorities monitor overseas programs, with the US, ­Britain, Israel and France among those countries already offering boosters.
ANU infectious diseases physician Peter Collignon said the “brilliant” uptake of the Covid-19 vaccine in 12-15 year olds could lead to restrictions being eased earlier than anticipated.
“The more people we vaccinate from any age group the better, because it means we will see a much lower risk of people getting the virus and passing the virus on to others,” he said.
“Basically, if people are vaccinated, it’s safer for them, safer for everyone else and means we can open up sooner.” Professor Collignon pointed to the fact that 12-15 year olds were not initially counted in the Doherty Institute modelling that would see Australia open up when 70 per cent of the population was vaccinated, with more freedoms being offered at 80 per cent. “Now that under-16s are getting vaccinated, it’s very possible we could see that road map moved forward because it means we may be able to relax things earlier.” Mr Morrison said the new road map for NSW was beginning the process of opening safely and staying safely open, calling it “the light at the end of the tunnel”.
“That’s what the national plan is about. When you hit those vaccination rates, you can open with certainty again and you can open safely with certainty again and you can stay open,” he said.
“We have passed the first major milestone for Australians getting their lives back.” Mr Morrison said residents now had the certainty to make plans and bookings for the months ahead.
“I want this to be a sign of hope to the rest of the country, partic­ularly those in Victoria, who I’m mindful of today, and here in the ACT, where the lockdowns continue.” However, the NSW moves were criticised on Thursday by the Australian Medical Association for “the potential sidelining of public health advice” after the state’s chief health officer, Kerry Chant, was notably absent from the press conference announcing the changes to the road map.
“The AMA is very concerned at the apparent shift in approach to the management of Covid-19 in NSW announced today”, AMA president Omar Khorshid said, warning the move could lead to “avoidable deaths”.
“The changes to the road map have occurred at the 11th hour without the presence of the chief health officer Dr Kerry Chant at the announcement,” he said.
The AMA supported the gradual opening up of the economy, but it was critical to observe the impact of each step on transmission and case numbers, otherwise NSW would still see hospitals become “completely overwhelmed” despite high vaccination rates, he said. “NSW must not be reckless at this critical time. That would cost more lives, cause more suffering, and put the economies of NSW and the nation at risk.” The move to bring forward face-to-face lessons for all students in NSW by October 25 comes despite estimates only 85 per cent of teachers are vaccinated, with November 8 set as the deadline.
NSW Teachers Federation president Angelo Gavrielatos said the low vaccination rate was because teachers had never been prioritised during the vaccine rollout.
“How do you intend to staff a school with all students present from October 25 when only 85 per cent of your workforce has been double-vaccinated?” he said.
However, Mr Perrottet was unapologetic: “It’s a major relief for parents and their sanity, and … I want to thank all the teachers who are there getting vaccinated to ensure we can open our schools as safely as possible.”

Full text: Yes, we have been kept safe and sound by the Gutwein state government, but Ingrid Harrison asks how much longer Tasmania’s business sector can afford to run scared of the pandemic I WAS horrified when I heard our Premier say 90 per cent vaccinations are what Tasmania will now be aiming for before and if, our borders are reopened.
Let’s be honest. The question of opening to the rest of the country, and indeed the rest of the world has become a political football. And the reason? Everyone is in fear of Covid and all politicians are playing on that fear.
Instead of praising our Premier for keeping us safe, why aren’t we up in arms protesting our hospital systems have failed — a systemic failure over decades that is now coming home to roost and a failure for which we are paying a huge cost?
We can have all the new hospital equipment and buildings under the sun, but if we don’t have sufficient frontline staff, this is the result.
Instead, we congratulate the Premier for keeping us safe. Yes, he has to a large degree. But he is doing so because of the poor state of our health system, comforted by the fact he knows the public will applaud his hardline approach.
Headlines saying 100 Tasmanians will die in the first six months if we open at 80 per cent is fear mongering at its best. He was quoting Doherty modelling based on a national outbreak infecting nearly 750,000 people within six months.
The Premier was applying the 100 deaths to Tasmania alone. It also seems to assume that the minute we hit 80 per cent everyone will stop vaccinating which is nonsense.
How about the hundreds of people who die every year from the common flu? In 2017, 1181 people died and in 2019, 902 died nationwide however no one makes any noise about these statistics. Why? Because they’re not Covid statistics.
All state premiers are at fault because each states’ hospital systems are failing not only their staff but the patients they have to treat.
Premiers are governing through the politics of pandemic fear by closing borders while holding on to their significant power base.
The Queensland premier has threatened to keep borders closed till early next year.
The Western Australian premier seems happy to keep his permanently closed. To be brutal, it seems that closing borders has become a substitute for governments providing an adequate level of healthcare for their citizens.
Meanwhile, more and more businesses are closing their doors because they cannot afford to stay open any longer.
Look at the sad reality of businesses in Melbourne — it’s distressing to see a once vibrant city falling apart.
Businesses in Tasmania, particularly in tourism and hospitality, are doing it hard and were hoping for some Christmas relief to keep their workers employed.
But it now seems that’s not likely to happen.
What about the personal toll on everyone? The mental anguish. Nobody is really addressing the mental impact on everyday people many of whom are keeping much of their mental suffering to themselves, not seeking help.
While Australia’s small businesses, employees and our students are suffering, those making the decisions to keep us apart, the politicians and the health bureaucrats, are all comfortably collecting their taxpayer-funded salaries.
I am double vaxed. Our children interstate and overseas are double vaxed and we’re all prepared to have Covid tests. So, when we get to 80 per cent vaccinations why can’t we see each other? Because now the goalpost has been moved to 90 per cent and we’re not being given a re-opening date.
Do you really think it’s going to happen before Christmas?
Is this the new reality or just part of the softening up process for no re-opening while Covid exists?
Minister Barnett recently let slip he wanted to see 100 per cent vaccinations. Is what he said the next goal?
This is a nightmare, and we are being spun a massive line because regularly the goal posts are being moved and the messages become more dire. And many Tasmanians are accepting these messages simply because they’re scared.
Wake up, people and demand the truth. Is this the life you want to live? I sure don’t.

Second doses critical

Full text: VICTORIA is at the tipping point with the latest spike in Covid cases, with epidemiologists warning numbers could “spiral” in the coming weeks if second Pfizer doses are not ramped up in hotspot areas.
Concern is rising at the growing transmission rate, with 1438 new cases and five deaths reported on Thursday.
Within days, 50 per cent of eligible Victorians will be fully vaccinated. Data analyst and creator of covid19data.com.au Juliette O’Brien said second doses were the key to driving down Victoria’s spiking Reff number of 1.3.
That means 10 people with the virus will spread it to 13 others, on current data.
Ms O’Brien said if nothing changed, Victoria faced an average of more than 2000 daily cases in about three weeks.
She said vaccination efforts in hotspots needed to ramp up as the state neared the 50 per cent mark, just as NSW did when its daily total of new cases peaked at 1603 on September 11.
NSW got to 50 per cent fully vaccinated on September 16 when 1351 new Covid cases were recorded, and since then it has seen a steady decline in case numbers.
“The problem for Victoria right now is exactly what NSW was facing a couple of months ago,” Ms O’Brien said.
“The impact of vaccines in NSW is unmistakeable. NSW flooded the LGAs of concern with Pfizer and now, four to six weeks later, cases in those areas are plummeting.
“We know the second dose gives greater protection, so anything that gives more protection will help drive down cases,” she said.
Melbourne University’s head of school of population and global health, Professor Nancy Baxter, said the coming days would be “critical” in ­determining the true impact of Thursday’s jump.
“We’re going to see exactly how bad a situation we’re in,” Professor Baxter said.
“It’s hard to know what’s going to happen based on this 500 (case increase) blip.
“The next week will tell us whether cases keep spiralling because of breaches over the long weekend.” Professor Baxter warned Victoria could surpass predictions made by Burnet modelling – which estimated a peak of ­between 1400 and 2900 cases per day by mid October – if more clusters emerged that could be traced back to grand final weekend.
“Those parties will have spread out throughout Melbourne and result in a rapid increase in cases that will lead us to be worse off,” she said.
“What happens over the next few days is going to be really critical in terms of deciding if we’re going to stay more at the mid-range, around 2000 cases, because we’re not going to stay at 1400 anymore.” Victoria’s Covid commander Jeroen Weimar revealed six out of 10 cases on Thursday were found in new households. The location of cases also spread further than usual, with 29 per cent of the new cases in the east and south­ east. “We have a far greater scattering,” he said. “Suddenly the map has bloomed.” He urged anyone who attended an illegal social gathering over the weekend to get tested regardless of symptoms.
“You don’t know whether somebody there was harbouring the virus,” he said. olivia.jenkins@news.com.au

A reality check some needed

Full text: Editorial
Premier Peter Gutwein's press conference on Thursday would have provided many Tasmanians with a reality check.
The pathway out of COVID, particularly in the first few months after opening borders this Christmas, is not going to be an easy one. The Delta variant will be in our community and people will die.
There is apprehension in many parts of the community about this fact - health care workers, people with disability and those with compromised immune systems.
That is why the state government is working hard to fully vaccinate 90 per cent of Tasmanians over 16 years by December 1, and before opening up to COVID-riddled states such as NSW and Victoria.
Fifty-eight per cent of eligible Tasmanians are now fully vaccinated and everyone will and is being given the chance to get jabbed.
The state government is preparing us for the next phase of COVID life and several months after opening up will be the most difficult. There is no shying away from it.
We must accept what could and will happen, but also do everything we can to ensure we slow the spread of COVID when it arrives. Getting vaccinated will ensure less people die. Following public health restrictions for what a COVID life will look like will be essential.
If we need to wear masks as part of everyday life, wear one. If we can only attend events or go out for tea when we're fully vaxxed then so be it.
Conditions on travellers leaving and entering the state are yet to be released, but it won't come as a shock if people must be inoculated and provide a negative result before they catch a flight.
More detail will come when the state government's commissioned Tasmania-specific modelling is released in mid-October.
But if the Doherty Institute's predictions of 14,900 cases, up to 590 hospital admissions, 97 intensive care admissions and almost 100 deaths in the first six months isn't enough to convince you to listen to public health messaging, then what is?
Tasmanians have been lucky, but a time is coming where we must learn to live with COVID in our community.

Full text: When will Victoria’s case numbers peak?
Leading epidemiologists believe Victoria could hit 2000 reported cases per day by mid-October before numbers plateau or drop. Deakin University epidemiology chairwoman Professor Catherine Bennett estimated a higher spike and said the state could reach 3000 cases per day in four weeks’ time.
What do the numbers tell us about outbreaks in Victoria v NSW? Victoria’s reff number, the figure that indicates how many people are being infected by each positive case on average, has dropped steadily over the past week and sits at 1.25.
Experts warn cases may rise following recent protests across Melbourne. Former World Health Organisation epidemiologist Professor Adrian Esterman said it was still difficult to predict whether Victoria’s cases would peak and fall in the same way as NSW.
Prof Bennett said cases were still trending downwards overall.
What will happen with hospitals and ICU?
Experts say Victorians’ chances of being admitted to hospital are smaller than in the second wave when four out of every 100 with Covid were in intensive care. Professor Peter Collignon said Victoria should follow NSW, with case numbers increasing without a large spike in those in hospital or on ventilators. Prof Bennett said Victoria in relative terms had more people in intensive care but people were less likely to be hospitalised than in NSW.
How is Victoria performing against the state’s modelling?
Prof Collignon said the prediction of Victoria reaching between 1400-2900 cases between October 19-31 was “a bit too pessimistic” because it did not account for improved vaccination across hot spots and warmer weather. But Prof Esterman said the Burnet modelling provided a “clear warning” about not easing restrictions too soon.
Why did NSW cases start to fall and stabilise?
Cases began to drop in NSW nearly three weeks ago when about 42 per cent of the state’s eligible adult population had received both doses of a vaccine. Prof Bennet said Victoria was on track for a similar drop in cases but NSW had turned the corner sooner as they began targeting hot spots with vaccination efforts earlier. Prof Collignon said Victoria was already seeing vaccines drive down case numbers.

Borders ‘stay shut until curbs lifted’

Full text: Annastacia Palaszczuk will keep Queensland’s border closed to NSW and Victoria until authorities in those states lift most of their Covid-19 health restrictions.
Christmas reunion plans were plunged into doubt last week when the Queensland Premier said lifting border restrictions even when 80 per cent of Australians were fully vaccinated would be a “backward” step.
State and territory leaders have already abandoned a national cabinet agreement made in July to exempt fully vaccinated Australians “from all domestic restrictions” once 80 per cent of the population older than 16 was double-dosed.
Senior Palaszczuk government officials have toldThe Australian the border would stay shut until interstate health officials decided it was safe to mirror Queensland’s relative freedoms. There was “no way” Ms Palaszczuk would reopen to states that were still subjected to tough restrictions, one said.
“Why would we reopen to states that still plan on having pretty strict restrictions even once they reach 80 per cent?” they said. “Obviously their chief health officers do not think it is safe for a lot of people to gather even at that higher vaccination rate.” Under NSW and Victoria’s road maps, 10 people will be ­allowed in private homes once 80 per cent of the eligible population is double-dosed.
In Queensland, where only 45 per cent of the eligible population is vaccinated, 100 people can congregate in homes, masks are not required outdoors, dancing is allowed in nightclubs and venues can operate at one person per 2sq m.
NSW looks to hit 90 per cent fully vaccinated by December 1, which is when nightclubs will reopen and limits on private gatherings will be scrapped.
Ms Palaszczuk said Queenslanders were “enjoying doing normal things” and the pressure on businesses was caused by lockdowns in NSW and Victoria.
She has repeatedly refused to reveal whether she would alter restrictions once her state reached the 80 per cent inoculation target, insisting she needed to look at updated Doherty Institute modelling. “Hopefully we’ll get that on Friday at national cabinet and the Prime Minister will release all of that publicly so everyone can see it,” Ms Palaszczuk said.
Interim modelling to be released on Friday will discuss reopening the international border and how easing domestic restrictions would affect groups such as Indigenous Australians and school students.
Queensland’s chief health officer, Jeannette Young, told tourism operators on Monday to prepare for borders to be opened by Christmas, but she said deciding when to do so was “not a straightforward process”. “You can’t just pick something and say it leads to something else, you’ve got to look at all of the ­issues,” she said. “The more people who are vaccinated, the more likely we can remove those last ­restrictions.” In addition to vaccine rates, Dr Young would also consider deaths, hospitalisations, the number of people in ICU and what restrictions were imposed by other chief health officers.
Deputy Premier Steven Miles said most Queenslanders were happy with current restrictions when they considered “the risk of having to go back to that kind of lockdown compared with the fantastic lifestyle we are experiencing here”.
“No one has ever suggested that the border should be closed at Christmas, but what we have said is that it should be opened at the right time and that we don’t yet have the information that tells us what that right time is,“ he said.
“Christmas is still 90 days away, a lot can change in that ­period of time.”

Model to change isolation approach

Full text: ISOLATION requirements would be relaxed for those who have visited a coronavirus exposure site but are fully vaccinated under a plan being considered by federal authorities.
The Doherty Institute, which is modelling the impact of new containment models, has backed the shift and told the national cabinet to move away from the existing “zero tolerance” tracing approach.
Experts say this is crucial to avoid the chaos seen in the UK, when an estimated 1.7 million people – in a country of 67 million – were forced to isolate after they were caught at exposure sites when restrictions were eased.
The UK’s so-called “pingdemic”, fuelled by its Bluetooth tracing app, caused widespread workforce shortages before the government scrapped the isolation rule for those who were fully vaccinated and instead encouraged them to be tested.
In its latest report to the national cabinet, the Doherty Institute said tracing and isolation measures would shift to target “transmission reduction allowing a lesser focus on casual and place-based contact tracing outside high-risk settings”.
Institute epidemiology director Professor Jodie McVernon said that once vaccination thresholds were met, it was time to scale back “low yield” tracing measures designed to find every last case, and instead implement “more efficient and sustainable processes”.
Deakin University epidemiology chair Professor Catherine Bennett said authorities “don’t have to find every case in the future” and needed to prioritise tracing in high-risk settings.
She said secondary contacts at everyday exposure sites could be asked to get a test instead of isolating for 14 days.
“You bring in the net,” Professor Bennett said. “We don’t want people who are sick going to work, and we might still be screening at big events, but it’s more about managing the risk.”

Scott Morrison throws down gauntlet to rebel premiers

Full text: Mr Morrison said he couldn’t see any reason why people should be kept apart by state borders after the 80 per cent national vaccination target was reached.
“It’s important that we do move forward. We can’t stay in second gear. We’ve got to get to top gear in living with the virus … that’s where we need to be,” he told Weekend Sunrise on Sunday.
“My message is to Australians that what I‘d like them to have for Christmas is their lives back.”
Mr Morrison slammed Queensland premier Annastacia Palaszczuk and WA’s Mark McGowan for their unwillingness to commit to granting Australians that same wish.
“There comes a time when you’ve got to honour the arrangement you’ve made with the Australian people, and that is when you get to 80 per cent vaccination, it’s very clear that you can start opening up,” the PM said.
“I think that puts the big challenge on the premiers. I mean, they've had the power to do what they’ve been doing. They’re not new powers. They’ve always had them.
“But, you know, there comes a time when you just got to move on and get on with it.”
Miles slams PM
Queensland Deputy Premier Steven Miles rejected Mr Morrison’s latest call for holdout states to open up on hitting 80 per cent full vaccination for Covid.
Renewing his feud with the Prime Minister, who from the US urged the states to “get on with it”, Mr Miles said the 80 per cent double-jab benchmark was only one of a number of considerations for reopening Queensland’s closed border with NSW and Victoria.
“I find it pretty incredible. I mean this bloke is the master of distraction isn’t he?” he told reporters in Brisbane on Sunday.
“Nine people died in NSW from this virus today. You’ve got diplomatic incidents with Paris. He broke up with France by text message.
“You’ve got him being rebuked by the European Union. You’ve got a trade dispute provoked with China.
“So all of that and he’s managing to distract the national debate by some discussion about what’s going to happen in Queensland in three months’ time.
“Frankly, I think the primer minister should be more focused on the health of people in NSW and Victoria and national affairs than what might happen in Queensland in 90 days time.”
Queensland Deputy Premier Steven Miles slams the 'parallel debate' about reopening the nation, saying the current plans are 'misleading' and not relevant to Covid-free Queensland.
Queensland and Western Australia have refused to commit to Mr Morrison’s roadmap out of the pandemic, underpinned by modelling from the Doherty Institute, to ease most restrictions from 70 per cent full vaccination and return to near-normal living once the 80 per cent target was achieved.
Asked what it would take for the Queensland border to reopen, Mr Miles said today: “What we’ve said is that it will depend on what the situation is here and what the situation is there (in NSW and Victoria) in terms of the number cases, number of hospitalisations, number of people in ICU and number of people vaccinated.
“So there is more than one variable. I know that the Prime Minister, with his constant attempts to distract from his own failings, wants to boil this down to a single number.
“But it is not that simple and it is misleading people to tell them that it should be that simple.”
The Queensland and WA premiers have held firm in their resistance of the national plan.
Ms Palaszczuk has demanded more research into the effects of Covid-19 on children before she says her state will embrace the reopening targets agreed on at national cabinet.
Mr McGowan has shown similar defiance, insisting WA is unlikely to reopen its borders until 2022.
But Mr Morrison slapped down both premiers’ claims, insisting the entire country should reopen at the 80 per cent vaccination target, which is expected to be reached before the end of the year.
“Once you get to 80 per cent of your population that’s vaccinated, it’s very clear. I can’t see any reason why Australians should be kept from each other,” he said.
“(Reopening by Christmas) is within the gift of governments. And that’s a gift I’d like to see us give them.”
The PM also made it clear that the country would not wait for vaccine-hesitant Aussies to make up their minds, insisting the national plan will go ahead as planned whether people decide to get their jab or not.
“Once we get to 80 per cent – the fact is that everybody has had the chance to get vaccinated by that point,” he said.
“If you've chosen not to get vaccinated, that’s your choice … but we must go into the next chapter.”
Andrews hopeful borders can reopen
Victorian Premier Daniel Andrews said, “I certainly hope so”, when asked whether he backed the PM’s expectation that borders between states would reopen once the 80 per cent full vaccination target is reached.
“But again, with the greatest of respect to the PM, that’s not his call. That’s a call for chief health officers, and for premiers,” Mr Andrews said.
“And the national plan, which we are faithfully delivering, doesn’t really go to these issues. No-one is locked into having borders open.
“I want them to be open. I want people to be able to travel across their state, interstate, travel overseas if they think that’s something that they want to do.
“But, again, I can’t predict that. We have to wait and see how things go and how many cases there are. Just like I don’t think the Prime Minister would necessarily be able to give you a definitive list of all the countries that are going to be able to be in travel bubbles with us right now, we’ll have to wait and see.”

Full text: EXCLUSIVE PLANS to turn “Jeff’s Shed” into a makeshift hospital have been dusted off as Victoria’s Covid case numbers continue to surge.
Amid the state’s highest daily case number, the Sunday Herald Sun can reveal high-level briefings have again discussed the option of converting the Melbourne Convention and Exhibition Centre into a hospital.
Multiple sources familiar with the arrangements have confirmed the idea has been canvassed for the first time since it was raised as an option at the start of the pandemic.
The contingency plan was considered as early as March 2020 but was shelved after Victoria drove cases to zero.
But with case numbers continuing to rise, and a higher proportion of patients needing intensive care than last year, some senior officials have questioned the capacity of the hospital system.
“The plan is on reserve. Case numbers are not going in the right direction, and very ­serious consideration is being given to the contingencies in place,” one senior government source said.
“The site is perfect for a temporary hospital, but we’re really hoping it’s not needed.” The source said a significant complication to using the site would be losing one of the state’s two largest vaccine hubs currently operating from the centre.
The Department of Health has flagged it will need ­additional beds in coming weeks, and on current pro­jections say the hospitals currently treating Covid patients may not be sufficient.
Health Minister Martin Foley has also flagged suspending some elective surgery as needed.
According to one senior government figure, a “field hospital” scenario is not yet projected to be required.
However, such a proposal would become a live option if there was a surge in demand for intensive care beds.
Cities including London and New York have each introduced field hospitals at various times throughout the pandemic.
Modelling by the Burnet ­Institute, commissioned by the state government, has forecast up to 120,000 diagnosed cases after the easing of restrictions.
Health sources said such a scenario would put unprecedented pressure on the state’s hospital system.
One senior source said authorities were actively preparing for a “NSW-level ­impact to hospitals” with consideration given to pulling nurses off the vaccine front line if needed.
Such a move risked slowing the state’s vaccination rollout with the potential to further delay meeting recovery road map targets.
A surge workforce of 2200 oral and allied health professionals and students is currently being trained to replace nurses on the jab frontline.
But only 300 newly trained vaccinators have completed the training since the initiative was announced three weeks ago.
Others have been employed directly by vaccination sites via health services and community health partners.
In April last year the government promised a $1.3bn ­injection to quickly establish an extra 4000 ICU beds in ­response to the pandemic.
By August 1556 critical care spaces had been prepared across public and private hospitals with another 2700 to be made available if required.
Mr Foley said he was confident the system could keep pace but would not say how long it would take to scale up to 4000 ICU beds if such a scenario were necessary.
On Saturday he said once case numbers surge further there would be changes to the way hospitals were managed.
The first stage is to ensure specialist centres are prepared to manage vulnerable groups such as pregnant women and the elderly.
The next step would be to pause non-urgent elective surgery, with hospitals to determine which areas went on hold to put “as many resources as are needed into the healthcare of Covid patients” and for the private system to take up some urgent surgery.
“We know that we can do that, but it will be at the ­expense of other arrangements in the health system and it will be at the expense of our ­already fatigued health professionals who will be working even harder,” Mr Foley said.
Opposition leader Matthew Guy called for greater transparency around the hospital system’s capacity to cope.
“I’m really concerned about the loss of elective surgery,” Mr Guy said. “We need to know where are the hospital beds that were promised by the government in April last year, every Victorian deserves to know.” shannon.deery@news.com.au

Full text: Following comments yesterday from Premier Annastacia Palaszczuk Queensland borders could remain shut for Christmas, Miles said there is a “bizarre parallel debate happening” at a state and national level.”
What should Queensland's next move in its Covid response be?
“I hope by Christmas we’ve reached those vaccination targets and it’s safe to have less restrictions but we should still expect some restrictions to be in place in New South Wales and Victoria,” Mr Miles said.
“They are taking the debate into Queensland where all of the restrictions are already lifted and the only real remaining restriction is the one at the border.”
He took particular aim at Prime Minister Scott Morrison at a press conference outside Suncorp Stadium on Friday morning.
“I have spent a lot of time around Queensland, talking to Queenslanders and what they tell me is Delta is the gift Queensland does not want from Scott Morrison.”
“He gave Delta to Sydney and now they are trying to re gift it to us, well we don’t want that, we want to stay open like we are now and we’ll continue to make our decisions on that basis”
Miles said it was “misleading” to expect for the whole thing to be over when we hit 80 per cent.
“Some, particularly in the Federal Government, are trying to portray it that way if you look at the road map in Victoria, that foresees at 80 per cent people can have larger gatherings in their homes.”
“(That is) much more honest than, for example, a Tourism Minister going out and saying international borders will be open by then, I don’t think Queenslanders want our international borders open if it is not safe to do so.”
Miles said when it comes to opening the border it will depend on the number of cases and vaccination rates in Queensland and New South Wales.
He said the Queensland Government is yet to see the revised version of the Doherty modelling.
“That modelling will tell us what the risks to us are at 70 and 80 per cent, at 70 and 80 per cent you still have large numbers of people who are unvaccinated.”
“From there the CHO an provide advice to us what appropriate restrictions are.”
It comes as the state recorded no new cases and some mask restrictions were relaxed.

Full text: Queensland Premier Annastacia Palaszczuk has thrown holiday travel plans into doubt, saying lifting border restrictions even after vaccine coverage reaches 80 per cent would be a “backward” step.
Ms Palaszczuk did not say what level of Covid-19 vaccination would be needed to safely reopen to NSW and Victoria, adding a national reopening plan had “not been finalised”.
“If you look at the national plan, the 80 per cent actually takes you backwards and I do not want that for Queensland, so we’re probably going to see a difference for Western Australia and Queensland because at the moment we have freedoms,” she said on Thursday.
Her comments came as NSW recorded 1063 new infections – and six deaths – while Victoria had 766 cases. There are fears that the virus could spread more widely in Melbourne after a man who attended a protest at the Shrine of Remembrance on Wednesday tested positive and was taken to hospital.
The Victorian government began easing restrictions on vaccinated residents stuck in Canberra and NSW, and will allow them to return home provided they have tested negative.
Queensland industry groups and tourism operators reliant on interstate travel criticised Ms Palaszczuk’s comments, and said they needed clarity to prepare for the coming summer holiday season. Ms Palaszczuk, asked about lifting health restrictions, said she would need to see additional health modelling.
“At the moment, Queenslanders have more freedoms now than Victorians will when they reach 80 per cent vaccinated,” she said. “In NSW, you have a massive Delta outbreak, so you have to go and ask the NSW government what is their plan for Christmas?” State and territory leaders in July agreed to a pathway to freedom based on vaccination rate thresholds recommended by the Doherty Institute. Under the plan, fully vaccinated Australians would be exempt from “all domestic restrictions” once 80 per cent of the population older than 16 was vaccinated.
But on Thursday, Ms Palaszczuk said Queenslanders would enjoy more freedoms at home than “if they hopped on a plane and went to Tokyo”.
“Where are you going to go? Are you going to go to India? In Tokyo, you have to sit in perspex screens with masks on and if you remove your mask you can’t talk while you’re eating,” she said.
Queensland Tourism Industry Council chief executive Daniel Gschwind said the state needed “a path to re-engage with the rest of Australia and the rest of the world”. “We know Queenslanders are very protective of the excellent health situation here and nobody wants to put that at risk,” he said.
“But at some point we have to make a leap of faith and trust in the vaccine protecting us alongside other health measures – tracing, testing social distancing.” Cairns Adventure Group owner Roderic Rees said 90 per cent of his customers were locked out of the state. “We had 75 on the payroll in June and last week we paid 23 people,” he said.
Mr Rees supported limiting freedoms for unvaccinated people if it meant borders could reopen to those who had been fully vaccinated against Covid-19.
“National cabinet has set that 80 per cent vaccination target and Queensland should stick to their guns on that and let people know what is going to change when we get there,” he said.
“We need to have the borders open and people travelling before Christmas – that needs to happen.” The latest vaccination figures show 74.1 per cent of adults have had at least one dose, while 49.3 per cent are fully vaccinated.
NSW will reach 80 per cent coverage for adults in mid-October, with Victoria following in November. Queensland is expected to reach that vaccine coverage level in December.
When asked whether she could give regional businesses more clarity after national cabinet meets next week, Ms Palaszczuk said: “If we get a Delta outbreak here, we’ll be in lockdown and all businesses will be closed. Do you want that?
“I don’t understand this constant criticism of Queensland doing well.” LNP MP Amanda Camm, whose northern Queensland electorate covers the Whitsunday Islands popular with tourists, said operators feared the state would remain closed while international travel restarted for other states.
“The goalposts keep moving,” she said. “People want to see their family on the other side of the country at Christmas. We need a clear plan with clear targets so people are incentivised to go out and get vaccinated.” In a push to increase the state’s lagging vaccination rollout, the state government teamed up with the NRL to offer free tickets to people receiving vaccinations.
It was scrapped hours after its launch when the Therapeutic Goods Administration deemed it non-compliant with its rules.
Health Minister Yvette D’Ath said the decision was “bureaucracy gone mad”, although she admitted to not having read the rules on offering incentives.
“Are we supposed to be vaccinating people against Covid in this country or not,” she said.
PALASZCZUK ON ...

So I don’t want that for Queensland FREEDOMS At the moment, Queenslanders have more freedoms now than Victorians will when they reach 80 per cent vaccinated REOPENING FOR CHRISTMAS In NSW, you have a massive Delta outbreak, so you have to go and ask the NSW government what is their plan for Christmas?

Andrews' Victorian road map has stark choices

Full text: For me, it was almost a year to the day when the dam burst. I was watching the Melbourne Symphony Orchestra's virtual performance of Paul Kelly's Leaps and Bounds, a shout-out to a city that had been in hard lockdown since early August.
My computer screen was a mosaic of musicians and vocalists blended with footage of a deserted Bourke Street mall and empty Sidney Myer Music Bowl.
"I'm high on the hill, Looking over the bridge, To the MCG," the choir sang celestially, alongside an aerial shot of the abandoned sacred ground at dawn.
And that was it. The repressed grief of the previous six months, the shock of all my certainties - including the mundane certainty of an AFL grand final at the MCG - upended by a once-in-a-hundred-year event, finally found expression.
"I remember ..." came the chorus, and on cue I started sobbing. Hard.
Feeling all the aforementioned emotions as well as hope - the latter being what? Inherent in the human condition? The mystical footprint religion leaves on the soul of even the most fervent unbeliever?
I wasn't alone in believing 2021 would bring vaccines and salvation. And as we smothered the virus back to zero, we felt almost saintly. Had an emissary from a year into the future told me that vaccines would indeed arrive but so would an infectious new strain and that this time our emancipation would likely come at a deadly cost, I might have dismissed the missive as fake news.
But here we are. The weekend's grand final once again on foreign interstate ground and in what seems nothing less than a cosmic insult, once again featuring two Victorian teams.
And the epidemiologists and medical experts are begging us for one final sprint, begging us to dig deep into our reserves and wear masks, get tested, stay at home, hang back, for the next few months until 80 per cent of adults are double-jabbed, and then ...?
And then I'm not sure, really.
Will the roses at Flemington still smell as sweet when Cup Day might see the already stretched staff at hospital ICUs bracing for a fresh influx of patients? Will we really be up for expansive Christmas gatherings if the more pessimistic of the Burnet Institute models seems to be panning out with COVID deaths on track to peak at more than 2000 in January?
According to the modelling, even if the present lockdown was to remain past the 80 per cent vaccination threshold, hospitals would still have a one-in-four chance of being overwhelmed.
So, the trade-off we're being offered is a fraught, guilt-inducing calculation in which the promise of more life is shadowed by the prospect of more death.
For now, most COVID deaths in Victoria and NSW involve the unvaxxed - a group that will be whittled down to the intentionally unvaxxed as the criminally glacial vaccine rollout gathers pace.
Alas, there's no helping some people; the inoculated sensible cannot be made hostage to the unprotected stupid. But as the evidence from places such as the UK and Israel shows, vaccines, while stunningly effective, cannot protect every vulnerable person. COVID's victims will include the blameless. "We have got to open the place up because remaining closed forever has its own cost," was Daniel Andrews' new mantra when he unveiled the road map on Sunday. The day before his "long- awaited" announcement, I was a mess of anticipation, resentment and dread.
As far as I was concerned the Dan v Gladys show, in which Melbourne's Twitterati propagandise the Andrews government's moral superiority for going hard, and going all the time, jumped the shark some time ago.
The NSW Premier had been unforgivably sluggish on lockdowns, sure, but at least she now had a plan for opening up, she was pressing hard on the accelerator. We, on the other hand, were stalling in neutral, our battery close to flat.
Down the phone, a friend delivered a rant that echoed my own embittered internal monologue. "Dan better tell us our kids are going back to school, or else ..." she said, minus a stream of expletives. Our kids are indeed going back to school, not as fast as I'd wished but fast enough for me to lay down my arms.
It is funny, though. Once the full meaning of Dan's "long-awaited" paradigm shift began to dawn on me, I found myself unsettled by his pivot to "this'll be tough but make no mistake we're opening up".
It is absolutely the case that remaining closed forever has its own, unacceptably high, cost. As a community, we should not be called upon to make sacrifices greater than those baked into the road map, which already allows for tighter restrictions should hospitals become overwhelmed.
As individuals, though, we are custodians of the city's contrarian superego. Melbourne is home to overlapping tribes, including COVID deniers, "professional protesters" and construction workers, invariably revolting.
But - admit it - for a big chunk of us the fact we're on track to be the longest locked-down city in the world is a source of perverse pride.
I'd wager that well into next year restraint will be the new black in one last push to keep infections down as vaccination coverage inches towards universal. The weather is usually rubbish anyway. I reckon I'm getting a second wind in this martyrdom caper.

Full text: Leadership demands action THE Andrews government needs to get into lock-step with NSW and keep pace on reopening or risk rendering the national road map meaningless.
Unless the county’s two biggest states — in population and economic importance — are moving forward on the same page the entire nation will be held back.
Yet Premier Daniel Andrews has admitted the pace and nature of his reopening decisions in coming weeks and months will be influenced — not just by the Burnet Institute modelling — but by what happens in NSW as the Berejiklian government relaxes restrictions much more quickly.
By treating NSW’s reopening like some sort of canary in the coal mine, stripping the Victorian economy of almost a billion dollars in additional lost output a week and condemning citizens to prolonged lockdown, Mr Andrews is displaying the antithesis of leadership.
To add insult to that absence of leadership, the Premier has the temerity to claim why not, after all, NSW had learnt valuable lessons from Victoria in the dousing of the second wave of Covid in 2020.
Neither NSW or any other jurisdiction learnt anything from that calamity because Mr Andrews led the only government in the nation to catastrophically mishandle hotel quarantine.
While accepting the vaccination rates in Victoria must increase to close the gap with greater Sydney, the Premier has to get even more vaccines from federal stockpiles and ensure he works with the Morrison government to much more significantly increase GP and pharmacy distribution points.
Family GPs and local pharmacies have been the engine rooms for accelerated vaccine uptake in NSW.
Even the heavy promotion of walk-in days for mass jabs, hugely successful in Brisbane at the weekend, should be adopted here.
Yet, other than generalised calls for Victorians to come forward for their first doses there remains a distinct lack of urgency in some areas, particularly where Covid is running rife, to get enough people rolling up their sleeves more quickly.
Covid-19 commander Jeroen Weimar yesterday said 85 per cent of the state’s active cases were in Melbourne’s northern and western suburbs. While there has been some strong increases in vaccinations, the hotspot suburbs continue to lag and have not hit the same marks achieved in west and southwestern Sydney epicentres. In Hume, a municipality that includes Broadmeadows, Tullamarine and Gladstone Park. first-dose rates have increased strongly towards 70 per cent but it remains below 60 in parts of the north east, west and southeast suburbs.
And it’s not just younger people in mobile or essential workforces or those facing language barriers but, as Pharmacy Guild Victoria president Anthony Tassone said, too many people aged over 60 who are continuing to waiver with vaccine shopping, including now asking for the newly arrived Moderna vaccine.
From this week, the mRNA Moderna vaccine will become available through 440 Victorian pharmacies for people aged 12 to 59. More than 300,000 Moderna doses will be available in Victoria during September, with stocks further increased in October and November.
The extra shots in arms cannot come quick enough but it is essential people get the vaccine that is available now. Unless there is individual health advice from doctors to the contrary, all Victorians aged over 60 still not yet vaccinated should get the safe and highly effective AstraZeneca vaccine.
And instead of seeking any political cover based on the reopening outcomes in NSW, Mr Andrews should give Victorians the leadership and action they deserve.
Democracies aligned JUST days after announcing the most significant security partnership in a generation, Prime Minister Scott Morrison is this week furthering that agreement and a wider co-operative pact.
While much of the international focus has been on Middle East security concerns in past decades, the Indo-Pacific has faced seismic changes and new challenges as China increasingly seeks to exert presence and influence.
The AUKUS alliance announced last week, centred on a first-plank agreement for Australia to build nuclear-powered subs, will become even more important for regional stability as it draws in greater military interoperability with the US and UK.
Mr Morrison’s US visit this week, the first since President Joe Biden took office, will include significant talks between “Quad” members — Japan, India, Australia and the US. President Biden will host Mr Morrison, Indian PM Narendra Modi and Japanese PM Yoshihide Suga at the White House on September 24. The Quadrilateral Security Dialogue, while not a formal security alliance, is based not just on maritime co-operation but also on regional health and economic issues. As we enter a more unpredictable post-Covid era, together with Beijing’s increasing aggression, the growing readiness for democratic nations to stand together is welcomed.

Full text: The major changes to COVID-19 restrictions are not expected to take place until the end of October.
Premier Daniel Andrews released his road map on Sunday, saying the results would be disastrous if the state opens up too quickly.
"The last 20 months have been all about buying time to get everyone vaccinated," Mr Andrews said.
"If we open up everything now with just 45 per cent we would have many many thousands of people in intensive care."
Mr Andrews warned there were tough times to come, with Burnet modelling revealing some "sobering" predictions.
He said the modelling suggested case numbers would peak at 4500 in December, hospital admissions would reach more than 3000 in January with deaths reaching 2200 at the same time.
There will be only minor changes for regional Victoria under the first phase of the roadmap, when 80 per cent of people 16 and over have had at least one vaccine dose.
The state government said it would have more details by the end of September about a return to face-to-face learning for regional students who were not already back in the classroom.
When the state reaches Phase B of the roadmap - 70 per cent of people fully vaccinated, which is expected on about October 26 - new vaccination status rules will kick in. Anyone wanting to access services like hospitality, beauty, or organised physical recreation like personal training will have to be fully vaccinated.
At this point hospitality caps will increase to 30 people indoors and 100 people outside. Outdoor social gatherings will double to 20 and gym capacity will triple to 30 people.
When 80 per cent of Victorians are fully vaccinated, people will be allowed to welcome 10 people to their homes and up to 150 vaccinated people will be allowed to dine indoors. At this point masks will only be required indoors.

Queensland might not reopen to Australia until it reaches 90 per cent vaccination rate

Full text: Despite NSW and Victoria outlining a road map to opening up based on an 80 per cent double vaccination rate, Queensland is yet to commit to any blueprint going forward.
The state’s population is on track to hit the 80 per cent double jab mark no later than December 5, giving hope for a more normal Christmas period.
But now some Labor insiders are claiming that a 90 per cent threshold is being weighed up.
Chief health officer Dr Jeannette Young last week publicly said that she would like to see 90 per cent of Queenslanders vaccinated.
Tasmania’s director of public health has publicly indicated he would like a 90 per cent vaccination rate in his state before its borders were fully opened the rest of the country.
Premier Annastacia Palaszczuk said it was too early to speculate on the 90 per cent target.
“We are waiting on updates – Doherty institute modelling – in two weeks before we can make those decisions,” she said
As well as Dr Young’s caution, politics is driving a shift in thinking to a higher threshold – with Labor polling finding Queenslanders do not want the borders if it means a mass Delta variant outbreak, like has happened in NSW and Victoria.
NED-4476-Covid-19-Vaccine-Rates-Brisbane
The polling makes two key findings. The first is that Queenslanders are angry at the so-called exemptions unit, which is regarded as “heartless’’, for refusing to allow Queenslanders back into the Sunshine State, but it gives special treatment to the wives and girlfriends of footballers.
The key finding, however, is that Queenslanders love their liberty and freedoms, and the fact that coronavirus is under control and that is a key driver in the Palaszczuk Government’s thinking.
Tourism industry leaders are incensed at the prospect of Queensland being closed for the Christmas-New Year holidays.

Full text: Burnet Institute modelling underpinning the Andrews government’s road map for reopening Victoria predicts between 1455 and 3152 people will have died from Covid in the state between July 1 and December 31.
Funded by the state Health Department, institute authors Romesh Abeysuriya, Dominic Delport, Rachel Sacks-Davis, Margaret Hellard and Nick Scott considered four possible scenarios to estimate the number of infections, hospitalisations and ICU admissions.
These included a maintained lockdown, included as a counterfactual scenario to set baseline estimates from which restrictions are eased, and the road map as announced by the Andrews government on Sunday, which sees school and childcare gradually return throughout October, increased outdoor activities at 70 per cent full vaccination, and mandatory vaccination of authorised workers, teachers, childcare workers, parents of children in childcare, hospitality workers and hospitality patrons.
The two other scenarios considered included the road map with the added assumption vaccinated people continue to seek symptomatic testing at the same rate as non-vaccinated people and the road map with a 15 per cent reduction in non-household transmission.
Under the road map scenario cases are expected to peak at a median of 4543 a day (in a range of 2778 to 6761 cases) on a median date of December 15 (and between December 7 and December 22).
This would see demand for hospital beds peak at a median of 3150 (with a range of 1950 to 4400), and demand for ICU beds peak at a median 706 (with a range of 462 to 953). The median estimate for deaths between July 1 and December 31 — including 11 that have already occurred — is 2202, with a range of 1455 to 3152.
The Institute said the key question it set out to answer was: “As vaccine coverage increases, how best can restrictions be eased that prevent the health system capacity from being exceeded?” Its “Covasim” simulation model for the easing of restrictions over the October-December period takes in data on demographics, contact networks, workforce composition, contact tracing systems, and age-specific vaccination rates.
“As well as options for easing of restrictions, additional policies around vaccine allocation and testing were examined to determine potential approaches to further reduce the epidemic peak,” the modelling states.
The Burnett modellers argue even without any easing of restrictions, there is a “moderate risk” of exceeding health system capacity.
“Based on the current epidemic growth rate, a peak in seven-day average daily diagnoses of 1400-2900 is estimated to occur between 19-31 October,” the report states. “Corresponding peaks in hospital and ICU demand were 1200-2500 and 260-550 respectively, with 24 per cent of simulations resulting in hospital demand exceeding 2500 beds.” The modellers found that under the road map scenario, the significant easing of restrictions at 80 per cent vaccine coverage led to 63 per cent of simulations exceeding 2500 hospitalisations, and resulted in a second epidemic peak in mid-December.
However, they found high rates of symptomatic testing among vaccinated people could reduce the impact on the health system, reducing the 63 per cent chance of >2500 hospitalisations to 29 per cent, although they noted this “could be difficult to achieve in practice”. “If a 15 per cent reduction in non-household risk could be achieved and sustained through a variety of additional targeted public health and testing interventions, the risk of >2500 hospital demand could be reduced to 18 per cent,” they found.
“When 80 per cent adult vaccine coverage is reached, the case numbers, hospital and ICU numbers can provide a guide as to the likelihood of the health system capacity being exceeded and whether restrictions can be safely eased consistent with the road map or whether a more staggered approach may be required.
“Due to uncertainty about whether the epidemic growth rate will be sustained, seasonal impacts and vaccine efficacy parameters against the Delta strain, updated projections are required as more data becomes available.
“Decisions to ease restrictions should be based on the latest epidemiological and health system information.”

Dan’s slow road to nowhere

Full text: MELBOURNE’S gruelling lockdown will drag on for at least the next 36 days — three weeks longer than that expected in Sydney.
And even then, the October 26 ‘end to lockdown’ in greater Melbourne will mean something vastly different to the freedoms being returned to Sydneysiders, despite their vastly higher case numbers.
In reality, the Andrews government’s ‘reopening’ road map is a roadblock, keeping retail, much of hospitality and many levels of in-class education shut for almost a month longer than Sydney’s exit strategy.
Premier Daniel Andrews’s long-awaited detail on Victoria’s re-emergence from crushing Covid lockdown — with Melbourne to suffer the longest citywide closure in the world come early October — once again means more than five million people are stuck in desolate limbo. The Premier’s spin yesterday in setting forward dates for a complex array of minor changes to business settings and social reawakening may have been received by some, desperate for any relief, as at least a map of some sort.
But in the detail, the changes are glacial in comparison to not just Sydney but advanced nations such as Britain, the US and Israel that opened further and faster when vaccination rates were in the 60 per cent range.
In Andrews’ Victoria, Covid still controls every aspect of government intransigence and it’s pessimistic go-slow on reopening.
Already, across suburban Melbourne compliance with numbing restrictions is breaking and the Covid reproduction rates in some municipalities is more than twice the level seen in many Sydney municipalities. In other words, the virus is now spreading faster across parts of Melbourne than had ever been the case in Sydney because people, rightly or wrongly, have given up following the rules and have lost faith and patience in the Victorian government’s blunt lockdown response. But the Victorian government hasn’t matched the urgency and creativity of the NSW vaccine rollout, leaving us lagging behind.
While Mr Andrews yesterday underlined the Burnet Institute’s modelling that showed easing restrictions too quickly would have a significant effect on hospital capacities, he finally conceded broader consideration beyond just infection case numbers was required.
Even so, after 20 months of dealing with the pandemic, the only reason Victorian hospitals could be at risk of being overwhelmed now is a lack of appropriate government preparation and resourcing.
The Premier has attempted to present his road map as a plan for reopening, not a plan for remaining closed. Yet that is exactly what his strategy sets out. Almost two weeks ago, NSW Premier Gladys Berejiklian mapped out her state’s journey for reopening and it was the exact opposite of the Andrews doctrine in scope, pace and tone.
For those north of the Murray, the quicker route out of lockdowns and an economic deep freeze has been defined by hope and a determination to press forward with confidence.
The NSW map gives back freedoms at the earliest opportunity to those who took their responsibility to get vaccinated. In Victoria, while minor changes to outdoor sport and recreation from September 26 and, from October 26 some reopening for outdoor patrons in hospitality and pubs is also reserved for fully vaccinated people, they fall far short of what is being offered in NSW and should be delivered here.
Even the return for all Melbourne students across all levels to in-class learning from October 26 carried the heavy caveat “at least part time”.
For beleaguered greater Melbourne retailers — many of whom will not survive financially — shops will only re-open when Victoria hits 80 per cent double-dose adult vaccination on the forecast date of November 5. No other city in the world has imposed such draconian, stifling restrictions for so long under vaccination rates above 60, let alone 70 per cent.
And again, our neighbouring state will have seen most of these restrictions eased long before. In NSW, which expects to hit a 70 per cent fully vaccinated adult population on October 8, hospitality, retail, gyms and personal services can reopen with one person per 4sq m inside — a full month earlier than here.
From early October across Sydney, even racecourses, theme parks and zoos can reopen with the one person per 4sq m limit, while sports stadiums can have crowds of up to 5000 people with the same distancing requirements and up to 500 people can attend ticketed and seated outdoor events. Cinemas, theatres and galleries will also re-open in NSW at the 70 per cent fully-vaxxed milestone, with a limit of 75 per cent fixed seating capacity.
Australia’s two biggest cities may be less than 900km apart but there remains a universe of difference in the way citizens and businesses are being treated. That will be reflected in the respective time it takes for each state to recover from Covid and, at this crushing crawl, Victoria will feel the economic and societal pain for years longer. When Melbourne finally emerges from lockdown on October 26, we will have spent 267 days under effective house arrest. Mr Andrews will try to paint the occasion as a celebration. In truth, it will be a shameful indictment on a government that has failed the people of Melbourne and Victoria at almost every turn over the past 18 months.

Even true libertarians can support vax passports

Full text: It is undoubtedly true that preventing people who choose not to be vaccinated from engaging in ­activities that are open to the vaccinated involves a degree of coercion. But that hardly means any such restrictions ought to be opposed by those who place a high value on liberty.
There are, on the contrary, arguments for restrictions of this kind that should appeal even to libertarians.
After all, no one has a right to impose a harm on others by negligently disregarding their rights and interests. And it is surely clear that negligently infecting another person with a potentially serious disease breaches their right to live safely and securely, undermining a fundamental freedom that govern­ments have a duty to protect.
Indeed, for most accidental harms, the law of torts – which towering libertarians, such as Friedrich Hayek, have not only endorsed but eulogised – serves precisely that purpose, entitling the victim of a negligent act to rely on the coercive powers of the state to secure compensation from the act’s perpetrator.
Were tort law readily applicable to highly contagious diseases, it would not only help compensate victims; the threat of being sued would deter negligent transmission, inducing people to seek vaccination, or, knowing or suspecting that they have a communicable disease, to self-isolate.
There are, however, obvious difficulties in relying on the remedies offered by the law of tort to control the spread of Covid.
In part, those difficulties relate to the complexities of making out a case: it would, for example, be virtually impossible to unambiguously identify the culprits in a lengthy chain of transmission.
But even if those issues could be addressed, many of the costs of Covid do not fall on those who catch the disease; they are instead borne by society as a whole, through broader economic and social losses that tort law is neither designed to recover nor to effectively prevent.
And with an infection that can spread explosively, it is surely preferable to pre-emptively reduce the probability of outbreaks, rather than relying, almost certainly unsuccessfully, on private legal action to pursue those who helped trigger an outbreak once it had ­occurred.
Given those difficulties, other instruments – such as “vaccinal passports” – must fulfil the functions that tort law cannot serve, including preventing immediate harm and encouraging the taking of reasonable precautions.
Moreover, since those other instruments are merely regulatory substitutes for the (coercive) law of tort, it is scarcely sensible to criticise them for being coercive; rather, the only real issue is whether they are more coercive than they need to be.
Inevitably, the answer to that question depends on an assessment of the facts. If one believes that Covid is not a serious disease, then any restriction on the unvaccinated is plainly unjustifiable. And much the same would hold were vaccination ineffective or unduly dangerous. But if one accepts the Doherty Institute report and the latest modelling by the US Centres for Disease Control, the picture is altogether different.
Those studies suggest that the unvaccinated are about five times more likely than the vaccinated to catch Covid. Even assuming that the unvaccinated and the vaccinated transmit the disease at exactly the same rate, that implies that adding just one unvaccinated person to a group of five people who are vaccinated doubles the risk of there being a person in the group who has Covid.
Clearly, the overall danger that poses depends on the likelihood that the infection will be passed on, seeding a major outbreak; the higher the proportion of the population that is vaccinated, and the better the quality of contact tracing and isolation, the lower must be the probability of an uncontrolled outbreak.
But even putting aside the possibility of further spread, the fact that about 7 per cent of the symptomatic cases among the vaccinated are sufficiently serious as to require hospitalisation provides some basis for policy measures that limit the scope for contagion by restricting the unvaccinated’s access to crowded places. And where the contagion would affect very vulnerable groups – as in aged-care homes or in hospitals – the case for restricting access by the unvaccinated is overwhelming.
Those measures may seem harsh but they are hardly discriminatory: far from treating like unalike (which is the essence of discrimination), they differentiate on the basis of a crucial difference, namely the risk of infection.
However, the function of the restrictions is not to simply reduce the immediate likelihood of transmission; it is also to encourage the unvaccinated to seek vaccination. They therefore resemble punishments, which, when taken to an extreme (as in “no jab, no school” policies), can make vaccination virtually mandatory.
Presumably, the goal being pursued is that of achieving a level of vaccination in the community that is sufficient to reach a degree of herd immunity, reducing the need for costly lockdowns.
Just how high that level has to be is controversial; what is certain is that any gains from herd immunity, once it is achieved, flow to both the vaccinated and unvaccinated, in terms of reduced risk of illness and improved quality of life. And because the unvaccinated stand a far higher chance of catching the disease and dying from it, they derive a substantially greater benefit than do the vaccinated from herd immunity being reached.
To that extent, the unvaccinated free-ride on a benefit they have done nothing to secure, other than by making a trivial contribution to the fiscal cost of the vaccines. It could be argued that their free riding on the risks and inconvenience borne by the vaccinated causes no harm, as the benefit remains intact, at least in the short term; but it is reasonable to suggest that a free society will struggle to survive if the principle of mutual obligation can be lightly disregarded, including when it comes to sharing the cost of vital public goods. Rather, just as refusing to be conscripted in times of war should not come cheaply, so the refusal to be vaccinated when one readily and safely could ought to come with hurdles and burdens attached.
Of course, it may be that imposing any such penalties will prove unnecessary. Perhaps the intense fear of Covid that has gripped Australia will make very high levels of vaccination easy to achieve. But even if it did, there would still be a risk that when the vaccinations have to be renewed, the passage of time will have dulled the panic, causing herd immunity, and the benefits it brings, to be lost. Having lived in fear for the past two years, wouldn’t it be ironic if now all we had to fear was the waning of fear itself?

Full text: Reward earned for jab success VICTORIANS have at last some sense of progress, even if it’s yet to materialise in much-needed and immediate lockdown relief.
Today, the state is expected to achieve its 70 per cent first vaccine dose milestone across the 16-plus population — a full week before the original estimate of September 23.
Victoria has also now crossed the one million jab target through state vaccine hubs — four days earlier than the five weeks needed that was originally forecast.
The signs are well and truly there that Victorians, and increasingly younger cohorts in their 20s and 30s, are coming forward in greater numbers to access not just the health protections of vaccination but the end to lockdowns the jabs promise.
Today, Premier Daniel Andrews is likely to announce minor changes to the distance people can travel from home, 10km instead of 5km, and an extra hour of outdoor exercise with perhaps small tweaks to child minding for essential workers.
For millions of beleaguered Melburnians enduring their sixth numbing lockdown, the fringe changes will mean little or nothing.
Interestingly, in a sign of the government’s belated recognition of the social and emotional costs of lockdowns, Premier Andrews indicated some “social” restriction amendments may be included in the small-step reliefs today, if possible.
Of course, the Andrews government’s road map for greater business, travel and private life easings in the period between now and when we hit the nationally-endorsed 70 per cent double-dose trigger for an end to lockdowns is due to be announced on Sunday.
This road map, informed by Burnet Institute modelling on projected Covid infection and hospitalisation rates, will be a plan that shows whether the Andrews government is now responding not just to Covid case numbers but the full spectrum of by-product costs to industry, education and community of wholesale shutdowns for months on end.
Nonetheless, a risk-averse balance is still raising questions about how proportional the health advice and responses are, with Ballarat yesterday thrust back into lockdown for a week despite having only four positive cases, although multiple wastewater detections back to September 8. The yo-yo open and shut mandates would be especially hard to take given lockdown was lifted for the regional city just six days ago.
Certainly, Delta is not as manageable as Alpha of the second-wave Wuhan strain seen last year: it transmits at least twice as fast, is hospitalising up to 10 per cent of cases and is primarily now hitting the young, mobile and unvaccinated.
The response to it must reflect the reality of both its risk, hospital load pressures and the need to live with it as mass vaccination rates increase.
Yet the western and northern corridors of Melbourne, and now emerging concerns around Dandenong — where case loads are driving the outbreaks — show vaccine access and the messaging program are still not hitting the required marks. Of Victoria’s 423 new Covid cases yesterday, 274 were in the north and 112 in western suburbs. Amid those regions, there was at least some better news with Hume, Wyndham and Melton all lifting in their first-dose jab rates by more than 30 per cent — albeit from low bases.
With an estimated one in eight cases in recent times linked to the construction sector, a highly mobile and young workforce, there needs to be better safe-work compliance to stem spread.
The wide use of rapid antigen testing in all essential workforces is needed as a priority to get ahead of Delta instead of continually chasing it as clusters occur at sites or within industries.
Water focus for city MELBOURNE has never made the most of its inner-city harbour and iconic Yarra River.
Correction: in times long past we used to make much more of our waterways, particularly the early 20th century Henley-on-Yarra regattas that could attract 300,000 people — much of the city — in a colourful pageant for boating and picnics.
And of course the Wurundjeri people had for millennia lived, fished and gathered around the Birrarung, cherishing the river as a place of cultural significance.
In recent decades, as Southbank developed and Northbank remains a work in progress, the Yarra has again become more a focal point. To the west, Docklands redrew the CBD footprint and took it to the edge of a repurposed Victoria Harbour.
Today, the Herald sun reports a new Melbourne ferry terminal for Docklands will aim to be “as popular as Circular Quay in Sydney.’’ Perhaps forget the Sydney comparisons and instead make it something uniquely our own.
“Better yet, it could be the Flinders Street Station of water transport services,’’ Deputy Mayor Nicholas Reece said.
The passenger terminal seeks to boost ferry services and tourism to Geelong and the Bellarine Peninsula. As we re-enliven the city post-pandemic, new visions like this are to be embraced.

Push for Cup fans as Dan mulls plan

Full text: EXCLUSIVE CAULFIELD Cup organisers want thousands of vaccinated racegoers trackside at the popular race next month, as Premier Daniel Andrews promises to detail a reopening plan within days.
Amid growing calls for more hope and certainty for Victorian businesses, families and schoolchildren before term 4, Mr Andrews said on Sunday he would release a comprehensive plan “in about a week’s time”.
“That will give people a sense of schools, hospitality, where they can go, who they can visit, all of those things,” he said.
It comes as Melbourne Racing Club prepares to submit a proposal for up to 7500 spectators at the October 16 event in what is hoped could signal a safe return of sporting crowds.
Chief executive Josh Blanksby told the Herald Sun the club was willing to ensure every fan was doubled vaccinated, wore a mask, showed proof of vaccination, placed bets from their seats and used QR codes around the course.
“We can do all those things,’’ he said. “If Health came back to us and said ‘these are the requirements we need’ … we could do betting in seats, seated for food, obviously masks, check-ins for all our restaurants, we could do it all.” The state government will this week receive more Burnet Institute modelling on the effect of easing restrictions as vaccination targets are hit. The Premier has previously suggested a very minor easing of Melbourne’s lockdown, including an extension of the 5km travel limit to 10km, when the state hits a 70 per cent single dose vaccination rate – projected to be September 17.
On Sunday, he said that any “roadmap in that race to 80 per cent” would include caveats based on the number of active cases and people in hospital.
He also said it would include better ventilation at schools and staggered entry times for students, but refused to commit to a term 4 date when students would return to the classroom. It comes as Opposition Leader Matthew Guy called for the government to consider “social interaction bubbles”, allowing small gatherings between families, in time for the AFL grand final on September 25.
“The government has got a couple of weeks now to prepare for it,” he said. “I hope they do because Victorian families deserve it. They have earnt that.” It comes as Sydney pushes to have crowds back at The Everest on the same day as the Caulfield Cup despite having far more Covid-19 infections.
The NSW government last week announced 5000 people would be allowed at racetracks once 70 per cent of the state was fully vaccinated.
Mr Blanksby said it would be “the definition of irony’’ to have spectators in Covid-plagued Sydney and none in Melbourne. He said he would “push right up to the end’’ to have spectators in the stands.
More than 90 per cent of Victorians aged 16 and over are projected to have had one dose by Caulfield Cup day, according to Covid Live. The state is then projected to hit the 70 per cent fully-vaccinated target on November 16 and 80 per cent on December 8.
Melbourne Racing Club originally wanted 30,000 fans across four zones for the Caulfield Cup but will now lobby for one area of up to 7500 fans.
While it hopes for a decision by the end of the month, Mr Blanksby said it could host fans at a week’s notice. peter.rolfe@news.com.au

'Show us the health advice on NSW reopening plan': Plibersek

Full text: The NSW government should reveal advice from its health authorities about plans to ease COVID restrictions at 70 per cent vaccination rates, Labor MP Tanya Plibersek has said.
Ms Plibersek called for greater transparency from Gladys Berejiklian about the competing advice the state government received on reopening, after the NSW Premier announced last week she would stop daily press conferences on the coronavirus outbreak.
"I would be much more confident about the 70 per cent target if it was clear that the Premier was getting health advice that backed it, and that it was clear that those other things that the Doherty modelling talks about, like tracking, tracing, the capacity of our hospital system to cope with the number of sick people, if those things were taken care of," Ms Plibersek told ABC's Insiders on Sunday.
"We're not going to get answers to those questions because the Premier has suspended Parliament and cancelled the daily press briefings that she was giving."
A reopening plan unveiled last week showed the NSW government would lift stay-at-home orders for fully vaccinated adults from the Monday after the state passes the 70 per cent double dose target.
Up to five visitors will be allowed in a home where all adults are vaccinated, and hospitality venues, retail stores, gyms and other services and venues will be able reopen subject to spacing requirements, while domestic travel, including trips to regional NSW, will be permitted.
It has been reported that the NSW chief health officer backed a more cautious plan for reopening at 80-85 per cent vaccination coverage, to avoid the state re-entering lockdown after easing restrictions.

"We've got a Prime Minister who's urging states to open up, lift all restrictions, get on with it, but not prepared to take any responsibility for his role here," she said.
"The reason we're in this second lockdown is because Scott Morrison failed on the vaccine rollout and quarantine."
The Labor education spokeswoman backed the NSW government's decision to mandate vaccinations for teachers.
However she said state and territory governments should give teachers the opportunity to be vaccinated first before making it mandatory.
"It's really important that front-line workers get vaccinated and the real problem here is we've got thousands of front line workers including teachers and school staff who are desperate to get vaccinated, who haven't had the opportunity to do so," Ms Plibersek said.
"Ultimately, I believe if you're a front-line worker, you should be vaccinated. Teachers risk their own health, but they also risk the health of the people they go home to and the kids if they're not vaccinated."
Ms Plibersek said the nation should look at school based COVID vaccination programs for children.
She also called for the government to look for vaccine supply for younger children from companies testing vaccines for young age groups.

Full text: The professor behind a model provided to the WA government that predicted scores of coronavirus deaths if restrictions are relaxed too soon says the Doherty Institute modelling on which the national reopening plan is based is "perhaps too optimistic". University of Western Australia Professor George Milne's modelling forecasts 13,390 cases, 1373 hospitalisations and 186 deaths in the six months after WA reopens. It suggests a need for vaccination coverage of 85 per cent.

Full text: Hope for an end to tale of two cities The NSW Treasurer is spot-on when it comes to a call — finally — on when and how we lift restrictions (FreeDom: Treasurer demands every suburb unshackled, 8/9).
“This is not a tale of two cities,” he has stated.
The pity is that is exactly what we are in now where some LGAs are hot spots and have higher levels of restriction (fair enough) than those who live in less-affected areas.
And perhaps if the government and health authorities are going to continue making this distinction, rather than look at an LGA, perhaps they could consider rules by suburb.
Where I live, my postcode includes a number of suburbs in an adjoining lower-risk LGA. I suspect that the number of Covid cases in my suburb are probably closer to those in The Hills rather than the figures for the Blacktown LGA.
If new health orders can now place restrictions on higher-risk apartment blocks (High-risk block bans, 8/9), surely the same level of delineation could be applied to suburbs.
Ray Abé, Kellyville Ridge
Pollies must stick to a united path to freedom Everywhere I look I see people ­trying to comply with lockdown provisions. In Bathurst, for example, many are queuing in freezing early morning weather to be vaccinated.
Daily they get political division and uncertainty though they crave unity, as do small businesses gasping to survive (FreeDom: Treasurer demands every suburb unshackled, 8/9).
Blame for vaccine complacency, rollout and associated problems like hospitalisation and educating children have now been done to death.
It is beyond time our politicians put aside their power-driven egos to co-operate in the interests of not just state, but national wellbeing.
We know how the north-south divide in the US adversely impacts lives, especially now with so many misled, obtuse and ignorant in the south succumbing to Covid.
If we do not want to emerge from this pandemic as the disunited states of Australia, co-operation among political and community leaders is crucial.
Ron Sinclair, Bathurst
Jab rate should be key NSW Treasurer Dominic Perrottet is calling for all of Sydney to come out of lockdown together, which ­differs from Premier Gladys ­Berejiklian.
Western Sydney doesn’t need to be in lockdown longer than other parts of the city, as vaccination ­numbers have increased in the so called hot spots.
The NSW government needs to represent all of us equally and not dish out conflicting rules about ­lockdowns, as regional areas with no reported cases have also worn the brunt of unfair decisions from ­Macquarie Street.
Michael Kovas, Homebush
Don’t ignore Doherty details Not only is the NSW Premier at odds with Treasurer Dominic Perrottet about how and when restrictions will ease, there is a much more significant clash between government and the work carried out by the Doherty Institute.
Anyone who has read the now-revised and famed Doherty report will see that it does not support the wholesale easing of restrictions even when a 70 per cent to 80 per cent vaccination rate has been achieved.
Their modelling does not account for open borders and it certainly does not take into account daily infection rates of more than 1200, 80 per cent of which unlinked.
I’m all for going back to some semblance of normality, but fear that the strain on hospitals will only get worse, because when 80 per cent of the nation is vaccinated some nine million people will ­remain unvaccinated.
Dr Jack Dikian, Mosman
Electoral backlash looms I’m glad to see that the Treasurer is in favour of all of Sydney opening up at once.
The west and southwest of Sydney both appear to have been treated very unfairly, and if the reopening is delayed out here then there could be a push-back against the government by the locals. If this doesn’t occur immediately then it will likely happen at the next election. Perhaps these areas are being punished because they are generally Labor electorates.
C. Clark, Ingleburn
Our sacrifices for nothing?
To open all the suburbs, even those that have endured tougher ­restrictions due to higher virus ­volume, would be a slap in the face for every person in NSW that’s been under one draconian law or another.
Team Berejiklian has had us all living under the jackboot of the police force, with the ADF in ­assistance, and has had us all locked up for months on end – and now the plan could be to just fling open the gates?!
Then what has this all been for?
We’ve been told ad nauseam that contact tracing is the quintessential ingredient to keeping the spread manageable, and we’ve been told vaccination is the layer that will bring us closer to freedom.
But contact tracers are already under the pump, vaccines will not stop the spread of the virus and the unvaccinated won’t enjoy the same reinstatement of their democratic rights as will the rest.
It would seem Team Berejiklian has just shown us, and the rest of the world, how to implement an exercise in futility.
Christopher Woodley, Vaucluse
Howard’s wise counsel Prime Minister Scott Morrison, ­Energy Minister Angus Taylor, NSW Premier Gladys Berejiklian, NSW Energy Minister Matt Kean and all Australians would do well to heed the wisdom of John Howard – one of our greatest prime ministers – when he ­cautions that we should ignore the UN and people that advocate ­destroying coal (Howard hits out at UN’s coal war, 8/9).
Coal is one of the most valuable export industries that this country has and it also helps lift living standards in underdeveloped countries.
Thank you, Mr Howard. You’ve offered far too much common sense for the current generation of woke ideologues and climate alarmists to comprehend.
Bob Partington, Wahroonga
Women deserve better The woke bureaucrats who decided to redefine the word “woman” for the NSW Woman of the Year awards, have completely lost the plot (Man, I feel like a woman, 8/9).
Allowing men who feel like or identify as women to potentially be named NSW Woman of the Year is not only farcical, it is also totally ­unfair to all the women across the state who are so deserving of this prestigious honour and makes a mockery of the award.
Bureaucrats who are on the public purse should get on with their jobs rather that redefining what it means to be a woman, ultimately letting down real women with their politically correct nonsense.
Thomas Carrie, Summer Hill
States don’t control ADF It is dumbfounding that there is even a question about the manner of return of ADF personnel from ­Afghanistan, or anywhere, to Queensland (Soldiers stranded, 8/9).
Surely the federal government has the power to determine how our forces are deployed and redeployed without reference to recalcitrant state government authorities.
Gary Bryant, Gladesville
Briefly...
Instead of including men who ­identify as women in the Woman of the Year awards, why don’t we set up an award for the dumbest ­bureaucrat of the year (Man, I feel like a woman, 8/9)? I’m sure there would be plenty of candidates for that position.
Jim Gardiner, New Lambton ●●● On the bright side of pub lockdowns, I have had better conversations with my fellow drinkers sitting ­outside the places where we would normally drink. They are more ­coherent, as am I.
Gary Frances, Bexley ●●● After reading stories of the galahs in some local councils since amalgamation, this could be a very good match-up (There’s a new pecking order: Council swoops on magpie, 8/9). Galah versus magpie – I’m backing the magpie.

On the wrong track with questionable calls

Full text: letters to the editor
I REFER to the article "Sneak peek inside $2b intercity train" (Herald, 2/9) regarding the new trains being ready for service.
As an ex-railwayman with 30 years' service, I am staggered at the NSW government's decision to curtail the guard's overall safety function on the new, foreign-built trains. The whole history of these trains is bad from the beginning. When challenged about them not being built in NSW, a certain Premier replied that "the people of NSW expect value for money". Well, that didn't happen as we all know. When the new carriages were off loaded on the wharf it was quickly discovered that they were out of gauge for the lines they were required to travel on. There was then a need to shave all tunnels and platforms where these trains were destined to travel, thus increasing the overall cost. When challenged on this and again asked why the trains were not built in NSW, the Premier replied "We're not very good at building trains in NSW," thereby exposing her complete lack of knowledge of the history of railways in this state. You may remember that she was the Transport Minister who thought that it would be a great idea to tear up the railway line to the second largest city in NSW?
During my railway career I progressed through the various grades in the traffic branch, including that of guard. I completed my service as the senior safety officer, Northern Region, based at Newcastle. I do not know the chief operating officer, Mr Merrick's background and I wonder what, if any, operating experience he has with railways. The guard is responsible for the safe working of the train and is also qualified to render first aid in an emergency, as well as generally looking after the wellbeing of the passengers and answering any inquiries they may have.
The driver has the responsibility of driving the train, adhering to the signals and watching the track ahead and must be prepared to act in any emergency that may occur on the line. I believe that the current plan to take away the guard's observation of the train and passengers when stopped at a platform and replace that with a camera is foolhardy and dangerous in the extreme. NSW Railways have been a forerunner in rail safety over many decades. This current plan, if enabled, will erode that record. If I was a driver, I would refuse to move a train without the guard's "right away" as it is unsafe to do so.
Mark Gattenhof, Wyoming Winds of change are blowing THE federal government's new bill to legalise the offshore wind industry in Commonwealth water will open Australia to global investment in offshore wind farms, with thousands of jobs expected to flow into industrial towns facing an uncertain future as manufacturing continues to decline. These projects will provide cheap, clean energy for existing manufacturing and attract private investment in new export industries such as hydrogen and local wind turbine manufacturing.
Offshore wind means onshore jobs as it's cheaper to build the massive turbines close by rather than transport them from other locations. The projects also require many of the skills that workers in fossil fuel industries already have and thus building them in places where workers have those skills should be a priority. This means a Newcastle offshore wind farm could be the kickstart we need for a green industrial rebirth in the Hunter Valley. A recent economic analysis by Beyond Zero Emissions said Newcastle, with its deep water port, skilled workforce and existing industrial infrastructure could attract $28 billion in capital investment to the region, generate $11 billion in revenue by 2032 and create 34,000 jobs.
Offshore generation and transmission will deliver a more secure and reliable electricity system and create thousands of jobs and business opportunities in regional Australia. In light of the rapidly declining coal sector due to shrinking global demand for thermal coal, the Hunter Valley must be made a priority for offshore wind by the government.
Bryce Ham, Whitebridge It pays to dig a little deeper GEORGE Williams, ("Put money where your mouth is", Letters, 3/9), regarding the Premier's token pats on the back for nurses and ambos, it's much worse than you might think.
Not only did Gladys Berejiklian block a pay rise for these people this year, last year she also froze the pay of 400,000 frontline public sector workers who were helping fight the pandemic. To add insult to injury, around the same time, Ms Berejiklian increased Minister for Finance and Small Business Damien Tudehope's $309,621 salary by $17,000.
Then to further rub salt into the wound, the Premier also approved Police Commissioner Mick Fuller's request for a $87,000 pay rise (bringing his pay up to $649,500), all while he was investigating her and Scott Morrison's alleged role in allowing over 130 people infected with COVID-19 to disembark the Ruby Princess cruise ship into Sydney without quarantining (Plus at the start of this year, Commissioner Fuller was granted a further pay rise of $16,250 by Berejiklian).
I've been questioning the Premier's priorities for years now, but all of these matters truly make my jaw drop. I also think that Ms Berejiklian granting a pay rise to someone investigating her is a bit suspect to say the very least.
Adz Carter, Newcastle 'Lockouts' for the unvaccinated ACCORDING to Doherty modelling, when Australia is fully vaccinated, we are unlikely to ever celebrate a "Freedom Day" where masks are thrown away and where lockdowns end.
The rest of our lives will be spent in partial lockdowns and being vigilant against possible infection. We will need to learn to live with COVID infections and deaths. Every year, we will receive booster shots. Mask-wearing will become mandatory indoors apart from in our homes. Lockdowns will become "lockouts" for the unvaccinated at all sorts of venues. The unvaccinated will be unable to travel.
As Australia approaches full vaccination, we should brace ourselves for more violent "freedom" demonstrations by anti-vaxxers and conspiracy groups.
Geoff Black, Caves Beach How we can be heard on climate THE Australian Security Leaders Climate Group have released a grim report highlighting how ill-prepared Australia is in assessing and addressing the risks posed by climate change, such as climate-fuelled water and food insecurity.
Our defence leaders are one of the many experts in various fields who are calling on the Morrison government for leadership and urgent action to decarbonise our economy. Yet it is very frustrating to know that little has been done to protect us Australians from future climate catastrophe.
We, as individuals, may not be able to control the actions of our politicians and the policies they set. However, we do control the outcome of the ballot box at the next federal election. If Scott Morrison and the Coalition party do not bring in the strong climate policies needed to protect us Australians from future damage, then I suggest that we vote them out.

Australia's vaccine supply issues are over: Frewen

Full text: Australia's vaccine supply issues are over and the success of the nation's rollout now hinges on public uptake, the man tasked with leading it says.
COVID-19 Taskforce Commander Lieutenant-General John Frewen has also told Australian Community Media that vaccination rates among Indigenous Australians must be accelerated to avoid leaving them exposed once restrictions begin to ease.
The early stages of Australia's rollout were wracked by an undersupply of Pfizer, a problem compounded by the Australian Technical Advisory Group on Immunisation advising against the use of AstraZeneca in people under 60.
But with an imminent influx of mRNA vaccines, General John Frewen said Australia was on track to ramp up its rollout in September, a month earlier than initially expected.
"This takes us beyond the phase in the vaccine [rollout] where we were really mRNA supply constrained. The vaccines are coming, the distribution networks are in place and expanding. It all comes down now to public willingness to come forward," he told Australian Community Media.
"Sentiment remains strong and high, which is pleasing. But I'm not counting any chickens until we've got everybody through the door.
"We've still got a ways to go to get us to 70 per cent, and international experience tells us you've got work hard between 70 per cent and 80 per cent."

Australia would return the doses by December, General Frewen predicted.
It followed a similar agreement with Singapore for 500,000 doses, and the federal government purchasing an additional one million from Poland.
General Frewen said the deals, coupled with the imminent availability of the Moderna jab, would allow the country's remaining GPs to administer mRNA vaccines.
"[That] is going to help us ramp up through September in ways that we didn't think would be possible until October," he said.
"We've got every opportunity, provided people keep stepping forward. So I really encourage everybody who hasn't made a booking to get in and make one now."
The nation's reopening plan, based on modelling by the Doherty Institute, saw Australia begin to reopen once 70 per cent of each state and territory was fully-vaccinated.
That did not include 12- to 15-year-olds, who were all eligible to make a booking from Monday.

Nor did it include a minimum threshold for Indigenous and Torres Strait Islander Australians, raising the prospect of Australia opening up while they remained vulnerable.
Just over 40 per cent of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Australians aged 16 and over had received a first dose by Monday, well below the broader population of 63 per cent. Just 23 per cent were fully-vaccinated, compared to 38 per cent nationally.
General Frewen conceded vaccination among First Nations peoples had fallen behind during the initial stages of the rollout and, although it had doubled in the last month, the rate was still only keeping pace with the rest of Australia.
"So we've got to accelerate it to catch it up, because we don't want them to be behind when the rest of the nation gets to 70 and 80 per cent," he said.
"We're going to accelerate where we can over the next month by focusing on some of those communities that are most behind right now."
General Frewen would not predict when the Indigenous population would hit 70 per cent, warning vaccine hesitancy would prove the "ultimate variable". He warned a relatively COVID-free existence in most remote communities, some of which had vaccination rates under 10 per cent, had caused complacency over the vaccine.
But the virus' spread through regional NSW, including the first deaths among Indigenous Australians, had prompted a shift in the region. Work was being done with local leaders and trusted community identities to counter disinformation, he said.
"[They are] stressing not only that the vaccines are safe and important, but there is a real urgency to this," he said.
"Western NSW has given us a good reminder that COVID can rip into these communities really quickly, so we're better to get in and get ahead of the curve."

That was complicated by logistical challenges posed by Pfizer, which needed to be transported and stored at freezing temperatures.
And as a September 17 deadline for all residential aged care workers to receive at least one dose loomed, General Frewen insisted Australia was on track to vaccinate the vast majority of the cohort.
Eighty-five per cent had received a first dose and 64 per cent were fully-vaccinated, with roughly 40,000 still requiring a first dose, he revealed.

Full text: HEALTH authorities in NSW have reversed a decision directing aged-care homes to care for Covid-positive residents on site amid a shortage of hospital beds, after at least two facilities were told there was not enough space for non-critical residents to be transferred into care.
It comes as new modelling predicted that up to 947 people would require intensive care treatment in hospital by the middle of October, creating as “overwhelming impact” on ICU operations.
Aged-care facilities initially told to manage Covid cases on-site include the Uniting Edinglassie Lodge in Penrith, where nine residents tested positive to Covid last week.
In a statement on Friday, Uniting said seven residents had been transferred to hospital, but the facility was advised by NSW Health that no further clinically stable residents would be transferred.
By Monday, an “agreement” had been reached to transfer the remaining two residents to hospital, according to a Uniting statement.
NSW chief health officer Kerry Chant on Monday said decisions about transferring aged-care residents with Covid to hospital was made by a “case-by-case assessment … (considering) what’s in the best interest of the facility”. Sydney’s second wave is predicted to grow at a rate of up to 2500 cases per day by mid September.

Full text: HEALTH authorities in NSW have reversed a decision directing aged-care homes to care for Covid-positive residents on site amid a shortage of hospital beds, after at least two facilities were told there was not enough space for non-critical residents to be transferred into care.
It comes as new modelling predicted that up to 947 people would require intensive care treatment in hospital by the middle of October, creating as “overwhelming impact” on ICU operations.
Aged-care facilities initially told to manage Covid cases on-site include the Uniting Edinglassie Lodge in Penrith, where nine residents tested positive to Covid last week.
In a statement on Friday, Uniting said seven residents had been transferred to hospital, but the facility was advised by NSW Health that no further clinically stable residents would be transferred.
By Monday, an “agreement” had been reached to transfer the remaining two residents to hospital, according to a Uniting statement.
NSW chief health officer Kerry Chant on Monday said decisions about transferring aged-care residents with Covid to hospital was made by a “case-by-case assessment … (considering) what’s in the best interest of the facility”. Sydney’s second wave is predicted to grow at a rate of up to 2500 cases per day by mid September.

Full text: NOT content with manipulating the fears of older Queenslanders, the Premier has now moved to frightening parents.
In a desperate attempt to deflect criticism from her border decisions, Palaszczuk said that any opening of the border before “every child (is) vaccinated” was putting children at risk.
“You open up this state and you let the virus in here and every child under 12 is vulnerable, every single child.” Not only does this conflict with the scientific evidence, it also sets a requirement for opening that no government can ever reach.
At present, 7 per cent of people over 70 who contract Covid will end up in ICU, with 46 per cent needing hospitalisation for a less severe set of symptoms.
In contrast, even for the Delta strain, just 0.1 per cent of people under 14 who contract it will find themselves in ICU.
This is why a long line of medical experts has advised against the need to vaccinate children under 12.
Queensland paediatrician Professor Robert Booy says “keeping borders shut because of the children is not a sensible measure”. He makes it very clear that the risk exists only for the small number of children who are already complex cases because of existing chronic conditions.
Professor Fiona Russell, paediatrician with the Murdoch Children’s Research Institute, has explained that while children can exhibit flu-like symptoms, they rarely become seriously ill, even with the Delta strain. As she put it, “Covid in kids is nothing like what occurs in adults.” And in responding to Palaszczuk’s fear-mongering, Professor Paul Kelly – Australia’s chief medical officer – said that even with the Delta variant, there is “very little evidence anywhere in the world that severity has increased” for childhood infections.
Using NSW as an example, Professor Kelly explained that most of the children hospitalised for Covid reasons were there because their parents were sick and couldn’t look after them.
What Palaszczuk neglected to mention was that there is no vaccine recommended for children under 12 – not in Australia or another country. This means she’s setting a requirement for opening the borders that no government can reach.
This overreach exposes what has been at the heart of her motivation for months now: using fear to maintain power and control.
It was one thing to lock Queenslanders in when there was no vaccine, but Australians now have access to vaccines in abundance. To continue to lock up Queenslanders indefinitely – even when 70 or 80 per cent of the community is vaccinated – is plainly unreasonable. Yet this is what the Premier is calling for by suggesting we must wait until a vaccine for kids has been invented, tested, manufactured and distributed. No such vaccine is even on the horizon.
What’s worse is the Premier has no alternative plan to hiding under the doona for the foreseeable future. Snap lockdowns and closed state borders – with their dubious constitutionality in an environment of abundant vaccines – are no recipe for confronting and dealing with this virus.
The Doherty modelling is clear. At 70 and 80 per cent vaccination, the harms that come to physical and mental health exceed the risk that comes from Covid itself.
Federal Labor agrees with the national plan. Asked about Palaszczuk’s comments, Labor leader Anthony Albanese said “we need to follow the health advice”. Deputy leader Richard Marles said “I would be distancing myself from the comments of Anastacia.” It’s time for the Premier to stop toying with the health, safety, livelihoods, and economy of Queenslanders. Time for her to stop undermining confidence in the vaccine, and confidence in the National Plan without an alternative vision of her own.
Rather than playing games, the Premier should focus on getting Queensland’s hospitals up to scratch. Ramping rates at hospitals are a far bigger risk to children with complex and chronic conditions than Covid.
There’s only one plan on the table for safely moving out of the pandemic and confidently resuming normal life, giving our children confidence of continuity in their education, job stability and business viability. The economic support measures cannot go on forever – and it would be corrosive to our national morale if they did.
It’s time for the Queensland government to honour the commitment it made at National Cabinet in July, and get serious about implementing the National Plan. Amanda Stoker is an LNP Senator for Queensland

JOURNOS SPLIT ON PARTY LINES

Full text: For all the media criticism of politicians’ handling of Covid-19, history may judge our leaders to have performed better than journalists and medical regulators.
Media sensationalism played a big role in hyping a one-in-a-million risk of death from rare blood clots associated with Australia’s preferred AstraZeneca vaccine. Coverage was so overblown many people in Sydney are still waiting for Pfizer jabs, rather than take the readily available Astra. Yet ABC health editor Norman Swan, an early critic of Astra, now says it may be more effective than Pfizer against the Delta variant of Covid.
Our medical regulators also harmed the vaccine rollout. The Therapeutic Goods Administration’s first approval came six weeks after US approval. Then the Australian Technical Advisory Group on Immunisation stoked vaccine hesitancy by first “preferring” Astra for over 50s, and then for over 60s. This left Australia with globally low vaccination rates in June at the start of the present Sydney outbreak.
Hindsight is easy but Astra was the logical choice for Australia a year ago. Labor would probably have made the same choice. Astra could be stored at normal refrigeration temperatures, was easier to handle and distribute and could be made in Australia.
As this column argued three months ago, Prime Minister Scott Morrison had little choice, with almost no Covid at the time, but to cave in to ATAGI’s “medical advice”, given the ABC and others would have blamed him personally for every Astra blood clot death. Morrison did eventually find his mettle in June when Delta hit Sydney, and on cue he was bagged by the ABC and Guardian for urging young people to see their doctor about an Astra jab.
Media coverage of virus escapes from quarantine has been just as flawed. Journalists should know hotel quarantine was agreed to by national cabinet. Victorian Premier Dan Andrews even claimed it was his idea. The premiers understandably wanted the money from quarantine to support CBD hotels that were struggling with low occupancy rates after the international border closure.
Morrison has largely ignored his critics on vaccination and quarantine to preserve the unity of national cabinet. This leaves him looking flat-footed as Labor premiers backflip on deals they have already agreed to. Few reporters call the premiers out. For example, journalists who could not give Labor state and federal politicians enough space to demand faster quarantine returns of Australians stuck overseas never questioned the premiers mid-year when they demanded dramatic reductions in overseas arrivals.
The truth is politicians did not know what they did not know at the start of the pandemic. Yet they got a fair bit right. From the decision to stop flights between Australia and China to the closing of our international borders and the introduction of JobKeeper, our leaders did a better job than most overseas governments. They got half a million Australians home and finished 2020 with among the world’s lowest Covid death rates – 910 dead from a population of 25 million – and the second best performing economy in the OECD.
The media did less well last year. Journalists jumped all over the Berejiklian government’s mishandling of the Ruby Princess in April 2020. Partisan reporters tried to pin it on then Home Affairs Minister Peter Dutton. An inquiry by the nation’s sharpest Queen’s Counsel, Bret Walker, pinned most of the blame on state health officials.
The media again split along partisan lines over the 112-day lockdown by Victorian Premier Dan Andrews, who held his own Commission of Inquiry that ended in the resignation of the head of his department and claims no one knew who decided on private security firms to run the state’s hotel quarantine.
The media Right went nuts, and still is on Andrews. The media Left fell in behind the “I Stand With Dan” hashtag on Twitter. Journalists who asked Andrews tough questions were targeted personally on social media. No journalist should “stand with” any politician, until they leave the business for PR.
Many journalists who defended every step Andrews made last year have criticised every Berejiklian step this year. They don’t mention Victoria’s much higher death rate. Nor do they admit reporters from this newspaper and Sky News have been just as tough on Berejiklian as Andrews.
By the middle of last week even the most provincial media defenders of the Labor premiers prepared to abandon their own national cabinet commitments in the name of Covid-zero must have been starting to see the light. Andrews on Wednesday admitted Victoria’s hard lockdown would not achieve zero Covid.
He was accepting what Berejiklian had said for more than a month – only rapidly increasing vaccination would pare back the Delta virus. WA and Queensland Labor leaders Mark McGowan and Annastacia Palaszczuk will eventually reach the same conclusion. Journalists who can’t see the obvious just need to look at New Zealand’s latest outbreak.
Palaszczuk and her chief health officer disgraced themselves mid-year with false claims about AstraZeneca. They did so again last week when they allowed the families of NRL players across the state’s border even as they refused entry to a three-year-old who had been holidaying with his grandparents in NSW. As politics, it put Sir Joh Bjelke-Petersen to shame. Palaszczuk’s fearmongering on Doherty Report modelling in state parliament last week rivalled Craig Kelly for misinformation.
Worse have been the senior ABC women feeding into false claims about vaccination for children. Palaszczuk falsely implied Coalition governments were risking child safety when she knows young children are not approved for vaccination anywhere in the world. While they can catch Covid, it seldom makes them sick.
Neither has a timid, politically correct media been intelligent enough to look seriously at the cultural factors in Aboriginal Australia and in outer suburban Sydney and Melbourne multicultural communities that feed vaccine hesitancy and rapid case spread.
My Aboriginal contacts have been predicting a Covid disaster in outback communities all year. Cultural, family and lifestyle issues, more than poverty, racism or language, have assured the most vaccine-hesitant communities in Aboriginal and multicultural communities are also the ones with the highest smoking rates, the worst general health, the highest density per household and the highest rate of multi-generational families.
That sort of reporting is difficult. It’s much easier to lead bulletins with sensational claims of soaring case numbers, out-of-control virus spread and a failing hospital system, even though this is not what is happening.
Sydney’s hospital system is coping well. Lockdowns in Sydney and Melbourne have slowed the spread. Virus reproduction numbers are falling and in Sydney, it’s only just above 1. Case numbers in Sydney and Melbourne will continue to rise, but the curve will bend as vaccinations rates rise. More interesting will be watching how the health systems cope in WA and Queensland when Delta inevitably hits the way it did in New Zealand.

Full text: THREE children under 13 – including an infant – are among 175 NSW Covid patients in ­intensive care.
NSW Health confirmed on Sunday that a baby, a nine-year-old and a 12-year-old were admitted to the ICU as a result of their Covid diagnosis.
All of the children have underlying health conditions.
Health officer Dr Jeremy McAnulty said the three children in ICU were “in context” of approximately 2000 people being cared for by the Children’s Hospital network.
NSW reported 1485 new Covid cases on Sunday and three deaths. The deaths included a 50-year-old woman with no obvious underlying health conditions who had received one vaccine dose.
Premier Gladys Berejiklian is set to release modelling as early as today showing case numbers peaking in the next two weeks, before hospitalisations increase into October.
It comes after authorities again pushed back a deadline for residents of hotspot local government areas to have at least one vaccine dose in order to leave their area for work.
Those residents will now have until September 19 to get their first dose of vaccine if their job requires them to leave their LGA.
It is the second time the vaccination deadline has been pushed back and comes amid claims from unions that thousands of critical staff would be prevented from going to work because they have not been able to book their first dose.
All authorised workers will need to have made a booking by Wednesday to get their jab before the new deadline.
Meanwhile, Federal Health Minister Greg Hunt has announced that vulnerable unvaccinated Australians will be individually approached by GPs to get a jab.
Mr Hunt said as the country edged towards 70 per cent first-dose coverage, the nationwide push to vaccinate “pockets of disadvantage” would ensure the most vulnerable groups were protected ahead of reopening.
New information released by NSW Health has also revealed that of the Covid cases reported in the week to August 21, more than 10 per cent had been admitted to hospital.
The hospitalisation rate of 11 per cent is almost double the figure offered by Premier Gladys Berejiklian last week, when she said the “most recent figure … was five and a half per cent”.
The Premier’s office could not say when the Premier was advised of a 5.5 per cent hospitalisation rate.
Sixty additional paramedics will hit the roads from September 11 in an attempt to bolster the faltering NSW Ambulance workforce. But NSW Health Services Union secretary Gerard Hayes said that figure is less than half of what is required.

Full text: Federal Health Minister Greg Hunt has reassured Australian parents the government's decision to vaccinate 12-to-15-year-olds is based on the best health advice and will get kids back to school sooner, after a British expert group recommended against vaccinating healthy adolescents.
A week after Australia approved vaccination of children as young as 12, the UK's Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation said the benefits of doing so were only "marginally greater than the potential known harms".
"It is not within the JCVI's remit to consider the wider societal impacts of vaccination, including educational benefits," the body noted in a decision that shocked experts and which is at odds with moves by Australia, the US, Canada, Israel and many European countries to vaccinate children 12 and over.
UK Health Minister Sajid Javid and his counterparts in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland have written to the chief medical officers asking for further advice, "including on educational impacts", and the decision could be reversed in matter of days or weeks.
The UK decision came as Australia's equivalent body, the Therapeutic Goods Administration (TGA), yesterday approved Moderna's vaccine for use by children as young as 12. It is the second vaccine after Pfizer to be approved by the TGA and the final hurdle - approval by the Australian Technical Advisory Group on Immunisation - is expected to be cleared later this week.
Mr Hunt said the rollout of Moderna and Pfizer to 12-to-15-year-olds would "offer them the best protection possible from COVID-19 and help get them back into classrooms safely, as soon as possible". "Australian parents can be confident in the decisions taken by, in our view, the best medical regulators in the world, the TGA and ATAGI," he said.
The Doherty Institute modelled how to begin reopening Australia - while maintaining non-lockdown health measures such as masks - when 70 and then 80 per cent of over-16s were vaccinated.
"Vaccinating 12-to-15-year-olds is over and above what was presumed in the Doherty modelling," Mr Hunt noted. "This is an important next step, vaccinations for all 12-to-15-year-olds will open on the 13th of September and have already been available for immunocompromised children, children with disabilities and Indigenous kids from early August."
TGA head Professor John Skerritt said the approval of the Moderna vaccine for children aged 12 and older was based on "evidence of strong ability for these vaccines to raise just as good if not stronger immunological responses as it does in young adults and older groups".
Professor Skerritt pointed out the UK government had ordered a review of the JCVI decision and "we may hear a different decision coming from [the] UK in the coming week".
University of Sydney infectious diseases paediatrician Professor Robert Booy said the UK was still recommending vaccination for the five to 10 per cent of children in the UK who had an underlying condition or increased risk.
Professor Booy said most children aged 12 to15 would only experience mild COVID if they contracted it and that Australia - and other nations - should focus on "how can we better control this virus".
"If we vaccinate our near neighbour [countries] we would reduce the risk of an 'end-of-the-world' mutation [of the virus] as it would not be spreading like wildfire," he said.
Nigel Curtis, an infectious disease physician at the Murdoch Children's Research Institute, said the JCVI's advice underscored the "complexity of the decisions" about vaccination.

Full text: A RESEARCH institute says a federal government blueprint to reopen Australia is flawed and could result in 40,000 Covid infections daily.
The Australia Institute believes modelling by the Doherty Institute treats Australia as a country without borders.
Richard Denniss, pictured, chief economist at The Australia Institute, said the modelling does not take into account the effect of opening borders of high case number states, such as NSW and Victoria.
It warns that “letting the virus rip” by opening borders at an 80 per cent vaccination rate of eligible people will put some nine million people at risk of catching the virus, including five million children. The analysis predicts that if the nation lifts border restrictions when 80 per cent of adults have been vaccinated “it is likely that by early next year around 40,000 Australians per day will be infected with Covid-19”. While national cabinet initially agreed with a staged plan to lift restrictions as vaccination rates hit 70 per cent then 80 per cent, premiers in Western Australia and Queensland are now distancing themselves from it.

Full text: For locked-down Australians, press conferences with premiers (and chief ministers) have been appointment viewing in the most dramatic days of the COVID-19 pandemic.
We tune in to hear the "number", the latest news on tightening or easing restrictions, the speculation on when treasured freedoms might be returned.
They're watched like theatre or sport.
Before all of this, the politically engaged relied on the nightly news or a few quotes in print or digital news to keep abreast of their local leaders' movements.
Now they, together with the previously incurious, are watching those same leaders address the public for 45 minutes a day, raw and unfiltered. There to be judged.
'The pick of the lot' Andrew Barr has been a member of the ACT Legislative Assembly for more than 15 years - Chief Minister for nearly seven - and has led Labor to two territory election wins. He was ever-present through the Black Summer fire season, when livestreamed daily press conferences become the norm, and then as the pandemic took hold not long after.
But for many Canberrans, these past three weeks under lockdown have been their most intense interaction with the 48-year-old boss of the ACT's Labor-Greens government.
So what have they seen and learnt about this politician, hailed as a highly intelligent, progressive powerhouse by his supporters, and considered by his detractors as stubborn, arrogant and out of touch with average people?
How has he performed compared to Victorian Premier Daniel Andrews, who developed a cult-like following through a 120-day run of press conferences amid his state's second wave, or NSW leader Gladys Berejiklian, the one-time "gold standard" of COVID management now being blamed for unleashing Delta on the nation?
For Andrew Hughes, an expert in marketing and political communication at the Australian National University, Barr has proven the best of the lot when it comes to fronting the cameras.
"He's taken the politics and the fear out of the messaging," Hughes says.
The daily press conference, livestreamed at 11.45am from a small room on the second floor of ACT Health's Woden headquarters, allows Barr and his team to explain to the public how they are handling Canberra's most serious outbreak of the pandemic.
This has been a very ACT government-style response - for good and bad.
This government is, for its flaws, generally competent. Its leaders - in politics and public health - have projected a sense of genuine calm and assuredness, despite the apparent severity of the situation.
More than 300 cases have been reported since the virus re-entered the Canberra community for the first time in more than a year on August 12.
Can you imagine how Mark McGowan, or even Steven Marshall, would react if that number of cases emerged in Western Australia or South Australia?
The ACT government knows its audience, too. It appreciates that Canberrans are as curious and thirsty for explanation as they are for basic information.
The explanation from Barr, chief health officer Kerryn Coleman and Health Minister Rachel Stephen-Smith about the purpose of the lockdown in those anxious first few days was as clear and understandable as any provided by an Australian government in the past 18 months.
The importance of this, in calming a community which had been virus-free for so long, shouldn't be understated.
Where others, like NSW Health Minister Brad Hazzard and Victorian chief health officer Brett Sutton, have anthropomorphised the Delta strain as a "beast" or a monster, the ACT's leaders have described it as what it is - a highly infectious, in some cases deadly, disease, which mustn't be allowed to spread through a largely unvaccinated population.
Hughes says that where leaders such as McGowan and Berejiklian have relied on muscular "my way or the highway" rhetoric, the ACT's leaders have adopted more "engaged, inclusive" language.
"Barr turns up, yes he's the leader, but at the same time he doesn't overdo it or overcook it," Hughes says.
"There is a danger when you use pressers for political messaging. People then might start to ask questions that you don't want them to ask - like, 'Why are you being so firm, why are you being so cagey?'
"Look at Berejiklian. Look at how confrontational those press conferences have become."
Ironically, Canberra's outbreak has elevated Barr into a position of prominence in the national debate over Australia's road out of the pandemic.
Unlike other Labor premiers, such as McGowan or Queensland's Anastacia Palaszczuk, Barr has used his megaphone to call for a nuanced debate on the national cabinet's highly contentious plan.
He's advocated for the vaccination of adolescents, without overhyping - or outright fearmongering - about the threats of Delta to younger people. He's urged caution about the Doherty Institute modelling, without trying to discredit or undermine it.
His strongest criticisms have been reserved for Berejiklian and her refusal to lock Sydney down harder and earlier, and for the "alpha-male" behaviour of unnamed figures in the federal government.
Oh, and then there was "poo-gate" with John Barilaro.
A fine line to walk The ACT has at each step prioritised public health over satisfying public curiosity - with mixed results.
Barr provoked both praise and outrage when he dismissed the question of how the virus re-entered the capital as "entirely unimportant" in the first days of lockdown. Having the answer, which remains elusive three weeks on, would not have assisted in the immediate task of containing the outbreak, Barr contended.
When a cluster of cases emerged in Canberra's disability community, key stakeholders were kept in the dark for days. The general public wasn't alerted for even longer.
Facing outrage from sections of the disability sector, Stephen-Smith insisted that there would have been no "public health benefit" in immediately alerting sector stakeholders, because those directly involved had been contacted.
Disclosing such information, even the very basics, might not have helped contain the cluster. But transparency helps build and retain public trust, which will become increasingly crucial for the government and the public health response as the lockdown rolls on.
The ACT government and its agencies have in the past demonstrated a propensity to hide information, too often under the pretence of personal privacy or confidentiality.
This will need to be watched closely.
Outbursts and empathy More than three years have passed since Barr was secretly recorded describing his hatred of journalists and disdain for mainstream media.
The national media storm which erupted after those comments were leaked and published proved a decisive moment in his political career. In an interview with The Canberra Times ahead of last year's election, Barr admitted to having taken a "good hard look" at himself after those comments.
The Chief Minister has, unquestionably, mellowed and matured. The skin is not nearly as thin as it once was.
But there has been the rare outburst throughout the pandemic, occurring often enough for detractors to believe Barr hasn't changed.
His extraordinary tirade at the Real Estate Institute of ACT after it criticised the rate rebate scheme brought in at the height of the first shutdown springs to mind.
He's also fired a few shots at Liberal senator Zed Seselja, who's assumed a pseudo opposition leader's role during the latest outbreak.
After talking up his "productive working relationship" with federal Treasurer Josh Frydenberg earlier this week, Barr snidely remarked: "Senators can sometimes get in the way."
The run of press conferences has also demonstrated that empathy, or at least the capacity to demonstrate it publicly, does not come naturally to Barr. Take, for example, his response to the residential construction sector's desperate pleas last Sunday morning to be allowed to reopen.
The Chief Minister would have known the question was coming at the 11.45am press conference. He could have expressed sincere, heartfelt empathy for the family-run businesses hit hard by the lockdown, before assuring them that it was essential to keeping them and the wider community safe.
Instead, he bluntly declared he wouldn't be swayed by people who sign petitions or "thump the table".
His stance was reasonable - that public health should trump economic interests - but his messaging was insensitive, if not arrogant.
This was Barr at his worst.
The Chief Minister is lucky that this weakness is among the biggest strengths of his offsiders in the pandemic response, Stephen-Smith and Coleman.

Where was the evidence, the actual evidence, to justify the prolonged closure of the residential construction sector? Why were people left in quarantine longer than they needed to be? Why have our contact tracers been unable to identify the source of so many cases?
All important questions, all in need of answers.
But limited to the spotlight of the daily press conference, Barr and his team have performed exceptionally well.
Perhaps, even, without peer in this pandemic.

Where we're at on jabs and kids

Full text: The COVID-19 vaccine rollout has prioritised adults. Sherryn Groch looks at what the science says so far about protecting children.
The experiment was every parent's worst nightmare - but it transformed medicine. In 1796, English doctor Edward Jenner deliberately exposed an eight-year-old boy to one of the worst plagues of the era: smallpox. Jenner had observed that milkmaids suffering from its less dangerous cousin, cowpox, tended not to catch smallpox. So he took pus from a cowpox lesion and scratched it into the arm of his gardener's son. The boy felt a little sick but quickly recovered.
Next, Jenner exposed him to the real thing: smallpox. This time the boy didn't get sick at all. Jenner had just invented what is considered the first vaccine. Two centuries later, smallpox became the first human disease driven into extinction thanks to mass vaccination.
Fortunately, safety standards and delivery methods have come a long way, but vaccines still work largely the same way. Instead of waiting for you to catch a pathogen to develop immunity, a vaccine trains your body to make virus-fighting antibodies exposing you to a tiny (and, these days, harmless) part of the virus.
While children have been the focus of most vaccination campaigns, in the case of the world's latest pandemic they are mostly last in line. That's because, unlike many past plagues, kids have a much lower chance of dying from COVID-19 than older people. And, unlike in 1796, vaccine trials on children are now usually conducted after those on adults, as dosages and other safety factors are considered with more caution.
While millions of teenagers have already had their COVID shots around the world - from the mRNA vaccines by Pfizer and Moderna in the US to a new needle-free DNA shot in India - trials for younger children, from six months to 12 years, are still under way. Many parents now hope the vaccines will help get their children back to school safely.
What do we know from trials so far?
Doctors aren't quite sure why children seem to be mostly spared the worst of COVID-19, but the numbers tell the story all around the world. Out of the more than 130,000 people who died of COVID-19 in Britain during the first year of the pandemic, for example, just 25 of them were children. That makes weighing up the risks against the benefits of a COVID-19 vaccine in children especially delicate. For any shot to make it through approvals, the risk you may face from the unintended side effects must be a lot lower than the risk from the pathogen itself.
Australian children already have high vaccination coverage against disease, with about 95 per cent getting their recommended shots. "We know it saves lives," says paediatric immunologist Professor Peter Richmond.
Many past plagues, such as polio and the 2009 swine flu, have hit children hard. "For the last one, swine flu, initial vaccine studies looked at children at the same time as adults," says Richmond, who is head of the vaccine trials group at the Telethon Kids Institute. "But with COVID, kids are not as big a concern, so we could wait till we had more data."
So far, so good. Teenagers in wealthy nations such as the US and Canada have been widely vaccinated and received very high protection against COVID without raising major safety concerns. In March, Pfizer claimed its vaccine was 100 per cent effective in those aged 12 to 15, based on an unpublished clinical trial of 2260 adolescents. (No teen vaccinated in the trial got COVID.) In May, Moderna announced its shot, which uses the same mRNA technology, was 96 per cent effective at stopping the disease in those aged between 12 and 17 after just one dose and, as with Pfizer, did not have any serious safety concerns. Australia's medical regulator, the Therapeutic Goods Administration, has pored over the data for Pfizer and, in July, it followed the US, Canada and other countries in expanding its approved use to 12 to 15-year-olds as well as those 16 and over. (Moderna, which was approved for adults only recently in Australia, is likely to also be approved for 12 to 15-year-olds soon.)
Children and teens generally respond very well to vaccines and the COVID-19 shots don't look to be an exception, Richmond says. "In trials, the 12-15s made even more antibodies [to kill the virus] than young adults."
What about younger kids?
While 12 to 15-year-olds could receive the same dose of vaccine as adults, researchers are trialling the right amount for young children. With their smaller bodies, and immune systems that seem better prepared to fight off a case of COVID-19 than adults' systems, experts think they should still get strong protection from a smaller dose, hopefully with fewer side effects.
"We're generally more cautious about checking how children tolerate vaccines," Richmond says. "Sometimes we'll start with a lower dose and slowly ramp it up to get the ideal protection."
In the Pfizer and Moderna trials, the first group of children vaccinated get the lowest dose, about a third the strength of the adult dose, and are monitored closely before it is slowly increased in the next group.
Data from those trials is expected to land before the US medical regulator in October or November, and experts expect children under 12 there will be offered vaccines before the end of the year.
"Once it's approved there, it could happen here and in Europe fairly quickly," says Richmond. "I expect we'll see Australian children vaccinated next year. It depends if they have to adjust the dose [in terms of] production and distribution."
AstraZeneca's own small trial in children was put on ice after the vaccine was linked to rare cases of a clotting condition called TTS in adults around the world, especially younger adults.
"If Astra was the only vaccine that we had, I'm sure we'd be running big trials in kids, but we're being conservative," Richmond says.
Meanwhile, China has already approved its own vaccines, Sinopharm and Sinovac, for children aged between three and 17 after early trials raised no safety concerns. Russia has been trialling its Sputnik V vaccine on young people.
What about side effects?
Mild side effects are common for most vaccines. They're caused by your immune system responding to the shot. When your body spots an invading pathogen (or, in this case, a vaccine dressed up to look like one), its first generic line of defence - known as the innate immune system - goes into battle. This takes care of most nasties and buys your body time to develop its second adaptive response - making antibodies designed to gum up and stop the specific virus in its tracks, as well as killer T-cells that will hunt down infected cells.
COVID-19 vaccines introduce a tiny piece of the virus, the spike protein it uses to hack into our cells, to trip this immune response without infecting you. The spike can't hurt you and the vaccine will leave your system fast. But if the virus shows up for real, your body will have learnt how to kill it quickly.
Everyone's response is a little different. While over 90 per cent of adults in Pfizer and Moderna trials developed immunity against COVID-19, some people barely got a sore arm while others felt sick. Our immune systems tend to peak in high school with puberty, Richmond says, so young people often have a stronger innate response compared with older groups.
If there is a more serious side effect from a vaccine, it generally comes down to how our immune system has reacted too, and so it will show up early, within the first few months. "That's why we don't expect long-term side effects," Richmond says.
As for rare complications, the scale and speed of the vaccine rollout means more adverse events are being picked up even faster than normal. "These vaccines have been tested and monitored so intensely, the fact there's been so few problems, including in adults and teens, is remarkable."
While kids are unlikely to get the AstraZeneca product linked to clotting syndrome TTS, the mRNA vaccines have been linked, in small numbers, to heart inflammation. This has been reported in teens as well as adults, mostly in young men, "but still at a slightly lower rate in adolescents than the young adults", Richmond says. The condition is generally mild. "This inflammation can already happen in that young adult/teen age group when they get a viral infection," Richmond says. "But it doesn't seem to happen in much younger children, so I don't expect it to be as much of an issue in under-12s."
For children, he says, there can be a concern the vaccine (or the virus itself) will trigger an overreaction of the immune system. In rare cases, fevers can get so hot, or change so rapidly, that it triggers convulsions in a small number of young children, generally those under five. This usually doesn't cause lasting damage but will be watched for. In 2010, Australia's seasonal flu shot had to be reformulated after it triggered a significant spike in these rare febrile convulsions among young children. Pregnant women and breastfeeding mothers, meanwhile, can be vaccinated without any harm to their babies, Richmond says.
But do we need to vaccinate kids?
Decisions to vaccinate children come down to discussions between parents and doctors, but almost all experts agree kids should get the shot if trials give the all-clear. The question is when they will be able to. While other groups at higher risk from COVID-19 remain unvaccinated due to limited supply around the world, Richmond says it's right for kids to stay a lower priority.
Parents are understandably concerned. "But the epidemiology has been that the younger you are, the less likely you are to end up with severe disease in hospital," he says. Of course, there are still children who do get sick. "And, if enough children get infected, some will end up in intensive care."
The Delta variant of the virus is at least twice as infectious as the original strain and that means everyone, including children, has a higher chance of catching it. As scientists warn it is becoming "a pandemic of the unvaccinated", some fear the virus will begin to mutate again to better infect children. "It may become more of a disease of children," Richmond says. "We need to be prepared for that. That's why it's important we do the studies now so that if it does shift and hit kids harder, we will be ready with data [to safely vaccinate them]."
National cabinet has agreed to start reopening Australia when 70 and 80 per cent of people aged 16 and over are fully vaccinated. At those levels, modelling by the Doherty Institute suggests public health measures apart from lockdowns, such as testing, tracing and quarantine, will be enough to contain outbreaks. But experts are quick to point out that, with children left out, those targets represent just 56 per cent of the total population.
It is unclear how big a role children play in the spread of the virus. The science seems to suggest so far that outbreaks in schools are fuelled more by outbreaks in the community.
Vaccinating kids faster could speed up their return to classrooms, after long hard months of home learning. But many experts say the risks to children from the virus are too low to justify it right now, while so many people in poorer parts of the world wait on vaccines. Rich nations hoarding early supplies means it's likely much of the developing world will be unvaccinated for some time, leaving the virus another open window to evolve.

Full text: It was another day of big numbers, big promises and some muscularity from people in tailored businesswear around the nation.
The focus was largely on the east coast (surprise, surprise). The sizeable numbers came from NSW and Victoria; the promises from, well, NSW and Victoria; and the muscularity from, well, really, in varying degrees, all the eastern states.
Queensland Premier Annastacia Palaszczuk's day revolved around kids. She refused to commit to immediately easing COVID-19 restrictions when her state hits the magical 70 and 80 per cent vaccination goals. And it's because she's waiting on the prime minister to provide modelling on what will happen to kids up to 12 years of age if restrictions are eased at that point.
Ms Palaszczuk's mood was probably not enhanced when federal Health Minister Greg Hunt chose to quote her own health department's report about COVID and kids back to her.
And that was after he'd labelled Queensland's strict border policy a "profound moral failure" after revelations a three-year-old boy was living on a NSW cattle station, separated from his parents.
Memphis Francis went to visit his grandparents place in the NSW Riverina back in July and has been there ever since, News Limited revealed. But no longer. The exemption his family said hasn't been previously granted now has. Oh, the magic of media.
Which is probably a nice segue into the advice of Victoria's chief psychiatrist today. Neil Coventry reassured us that it was OK to feel confused and uncertain and that life now was particularly challenging for children and teenagers, who had spent much of the past 18 months learning from home.
He encouraged parents to talk to their kids about coping, encouraged them to exercise and was "very pleased" playgrounds in Victoria will reopen from Friday. Probably not quite as pleased as parents, though.
There were rewards on offer in NSW, too - for the jabbed, that is. People in hotspots can leave home for longer than an hour now NSW has hit its 70 per cent first vax target. Make it to 80 per cent and even more treats, the Premier promised.
The government has flagged that at 70 per cent double-dose coverage, vaccinated people can expect to go out for a meal and attend public events. Oh, and from Friday small weddings will again be permitted in NSW, but the list of caveats is about as long as your average 1980 bridal train.

Full text: Whatever your view of restrictions, the state government abandoning the dream of COVID zero might have left you feeling the sacrifices we've made since last year have been for nothing.
But it has not been a waste. Our collective efforts have saved many thousands of lives and those Australians still living in relative freedom in other states can partly thank Victorians for that.
Burnet Institute modelling found that lockdown six has prevented more than 6000 local COVID cases. But our greatest achievement remains the scenario that we avoided in 2020. If we'd seen deaths then at a similar rate to Britain's, there could have been roughly 15,000 socially distanced funerals.

Feds muscle up on borders

Full text: Attorney-General Michaelia Cash has warned state governments that their constitutional power to shut borders will diminish once the nation hits an 80 per cent vaccination rate, as premiers with low Covid-19 infections defend the need to lock out interstate arrivals.
Senator Cash said the legal ­arguments that led the High Court to block billionaire Clive Palmer’s push to tear down the West Australian border were shifting, as a coalition of the nation’s largest employers urged governments to work together to ease restrictions once 70 to 80 per cent of Australians were jabbed.
West Australian Premier Mark McGowan on Tuesday argued that he had to keep the option to close borders — even when the rest of the nation hit the 80 per cent vaccine threshold — as ­“hundreds of people (would) die” if he introduced the Delta strain into his state.
The High Court ruled last ­November that Mr McGowan’s state border closure was proportionate due to public health reasons. Chief Justice Susan Kiefel and Justice Patrick Keane singled out the lack of Covid-19 vaccines and treatments at the time.
Senator Cash — the most senior West Australian in the Morrison government — told The Australian it would be much harder for states to defend a hard border closure as reasonable and necessary by the time 80 per cent of Australian adults were vaccinated. “Once you hit 80 per cent, you are in a fundamentally different position if you are looking at the issue of proportionality,” Senator Cash said.
“When you look at the reasons for that decision, flowing from the Clive Palmer vs WA case, the issue of proportionality was a live issue … we did not know where the virus was going, it was considered a proportional response to Covid-19.
“We now have the benefits of 12 months or thereabouts, but we also have the benefit of the vaccine. Now that can only be tested in the High Court, obviously, but based on the reasons for that decision in that initial case, and based on where we are now in relation to the vaccine and vaccination rates, one would now think the grounds of any argument has now shifted.” Senator Cash said the government was not considering court action and would do nothing to jeopardise the four-step national plan, but there were expectations Mr Palmer or others could make another attempt to overturn state border closures through the courts.
The Attorney-General’s comments came as Australia’s largest employers – including the banks, telcos, airlines and grocerychains – threw their support behind the national cabinet plan, penning an open letter in The Australian and other newspapers backing the 70 and 80 per cent vaccine targets and phasing out lockdowns.
Signed by chief executives from 80 of the nation’s biggest companies, the letter says Australia must “open up society and live with the virus in the same way that other countries have done”.
“We need to stay the course,” it says. “Informed by modelling from the Doherty Institute, it (the national plan) balances the risks from Covid in a more vaccinated population, with the risks of indefinitely keeping our country divided and cut off from the world, our children out of schools, our friends apart from loved ones, and our small businesses closed.
“We ask governments to work together to implement the national plan and chart a path out of the current lockdowns. Providing a light at the end of the tunnel will encourage more Australians to get vaccinated. We need to give people something to hope for.” The open letter was signed by companies employing almost one million Australians, including the Commonwealth Bank, NAB, Qantas, Telstra, Optus, AGL, Woolworths, Coles, Uber, BHP and Origin.
The campaign, led by the Business Council of Australia, comes after Josh Frydenberg called on the private sector to “beat the drum” and put pressure on wavering states and territories and as Scott Morrison on Tuesday conceded it was a matter for the states when to drop hard border restrictions. “Ultimately everything is a state matter,” the Prime Minister said. “It all ­depends where their vaccination levels have risen to. So, if you have NSW or Tasmania … well above 70 per cent, and you have other states that are below 70 per cent, well, the national plan doesn’t provide for them to move into Phase B (of the national plan). It’s all a matter of where they’re at any given time.” The Morrison government came under attack from Mr McGowan and federal Labor last year when then-attorney-general Christian Porter intervened in Mr Palmer’s High Court case. Mr Morrison made the call to withdraw the commonwealth from the stoush.
Senator Cash said she hoped to work with state governments when the vaccine thresholds were passed, making any legal fights over state borders unnecessary.
“My preference is very much to work with the state of Western Australia,” she said.
“We’re not at 70 per cent. We’re not at 80 per cent. So those considerations are not on the table. Let’s get to 70 per cent. Let’s get to 80 per cent.” Senator Cash said WA could not relax its border measures at the 70 per cent interval due to its lack of Covid-19 community transmission, but said the 80 per cent vaccine threshold would have to change the strategy of the Labor McGowan government.
“The issue we are now confronted with as a state is if not at 80 per cent, when?” she said.
“Most West Australians would say it’s great for the rest of the country to open up at 70 per cent but they are still going to be behind WA … Once you move to 80 per cent though, you’re playing on a different field.” Mr McGowan and Queensland Labor Premier Annastacia Palaszczuk, Tasmanian Liberal Premier Peter Gutwein and South Australian Liberal Premier Steven Marshall have all voiced concerns about the consequences of opening up when their states are still relatively Covid-19 free.
Mr McGowan said on Facebook on Tuesday that his state border regime might need to exist for “a few months” before he was willing to see Covid-19 introduced back into WA.
“When it is safe to do so we will open the borders — when an overwhelming majority of our population has been vaccinated,” Mr McGowan wrote.
“We will get there — it might only be a difference of a few months — but in the meantime, it’s worth trying to keep Covid out for as long as we can.”

“My preference is very much to work with the state of Western Australia,” she said.
“We’re not at 70 per cent. We’re not at 80 per cent. So those considerations are not on the table. Let’s get to 70 per cent. Let’s get to 80 per cent.” Senator Cash said WA could not relax its border measures at the 70 per cent interval due to its lack of Covid-19 community transmission, but said the 80 per cent vaccine threshold would have to change the strategy of the Labor McGowan government.
“The issue we are now confronted with as a state is if not at 80 per cent, when?” she said.
“Most West Australians would say it’s great for the rest of the country to open up at 70 per cent but they are still going to be behind WA … Once you move to 80 per cent though, you’re playing on a different field.” Mr McGowan and Queensland Labor Premier Annastacia Palaszczuk, Tasmanian Liberal Premier Peter Gutwein and South Australian Liberal Premier Steven Marshall have all voiced concerns about the consequences of opening up when their states are still relatively Covid-19 free.
Mr McGowan said on Facebook on Tuesday that his state border regime might need to exist for “a few months” before he was willing to see Covid-19 introduced back into WA.
“When it is safe to do so we will open the borders — when an overwhelming majority of our population has been vaccinated,” Mr McGowan wrote. “We will get there — it might only be a difference of a few months — but in the meantime, it’s worth trying to keep Covid out for as long as we can.”

Full text: Attorney-General Michaelia Cash has warned state governments that their constitutional power to shut borders will diminish once the nation hits an 80 per cent vaccination rate, as premiers with low Covid-19 infections defend the need to lock out interstate arrivals.
Senator Cash said the legal ­arguments that led the High Court to block billionaire Clive Palmer’s push to tear down the West Australian border were shifting, as a coalition of the nation’s largest employers urged governments to work together to ease restrictions once 70 to 80 per cent of Australians were jabbed.
West Australian Premier Mark McGowan on Tuesday argued that he had to keep the option to close borders — even when the rest of the nation hit the 80 per cent vaccine threshold — as ­“hundreds of people (would) die” if he introduced the Delta strain into his state.
The High Court ruled last ­November that Mr McGowan’s state border closure was proportionate due to public health reasons. Chief Justice Susan Kiefel and Justice Patrick Keane singled out the lack of Covid-19 vaccines and treatments at the time.
Senator Cash — the most senior West Australian in the Morrison government — told The Australian it would be much harder for states to defend a hard border closure as reasonable and necessary by the time 80 per cent of Australian adults were vaccinated. “Once you hit 80 per cent, you are in a fundamentally different position if you are looking at the issue of proportionality,” Senator Cash said.
“When you look at the reasons for that decision, flowing from the Clive Palmer vs WA case, the issue of proportionality was a live issue … we did not know where the virus was going, it was considered a proportional response to Covid-19.
“We now have the benefits of 12 months or thereabouts, but we also have the benefit of the vaccine. Now that can only be tested in the High Court, obviously, but based on the reasons for that decision in that initial case, and based on where we are now in relation to the vaccine and vaccination rates, one would now think the grounds of any argument has now shifted.” Senator Cash said the government was not considering court action and would do nothing to jeopardise the four-step national plan, but there were expectations Mr Palmer or others could make another attempt to overturn state border closures through the courts.
The Attorney-General’s comments came as Australia’s largest employers – including the banks, telcos, airlines and grocerychains – threw their support behind the national cabinet plan, penning an open letter in The Australian and other newspapers backing the 70 and 80 per cent vaccine targets and phasing out lockdowns.
Signed by chief executives from 80 of the nation’s biggest companies, the letter says Australia must “open up society and live with the virus in the same way that other countries have done”.
“We need to stay the course,” it says. “Informed by modelling from the Doherty Institute, it (the national plan) balances the risks from Covid in a more vaccinated population, with the risks of indefinitely keeping our country divided and cut off from the world, our children out of schools, our friends apart from loved ones, and our small businesses closed.
“We ask governments to work together to implement the national plan and chart a path out of the current lockdowns. Providing a light at the end of the tunnel will encourage more Australians to get vaccinated. We need to give people something to hope for.” The open letter was signed by companies employing almost one million Australians, including the Commonwealth Bank, NAB, Qantas, Telstra, Optus, AGL, Woolworths, Coles, Uber, BHP and Origin.
The campaign, led by the Business Council of Australia, comes after Josh Frydenberg called on the private sector to “beat the drum” and put pressure on wavering states and territories and as Scott Morrison on Tuesday conceded it was a matter for the states when to drop hard border restrictions. “Ultimately everything is a state matter,” the Prime Minister said. “It all ­depends where their vaccination levels have risen to. So, if you have NSW or Tasmania … well above 70 per cent, and you have other states that are below 70 per cent, well, the national plan doesn’t provide for them to move into Phase B (of the national plan). It’s all a matter of where they’re at any given time.” The Morrison government came under attack from Mr McGowan and federal Labor last year when then-attorney-general Christian Porter intervened in Mr Palmer’s High Court case. Mr Morrison made the call to withdraw the commonwealth from the stoush.
Senator Cash said she hoped to work with state governments when the vaccine thresholds were passed, making any legal fights over state borders unnecessary.
“My preference is very much to work with the state of Western Australia,” she said.
“We’re not at 70 per cent. We’re not at 80 per cent. So those considerations are not on the table. Let’s get to 70 per cent.

Business backs PM's call on reopening

Full text: Business groups are warning state and territory leaders that continuing to lock down once 70 to 80 per cent of the eligible population is vaccinated against COVID-19 will cause more economic damage and job losses.
The Business Council of Australia, Australian Chamber of Commerce and Industry, Council of Small Business Organisations Australia and Ai Group have all backed the federal government's push to allow extra freedoms when the country achieves 70 per cent coverage and the end of lockdowns at 80 per cent. This position is based on Doherty Institute modelling.
However, disagreement has been growing between the federal government and some state and territory leaders over when lockdowns and interstate border closures should be lifted as Delta cases continue to grow in NSW and Victoria.
Some state leaders are concerned about the national plan to "live with the virus" and the ability for health systems to cope as more people are infected once restrictions are relaxed. But Prime Minister Scott Morrison and Treasurer Josh Frydenberg have warned the economic and mental health costs from shutting down outweigh the benefits when vaccination rates exceed these targets.
Mr Frydenberg said it would be a "ridiculous" situation if somebody could travel to Canada before they could go to Cairns in far north Queensland.
"We must end stringent lockdowns and border closures when we reach 70 to 80 per cent vaccination rates, as agreed to at national cabinet," he said yesterday.
BCA chief executive Jennifer Westacott urged state leaders to stick to national reopening targets.
"We need certainty now, and we back the Prime Minister's call to stick to the numbers and develop a detailed plan to reach the targets," Ms Westacott said. "At 70 per cent, we need to start removing the high-cost restrictions holding back the economy. At 80 per cent, statewide lockdowns and border restrictions should be unnecessary.
"Australian businesses, whether they are big or small, cannot continue to deal with the what-ifs and maybes - that's no way to plan the reopening of the economy."
ACCI chief executive Andrew McKellar said businesses had demonstrated their willingness to listen to health advice and work with the government.
"We urge governments to commit to limiting lockdowns once vaccination targets are achieved unless community transmission is putting pressure on healthcare systems," Mr McKellar said.
He said businesses needed confidence and clarity on when easing restrictions would be possible.
COSBOA interim chief executive Alexi Boyd said lockdowns should have ended "yesterday".
"It's unfair on businesses to have this confusion, lack of planning," Ms Boyd said.
She said until the Doherty Institute modelling was released, there had been nothing to work towards.
"It's great we've now got this. It's imperative all states work together to support the reopening as fast as we can," she said.
Ai Group chief executive Innes Willox said more clarity was needed about the reopening of interstate borders and whether it was linked to national or individual states' vaccination targets.
"We need to avoid going down the nightmare track of creating eight different state and territory health pass apps and instead have national-cabinet-agreed consistency," Mr Willox said.

Full text: The debate about when Australia should emerge from lockdown is currently dominated by advice from health experts, but the mounting economic costs of lockdowns will and should play an increasingly important role.
At the moment, there is a strong consensus to maintain lockdowns to buy time until a sufficient share of the population is vaccinated. The alternative would be an overwhelmed hospital system and a much higher death toll because the moderately sick would not receive essential care.
Yet once Australia's vaccination rate rises closer to the levels of those in Europe and the United States, an even more difficult debate must begin about how quickly to relax restrictions.
The federal government has asked states to implement a plan endorsed by the national cabinet and underpinned by modelling by the Doherty Institute.
The model forecasts that after 70 or 80 per cent of the eligible population is vaccinated, we should be able to reopen slowly without overwhelming the hospital system and with only a modest death toll.
Many people question the Doherty model and argue the threshold for reopening should be higher or hospitals will be swamped, as is occurring in many states in the US.
Prime Minister Scott Morrison has suggested state premiers who refuse to open at 80 per cent vaccination rates are "croods", a reference to a 2013 animated film about cavemen who are too scared to come out of their safe hole in the ground.
Every jurisdiction in the world is struggling with this difficult debate. There is no right answer. It will involve sophisticated modelling and difficult moral choices about how many deaths we are willing to accept.
The economic damage to individuals, businesses and government finances as a result of prolonging lockdown must also figure in the debate.
At some point, the lives saved by lockdowns will be fewer than the lives destroyed by all the social ills that come with economic pain.
The economic reckoning has been mitigated by federal disaster payments to individuals and state-based support for businesses, but many are falling between the cracks.
Many of the costs of lockdowns have not yet shown up in the economic data but retail sales fell 7 per cent in July and "hours worked" fell sharply in NSW. Many economists are predicting the economy will contract this quarter and unemployment will rise.
The recovery is likely to be slower than after the lockdowns last year because the national plan foresees restrictions being maintained for some time. This time, we will be "living with COVID-19", unlike last year, when it was all but eradicated.
Calculating the economic benefit of easing restrictions is very different for Western Australia, Tasmania, Queensland and South Australia - none of whom are currently in lockdown - compared to Victoria and NSW, where people are champing at the bit to open up.
NSW will not suffer if it opens its borders to WA but if WA opens its borders it risks a significant outbreak and reimposition of restrictions. It is understandable if they are more cautious about opening their borders.
The good news is that the rapid pace of the vaccination program offers encouragement that all states will feel comfortable reopening their borders in a reasonable time frame.
The economic pressure for them to reopen will grow with time. Queensland's tourism industry, for instance, will not recover until borders reopen.
It might seem insensitive to even mention the economy when talking about human life, but the high costs of lockdowns must be placed in the balance in deciding when to start relaxing restrictions.

After a week of back and forth between the Federal Government and the states and territories over the vaccination levels required to banish lockdowns, National Cabinet was given another briefing from Doherty Prorofessor Jodie McVernon on the Institute’s draft modelling scenarios.
But National Cabinet was also told that some public measures such as mask wearing, contact tracing and localised ‘moderate restrictions’ will be necessary at between 70 and 80 per cent of vaccination coverage. COVID GUIDE FOR PARENTS P10

Full text: All Australian children aged 12 to 15 will be eligible for a COVID vaccine from next month, after Pfizer was given the green light by the Australian Technical Advisory Group on Immunisation (ATAGI).
But Prime Minister Scott Morrison rejected calls for teenagers to be included in the vaccination targets forming the basis of Australia's path out of COVID restrictions.
The federal government on Thursday accepted recommendations from ATAGI and COVID Taskforce commander Lieutenant-General John Frewen for Pfizer to be administered to all Australians aged 12 to 15. Bookings for that age range will open from September 13.
And with Pfizer supplies increasing after a rocky start to the rollout, Health Minister Greg Hunt was optimistic about uptake in teenagers.
"We are in a position to ensure that all children and all families who seek their children to be vaccinated between the ages of 12 to 15, will be able to do so this year," he said on Friday.
Mr Morrison said state and territory leaders would be briefed on the decision at national cabinet on Friday, and discussions would centre on their participation in the scheme. The states would work through whether and when to open up their mass hubs to children.
"Principally I would see that happening especially through the GP network [initially]. That provides the opportunity for family vaccinations, for the family to go along together across those age groups," he said.
Pfizer was provisionally approved for that age range among immunocompromised children, Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander children, and children in remote areas earlier this month.
Australia's path out of COVID restrictions is based on Doherty Institute modelling, outlining new stages to be triggered at 70 and 80 per cent vaccination of the 16 and over population.
But the Prime Minister rejected suggestions 12- to 15-year-olds would now be folded into the national targets, despite pressure from some jurisdictions.
"The target is about the overall level of vaccination in the adult population, who are the primary transmitters of the virus. So that's the science of that," he said.
"There is no recommendation from any of our medical health advisors to [include children in the targets], and so I don't see the point of that. What I see the point of doing is vaccinating children."
His comments came soon after ATAGI confirmed it had granted provisional approval for the Pfizer vaccine to be administered to all children aged 12 to 15. Approval for another mRNA vaccine, Moderna, was also being worked through.
"Vaccination against COVID-19 is recommended for all individuals from 12 years of age, extending the current recommendation for those aged 16 years and older," ATAGI said in a statement.
"Recommendations on the use of Spikevax (Moderna) for adolescents will be finalised following the decision on provisional registration of Spikevax (Moderna) in this age group."
ATAGI conceded there was uncertainty over teenagers' role in transmitting COVID, but said the virus would increasingly target younger people with a higher proportion of adults vaccinated.
ATAGI said a trial of 2000 children in that age range produced "high level evidence" Pfizer was effective against the virus.
That included an 100 per cent effectiveness against symptoms seven days after children received their second dose. The first dose proved 75 per cent effective.

Full text: Australia is under the heavy burden of two global events which, at their cores, are the same basic quest for freedom.
There is the stumbling race towards Covid-normal - or Covid-zero or getting out of the cinematically-depicted Croods cave - and starkly, there is the deadly, gut-wrenching scenes in Afghanistan as people desperately try to flee the Taliban.
People want out, in both scenarios. When do they want it? Now.
Sadly, the door has closed for remaining people in Afghanistan for whom Australia has obligations. With Islamic State claiming responsibility for twin attacks at Kabul airport that killed more than 70 people, Prime Minister Scott Morrison confirmed Australia's mission that had rescued some 4100 people has come to an end.
Mr Morrison paid tribute to the 13 US military personnel among the dead, saying they had a mission to "protect lives, to save lives, but lost their own in providing a pathway to freedom for others".
Amid the confusion, the government has been unable to confirm whether or not any Australians or visa holders were injured or killed in the attack.
Those left behind await their fate.
Back home, it is a virus randomly killing people, disrupting business and stopping children from going to school.
We all want to find an exit to this pandemic life.
Patience for many wore thin a year ago. It is lockdown number six in Victoria, there seems no end in sight in New South Wales and the ACT is at a precarious point with 21 new infections and more than a handful of those cases infectious in the community.
Individuals and families are doing it tough. Children and parents are being separated amid family-wide Covid infections. Others are risking their lives and others around them by protesting in the name of freedom; ultimately doing an act that will likely lengthen lockdowns.
There are real questions about how Australia's much-vaunted health system is coping and there is desperate concern for Australia's most vulnerable people being put at terrible risk.
Meanwhile, in one of the states lagging in the vaccination race, Queensland, dancing is allowed again after the state recorded no local cases. But each Covid win, as much as we can enjoy them, seems fragile.
We are told, and it is intuitive, the only way out of this is vaccination. But the nation is still trying to vaccinate the most needy.
The first Covid vaccinations are just being opened up for our vulnerable children. All Australian children aged 12 to 15 will be eligible for Pfizer jabs from next month.
Federal Health Minister Greg Hunt says the hope is Australia's "staged, careful" reopening plan, backed by Doherty Institute modelling and agreed to by national cabinet, which has key stages at 70 and 80 per cent of the population (over 16 years) fully vaccinated will work.
How far to go? He says 3 million Australians need to get vaccinated to get to 70 per cent and 5 million are required to get to 80 per cent. With Delta out in the wild, there have been more than 1.8 million vaccinations in the past week.
The Morrison government wants to give hope, but it can't give too much. There won't be any Australian Covid freedom day. Targeted lockdowns, social distancing, booster shots perhaps once a year are all part of our future.
We are learning to live with isolation, the fear of contagion and doing without.
With the repression of attempted suppression, have Covid restrictions changed our way of seeing freedom?
If not, surely the fall of Afghanistan will.

Full text: Knowledge is poower Are fleeing Canberrans to blame for Covid fragments found in Merimbula’s sewage? The NSW Premier’s No 2, John Barilaro, thinks so … even though the NSW coastal town is a three-hour drive south of the locked-down capital. ACT Chief Minister Andrew Barr refused to be the butt of the joke. “I don’t think sewage detection is quite that sophisticated (that) it is able to tell whether it’s a Canberran’s poo or someone else’s,” a craptivated Barr critiqued. “Does John know something about the poo that other people don’t? I mean, if he got scientific evidence that can back it up, that it’s Canberra poo.” Em-poo-rical evidence? “I mean, seriously, I’m just not interested in having whose poo it was arguments with John Barilaro at the moment.” What a shit show! (Which Strewth has titled Poo And A Half Men.) Meanwhile, federal MPs from Annastacia Palaszczuk’s palatial state — including Peter Dutton and Karen from Home Affairs — are locked out of Queensland until at least September 8.
’Tis an ill wind It’s the question you didn’t know you needed answered: can you catch Covid-19 from farts? The ABC’s omniscient Norman Swan told listeners to his Coronacast podcast that yes, you probably can. Hence why the government is testing our waste water for fragments of the virus shed in faeces. Swan warned flatulent Quiet Australians to avoid passing wind “close” to other folk, adding it was important “that you don’t fart with your bottom bare”. Solid advice, pandemic or no.
Presents accounted for There’s certainly an art to looking a diplomatic gift horse in the mouth. Scott Morrison has decided not to keep the mere – a highly prized Maori weapon made of jade – he received during his whirlwind trip to New Zealand in May. The Prime Minister was officially welcomed to Queenstown by Ngai Tahu leader Edward Ellison at a ceremony where Kiwi official Martin Wikaira sang a rendition of Waltzing Matilda in Maori. Morrison was presented with the jade mere, a short flat club shaped like a large tear drop, as a sign of trans-Tasman “unity and togetherness”. It is traditionally used in close hand-to-hand combat … surely it would come in handy for the Liberal partyroom? ScoMo’s mere was valued at $1407.55 by NZ, and therefore exceeded Australia’s gift limit – $750 from government sources and $300 from private or industry sources. In order to keep it, he would be required to pay the dollar difference of $1218.31. Instead, the PM decided to consciously uncouple from the weapon and surrender it to his department, which will decide whether it should be added to the rotation of items on display in his Parliament House office (in case they ever visit) or disposed of. The PM does deserve some credit that the mere made it to PM&C. Over in Washington DC, there’s an “ongoing inquiry” into the disappearance of a $7860 bottle of whisky given to former secretary of state Mike Pompeo by then Japanese prime minister Shinzo Abe in 2019. Mysterious!
Trump up your sleeve The PM obviously didn’t feel as attached to the Kiwi artefact as he did the silver bald eagle cufflinks from Donald Trump or the signed photographs of the Queen and Prince Philip, from QEII herself. He paid $355.30 and $33 respectfully to keep them in his personal possession. Jenny Morrison also forked out $264 to keep a “carved ivory pig tusk bracelet” from the first lady of Vanuatu, Estelle Tallis. Would a proud constitutional monarchist wear one’s bald eagle cufflinks with one’s everyday Australian flag face mask and pin? Or would they clash? Asking for a friend.
They’re fin love Jacinda Ardern’s North Island nuptials are on hold now that NZ is in a national lockdown. Beau-to-be Clark Gayford confirmed the pair, and daughter Neve, have put prep for the summer wedding in Gisborne on “the backburner”. When he’s not starring in Audible ads, NZ’s first fiance has been busy working on his book Fish of the Day, which captures his best travel tips and recipes. Apparently Ardern is actually pretty good with a rod in hand. “Her first cast she got a 14 pound snapper, her very next cast she caught this huge John Dory – and she thought that was what fishing was always like.” No wonder she’s hooked! “I’ve been teaching her how to soft bait and a style of fishing called speed-jigging and she’s very determined when she sets her mind to it.” What a catch!
Point of order Could the farce that is question time sink any further than this? Government whip Rowan Ramsey was two sentences into reading his Dorothy Dixer for Small Business Minister Stuart Robert when he realised something was amiss. “I have asked the wrong question,” Ramsey declared. He was meant to quiz Education Minster Alan Tudge. Close but no cigar. “Sorry, no. You’ve asked the question,” Speaker Tony Smith interrupted. “Yes, it’s probably the clearest illustration that it’s not a question without notice, but anyway…” Laughter ensued. The surprise zinger of the day came from Trade Minister Dan Tehan, who thanked Liberal backbencher Warren Entsch for “asking the right question”. Talk about a low bar! Kudos also to Bob “I never use a computer” Katter, who asked his first remote query without a hitch. More than we can say for Health Minister Greg Hunt, who paused mid-answer and tried to probe Labor’s Tony Burke.
Like a Rolling Stone “We know the member for Dawson wasn’t born in a crossfire hurricane but he’s got a touch of the cyclone!” Minister Keith Pitt on George Christensen.
Taters gonna tate Here’s another fun QT fact. Nationals leader Barnaby Joyce revealed that Ken O’Dowd, the outgoing member for Flynn, once bought and renovated an old Rockhampton pub. He renamed it O’Dowd’s Irish Hotel before offloading it in 2004. It’s now known simply as O’Dowds, but one of Strewth’s spies found something called an “Irish Pizza” on the dinner menu. With a creamy white sauce, sliced potato, Irish sausage, mushrooms, chives, bacon and cheese … it’s a spudtacular steal for $12.
What are the chances?
Here’s a tweet that caught our eye from professor Peter Doherty: “My guess is we’re headed for a federal election very soon. Make sure you’re registered to vote, decide what policies are important to you, make the effort to find out the positions of the different parties & candidates & vote for the least worst alternative. BUT VOTE”. Sure … but where’s the modelling? strewth@theaustralian.com.au

ACT Chief Minister Andrew Barr refused to be the butt of the joke. “I don’t think sewage detection is quite that sophisticated (that) it is able to tell whether it’s a Canberran’s poo or someone else’s,” a craptivated Barr critiqued. “Does John know something about the poo that other people don’t? I mean, if he got scientific evidence that can back it up, that it’s Canberra poo.” Em-poo-rical evidence? “I mean, seriously, I’m just not interested in having whose poo it was arguments with John Barilaro at the moment.” What a shit show! (Which Strewth has titled Poo And A Half Men.) Meanwhile, federal MPs from Annastacia Palaszczuk’s palatial state — including Peter Dutton and Karen from Home Affairs — are locked out of Queensland until at least September 8.
’Tis an ill wind It’s the question you didn’t know you needed answered: can you catch Covid-19 from farts? The ABC’s omniscient Norman Swan told listeners to his Coronacast podcast that yes, you probably can. Hence why the government is testing our waste water for fragments of the virus shed in faeces. Swan warned flatulent Quiet Australians to avoid passing wind “close” to other folk, adding it was important “that you don’t fart with your bottom bare”. Solid advice, pandemic or no.
Presents accounted for There’s certainly an art to looking a diplomatic gift horse in the mouth. Scott Morrison has decided not to keep the mere – a highly prized Maori weapon made of jade – he received during his whirlwind trip to New Zealand in May. The Prime Minister was officially welcomed to Queenstown by Ngai Tahu leader Edward Ellison at a ceremony where Kiwi official Martin Wikaira sang a rendition of Waltzing Matilda in Maori. Morrison was presented with the jade mere, a short flat club shaped like a large tear drop, as a sign of trans-Tasman “unity and togetherness”. It is traditionally used in close hand-to-hand combat … surely it would come in handy for the Liberal partyroom? ScoMo’s mere was valued at $1407.55 by NZ, and therefore exceeded Australia’s gift limit – $750 from government sources and $300 from private or industry sources. In order to keep it, he would be required to pay the dollar difference of $1218.31. Instead, the PM decided to consciously uncouple from the weapon and surrender it to his department, which will decide whether it should be added to the rotation of items on display in his Parliament House office (in case they ever visit) or disposed of. The PM does deserve some credit that the mere made it to PM&C. Over in Washington DC, there’s an “ongoing inquiry” into the disappearance of a $7860 bottle of whisky given to former secretary of state Mike Pompeo by then Japanese prime minister Shinzo Abe in 2019. Mysterious!
Trump up your sleeve The PM obviously didn’t feel as attached to the Kiwi artefact as he did the silver bald eagle cufflinks from Donald Trump or the signed photographs of the Queen and Prince Philip, from QEII herself. He paid $355.30 and $33 respectfully to keep them in his personal possession. Jenny Morrison also forked out $264 to keep a “carved ivory pig tusk bracelet” from the first lady of Vanuatu, Estelle Tallis. Would a proud constitutional monarchist wear one’s bald eagle cufflinks with one’s everyday Australian flag face mask and pin? Or would they clash? Asking for a friend.
They’re fin love Jacinda Ardern’s North Island nuptials are on hold now that NZ is in a national lockdown. Beau-to-be Clark Gayford confirmed the pair, and daughter Neve, have put prep for the summer wedding in Gisborne on “the backburner”. When he’s not starring in Audible ads, NZ’s first fiance has been busy working on his book Fish of the Day, which captures his best travel tips and recipes. Apparently Ardern is actually pretty good with a rod in hand. “Her first cast she got a 14 pound snapper, her very next cast she caught this huge John Dory – and she thought that was what fishing was always like.” No wonder she’s hooked! “I’ve been teaching her how to soft bait and a style of fishing called speed-jigging and she’s very determined when she sets her mind to it.” What a catch!
Point of order Could the farce that is question time sink any further than this? Government whip Rowan Ramsey was two sentences into reading his Dorothy Dixer for Small Business Minister Stuart Robert when he realised something was amiss. “I have asked the wrong question,” Ramsey declared. He was meant to quiz Education Minster Alan Tudge. Close but no cigar. “Sorry, no. You’ve asked the question,” Speaker Tony Smith interrupted. “Yes, it’s probably the clearest illustration that it’s not a question without notice, but anyway…” Laughter ensued. The surprise zinger of the day came from Trade Minister Dan Tehan, who thanked Liberal backbencher Warren Entsch for “asking the right question”. Talk about a low bar! Kudos also to Bob “I never use a computer” Katter, who asked his first remote query without a hitch. More than we can say for Health Minister Greg Hunt, who paused mid-answer and tried to probe Labor’s Tony Burke.
Like a Rolling Stone “We know the member for Dawson wasn’t born in a crossfire hurricane but he’s got a touch of the cyclone!” Minister Keith Pitt on George Christensen.
Taters gonna tate Here’s another fun QT fact. Nationals leader Barnaby Joyce revealed that Ken O’Dowd, the outgoing member for Flynn, once bought and renovated an old Rockhampton pub. He renamed it O’Dowd’s Irish Hotel before offloading it in 2004. It’s now known simply as O’Dowds, but one of Strewth’s spies found something called an “Irish Pizza” on the dinner menu. With a creamy white sauce, sliced potato, Irish sausage, mushrooms, chives, bacon and cheese … it’s a spudtacular steal for $12.
What are the chances?
Here’s a tweet that caught our eye from professor Peter Doherty: “My guess is we’re headed for a federal election very soon. Make sure you’re registered to vote, decide what policies are important to you, make the effort to find out the positions of the different parties & candidates & vote for the least worst alternative. BUT VOTE”. Sure … but where’s the modelling? strewth@theaustralian.com.au

Full text: BREWING BORDER WARS THE Lethbridge cartoon (C-M, Aug 25) depicting states as a bunch of cars pulling in opposite directions was on the money.
It’s the latest in a series of pictorial, written and spoken statements highlighting the threat to Australia’s wellbeing posed by over-powerful state governments.
What’s emerging in the current crisis is an incredible state-centred selfishness.
Watching the current Queensland-NSW border imbroglio, it’s almost as if a civil war has broken out.
The saying a house divided against itself cannot stand comes to mind. Just imagine if our nation was at war with some insidious foe. What’s that you say? It already is?
At any rate, the big question is: how can the federal government take back sufficient power from the states to protect the nation as a whole, when an existential crisis such as Covid-19 strikes?
Paul Dobbyn, Wynnum
IT IS understandable that Premier Palaszczuk stays cagey on the plan to open up Queensland to the rest of the country under the Doherty Institute modelling in the face of rampant Covid-19 cases in New South Wales (C-M, Aug 25).
Nobody wants to live in lockdown.
The rampant virus in New South Wales could cause a lockdown in Queensland at any time.
The priority is to keep Queensland open and safe for Queenslanders. The pathway out to border openings is vaccinations, built quarantine and personal hygiene including mask wearing.
The Morrison government is responsible for vaccinations and quarantine. Action by the Morrison government on vaccinations and quarantine, rather than words is the real light at the end of the tunnel back to life as we knew it.
The Palaszczuk government has earned trust in keeping Queenslanders safe by its actions.
The Morrison government must now earn trust by its actions.
Out of trust, hope will be born.
David Muir, Indooroopilly
WE WILL have to live with Covid forever, it’s not going away. We will need yearly vacs and have the info on your phone. So let’s get on with it, get vaccinated and back to living with open borders.

SMART POLLIES FACE TEST PETER Gleeson’s recent article (C-M, Aug 23) on prospective politicians requiring a minimum IQ level before being endorsed to contest a seat, certainly has merit.
The problem associated with this requirement, however, is trying to find the people with the required IQ level who are willing to take on the job for the salary offered.
This statement will certainly raise the ire of many people who consider politicians to be grossly overpaid.
But consider this, people with an IQ rating well above the normal, are generally employed in positions paying well above the level of politicians.
Would any of them be prepared to drop a significant amount of annual remuneration to take on the dubious honour of being a member of parliament? Not likely.
So the situation will remain the same until the remuneration package equals the expectations of any aspiring politician.
As the old saying goes, if you pay peanuts you get monkeys.
Phil Stoneham, Middle Park
PETER Gleeson’s article on the IQ of MPs, has raised some interesting remarks. The parliament should be a microcosm of the electorate.
That there is an over representation of a particular segment is the fault of the political parties who select candidates based on a particular basis.
Senate committees are interesting and sometimes frivolous but just because a senator does not have a degree does not say that they are of less IQ than those with degrees.
Quite often it is proved that the most intelligent and the ones asking the most penetrating questions are those who are the quiet achievers.
Don’t judge a person by their qualifications, but by their actions, then you’ll know who the muppets are!
Lin Powell, Craignish
STANCE ON YOUTH CRIME FAR northern judge, Justice James Henry, has spoken for the people and the way people feel (C-M, Aug 25).
By revoking the bail of a repeat 15-year-old juvenile offender, he has given a glimmer of hope that more judges might follow his lead.
The community should be first and foremost in their decision making. These recidivist offenders have little if any fear of the consequences and yet the public often live in fear of where these juveniles might strike next.
Such crime has been rampant in recent months and, if the Labor government will do little about it, rulings by judges of Justice Henry’s ilk must become commonplace.
Ken Johnston, Rochedale South
MENTAL HEALTH MEASURES I CONFESS to considerable scepticism when conservative voices talk about the impacts of lockdown on mental health.
These are the same people who pursued the fundamentally flawed Robodebt scheme, even after they were told of the damage it was doing.
And they threw people into detention centres for the crime of fleeing persecution, then ignored the professional advice on suicide and self-harm.
If conservatives are concerned for the mental wellbeing of people they can immediately act to bring about the following changes.
First, release all refugees and asylum seekers from institutional incarceration, as recommended by mental health experts.
Next, implement all of the findings of the Royal Commission into Aboriginal Deaths in Custody, as recommended by mental health experts.
Last, provide a four-fold increase in funding for veterans’ reintegration programs, as recommended by mental health experts.
Let’s see real support for critical mental health programs, and not ideological posturing that will sell out at the first convenient opportunity.
Stephen Morgan, Carina Heights
VALE CHARLIE WATTS I HEARD the sad news about the passing of Charlie Watts, drummer of the Rolling Stones who played with the band for nearly 60 years.
What a talent and gentleman he was, often seen donning a three-piece suit while Mick and the rest were in jeans and T-shirts.
We love your work.
His wife Shirley once famously said: “Oh Charlie isn’t really a Rolling Stone he just plays on tour with the band now and then”.
So very glad that he did. RIP dear old Charlie hope you remembered to take your drumsticks to heaven.
Margo Campbell, Birkdale
WHEN MAGPIES ATTACK WHAT good news that we have an expert on magpies at Griffith University. I wasn’t aware that was a course that was available and one has to wonder how long it takes to complete – and what use it actually is.
This expert must live on a different planet to me.
I have never yet seen a magpie fly around in front of a human to see if they recognise the face of a person before attacking.
In my experience, unlike plovers that I have seen attack from the front, magpies always attack from behind.
Syd Cutmore, Golden Beach
WAKE UP CRAIG IF CRAIG Kelly thinks that he will be the leader and sole formulator of policy for The United Australia Party I’ve got a block of flood-prone land to sell him.

Full text: Vax on, vax off Here’s one for the diary. The National Audit Office — of #sportsrorts and #carparkrorts fame — has launched an inquiry into the vaccine strollout and is set to report back by April. If Scott Morrison fulfils his promise to be a “full-termer”, the ANAO’s analysis could be released before the next federal election (due by May 21, 2022). “The objective of this audit is to assess the effectiveness of the planning and implementation of the Covid-19 vaccine rollout,” the ANAO said, hinting at a focus on Greg Hunt’s Health Department. The jimmy jab games began in February, with the government initially planning for all Quiet Australians to receive both doses by October. NSW hit the six million milestone on Tuesday, with Gladys Berejiklian promising fully vaxxed punters a TBC treat. There’s plenty for the auditors to delve into: supply and sourcing (Poland); delays and eligibility (to give and receive); Vaxzevria (aka AstraZeneca) hesitancy and indemnity; Dolly Parton’s Moderna; private school students jumping the queue and private consultants (PWC’s secret $1m a month contract); translations that were weeks out of date; political tattoos exposed during shots (e.g. Peter Gutwein’s black panther); the useless $10m CovidSafe app; boots on the ground; Thor refusing to star in a pro-vax ad; and a definitive answer on which Paul Kelly we should take our health advice from. The ANAO is accepting submissions until January 30, 2022. If they have time, could they look at delay and supply issues with toilet paper during periods of panic-buying?
Crood culture The Prime Minister’s latest road map to recovery is based on a fictional prehistoric family who live in a cave. You know what they say, it’s always darkest before the Delta dawn. “It’s like that movie, The Croods,” Morrison waxed comical. “Some wanted to stay in the cave, and that young girl, she wanted to go out and live again and deal with the challenges of living in a different world. Well, Covid is a new, different world, and we need to get out there and live in it. We can’t stay in the cave.” His review? “I like the movie.” No doubt temporary The Lodge resident Josh Frydenberg is breathing a sigh of relief he’s dropped “under the doona” metaphors.
Coming out of my cave For those unfamiliar, The Croods is based on a story by John Cleese and made $23.8m at the Aussie box office in 2013. It stars Nicolas Cage (in a cave!), Emma Stone, Ryan Reynolds and Catherine Keener. Strewth had a spare 94 minutes before question time so we took some animated PG notes. The Quiet Australian neanderthals –Grug, Eep, Ugga, Thunk, Sandy and Gran – live in a cave (lockdown) without light. State premier Grug is stubborn and overprotective so institutes a ring of steel and curfew.

Crood culture The Prime Minister’s latest road map to recovery is based on a fictional prehistoric family who live in a cave.

Well, Covid is a new, different world, and we need to get out there and live in it. We can’t stay in the cave.” His review? “I like the movie.” No doubt temporary The Lodge resident Josh Frydenberg is breathing a sigh of relief he’s dropped “under the doona” metaphors.

Most workers support vaccination passports

Full text: More than 70 per cent of workers support the rollout of a vaccine passport, while less than a quarter believe employers should mandate vaccinations for staff, new polling has revealed.
The survey of 999 Australian employees by global HR software firm Employment Hero found overwhelming support for providing greater freedoms for fully vaccinated citizens, including almost 77 per cent in NSW.
A range of business groups has called for the use of vaccine certificates in Australia, but several ­Coalition MPs have voiced concerns about their requirement for interstate travel and attending venues and events.
The Employee Covid-19 Vaccination Sentiment Report found 71 per cent of employees surveyed support the use of green cards – already used in Israel and the EU. More than two-thirds felt vaccine passports were necessary to protect family health and get businesses operating again.
Only 16 per cent of surveyed workers said they were against the concept. Victoria, Tasmania and the Northern Territory are currently working on vaccine passport pilot programs and will deliver recommendations to nat­ional cabinet.
Under national cabinet’s vaccination road map – based on modelling conducted by the Doherty Institute – a 70 per cent threshold will see the use of lockdowns and hard border closures curtailed, with draconian restrictions almost disappearing once 80 per cent of the population is vaccinated.
West Australian Premier Mark McGowan has already announced that travellers from Covid hotspots – a new “extreme high risk” category – will be required to show proof they have had at least one jab.
Six per cent of surveyed workers said they had been actively discouraged from getting the ­vaccine by their workplace. Employees in microbusinesses (two-nine staff) were 198 per cent more likely to report employers were pushing them not to get the jab.
More than half of Australian workers in the survey believed the federal government had mismanaged the vaccine rollout; 57 per cent of workers agreed the federal government vaccine messaging was confusing.
Moreover, more than 60 per cent of workers surveyed said their workplace had little influence on their decision to be vaccinated, with more than half saying their employer had never spoken to them about getting the vaccine. Only 22 per cent of those surveyed said employers should mandate vaccinations for staff.
Employment Hero chief executive Ben Thompson said ongoing uncertainty about staff vaccination meant employers were “terrified of doing the wrong thing”. Of those who said they wouldn’t get vaccinated, 12 per cent said they were against the vaccine. More than a quarter were waiting for mRNA vaccines and 24 per cent said they were waiting until vaccines had been available for longer.

Full text: NEW South Wales is expected to be isolated from the rest of the country for months to come, as state leaders acknowledge its lockdown will never drive case numbers back to zero.
The worsening outbreak could throw into chaos the national cabinet’s agreed plan to reopen Australia, because it assumed there would be only small number of Covid-19 cases when the vaccination targets of 70 per cent and 80 per cent were reached.
The state recorded 415 cases on Sunday as Gladys Berejiklian said it was “not possible to eliminate it completely”.
“The best chance we have to live with it freely and safely is to get the case numbers down as low as possible,” the NSW Premier said.
Victorian Premier Daniel Andrews agreed, saying there was “no way they’re going to get to zero cases”.
“Nothing else they’re doing is working … This is where they’re at now, they’re going to have to vaccinate their way out of this,” Mr Andrews said.
He said there was “no doubt” about the national cabinet’s plan to end lockdowns and reduce restrictions among state and territory leaders.
“No one’s walking away from the plan,” Mr Andrews said.
But senior federal government sources said that for the national cabinet plan to succeed, they expected states would keep their borders closed to NSW for months, and possibly until Christmas.
Mr Andrews said that if Ms Berejiklian reopened her state at the 80 per cent threshold, and there were still many cases of community transmission, then “they’ll be locked out to here”.
He said the Doherty Institute modelling underpinning the national cabinet plan was based on Australia reaching the vaccination thresholds while having successfully suppressed the virus.
“That modelling does not assume that there are thousands of cases, and hundreds of cases every day,” Mr Andrews said.
“If we want to be open, if we want to have a new set of rules as we go into a new year, if we want to preserve our health system for everyone who needs it … then when we get to 70 and 80, we have to have cases down here, not raging.
“Otherwise I don’t know how that works.” Mr Andrews maintained that was why it was paramount that Melbourne’s continuing lockdown was successful, because the city and state could not reopen if it had thousands of cases, even with 80 per cent of people over 16 fully vaccinated.
“I’m determined to make sure that it doesn’t ­happen here,” Mr Andrews said. With all of NSW now in lockdown, chief health officer Kerry Chant said on Sunday: “I cannot stress enough the seriousness of the current situation, and my grave concerns that these case numbers will continue to escalate.” tom.minear@news.com.au

“The best chance we have to live with it freely and safely is to get the case numbers down as low as possible,” the NSW Premier said.
Victorian Premier Daniel Andrews agreed, saying there was “no way they’re going to get to zero cases”.
“Nothing else they’re doing is working … This is where they’re at now, they’re going to have to vaccinate their way out of this,” Mr Andrews said.
He said there was “no doubt” about the national cabinet’s plan to end lockdowns and reduce restrictions among state and territory leaders.
“No one’s walking away from the plan,” Mr Andrews said.
But senior federal government sources said that for the national cabinet plan to succeed, they expected states would keep their borders closed to NSW for months, and possibly until Christmas.
Mr Andrews said that if Ms Berejiklian reopened her state at the 80 per cent threshold, and there were still many cases of community transmission, then “they’ll be locked out to here”.
He said the Doherty Institute modelling underpinning the national cabinet plan was based on Australia reaching the vaccination thresholds while having successfully suppressed the virus.
“That modelling does not assume that there are thousands of cases, and hundreds of cases every day,” Mr Andrews said.
“If we want to be open, if we want to have a new set of rules as we go into a new year, if we want to preserve our health system for everyone who needs it … then when we get to 70 and 80, we have to have cases down here, not raging.
“Otherwise I don’t know how that works.” Mr Andrews maintained that was why it was paramount that Melbourne’s continuing lockdown was successful, because the city and state could not reopen if it had thousands of cases, even with 80 per cent of people over 16 fully vaccinated.
“I’m determined to make sure that it doesn’t ­happen here,” Mr Andrews said. With all of NSW now in lockdown, chief health officer Kerry Chant said on Sunday: “I cannot stress enough the seriousness of the current situation, and my grave concerns that these case numbers will continue to escalate.” tom.minear@news.com.au

Full text: Amid reports of spikes in children being hospitalised for Covid-19 overseas, New Zealand experts explain why they have 'no new concerns' for youngsters here. Brittney Deguara reports.
Despite Covid-19 infections and hospitalisations spiking in children in parts of the world, one leading paediatric infectious disease specialist in New Zealand sees "no new concerns" with the Delta variant and children younger than 16.
In the United States, 93,824 children - defined here as younger than 20 years - tested positive in the week ending August 5, making up about 15 per cent of confirmed cases. To put this into perspective, the week ending July 22 saw 38,654 new cases in that age group.
Associate Professor Tony Walls, a paediatric infectious disease specialist from the University of Otago, explained there were more cases in children simply because there was more transmission in the wider community.
"I don't think anyone thinks that there's more severe disease occurring in children because of the Delta variant, but obviously it's pretty early and people are keeping a close eye on that."
The US Centres for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), for example, is actively investigating the potential for this variant to cause severe disease in adults and children.
Dr Nikki Turner, director of the Immunisation Advisory Centre, said there was some indication 12 to 15-year-olds were contracting the Delta variant more severely, but it wasn't affecting them as badly as older age groups.
Walls, however, said data from the UK suggested there was "no new concerns" for children under 16 and how they might be affected by the Delta variant.
In England, at the end of July, an estimated 1.72 per cent of children from 2 to 11 years tested positive, while an estimated 3.21 per cent between 12 and 16 years tested positive. The month prior, these figures sat at 0.91 per cent and 1.25 per cent, respectively.
Children were also being hospitalised with Covid-19. In the week ending August 1, there were 3.12 hospitalisations per 100,000 for children aged 0 to 4, and 1.08 for those aged 5 to 14.
Despite this, Walls said it was still "less likely" kids would be hospitalised with severe illness.
"The risk of a child having disease severe enough to lead to a hospital admission is very, very low compared to an adult.
"My colleagues in the UK are generally reassured that there are still relatively few children that get admitted to hospital with Covid - that was the case during the first and early waves and seems to be the same even with the Delta variant spreading throughout the UK. Generally that's pretty reassuring."
The number of hospitalisations of children in the US was also increasing, but that was on par with the increase in cases, according to Dr Anthony Fauci, chief medical adviser to the US president.
"More infections mean more children will be in the hospital," he said at a recent White House media briefing.
Hospitalisations for children under 17 in the US increased by 27.3 per cent, on average, in the week ending August 10. The week prior there had been an average 46.3 per cent increase.
One recent pre-print study out of Uruguay's University of the Republic, which was yet to be peer- reviewed, estimated age-specific frequencies of severe, critical and fatal disease. It found children up to 9 years had a 0.094 per cent chance of getting severely ill, a 0.008 per cent chance of being critical, and practically no chance (0.00048 per cent) of dying from the virus. For the 10 to 19-year age bracket, the risk increased - 0.2 per cent for severe disease, 0.021 per cent for critical disease, and 0.0018 per cent for fatal disease.
Some had raised concerns about reopening New Zealand's borders and the effect it might have on children under 16 who were yet to be vaccinated.
Amanda Kvalsvig, a senior research fellow in the department of public health at the University of Otago, previously told Stuff planning to vaccinate children as young as 12 needed to happen "right away".
But vaccinations were less likely to have that great of an impact on that demographic, according to Australian research. With or without vaccinations for 12 to 15-year-olds, cases would still likely be reported in that age group if outbreaks emerged when the borders reopened. Some may even be severe.
"Even though younger people are less affected, when many people get the disease then you'll get some who will get it more severely," Turner said.
She described it simply as a "number's game".
Some groups of children and teenagers were more at risk of hospitalisation than others, according to Dr Jin Russell, a developmental paediatrician in Auckland, and PhD candidate in epidemiology.
Those with co-morbidities - such as lung, heart or neurological diseases, or who were obese - were at a greater risk, as were children in rural communities, Maori and Pacifika children, and those from socio-economically disadvantaged backgrounds.
The overall risk of severe outcomes for kids, however, would likely remain "very low", Walls said. There was an exponential increase in risk as people got older. So the youngest children had the least chance of getting severely ill or dying from Covid-19.
Modelling from Australia's Doherty Institute, which was provided to the Australian federal government, found vaccinating 12 to 15-year-olds "would not materially change the expected overall health outcomes" of the population. With 80 per cent of the eligible Aussie population vaccinated, jabbing teens between 12 and 15 would reduce the transmission potential of the Delta variant for all adults by just 0.1 per cent.
Turner said in terms of reaching herd immunity, vaccinating teenagers was "only a very small gain".
Speaking from an equity point of view, Turner said it would be good to vaccinate all family members at the same time. But priority still needed to be given to the vulnerable populations.
Walls agreed: "I think vaccines for 12 to 15-year-olds are a good idea for their individual protection. As a country, I think we should be focusing on vaccinating the elderly and the more vulnerable in our population before we move on to vaccinating the 12 to 15-year-olds.
"That's going to have a much greater impact in terms of reducing severe disease and illness rather than any other intervention."
Other interventions were still necessary, however. Kvalsvig highlighted the importance of minimising the risk to unvaccinated teenagers at school by monitoring C02 levels in classrooms and opening windows if levels rise, having good ventilation and filtration systems, and wearing masks.
"There are a number of measures that we can start with now to minimise children re- breathing each other's air."

Full text: Who's being targeted, and why
Tasmania is about to embark on its four-point Delta Shield plan, aimed at ensuring the state is as ready as it can be ahead of any future cases of the highly infectious COVID strain.
Aimed at learning from the challenges facing NSW, Victoria and Queensland, the plan includes an aggressive vaccine blitz over the next six weeks, with the goal of boosting the state's vaccination levels past 60 per cent by mid-September.
Dubbed the Super Six campaign, a significant part of this will be targeted at college students aged 16 to 18 years old, along with additional clinics for those aged 30 to 59.
So why is Public Health targeting this group, and why now?
We've broken down the latest advice and details of the strategy aimed at ensuring Tasmania is ready for the worst case scenario.
Why blitz now? A week on from Tasmania's first new case of COVID-19 in more than seven months - confirmed to be Delta - Premier Peter Gutwein said the strain was challenging communities right across Australia's Eastern seaboard, and creating serious health and economic challenges.
While Tasmania's vaccine program continues to lead the country, he said in the face of the Delta strain, more needs to be done.
Deputy Premier and Health Minister Jeremy Rockliff said the timing of a targeted campaign to vaccinate college students, starting from August 23, had also been selected in conjunction with the Education Department to best suit examination scheduling.
Health Department Secretary Kathrine Morgan-Wicks (pictured) said they had been working to determine the right time to bring the state's college population into the vaccine roll-out, with the Health Department to offer logistical support to colleges, with assistance from school nurses already familiar with student populations.
The six-week blitz will also target those aged 30 to 59, with state community clinics set to open on extra days and for extended hours.
By lifting vaccination rates in this age group, the aim is to also bring forward the vaccination of those aged 19 to 29 in state clinics from September 13.
Why target these age groups? Mr Rockliff said the target age group, particularly 30 to 39-year-olds, had been shown by recent modelling to be a key factor in the ease of transmission of the Delta variant.
"That is why we are going to do a very big push to get this age range vaccinated," he said.
Public Health Director Dr Mark Veitch explained the latest recommendations from the Doherty Institute identified priority groups in the community - mainly older teenagers to 40-year-olds - as being more mobile in the community, and therefore posing a higher risk for transmission.
"They are the people we know from the experience of other jurisdictions, who contribute disproportionately to the spread of disease," he explained.
Ms Morgan-Wicks said the Super Six campaign would also focus on those aged up to 59.
"We are watching the percentage of vaccination rates for those age groups, and I would really like to see particularly for our 40 to 49s, our 50 to 59s, those rates to really increase," she said.
"We are probably sitting in the 40 to 50 per cent, for those groups, for first dose vaccinations. We really need to lift those up."
Do we have enough vaccines? Ms Morgan-Wicks said for the next six weeks, Tasmania had enough vaccines "to do a really big lift", to get the state above a 60 per cent vaccination rate, for those aged over 16.
"We are currently talking to the Commonwealth, and will examine the potential of whether we do need to bring forward any vaccines," she said.
She said Public Health teams were working through the numbers and making the necessary adjustments to allow for the Super Six campaign.
"It's absolutely critical that we take this time, particularly while we do have these border arrangements with both NSW and Victoria, to really focus on vaccinating," she said.
"We do have the stock. I'm confident we have the supply. We also have a very good relationship with the Commonwealth team, to bring forward supply if we need to have that conversation."
What else is involved? Community pharmacists are also expected to play a major role in the vaccination blitz.
This includes re-examining the remaining pharmacists already authorised and approved to administer COVID-19 vaccines, but who sit outside designated postcodes authorised under state guidelines.
Ms Morgan-Wicks said these decisions would also need to be matched to the supply of vaccine expected to arrive in the state.
From Monday, 11 pharmacies will start administering first and second dose AstraZeneca to over 60s aimed at filling the gap for that age group, as state clinics have moved to Pfizer only.
Mr Rockliff said they were continuing to work with the Commonwealth to bring on more pharmacies, and would look at the expansion of vaccine types and age ranges as the roll-out progresses.
"The Tasmanian guidelines reflect the fact that AstraZeneca is the only vaccine available from the Commonwealth for community pharmacies," he said.
"The TGA advice for state's like Tasmania, where there is no widespread threat of community transmission, is that AstraZeneca is the preferred vaccine for the over 60 age group."
What about 20-year-olds? Those aged 19 to 29 who don't have underlying health conditions or other eligible circumstance, are now the only approved age group who haven't been targeted in Tasmania's vaccination roll-out.
Dr Veitch said this was a gap that would need to be prioritised "once we have enough vaccines to be confident that we can open up bookings to that group".
Mr Gutwein said if the state succeeded in lifting vaccination rates for those eligible in the 30 to 59 age bracket, bookings could open to other age groups by September.
What's the end goal? In short, the goal is to have as many Tasmanians vaccinated as possible in the next six weeks. To date, more than 50 per cent of eligible Tasmanians have received one dose of a COVID-19 vaccine, and more than 28 per cent are fully vaccinated.
The Super Six plan aims to boost the state's vaccination rates well into the 60 per cent range, with the goal of also reaching 70 and 80 per cent targets more quickly.
"We will try to push as far as possible into it by mid September," Ms Morgan-Wicks said. "We had previously talked about targets for our 70 per cent, and 80 per cent. We are currently re-working our numbers on that, but trying to bring those forward as quickly as we can."
Mr Gutwein previously said he was hopeful Tasmania could reach a vaccination rate of 80 per cent by the end of November.
"I want to remind all Tasmanians that we are at a very critical point in our COVID preparedness and response," he said.
"Please continue to do the basic important things we can all be doing to stay on top of COVID."

"They are the people we know from the experience of other jurisdictions, who contribute disproportionately to the spread of disease," he explained.
Ms Morgan-Wicks said the Super Six campaign would also focus on those aged up to 59.
"We are watching the percentage of vaccination rates for those age groups, and I would really like to see particularly for our 40 to 49s, our 50 to 59s, those rates to really increase," she said.
"We are probably sitting in the 40 to 50 per cent, for those groups, for first dose vaccinations. We really need to lift those up."
Do we have enough vaccines? Ms Morgan-Wicks said for the next six weeks, Tasmania had enough vaccines "to do a really big lift", to get the state above a 60 per cent vaccination rate, for those aged over 16.
"We are currently talking to the Commonwealth, and will examine the potential of whether we do need to bring forward any vaccines," she said.
She said Public Health teams were working through the numbers and making the necessary adjustments to allow for the Super Six campaign.
"It's absolutely critical that we take this time, particularly while we do have these border arrangements with both NSW and Victoria, to really focus on vaccinating," she said.
"We do have the stock. I'm confident we have the supply. We also have a very good relationship with the Commonwealth team, to bring forward supply if we need to have that conversation."
What else is involved? Community pharmacists are also expected to play a major role in the vaccination blitz.
This includes re-examining the remaining pharmacists already authorised and approved to administer COVID-19 vaccines, but who sit outside designated postcodes authorised under state guidelines.
Ms Morgan-Wicks said these decisions would also need to be matched to the supply of vaccine expected to arrive in the state.
From Monday, 11 pharmacies will start administering first and second dose AstraZeneca to over 60s aimed at filling the gap for that age group, as state clinics have moved to Pfizer only.
Mr Rockliff said they were continuing to work with the Commonwealth to bring on more pharmacies, and would look at the expansion of vaccine types and age ranges as the roll-out progresses.
"The Tasmanian guidelines reflect the fact that AstraZeneca is the only vaccine available from the Commonwealth for community pharmacies," he said.
"The TGA advice for state's like Tasmania, where there is no widespread threat of community transmission, is that AstraZeneca is the preferred vaccine for the over 60 age group."
What about 20-year-olds? Those aged 19 to 29 who don't have underlying health conditions or other eligible circumstance, are now the only approved age group who haven't been targeted in Tasmania's vaccination roll-out.
Dr Veitch said this was a gap that would need to be prioritised "once we have enough vaccines to be confident that we can open up bookings to that group".
Mr Gutwein said if the state succeeded in lifting vaccination rates for those eligible in the 30 to 59 age bracket, bookings could open to other age groups by September.
What's the end goal? In short, the goal is to have as many Tasmanians vaccinated as possible in the next six weeks. To date, more than 50 per cent of eligible Tasmanians have received one dose of a COVID-19 vaccine, and more than 28 per cent are fully vaccinated.
The Super Six plan aims to boost the state's vaccination rates well into the 60 per cent range, with the goal of also reaching 70 and 80 per cent targets more quickly.
"We will try to push as far as possible into it by mid September," Ms Morgan-Wicks said. "We had previously talked about targets for our 70 per cent, and 80 per cent. We are currently re-working our numbers on that, but trying to bring those forward as quickly as we can."
Mr Gutwein previously said he was hopeful Tasmania could reach a vaccination rate of 80 per cent by the end of November.
"I want to remind all Tasmanians that we are at a very critical point in our COVID preparedness and response," he said.
"Please continue to do the basic important things we can all be doing to stay on top of COVID."

Full text: Who's being targeted, and why
Tasmania is about to embark on its four-point Delta Shield plan, aimed at ensuring the state is as ready as it can be ahead of any future cases of the highly infectious COVID strain.
Aimed at learning from the challenges facing NSW, Victoria and Queensland, the plan includes an aggressive vaccine blitz over the next six weeks, with the goal of boosting the state's vaccination levels past 60 per cent by mid-September.
Dubbed the Super Six campaign, a significant part of this will be targeted at college students aged 16 to 18 years old, along with additional clinics for those aged 30 to 59.
So why is Public Health targeting this group, and why now?
We've broken down the latest advice and details of the strategy aimed at ensuring Tasmania is ready for the worst case scenario.
Why blitz now? A week on from Tasmania's first new case of COVID-19 in more than seven months - confirmed to be Delta - Premier Peter Gutwein said the strain was challenging communities right across Australia's Eastern seaboard, and creating serious health and economic challenges.
While Tasmania's vaccine program continues to lead the country, he said in the face of the Delta strain, more needs to be done.
Deputy Premier and Health Minister Jeremy Rockliff said the timing of a targeted campaign to vaccinate college students, starting from August 23, had also been selected in conjunction with the Education Department to best suit examination scheduling.
Health Department Secretary Kathrine Morgan-Wicks (pictured) said they had been working to determine the right time to bring the state's college population into the vaccine roll-out, with the Health Department to offer logistical support to colleges, with assistance from school nurses already familiar with student populations.
The six-week blitz will also target those aged 30 to 59, with state community clinics set to open on extra days and for extended hours.
By lifting vaccination rates in this age group, the aim is to also bring forward the vaccination of those aged 19 to 29 in state clinics from September 13.
Why target these age groups? Mr Rockliff said the target age group, particularly 30 to 39-year-olds, had been shown by recent modelling to be a key factor in the ease of transmission of the Delta variant.
"That is why we are going to do a very big push to get this age range vaccinated," he said.
Public Health Director Dr Mark Veitch explained the latest recommendations from the Doherty Institute identified priority groups in the community - mainly older teenagers to 40-year-olds - as being more mobile in the community, and therefore posing a higher risk for transmission.
"They are the people we know from the experience of other jurisdictions, who contribute disproportionately to the spread of disease," he explained.
Ms Morgan-Wicks said the Super Six campaign would also focus on those aged up to 59.
"We are watching the percentage of vaccination rates for those age groups, and I would really like to see particularly for our 40 to 49s, our 50 to 59s, those rates to really increase," she said.
"We are probably sitting in the 40 to 50 per cent, for those groups, for first dose vaccinations. We really need to lift those up."
Do we have enough vaccines? Ms Morgan-Wicks said for the next six weeks, Tasmania had enough vaccines "to do a really big lift", to get the state above a 60 per cent vaccination rate, for those aged over 16.
"We are currently talking to the Commonwealth, and will examine the potential of whether we do need to bring forward any vaccines," she said.
She said Public Health teams were working through the numbers and making the necessary adjustments to allow for the Super Six campaign.
"It's absolutely critical that we take this time, particularly while we do have these border arrangements with both NSW and Victoria, to really focus on vaccinating," she said.
"We do have the stock. I'm confident we have the supply. We also have a very good relationship with the Commonwealth team, to bring forward supply if we need to have that conversation."

We will need an inquiry to learn from rollout mistakes

Full text: We are living simultaneously in two Covid worlds.
On the one hand we're talking about how life will be when 70 per cent or 80 per cent of eligible people are fully vaccinated.
On the other, what we can call our third wave of Covid is spreading, hitting young people, infecting children, resisting efforts at suppression. Sydney is in dreadful shape, NSW regions are under threat, south-east Queensland is shuttered, as is Victoria, and the rollout remains beset by difficulties.
We must, of course, have the conversation about exiting the pandemic. We need to consider issues including how a vaccine passport would work, and when home quarantine can kick in.
"Transition" and "campaign" plans abound - from national cabinet and rollout tsar Lieutenant-General J.J. Frewen. All good, but there's a pie-in-the-sky element about them when we're moving forward so slowly.
Unfortunately, but perhaps inevitably, Frewen this week found himself caught on the political fly paper, after Anthony Albanese made his populist call for everyone who's vaccinated by December 1 to receive $300.
The government launched a massive attack on on this "bubble without a thought". Frewen was dragged in because he's canvassed various incentives. His position seems to be: possibly some cash, but not now. Both sides invoked his name in making their cases for and against the Labor proposal.
Morrison is using Frewen as a political shield, just as he once used former chief medical officer and now Health Department secretary Brendan Murphy.
This has brought claims Frewen is being politicised, a perception the general needs to avoid, because it could make him less credible to the public and is bad for the military.
It would have been better if Frewen had performed his role in civvies rather than in uniform, but Morrison no doubt likes the khaki. Certainly Frewen should guard against being drawn on political questions.
The Doherty Institute modelling presented publicly on Tuesday by Professor Jodie McVernon showed how the rollout's limitations have undermined our fight against the Delta variant and will continue to do so.
Its message was that the superspreaders are those aged 20 to 40. As McVernon said, they infect both their children and their parents.
But they've been the worst catered for in the rollout. They were initially placed at the back of the queue, after the most vulnerable, key workers, and the middle-aged. And Pfizer, the vaccine preferred for them - although they're now being urged to take AstraZeneca - has been in short supply.
Belatedly, vaccinations for them are being somewhat accelerated, but it is all ad hoc and unclear.
Politicians like to talk about the "learnings" (aka lessons) from this pandemic. At some point, when we're much further down the exit road, there should be a comprehensive inquiry into how decisions were made and what went right and wrong, at both federal and state levels, particularly in the rollout but in other areas too.
In this context, Thursday's Administrative Appeals Tribunal decision that the national cabinet is not - as the federal government tried to claim - a cabinet committee and is therefore not subject to cabinet confidentiality, is a welcome development.
We can perhaps understand - while still strongly criticising - how the federal government, not expecting the problems with AstraZeneca, failed to order enough Pfizer or to have sufficient alternatives.
But how come on Thursday, when people were being shouted at to get the jab, an inefficient booking system in NSW was hampering many doing that?
And why, way back when, did the government put so much weight on the doctors in delivering the early months of the rollout? The pharmacists have only recently been brought in. If they'd been involved from near the start, we would likely be in a lot better position, at least with the AZ coverage.
The question has to be asked: how much did doctors' lobbying influence the rollout's initial shape? What clout did they have with senior health officials?
In February, the Australian Medical Association issued a statement headed "GPs, not pharmacists, best placed for vaccine rollout".
It said AMA president Omar Khorshid had written to Health Minister Greg Hunt to express the AMA's concerns.
The release went on: "Dr Khorshid told Sky News that the AMA would prefer that the rollout remained part of usual GP interactions.
"'We do have significant reservations about the place of vaccination in pharmacy,' [he said].
"'In the very, very rare occurrence of a severe reaction like anaphylaxis to a vaccine, it's something that we really can't expect a pharmacist to be able to manage.
"'But the main reason is that we think that vaccination is part of a primarily holistic care package where people have a healthcare home. They know to go and see their local GP for their healthcare needs.'"

But the reference to the "main reason" is a giveaway. As is sometimes said, the AMA is the country's most powerful trade union. It fights doggedly to protect its turf.
When the Coalition came to power, it launched a royal commission into the pink batts scheme. This was seen as, and was, a political exercise. Nevertheless, it did identify faults in planning and administration.
The pink batts program and its problems pale against the importance of, and the inadequacies in, the rollout.
An inquiry into the handling of the pandemic should not be driven by political motives, but rather by the need to understand the reasons for the mistakes and how to be better prepared in future.
This isn't to diminish how well, comparatively, Australia did earlier. But the good side of the record shouldn't be an excuse to avoid rigorous scrutiny of the negatives.
You won't find provision for an inquiry in the government's exit plan. But it should be there, in stage four.

So it was at the end of this week. Just as the NSW government was gaining traction with its message to all adults to get vaccinated promptly against COVID-19 - and not to hesitate over AstraZeneca - came news that must have left the state's senior health officers with their heads in their hands.
A young woman, just 34, died from an exceedingly rare blood-clotting disorder linked to the vaccine - the sixth Australian to die from more than 6.8 million doses of AstraZeneca administered in this country.
Utterly tragic as her death is, health authorities are desperate to keep the public mind focused more on the state's mounting toll of death and disease from COVID-19, hoping this will drive vaccine uptake, the jab seemingly now the only ray of hope on NSW's horizon.
Sydney's Delta outbreak continues to smoulder at a frustratingly irrepressible rate. Thursday's figure of 262 new cases was a new high, eclipsed by yesterday's 291.
Victims are not just the elderly. Intensive care units are seeing patients in their teens, 20s and 30s. Earlier in the week, a 27-year old man died from the disease while isolating in his south-west Sydney home, the state's youngest COVID-related death to date.
Premier Gladys Berejiklian, chivvied daily by journalists about whether she'll tighten the lockdown screws even further, says "we have the harshest lockdown conditions that any state in Australia has seen".
"The vaccine is our key tool," she says, a line which jars with the Prime Minister's assertion that the lockdown itself is "the primary tool".
This week, the core message from senior NSW ministers and Chief Health Officer Dr Kerry Chant has been for the public to get behind a state-wide effort to achieve 6 million jabs (first or second doses) by the end of this month, which will equate to roughly half the state's population.
To reach the goal, every delivery channel available is being ramped up. Just under 4.3 million doses have been administered in NSW so far, of which about 2.7 million have been delivered via Commonwealth channels which include GPs, specialist respiratory clinics and aged and Indigenous healthcare.
The NSW government has been responsible for delivering the balance, about 1.6 million doses, through outlets which include three mass vaccination hubs at Sydney Olympic Park, Lake Macquarie, and Macquarie Fields in Sydney's south-west. Two more mass hubs are due to open in Wollongong and at the Qudos Bank Arena on Monday. To bolster the vaccine workforce, appropriately trained student dentists, podiatrists and speech pathologists among others are being brought in.
Local authorities are also pumping out vaccines via another 40 or so NSW-run clinics around the state, and through 100 "outreach" locations (where city-based medical teams fly to rural areas).
In the hotspots of south-west Sydney, pop-up and walk-in vaccination clinics targeting multicultural communities are now operating on set days a week at places such as mosques and community centres. A key walk-in clinic is operating seven days a week at Prairiewood.
The head of the federal government's Operation COVID Shield, Lieutenant General John Frewen, has proposed adding drive-in clinics to the mix, a move which caught the state government off-guard when it was announced mid-week.
But NSW Health Minister Brad Hazzard told the Herald he welcomed the initiative and "encouraged" Canberra to work with the state on determining the best locations, while "preferably getting on with it as fast as possible".
He's also welcomed federal help in getting vaccine programs into south-west Sydney's major distribution hubs for suppliers such as Woolworths, Coles, Aldi and Metcash.
So far, 21 per cent of the state's eligible residents have been fully vaccinated, including 45 per cent of over-70s. Between April and the end of last month, 2.53 million of those jabs were AstraZeneca and 1.51 million Pfizer. Most of the AstraZeneca went out through federally run channels. One in five over-70s have yet to receive a first dose, which Chant says is of grave concern.
For the state to reach its 6 million target by month's end, about 69,000 doses will have to be put into arms daily, a tall order given that weekends usually dip to around half the weekday rate. Yet it would seem within reach if NSW keeps up the pace of more than 80,000 doses administered every day this week.
On Wednesday, the figure exceeded 84,000 doses.
GPs are doing a substantial proportion of the heavy lifting: 1800 of the state's almost 3000 general practices are participating. Many small practices are turned off by the costs and staffing demands of the consent process, reporting requirements and a delivery protocol which requires observation of patients for 15 minutes after each jab.
Mount Druitt GP Kean-Seng Lim told the Herald: "GPs get a rebate $31 from Medicare for every first jab, then it drops to $24 for the second. It can be financially non-sustainable for many doctors."
The latest weapon to be added to the vaccine armoury is pharmacies, only now gearing up despite many having engaged with the federal government's "expression of interest" process in March.
Across the state, 1250 pharmacies have been authorised to join the program, though only about 300 have started inoculating customers
That number will climb swiftly next month as hundreds more join the rollout. NSW Pharmacy Guild president David Heffernan says "we've been ready to go from day one - it's just been the block of government".
Port Macquarie pharmacist Judy Plunkett says the vaccine rollout has been "singularly the most frustrating thing in [her life] for the past six months".
"If pharmacies were brought on in April, we could have done tens of thousands of doses by now," says Plunkett, who has given out 4000 flu vaccines this year.
Plunkett says many pharmacists are uniquely connected to their communities and are well-placed to help long-standing customers who might struggle with impenetrable booking systems and consent process.
She says: "The booking system is a mystery to most people. It's not accessible. It's not easy. And it's not selling itself. These are all people who often don't have cars and many have carers that bring them in to see me. They are saying 'Judy, we will wait for you to vaccinate us'."
At his family-owned Priceline pharmacy in Fairfield, pharmacist Quinn On has been staggered by demand for vaccine since he started administering AstraZeneca on July 26.
Having erected a gazebo on the pavement outside to keep patients socially distanced while he explained the vaccine process to them, Quinn discovered he and staff were attracting quite an audience among Cantonese, Mandarin, Vietnamese and Lao speakers (the pharmacy's staff are multilingual).
"We started noticing everyone was hanging around listening as we counselled people over the consent form and explained the risks and benefits of AstraZeneca. We managed to debunk a lot of the misinformation because many don't speak much English," Quinn says.
"We went from doing 25 on the first day to 172 on the third day."
He rapidly exhausted his government-allotted quota of 300 vaccine doses for the fortnight and had to borrow extra from a GP and another pharmacy. He's now won agreement to administer 600 a fortnight, but could do more.
Quinn says for some of his peers, the $19 paid per jab has been a deterrent, given the higher Medicare rebate paid to doctors. He finds the payment does not cover his costs. "But I say 'do it for the community - the more people we can do, the quicker we can get out of this'."
His experience highlights how effective local leaders can be in countering misinformation about the virus, which has seeped into Sydney's most vulnerable ethnic communities from overseas media and eroded confidence in vaccines.
Data from Operation COVID Shield revealed for the first time this week the glaring "vaccination gap" between some of Sydney's most privileged areas and the hardest-hit south-west. More than a quarter of those aged over 15 living in North Sydney, for instance, are fully vaccinated compared with just 14 per cent in the south-west.
As well as being the epicentre of the city's outbreak, the south-west is home to many of the key "authorised" workers who must leave the area daily to provide essential services such as aged care and food distribution.
Public health experts say a lack of easy access to vaccines, a constrained supply and complex booking systems have been to blame. Younger people - who predominate in the south-west - were locked out of AstraZeneca until very recently because of changing advice from the expert ATAGI advisory group. They've been denied Pfizer because of a lack of supply.
In the Hunter and Newcastle, now under tight lockdown for a week, there are also low rates of vaccination. In the Hunter, only 14 per cent are fully vaccinated.
On Thursday, Berejiklian announced a fast-tracked 180,000 Pfizer vaccines would be provided to NSW in the next fortnight, news which the Premier said had left her and her health officials "overjoyed".
Yet federal sources later confirmed these were the same jabs that had been foreshadowed by the Prime Minister on July 25.
The top-up comes after Canberra sent an extra 300,000 doses earlier in July - half Pfizer, half AstraZeneca - to boost jabs available for south-west Sydney. The Pfizer doses were used almost immediately on teachers and aged care workers, and state authorities asked the federal government to direct the AstraZeneca doses to community pharmacists instead of state hubs.
But last month, NSW administered 773,976 AstraZeneca doses compared to 325,086 in April. The message from local health authorities now is unambiguous: if you are 18 or over, don't wait - take whatever is available.
From September, the state should start to receive at least 290,000 Pfizer doses each week, together with 30,000 Moderna and at least 300,000 AstraZeneca.
Berejiklian has dropped veiled hints at minor loosening of the straitjacket once the state hits 6 million jabs. But the weight of epidemiological evidence leans heavily against that prospect.
Modelling carried out by the Doherty Institute for national cabinet makes clear vaccination rates have to reach about 70 per cent at least before any meaningful easing of restrictions can occur without a resurgence of the highly infectious Delta strain. An Infectious Diseases Society of America briefing this week painted a bleaker picture, saying Delta has pushed the threshold for herd immunity to well over 80 per cent and potentially 90 per cent.
Frewen has promised that every Australian who wants a vaccine will have the chance to get one by Christmas. By then, we may have exceeded the 70 per cent national vaccination uptake. It's anyone's guess what stomach the community will have for compliance with on-and-off lockdowns by then.

Full text: A group of the nation’s leading medical professionals has urged Australians not to wait for Pfizer and to get jabbed with Astra­Zeneca, as new Treasury modelling found that a lower vaccine take-up rate would wipe nearly $7bn off growth every three months.
The economic necessity of imposing short, sharp lockdowns and achieving higher inoculation rates was revealed in Treasury analysis that showed Australians would be forced into five lockdowns every quarter if vaccination coverage flatlined at 50 per cent.
In addition, Treasury found the cost of governments failing to act quickly to rein in outbreaks would rise to an even more ­brutal $35bn a quarter under the Delta strain.
The warning came as an alliance of prominent medical and health specialists penned an open letter debunking myths about the AstraZeneca vaccine and pleaded for all people to urgently get jabbed.
The letter, published in The Australian, reveals a growing number of doctors, professors and medical researchers are pushing back against the undermining of AstraZeneca, which they say provides similar protections against the Delta variant as Pfizer.
The public appeal includes doctors at the coal face of the Sydney outbreak and leading health professionals including: National Health and Medical Research Council chair Bruce Robinson; former deputy chief medical officer Nick Coatsworth; infectious diseases experts Tania Sorrell and Lyn Gilbert; Gardasil vaccine co-founder and former Australian of the Year Ian Frazer, and former Australian Medical Association president Steve Hambleton. The health professionals said the country was at a “critical point in the pandemic” and noted that, as NSW responded to spikes in cases and infections rose in Queensland, there were “millions of unused doses of AstraZeneca vaccine sitting in GPs’ surgeries and vaccination clinics”.
“Our strong recommendation to all Australians in an outbreak setting is to get a first dose of AstraZeneca or Pfizer vaccine as soon as possible ... This is consistent with the latest Australian Technical Advisory Group on Immunisation advice,” the health professionals wrote.
“Do not wait for the Pfizer ­vaccine if the AstraZeneca vaccine is available to you. AstraZeneca is an excellent vaccine that has ­already saved millions of lives and will save many more. Covid kills, and by the time you or someone you love is infected, hospitalised or in ICU it is too late.” They said lockdowns, while necessary to limit new cases, could not “prevent the spread of the virus” alone and caused “terrible stress and economic hardship”.
In a research paper assessing the direct economic costs of the COVID-19 management strategies modelled by the Doherty Institute, Treasury said it now assumed there would be five Covid-19 outbreaks every three months – two more than assumed in the May budget.
The lockdowns necessary to control the outbreaks would also be more prolonged. At a vaccination rate of 50 per cent, (the current rate is 20 per cent), there would be 70 days of lockdowns on average each quarter affecting 20 per cent of the population, while there would be lower-level health measures in place for the remaining 20 days.
Over the quarter, the average weekly cost of restrictions would be $570m – or $6.8bn in total – representing a 1.4 per cent handbrake on economic growth as long as vaccination rates remained relatively low.
Jarden chief economist Carlos Cacho said the official estimates showed vaccination was the economic imperative to next year’s recovery. Mr Cacho said that under this scenario the nation’s trend annual growth rate of roughly 3 per cent would halve. The combination of low immigration, which has accounted for about half of long-term growth, and low vaccination rates would mean the economy would stagnate.
Even at 60 per cent vaccination rates and with the adoption of a swift lockdown approach, Australia would still experience 48 days of lockdown on average in each quarter, Treasury estimated.
This would have an average weekly cost of $430m – equivalent to $5.2bn over three months, or closer to 1 per cent of nominal GDP. “Moderate or strict lockdowns are still expected to be necessary to continue minimising outbreaks until Australia reaches 70 per cent vaccination rates for Australian adults (aged 16 and over),” Treasury said. “As a result, the costs of managing COVID-19 will remain high.” By the time seven in 10 Australians aged 16 or over had received two jabs, Treasury assumed there would be only “periodic low-level restrictions” at an average cost of $200m a week or $2.4bn a quarter.
At an 80 per cent vaccination rate, the average weekly hit to economic growth would reduce to $140m or $1.7bn over a quarter.
While the costs of locking down Australians to control the spread of the virus are large, the economic damage from adopting a more laissez-faire approach to managing infections would be devastating. Assuming half the adult population was vaccinated and there was a failure to take swift action to lock down, the economic damage from more prolonged restrictions aimed at reining in infections would rise to as much as $35bn a quarter, according to the Treasury analysis.
Under this dire “managed transmission” scenario, authorities would only introduce lockdowns once the health system had reached its capacity to treat ­severely ill Covid patients. “Applying strict localised lockdowns, for shorter durations, is more cost-effective than applying more moderate lockdowns for longer periods,” Treasury concluded.
In their open letter, Australia’s leading health professionals outlined the low risks associated with AstraZeneca, upholding its safety and efficacy, while urging younger Australians to get vaccinated. “Whilst the risk of death is highest in older age groups, we are now seeing serious illness and death in unvaccinated young patients. The risk, however, is also not all about simple survival. Between 10-30 per cent of people who contract Covid will suffer long-term health consequences, the seriousness of which are yet to be fully understood,” they said.

Full text: Let’s get the messaging right and stick together if we are going to beat lockdowns
AUSTRALIA right now is a nation of house cats. We are skittish and jumpy and even though the front door is about to open, we still don’t know whether we really want to go outside or not.
The dilemma was captured in two extraordinary spectacles this past week. First, there was Prime Minister Scott Morrison standing out front of the Lodge last Friday night in full ­nation-building mode, setting what might generously be called ambitious vaccination targets of 70 and 80 per cent, with a road map to get us out of this endless rinse and repeat cycle of lockdowns.
This when Israel, which leads the world in jabbing its citizens, has ­barely cleared 62 per cent double dosed – and with a big head start too.
Then, on Monday morning, it was Queensland Chief Health Officer Jeannette Young’s turn.
Coming across more dotty aunt who spends too much time on Facebook than respected medical official, and having recently plunged much of her state into a lockdown so drac­onian AFL players were forced from the field mid-play, Young pulled the handbrake on the PM’s moon shot vaccination program.
“I said I didn’t want 18-year-olds to have AstraZeneca and I still don’t,” she said on Monday. “Even now.” Young would go on to soften her stance just a bit but, in the process, she revealed the biggest problem with the government’s road map.
Far beyond asking us to hit marks no other nation has been able to achieve, or being way too vague about dates or when we will stop letting health bureaucrats decide what “low-level restrictions” we still have to live with, the real problem is that it relies on the goodwill of states like Queensland, Victoria, and Western Australia to stick with the program.
Hence the problem. Which is it going to be, Australia? In or out? Obviously we cannot stay locked up forever. But it is a huge challenge for the Prime Minister, whose only ­really reliable ally in the push to ­re-open Australia is Gladys Berejiklian – and even they have been at loggerheads over just how Sydney’s present lockdown is going to end.
Given Treasury’s new quick-smart disaster relief payments scheme which takes the financial pressure off, and the fact that the PM’s election hopes ride on him coming through as “Mr 80 per cent”, it’s not hard to imagine Labor premiers working to derail re-opening just as they have done so much to derail national cabinet.
But in opening up the country again, psychology will play as much a part as politics.
Australia’s Covid experience has been different to most other nations. Because we have had barely any deaths compared to other nations since the start of the pandemic, we also now have far less tolerance for any deaths at all as we see the pandemic out. And, despite all the businesses smashed and psyches wrecked and opportunities and time gone forever, there are plenty of people who for a variety of reasons like the lockdown life.
For many, particularly those in well-paid work-from-home jobs, ­restrictions have offered a sense of safety and security. For some, Covid has even become a sort of substitute religion, with health officers the new high priests and heretics who flout the rules are to be burned at the stake of social media.
Recall that WA’s Mark McGowan, who has proposed making a hard ­border with the rest of the country permanent, and Queensland’s Anna­stacia Palaszczuk, who said “in Queensland we have Queensland hospitals for our people”, romped it in at their respective elections.
Neither Premier’s opponents dared to run on a platform of ending border restrictions, despite their well-reported absurdities and cruelties. Voters loved them and were just happy to be “kept safe”.
But nothing is forever and rapidly rising vaccination rates will quickly undermine Fortress Australia’s ­foundations.
As the number of Australians with both jabs approaches 50 per cent, calls will rise for more exemptions from border closures and other restrictions.
One good way to manage this would be to seek modelling on more than just the costs of lockdowns, as was presented to back up the Doherty Institute’s targets on Tuesday.
Putting the cost of minimising Covid against the cost of keeping international and domestic borders closed, personal uncertainty, mental health damage, lost classroom time, and so much else, would provide the evidence needed to lower targets, or reframe them again towards protecting the vulnerable. After all, almost every death in the current Sydney outbreak has been amongst the elderly and unvaccinated.
More talk about how we deal with risk in a free society would also help. For the past 18 months, the tension between saving lives and living life has always been resolved by coming down on the side of safety. But that cannot go on forever, and if we begin to enshrine the “right” not to be infected with Covid as the starting point for all our thinking, we will trample a lot of other freedoms as well.

Full text: A group of the nation’s leading medical professionals have urged Australians not to wait for Pfizer and to get jabbed with Astra­Zeneca, as new Treasury modelling found that a lower vaccine take-up rate would wipe nearly $7bn off growth every three months.
The economic necessity of imposing short, sharp lockdowns and achieving higher inoculation rates was revealed in Treasury analysis that showed Australians would be forced into five lockdowns every quarter if vaccination coverage flatlined at 50 per cent.
In addition, Treasury found the cost of governments failing to act quickly to rein in outbreaks would rise to an even more ­brutal $35bn a quarter under the Delta strain.
The warning came as an alliance of prominent medical and health specialists penned an open letter debunking myths about the AstraZeneca vaccine and pleaded for all people to urgently get jabbed.
The letter, published in The Australian, reveals a growing number of doctors, professors and medical researchers are pushing back against the undermining of AstraZeneca, which they say provides similar protections against the Delta variant as Pfizer.
The public appeal includes doctors at the coal face of the Sydney outbreak and leading health professionals including: National Health and Medical Research Council chair Bruce Robinson; former deputy chief medical officer Nick Coatsworth; infectious diseases experts Tania Sorrell and Lyn Gilbert; Gardasil vaccine co-founder and former Australian of the Year Ian Frazer, and former Australian Medical Association president Steve Hambleton. The health professionals said the country was at a “critical point in the pandemic” and noted that, as NSW responded to spikes in cases and infections rose in Queensland, there were “millions of unused doses of AstraZeneca vaccine sitting in GPs’ surgeries and vaccination clinics”.
“Our strong recommendation to all Australians in an outbreak setting is to get a first dose of AstraZeneca or Pfizer vaccine as soon as possible ... This is consistent with the latest Australian Technical Advisory Group on Immunisation advice,” the health professionals wrote.
“Do not wait for the Pfizer ­vaccine if the AstraZeneca vaccine is available to you. AstraZeneca is an excellent vaccine that has ­already saved millions of lives and will save many more. Covid kills, and by the time you or someone you love is infected, hospitalised or in ICU it is too late.” They said lockdowns, while necessary to limit new cases, could not “prevent the spread of the virus” alone and caused “terrible stress and economic hardship”.
In a research paper assessing the direct economic costs of the COVID-19 management strategies modelled by the Doherty Institute, Treasury said it now assumed there would be five Covid-19 outbreaks every three months – two more than assumed in the May budget.
The lockdowns necessary to control the outbreaks would also be more prolonged. At a vaccination rate of 50 per cent, (the current rate is 20 per cent), there would be 70 days of lockdowns on average each quarter affecting 20 per cent of the population, while there would be lower-level health measures in place for the remaining 20 days.
Over the quarter, the average weekly cost of restrictions would be $570m – or $6.8bn in total – representing a 1.4 per cent handbrake on economic growth as long as vaccination rates remained relatively low.
Jarden chief economist Carlos Cacho said the official estimates showed vaccination was the economic imperative to next year’s recovery. Mr Cacho said that under this scenario the nation’s trend annual growth rate of roughly 3 per cent would halve. The combination of low immigration, which has accounted for about half of long-term growth, and low vaccination rates would mean the economy would stagnate.
Even at 60 per cent vaccination rates and with the adoption of a swift lockdown approach, Australia would still experience 48 days of lockdown on average in each quarter, Treasury estimated.
This would have an average weekly cost of $430m – equivalent to $5.2bn over three months, or closer to 1 per cent of nominal GDP. “Moderate or strict lockdowns are still expected to be necessary to continue minimising outbreaks until Australia reaches 70 per cent vaccination rates for Australian adults (aged 16 and over),” Treasury said. “As a result, the costs of managing COVID-19 will remain high.” By the time seven in 10 Australians aged 16 or over had received two jabs, Treasury assumed there would be only “periodic low-level restrictions” at an average cost of $200m a week or $2.4bn a quarter.
At an 80 per cent vaccination rate, the average weekly hit to economic growth would reduce to $140m or $1.7bn over a quarter.
While the costs of locking down Australians to control the spread of the virus are large, the economic damage from adopting a more laissez-faire approach to managing infections would be devastating. Assuming half the adult population was vaccinated and there was a failure to take swift action to lock down, the economic damage from more prolonged restrictions aimed at reining in infections would rise to as much as $35bn a quarter, according to the Treasury analysis.
Under this dire “managed transmission” scenario, authorities would only introduce lockdowns once the health system had reached its capacity to treat ­severely ill Covid patients. “Applying strict localised lockdowns, for shorter durations, is more cost-effective than applying more moderate lockdowns for longer periods,” Treasury concluded.
In their open letter, Australia’s leading health professionals outlined the low risks associated with AstraZeneca, upholding its safety and efficacy, while urging younger Australians to get vaccinated. “Whilst the risk of death is highest in older age groups, we are now seeing serious illness and death in unvaccinated young patients. The risk, however, is also not all about simple survival. Between 10-30 per cent of people who contract Covid will suffer long-term health consequences, the seriousness of which are yet to be fully understood,” they said.

Full text: REVEALED New Covid plan to vaccinate young people sooner
YOUNGER people have emerged as the key to ending lockdowns, with modelling being relied on by state and federal governments showing the vaccination rollout needs to next target adults aged up to 40.
As Queensland’s chief health officer Jeannette Young revealed she would not lift the current lockdown until all known cases had been in quarantine while infectious, Doherty Institute modelling mapped out the path to a post-lockdown future.
Key to the strategy is a “strategic shift” in the rollout plan with immunisation brought forward to the 30-39 age group to the beginning of September, and the 16-29 age group to early October – to ensure these “super-spreaders” are protected as soon as possible from the virus.

Vaccine push to pave way for reopening

Full text: National cabinet will start creating the path out of lockdowns tomorrow when the country's leaders look at how many Australians must be vaccinated in order to end economically damaging restrictions.
As NSW recorded another 177 new cases, the Berejiklian government was pinning its hopes on a continuing shift in the community's attitude towards AstraZeneca vaccine, with figures showing the state is delivering thousands more doses a day than it was before the Sydney outbreak.
Vaccination figures from NSW Health reveal that one week before the outbreak began, about 24,000 of doses of AstraZeneca were administered in a day. On Monday the state delivered more than 36,000.
Prime Minister Scott Morrison revealed the federal government has been sent the Doherty Institute's modelling on the vaccination levels required to end the need for lockdowns and work is under way to combine that with Treasury predictions before Friday's meeting.
"I don't want to say that will be resolved on Friday ... that will be our first discussion," Mr Morrison told reporters.
"I hope we'll be able to set those targets and give more definition to phase two and phase three in that time. But, we have a plan for that.
"We are setting the targets scientifically, combined with the economic advice as well, and that gets us a road map to Christmas, I think, that means that we'll be living life different at Christmas than what we are now."
At the start of July, Mr Morrison revealed a four-phase plan to return Australia to a form of Covid-normal, with open borders and few restrictions. The Herald has reported the Doherty Institute's modelling will have different vaccination thresholds for older and younger Australians.
Friday's meeting will be the first time state and territory leaders will have detailed targets on how many of their citizens must be vaccinated in order to end border closures and business shutdowns.
Premier Gladys Berejiklian yesterday stressed a spike in vaccination rates, with a tightened lockdown, were critical to Sydney emerging from lockdown on August 28, after the city recorded its highest number of cases this outbreak.
"It was fairly obvious, given the way the numbers were going in the last few days, it would have not been possible for us to get out of lockdown tomorrow or Friday," she said yesterday.
Ms Berejiklian said she appreciated the toll the next four weeks would take on the community but it was necessary to keep people safe and hospital numbers down.
"Please know that I'm as upset and as frustrated as all of you that we weren't able to get the case numbers where we'd like to, at this point in time. That's the reality. We have to deal with the cards that are here before us. We have to deal with the situation at hand."
Health Minister Brad Hazzard said vaccination figures showed the community was clearly increasing its understanding of the need for vaccinations however the state was still "a long way short" of where it needed to be. "Contrary to what some have said, vaccines are definitely a major player in our way out of lockdowns. NSW residents have certainly responded to the breakout by getting more jabs in arms of AstraZeneca and, when its available, Pfizer," he said.
"The increase in the willingness to be vaccinated brings hope for the future but right now the focus has to be stay home and not spreading the virus."
Mr Morrison yesterday announced income support for people in lockdown would return to the level of the original JobKeeper scheme and those on welfare who have lost work hours will get a $200 weekly supplement under further changes to disaster payments.

Full text: NSW Premier Gladys Berejiklian appeared on Sky News.
“I fear for Victoria and I worry about what their government may do,” she said. “We’ve demonstrated to other states that it is possible to manage an outbreak and not shut down a city.”
In Victoria, we’ve copped a lot of hits from Covid. We’ve copped a lot condescending gibes from NSW politicians, too. Scott Morrison and Josh Frydenberg have made plain their views again and again: Victoria bad; NSW good.
We received the memo, loud and clear. What a shame the virus didn’t, and changed its behaviour accordingly. There are so many factors in play in outbreaks, and luck plays a part. As things stand right now, people in Victoria fear for the people of NSW and the rest of the nation.
Having lived through our long lockdown and learnt the hard way, we can see the errors being made. What we cannot understand is why others have not learnt from our mistakes.
It is clear to all that the Delta variant won’t respond to the lighter touch.
During Victoria’s second wave, on day 38, 864 cases had been reported. In this outbreak, NSW locked down much earlier than we did yet reached this number on day 28.
The key number, the daily numbers of people infectious while in the community, is not dropping, and this spells trouble for us all. Hard questions need to be asked of the NSW government and they need to be asked now. If the NSW government really is trying to achieve zero transmission in the community before it lifts the lockdown, then why is it sticking with current settings?
On Thursday, NSW Treasurer Dominic Perrottet said on ABC radio, “I believe, as the Premier has said, the policy settings that we have in place will ensure that we get out of this lockdown as quickly as possible.”
However, recently published modelling from the Burnet Institute suggests on current settings cases will still be at 40 a day in six weeks. Yet if settings were moved now to a hard lockdown, then that number would drop to below five.
If the government does not want to accept this modelling, then why hasn’t it done its own and shared it with the rest of the country?
From the outside looking in, the situation is baffling. Political differentiation is clearly being applied to a pandemic setting. At the same time, there is belligerent insistence that all decisions are being made on just the health advice. The lockdown is half-hearted and the health orders are confusing. The messages from the government are muddled and increasingly intemperate.
Employers and employees are supposed to agree between themselves whether work is essential and can be done from home. People are supposed to decide on what shopping is essential in the moment. At the same time, individual errors are detailed and people are ridiculed for their “stupidity”, which NSW Health Minister Brad Hazzard says cannot be legislated against.
At press briefings, responsibility for the lockdown length repeatedly is sheeted home to people doing the right thing. Yet the right thing cannot even be defined by the government when pressed. Instead, success or catastrophe is dependent on the various inter­pretations made at any given time by eight million people about a set of bewildering instructions.
It feels like the whole thing is a set-up for failure, designed by a government that won’t make the tough decisions or, worse, has an agenda it won’t reveal.
The narrative for the worst-case outcome has already been conveyed; if the lockdown drags on, if the outbreak gets out of control, the finger of blame will be pointed at constituents.
Up until this week, reporters at the press conferences hadn’t put much heat on the NSW Premier and her team. Now, though, it seems that everyone – except the NSW government – can see the current settings are not changing the trajectory of infections to the extent required for the lockdown to lift in a timely fashion.
On Thursday, a reporter demanded to know why the lockdown couldn’t be tightened, because “Victoria did it very successfully”. “No they did not,” Berejiklian scoffed, with a laugh and a shake of her head. As the questions continued to rain down, the Premier said it wasn’t very nice to be shouted at and left the podium, before returning to insist that she could see “green shoots”. Optimism is one thing but magical thinking is another.
Of great concern is that all the focus is on when the lockdown will end, not if. Success of this lockdown is not guaranteed. It is possible the virus may jump the soft settings and get beyond everyone, to spread throughout the nation. Victoria has 11 cases linked to the NSW outbreak. A snap lockdown is under way.
Here is where the NSW government must be held to account. Its actions endanger its own people and the rest of the nation. Failure will cause misery, illness and death, and eliminate our one strategic advantage – isolation and international border closures.

Politics of vaccine sure to change

Full text: Having unveiled a new national cabinet road map intended to run far into next year, Scott Morrison now confronts his most difficult political challenge this term with a vaccine rollout long limited by supply and a growing list of political opponents, federal and state, to threaten his survival. The Prime Minister’s problem is lack of control. He lacks the means to solve the vaccine problem any time soon.
The road map out­sources authority to the scientific experts and still leaves premiers with the ability to stage lockdowns and dictate the terms. But Morrison and Health Minister Greg Hunt stand by their core pledge – that by year’s end every Australian who wants the jab will be vaccinated. In health terms this is imperative; in political terms it is probably a survival necessity.
The next three months will be brutal damage limitation for Morrison. Australia’s rollout is one of the slowest among rich nations. A total of 6.35 million Australians or 31 per cent of the populace have had the first jab and 1.9 million or 9 per cent have had the second jab. By comparison, in the US 67 per cent of people and in Britain 80 per cent of people have had the first dose. But Australia is far ahead of New Zealand, whose first-dose rate is just half that of Australia.
Yet the metrics will change. The metric now is rollout speed. But by late this year and early next year speed won’t be the test. There will be a new metric – coverage. To redeem his authority Morrison needs to win on coverage. If the US finishes with 70 per cent of people vaccinated and Australia has 75 per cent, then Australia wins. And that win will be accentuated by the huge difference in death rates.
Coverage will be king. The road map identifies vaccination coverage as the test for easing restrictions. Morrison can survive a slow rollout if he delivers on coverage. That will become the next and more vital test. But the reality is, if Australia cannot get well above 70 per cent fully vaccinated, that will be a failure of national leadership and proof of alarming vaccine hesitancy.
There are three key factors in Australia’s slow rollout. First, there was no urgency, unlike in the US and Britain, because in Australia people weren’t dying en masse. It was assumed we had time on our side. The Therapeutic Goods Administration conducted a “full assessment” of the AstraZeneca and Pfizer vaccines while Morrison and Brendan Murphy said there was no race – technically correct but a political blunder suggesting complacency.
Second, last March Europe denied 3.1 million doses of AstraZeneca from a pledge of 3.8 million doses. This was another hurdle after a slow start with only 700,000 doses forthcoming. Critical to rollout has been the government’s decision last year to engage in local production of AstraZeneca.
To this point 5.2 million doses of AstraZeneca have been injected but only 700,000 doses are from overseas, with most of the 4.5 million doses coming from local production. That local production decision was pivotal. By the end of the rollout there will be around 10 million AstraZeneca jabs with far more than 90 per cent being produced locally.
Hunt calls vaccine supply “the most competitive global environment imaginable”. For Australia, everything now depends on delivery of its contracted 40 million doses of Pfizer this year. This week GPs began to distribute Pfizer. Last month Australia got 1.2 million Pfizer doses; this month it is scheduled to be 2.8 million doses. So far all Pfizer supplies have arrived on time, no delays. During the last five months of this year Australia is scheduled to get 32.6 million Pfizer doses sourced from Europe. The big surge in Pfizer jabs comes in the final quarter. Morrison’s political future hinges on these Pfizer deliveries.
Another 10 million doses of Moderna are due before the year’s end and Australia has an order for 51 million doses of Novavax and expects first arrivals late this year. A critical question now becomes public motivation – the risk being many people may decide they won’t die from Covid and therefore won’t be vaccinated. The anti-vaxxer move­ment is a threat. “The real damage they do is by spreading falsehoods and undermining people’s confidence,” Hunt told the media.
But the third factor has been the most important in weakening the vaccination rollout – the medical advice from the Australian Technical Advisory Group on Immunisation advising over two stages that AstraZeneca is not preferred for under-60s. This reduced the likely pool for AstraZeneca to five million people, about a quarter of the total over-16-year-old population.
Morrison and Hunt had to follow this deeply conservative health advice. The impact was serious. Confidence in AstraZenaca collapsed. No wonder Morrison, not contradicting the medical advice, tried to encourage people last week on AstraZeneca. The vaccine that saved Britain was demonised in Australia. This highlights the political constraints the government faces. It must follow the medical advice that it can’t control; it must beware targets it can’t meet; and it must avoid public brawls with the premiers that it cannot win.
Claims that Morrison should assert himself over the premiers and ditch national cabinet are political madness. But Morrison’s recurring mistake has been sending too many mixed and contradictory messages during the rollout. The nation needs the new road map. The problem is its fragility. It is an independent body, the Risk Analysis and Response Taskforce acting on modelling advice from the Doherty Institute, that will determine the thresholds of vaccin­ation coverage allowing the country to move from one phase to another in easing restrictions.
The theory is good. But everything depends on the modelling conclusions, whether 50 per cent, 70 per cent or 80 per cent. Coverage of the over-70s will be important and that’s encouraging because 70 per cent have had their first dose. Morrison made clear the recommendation would be a “scientific”, not a “political”, number. But if the threshold is too high the country will be paralysed.
There is no fixed timetable, no certainty and no guarantee premiers will abide by the “scientific” findings. Business is right to be worried. The price Morrison paid for the road map last week was cutting international arrivals by 50 per cent as demanded by the ALP premiers. The government anticipates the transition from phase one to two before the end of the year. That is essential.
But the premiers possess the political power. Will the ALP premiers sabotage the project based on their own interests and own health advice? All progress depends on changing the metrics – from Covid cases to hospitalisation, intensive care and any deaths. Australia has had no deaths this year yet this metric is ignored in public debate. Once Morrison sees the vaccination rollout completed – provided the coverage is relatively high – the opportunity arrives to restore his leverage and authority.

Full text: Australians are being promised a path out of lockdowns and international arrivals will be halved within weeks in a four-stage plan to move on from suppressing COVID-19 in order to live with the virus.
National cabinet backed the proposal to use lockdowns and border checks as required until at least the start of 2022, when the vaccination rollout could reach a key threshold to ease the controls.
Prime Minister Scott Morrison said yesterday the plan would need a "mindset change" in the community around living with COVID-19, even when cases increased because vaccinations would prevent serious illness and death.
Mr Morrison said the four-stage plan promised to get the country back to normal with uncapped inbound arrivals, the end of quarantine for those who were vaccinated and the removal of bans on Australians who wanted to travel overseas.
"The idea of having lockdowns is based on the premise that community transmission would lead to serious illness, hospitalisation and fatality," he said. "So if you've got the vaccination in place, what's the point? That's the mindset change that we've agreed today.
"Our mindset on managing COVID-19 has to change once you move from pre-vaccination to post-vaccination. That's the deal for Australians."
The long-term plan comes with a short-term cut to international arrivals, with Mr Morrison agreeing to demands from Victorian Premier Daniel Andrews, Queensland Premier Annastacia Palaszczuk and West Australian Premier Mark McGowan for a lower intake.
Victorian Health Minister Martin Foley said the new plan showed national cabinet had "pretty much endorsed" a series of proposals from Mr Andrews.
The Premier released a four-point plan before yesterday morning's meeting requesting a reduction in international arrivals, refined criteria for eligibility to fly in and out of the country, a nationally agreed vaccine target and more alternative quarantine options.
The plan was revealed as fears grew that Greater Sydney's lockdown could be extended beyond next Friday after the city recorded 31 new daily cases - its highest total in more than a year.
The number of people entering Australia through state hotel quarantine systems will drop from 6070 to 3035 a week after NSW Premier Gladys Berejiklian expressed her concern about the move but accepted the outcome in the national cabinet's online meeting.
The new weekly caps will result in up to 1505 people arriving in Sydney, 500 in Melbourne, 500 in Brisbane (with a surge capacity of another 150), 265 in Perth and 265 in Adelaide by July 14.
But there have been warnings that the decision to halve the already limited number of people allowed into the country on commercial flights will prompt foreign airlines to stop flying here altogether.
Premiers and chief ministers have only agreed to the plan in principle and will not finalise their position until they see advice in the next few weeks on the vaccination rate needed to open borders.
The four stages hinge on the success of a vaccine rollout for which the federal government has missed previous targets. State leaders are calling for more supply of the Pfizer vaccine after furious debate this week over whether the AstraZeneca product should be offered to younger Australians.
While 70 per cent of people aged over 70 have received at least one dose, protecting some of the most vulnerable, only 8 per cent of the eligible population have received two doses needed for vaccination.
University of NSW epidemiologist Mary-Louise McLaws said the country should aim to vaccinate at least 80 per cent of adults this year and plan for a series of booster shots next year to adapt swiftly to changes in the virus.
"It would be nice to get to 85 per cent but if we get to 80 per cent we'd be doing well. The community needs to hear the target because it needs to see how important vaccination is," she said.
The federal government will ramp up repatriation flights to Darwin to meet some of the demand during the lower cap on international arrivals, with an estimated 34,000 Australians still seeking to come home, including more than 10,000 in India.
The cut will be reviewed in August and a new inquiry will be launched into the hotel quarantine system to consider stronger rules to stop breaches that have spread the highly contagious Delta strain into the community.
Commonwealth Chief Medical Officer Paul Kelly said the Delta variant was "definitely more transmissible" but not more severe than other strains.
The national plan includes a trial of seven-day home quarantine as an alternative to 14 days in hotel rooms, with South Australia testing the idea.
Professor Kelly said it could be safer for vaccinated people to be at home because it would avoid interaction with hotel staff.
Mr Foley said Victoria would need to have an understanding of how a home quarantine program would work before he considered rolling out such a scheme across the state.
"It's one thing to be quarantining at home as a vaccinated individual, but you need the compliance and enforcement overlay as well," Mr Foley said yesterday.
A task force led by the head of the Department of Prime Minister and Cabinet, Phil Gaetjens, will develop the plan with modelling from the Doherty Institute about the level of vaccine coverage needed before governments can move to the second stage.
Lieutenant-General John Frewen, who heads the COVID-19 Task Force, said he expected all Australians who wanted a vaccine to be offered one by the end of December. This means the lower arrivals cap is likely to remain until early next year.
Labor leader Anthony Albanese backed the cut to international arrivals but accused Mr Morrison of failing to deliver on earlier promises and doing too little to expand the vaccination program and invest in new purpose-built quarantine centres.
"This Prime Minister is someone who reacts rather than leads, and I think this is an example of it whereby he's reacted because of the fact that 12 million Australians are locked down," he said.
Ms Berejiklian said she was disappointed with the cut in returned travellers.
"NSW, without complaint, has been welcoming home 3000 Aussies every single week ... yes, we have had issues, but if you compare that to other states who have only had a few hundred coming in or far less numbers, bringing less people home doesn't mean you won't have outbreaks," she said.
Of the 31 new local cases reported in NSW yesterday five have not been linked to existing cases. Fourteen COVID-19 patients are in hospital, two of them in intensive care.
Victoria recorded no new locally recorded cases yesterday.

Full text: THE threshold for reopening Melbourne may be eased amid mounting concerns the state government’s COVID-19 targets are too unreasonable.
Premier Daniel Andrews on Saturday conceded the expectation for Melbourne to fall below five daily coronavirus cases before he lifts stage-four restrictions may be scrapped or watered down.
Chief Health Officer Brett Sutton said a decision may have to be made to reopen the city before all community transmissions are eliminated.
The concessions came after the Herald Sun revealed on Saturday that a key figure in the modelling, University of Melbourne professorial fellow in epidemiology Tony Blakely, considered the target to release Melbourne from stage four was “too stringent”.
Yesterday’s comments gave fresh hope to Melburnians of emerging from lockdown restrictions faster than expected. FULL REPORT, PAGE 8

Full text: WHAT IS THE CRITICISM OF VICTORIA’S PLAN?
Victoria’s road map has been criticised, including by the Prime Minister, for being too cautious and setting tough, potentially impossible, targets — including no new cases for 14 days before all retail can reopen and eateries can have up to 50 patrons. Business groups have also slammed the plan for failing to strike the right balance between protecting health and keeping business alive, saying it was a “road to nowhere” with many forced to remained closed for weeks yet. The PM singled out NSW as a state that had managed to strike the right balance, arguing its comprehensive contact tracing had allowed businesses to reopen.
WHY HAS VICTORIA CHOSEN THIS?
Premier Daniel Andrews said the extended lockdown was needed to avoid a third wave. University of Melbourne and University of New England modelling found if restrictions were eased too early, there was a more than 60 per cent chance of another lockdown having to be imposed before Christmas. “I would like to open up much more quickly than we have but none of us have the luxury — none of us, not me, not any Victorian — of letting our frustration get the better of us … That’s not a recipe for anything other than a third wave,” Mr Andrews said.
DO ALL EXPERTS AGREE?
No, some questioned the modelling and plan to reopen, saying the tough targets in later stages would be difficult to meet. Deakin University epidemiology chairwoman Catherine Bennett questioned the assumptions that underpinned the modelling, while Doherty Institute director of epidemiology Jodie McVernon said the government had released “scant” detail on its data. Monash University research, based on China’s outbreak, suggested it was possible to trace and contain outbreaks if there were fewer than 30 active cases.
ARE WE PURSUING AN ELIMINATION STRATEGY RATHER THAN SUPPRESSION? Mr Andrews and Chief Health Officer Brett Sutton said Victoria was focused on “aggressive” suppression, not elimination. But top epidemiologists such as ANU Professor Peter Collignon have said the benchmarks set in the road map out of the lockdown, including fewer than five daily average cases for the “third step” and no new cases for 14 days to reach the “last step”, resembled elimination, which was “unattainable”.
IF CASE NUMBERS DROP, COULD RESTRICTIONS EASE EARLIER?
Prof Sutton said on Monday the September 28 date for Melbourne to reopen childcare and allow up to five people to meet outdoors was “locked in”, and would not be brought forward even if the target of 30-50 daily average cases was met earlier. But he said the dates for further easing — October 26 and November 23 — could be moved if those targets were reached earlier. “Everyone would welcome an earlier opening rather than a later one,” he said.
WHAT HAPPENS IF WE CAN’T GET 14 DAYS WITHOUT ANY CASES — THE THRESHOLD FOR BIGGER PUBLIC GATHERINGS, MORE VISITORS AT HOME AND INDOOR DINING?
Prof Sutton described a fortnight of no new cases as “a feasible strategy” but, asked if Victoria could ease restrictions if there was one or two new cases a day, he said: “I think so.”
IS OUR CONTACT TRACING UP TO SCRATCH? HOW HAS NSW HANDLED IT DIFFERENTLY? Victoria’s contact tracing system buckled in the state’s second wave when hundreds of new cases were recorded daily. Some businesses took the drastic step of carrying out their own contact tracing after significant delays in notifying and interviewing positive cases. In a shot at Victoria’s contact tracing scheme on Monday, Prime Minister Scott Morrison described NSW’s program as the “gold star”. He said Victoria needed to “build capacity” to contain outbreaks.
WHY IS THE CURFEW CONTINUING UNTIL AT LEAST OCTOBER 26?
It is unclear what medical evidence there is to support the curfew but Prof Sutton said it had “played its role to date” — suggesting it was used to send a strong message and help police enforce restrictions. “It has had a significant message about the serious position Victoria was in and, from a compliance point of view, the police have been able to focus their resources in areas where they need to,” he said.
MELBOURNE’S LOCKDOWN IS BEING EXTENDED FOR AT LEAST ANOTHER FORTNIGHT. WHY DID THE GOVERNMENT DECIDE ON A SIX-WEEK STAGE FOUR LOCKDOWN INITIALLY?
Prof Sutton conceded on Sunday the length of the six-week lockdown was “in some respect, guesswork”. He said it was hard to model how case numbers would fall under stage four restrictions, given there wasn’t “experience anywhere in the world of going through another wave” like Victoria’s.
WHAT ARE THE OTHER OPTIONS? COULD WE HAVE LOCALISED LOCKDOWNS OF SUBURBS AGAIN? The government has ruled this out. Mr Andrews said on Monday localised lockdowns of postcodes “will not work” because police, nurses and other essential workers would still need to move in and out of restricted zones. “That means you’ve got movement and, therefore, you’ve potentially got the transmission of the virus,” he said.
MORE THAN 60 PER CENT OF VICTORIA’S ACTIVE COVID-19 CASES ARE LINKED TO AGED CARE OR HEALTHCARE. WILL THE GOVERNMENT CONSIDER A TARGETED “RING-FENCED APPROACH” TO THOSE SECTORS TO ALLOW THE ECONOMY TO REOPEN FASTER?
Essentially, no. Mr Andrews said on Monday there were already tight restrictions in aged care that meant staff had to wear heavy PPE and could not work at more than one facility. But he said staff in hospitals or aged-care homes “all live in families … they go from one part of Melbourne to another” so it wasn’t easy to lock down those workers. “Community transmission is very difficult to just attribute and just lock down to one particular setting,” he said.
IF VICTORIA’S ROAD MAP TO RECOVER DOESN’T WORK, DOES THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT HAVE ANY POWERS TO INTERVENE? No. Although some business groups have called for the PM to intervene to help save jobs, the federal government can only offer support and assistance to Victoria. Mr Morrison said: “The legal authority for all of these matters, of course, rests with the Victorian government. It’s not for the commonwealth government, we do not have that authority to step in and tell the Victorian government they have to follow another plan. That is not how Australia’s federation works.”

Premier's road map a massive disappointment

Full text: It is by now very well understood by everyone that Daniel Andrews and his Labor government have botched Victoria's COVID-19 response. This stands in contrast to other jurisdictions in Australia.
Sadly, the so-called "road map" released on Sunday is a massive disappointment focused on more lockdowns targeting the Victorian community and businesses rather than resolving the problems deep in the government's own response. Nothing was said about the need to fix contact tracing, nothing was said about the need to fix health worker infections.
Andrews and some other commentators have tried to build a dichotomy, a binary choice between staying in lockdown longer, likely much longer, and opening now only to see a relapse shortly after and a series of on/off restrictions/lockdowns being reintroduced. This is a false choice.
We must be cleverer. We have to accept the virus will be with us and will not quickly go away. So we must live with it and manage it. This means having in place systems to respond quickly, decisively, to every outbreak, small and large.
Victoria's contact tracing has lagged far behind other states, especially NSW and Queensland. We still don't hear the detailed locational data released about individual outbreaks that are routinely released by other states; why?
The road map released on Sunday set much lower targets than the number of cases active in NSW. The larger jurisdiction, with its superior contact tracing, has allowed industries to reopen and stay open. If we fix contact tracing and other flaws in the Victorian system we should be able to do at least equivalent to our northern cousins.
Deakin-based public health expert Catherine Bennett has explained the weaknesses in the modelling, including the failure to use Victorian data, and Tony Blakely from the University of Melbourne has made clear the modelling did not examine earlier opening based on improved contact tracing.
We need a decisive break. The truth is Andrews and his hapless Health Minister, Jenny Mikakos, are central to the problem the state faces. Opposition Leader Michael O'Brien called on Andrews to resign in Parliament on Friday.
It is my view that a senior health official must be brought in from outside, probably interstate, to be given clear charge of contact tracing. They must be given the authority and resources to take whatever action is required to fix the departmental problems and make the contact tracing work. A new premier could do this on day one. There must be clear lines of authority, but once appointed the "supremo" must not be interfered with or micromanaged.
The involvement of a broader group of experts is critical, too, and there must be more data released to enable intelligent expert input and advice to be broadened. The secrecy of Andrews, Mikakos and the Health Department is now legendary. The opposition has repeatedly sought proper briefings and documents, especially those behind each and every one of the public health orders. Andrews and his officers have stonewalled. Last sitting week the upper house ordered Andrews to deliver to the Parliament the briefings behind every public health order. We are waiting.
The road map also failed in other critical ways. It is not based on proper consultation with the many sectors of industry and business. The sharp attack by Jennifer Westacott, CEO of the Business Council, on ABC's Insiders was unusual in its directness but made clear the standards of consultation with industry in Victoria fall well short of those in NSW, for example, or with the national government.
A fresh broom, a new start, is needed to deal with the continuing weakness in contact tracing, among other serious problems Labor appears unable to deal with. Andrews is the problem, his removal a first step toward the solution.

Full text: VICTORIA’S path out of lockdown could be “accelerated” if contact tracing was improved, according to one of the federal government’s top medical ­experts.
Deputy Chief Medical Officer Michael Kidd said the Commonwealth was “ready to provide further assistance” if Daniel Andrews asked.
But on Sunday the Premier said contact tracing work being done in Victoria was at the same standard of that in NSW — widely seen as the gold standard.
“It most likely exceeds it in terms of the numbers and our performance is equal to it,” Mr Andrews said.
“We are delivering performance that is as good as they are delivering and they’re dealing with maybe a dozen cases a day, and 30 or 40, close contacts, we’re dealing with an infinitely large number, and yet we’re delivering metrics.” But data released by the federal government on Friday last week showed 2 per cent of people who had received a positive test had not been fully contact traced within 24 hours — compared with none over the same period in NSW.
It was an improvement from the 10 per cent recorded the week earlier. Prof Kidd’s comments about contact tracing reiterated those reported from University of Melbourne epidemiology professor Tony Blakely, who was involved in developing Victoria’s coronavirus modelling.
“With improved contact tracing, the current time frame out of lockdown could be accelerated,” Prof Kidd said.
“The Commonwealth stands ready to provide further assistance with contact tracing in Victoria, which is now arguably one of the most important tasks. New South Wales has shown us the model of high-performance contact tracing.” Prime Minister Scott Morrison, Health Minister Greg Hunt and Treasurer Josh ­Frydenberg on Sunday said the path forward should not be with restrictions but with a ­better health response.
“Of critical importance is that Victoria’s contact tracing is strengthened to the highest possible levels,” a joint statement read. “In NSW, this has enabled the Berejiklian government to respond to ­multiple outbreaks while permitting businesses and people to carry out their daily lives in a COVID-safe way. Restrictions are not substitutes for strengthening health systems to cope with the virus, especially when community outbreak is brought under ­control.” Last month the Herald Sun revealed reluctance by Victoria’s health authorities to share data with other states forced the federal government to step in. tamsin.rose@news.com.au

Sutton hopes family visits can return if numbers dip

Full text: Victoria's Chief Health Officer Brett Sutton has hinted visits to family and friends in small numbers could be allowed when authorities downgrade stage four coronavirus restrictions in Melbourne, which they hope to do in a month.
Professor Sutton said yesterday's 303 new COVID-19 cases showed tough restrictions were driving down numbers but admitted a statewide ban on home visits was creating difficult periods of isolation for many people.
He said Victorians should have "hope and confidence" that their compliance with stage four measures was proving effective even though it was too early to confirm restrictions would be relaxed after six weeks on September 13, as initially announced by Premier Daniel Andrews.
Professor Sutton warned, however, that with more than 2000 active cases linked to aged care, scores more deaths were expected and yesterday's death toll of four was "probably just a blip".
Home visits have been banned in Melbourne and Mitchell Shire since stage three restrictions began on July 8. An easing of stage four on September 13 would mark almost 10 weeks and Professor Sutton acknowledged a period of isolation that long would be particularly difficult for some Victorians.
"We certainly always balance: what are the benefits - psychological, health-wise - in terms of easing of restrictions?" Professor Sutton said yesterday.
"It's profoundly challenging to be on your own. For single-parent households, for people living on their own, not being able to see others is a really significant thing."
Mr Andrews attributed the initial spread of Victoria's second wave in June to gatherings of family and friends larger than the permitted limit of 20, which Professor Sutton said authorities would have to be wary of.
"It's a fine balancing act . . . we may move to a point where we can say that you can have visitors at home obviously, but we need to balance that against what that transmission risk is," the Chief Health Officer said.
"I don't think we'll be jumping to 10 people immediately, I think it will be an incremental easing."
Yesterday's 303 new cases brought Victoria's seven-day average to 344 per day compared to 520 last Saturday. Mr Andrews said he was "hopeful about these numbers" but warned against complacency.
"I'm incredibly cautious to not have anyone, not even one Victorian, come to the conclusion that . . . 'we're on the run now, we can just let it all unfold'," the Premier said.
The Premier pointed to Victoria's 7875 active cases, including 1178 healthcare workers and 2041 cases linked to aged care, as a cautionary sign. About half of those aged care cases are elderly residents and Professor Sutton said they also made up the majority of Victoria's 661 hospitalisations.
"[Aged care] is a very vulnerable population, we will see more deaths with those infections," he said.
Professor Maximilian de Courten, a public health expert with Victoria University, said he believed Victoria was on track to ease restrictions on September 13 and he was hopeful daily case numbers would drop to double-digits within 10 days if Victorians stay vigilant.
"I'm optimistic but I'm holding my breath for a couple more days of evidence to be certain," he said.
Professor James McCaw, a Melbourne University epidemiologist whose team at the Doherty Institute prepares modelling for the Victorian government, said Victoria's effective reproduction rate was about 0.9 when calculated earlier this week, meaning every 10 coronavirus cases will infect nine others on average.
He said he expected it will drop below 0.9 this week as Melbourne and Mitchell Shire move into a third week of stage four restrictions.
An effective reproduction rate of 0.5 would mean daily case numbers halve every day and Professor Sutton said that was Victoria's aim.
"If it's looking like it's getting towards 0.6 then we're doing very well," Professor Sutton said.
"If it's sitting at 0.8, that's too slow. That means we're not doing enough."
Professor de Courten called on Mr Andrews to be more transparent about what an easing of stage four restrictions could look like in September.
Opposition Leader Michael O'Brien called the lower case numbers "pleasing" but also called for more transparency. "I think Victorians are being asked to make so many sacrifices at the moment, the least the government could do is bring us into their confidence and tell us: how does the easing out of stage four look?" he said.

Full text: Too much time, not enough sense I am amazed at how much notice the Queensland government gave people to get over its border with NSW (Goin’ nowhere: last bus out of Sydney, 8/8). I have seen in the media the lines of cars heading north. Why wouldn’t they? I think 24 hours would have been enough notice to man the borders. If you know your way about there are a lot of ways into Queensland and obviously people have worked it out. It seems fairly stupid to me.
Living in the northern part of NSW we have been glad that large numbers have not come here so that we have not had a problem with virus carriers.
Ron, Narrabri
●● ● It is commonsense not science. The border should have been closed between NSW and Victoria weeks ago and the airport closed to Victorians coming in.
The science takes too long to reach a conclusion, and one can liken it to closing the door after the horse has bolted.
Indeed science and modelling should take second seat behind commonsense in the instance of an extremely virulent virus.
Come on, Gladys, you are smart enough to know that once the commonsense door is closed it can always be reopened once the science tells you different.
Tim Reynolds, Moss Vale
Pandemic has us living in states of confusion Australian premiers are treating their states like their very own fiefdoms. Each state has its own rules and regulations on how to deal with this virus, on the advice of their unelected “health experts”, which is all very confusing.
The sheer arrogance and obfuscation of the Premier of Victoria, Daniel Andrews, in his handling of the botched and deadly hotels quarantine issue has placed Australia under tremendous strain, both health-wise and economically. There will never be a better time for a rethink on Australia’s Federation than now.
The states “stuff up” and it is left to the federal government to clean up the mess.
Janice Russell, Malua Bay
No nursing home for me I am sending a memo to my relatives — when they think I have lost it (and they probably think that now) don’t put me in a nursing home (Aged home claims ‘supermarkets are riskier than us’, 8/8). Instead, put me in a tent on a beach or a cabin overlooking the beach, with one of the young people I am so fortunate to know, as my carer and companion.
Unless this problem with nursing homes, where so many deaths from the virus have happened, is well and truly fixed, some of the politicians will be soon looking for another job.
Geoff Hinds, Merrylands
Defending cereal offenders If real estate personality Andrew Winter doesn’t want tenants “leaving breakfast in the sink”, perhaps the landlord shouldn’t be selling a house in which someone currently lives (The 10 Secrets to Selling Your House, 8/8). I’m paying your mortgage, mate. I’ll leave my breakfast where I like. Want a clean sink? Forego the rental income while you sell the place.
John Noble, Braddon, ACT
ASIC on fire over rip-off Hats off to ASIC recovering $3.6m in compensation for 5000 super members (Super funds rip-off: Get your compo, 8/8).
It seems that the transparency and honesty required from customers cynically does not apply to some super funds that ripped off wrongly-classified Aussies as smokers and charged higher fees for life insurance.
Steve Ngeow, Chatswood
A question of responsibility It just doesn’t make sense. Victoria’s borders are closed, citizens are restricted to their homes and only allowed out for certain reasons and for a certain length of time (unless they have a permit), everybody must wear a mask, they still have to obey social-distancing rules and now they also have a curfew, yet hundreds of new cases are still being recorded every day?
With the border closure, lockdown, curfew and other restrictions it begs the question of why infections are still so high — something is seriously wrong.
In my opinion, either the measures the Victorian government are implementing are not working (or not being enforced properly), or there are more stupid people than the government thinks deliberately going around ignoring restrictions for their own selfish reasons.
B Thompson, Cowra
Building on futility After the devastating fires earlier in the year, we were told that billions of native animals including koalas were incinerated.
If that is in fact correct, what is the point in requiring people wishing to rebuild their destroyed homes to obtain an expensive environmental report to identify virtually non-existent wildlife (Cruel green tape crisis, 7/8)?
John Stuart, St Fillans
Beauty amid the tragedy With all the bad news in the headlines regarding COVID-19 infections and deaths, job losses, the horror blast in Beirut and terrible attacks on police and paramedics, there was a nice story.
The special M4 baby delivery unlike the usual truck type (Dad used survival book to deliver his miracle baby on the M4, 8/8).
Construction worker David Price, armed with knowledge he’d read in his grandfather’s present of a British Army handbook given to him when he was 13, expertly delivered his baby girl following the instructions.
A heartwarming real life story.
Congratulations to David and Angela on the arrival of Lexi. They will have a very special story to tell at her 18th birthday party.
Marg Swindells, Castle Hill
Briefly … I agree … every day you see more cyclists (Cycling riding wave of popularity, 8/8). Unfortunately, they mainly ride on the footpath, and never use their bells so you are never aware of them rushing past you. The footpath used to be safe for pedestrians, not anymore.
Kathe Fraser, Bellevue Hill ●● ● Infectious diseases expert Peter Collignon is proselytising sending in “poo detectives” to test for the COVID-19 virus in untreated sewage (Experts: Time to send in poo detectives, 8/8). Will this work or will they just be going through the motions?
Peter Penglis, Kambah ●● ● Paul Kent couldn’t have put it any better by referring to Wayne Bennett as “an old man faded and vague and irrelevant” (Wayne’s world wanes, 8/8).
Alan Moore, Melba, ACT ●● ● Just when NSW had finally found the key to rugby league domination over Queensland, somebody has to invent a bloody virus. Truly, Annastacia, just because your joint is bereft of a Lewis/Langer/Lockyer, was locking us out your best answer?
Rosemary O’Brien, Ashfield ●● ● Every political leader is defending their actions by saying they are acting on “expert” medical advice. That explains the confusion.
Will Stedman, Salamander Bay ●● ● Let’s stop pussy-footing around, show some guts and send the Chinese government an invoice for the cost to our economy this pandemic has caused. After all, it started in their country and they are the people responsible.
David Ingram, Randwick ●● ● In this age of COVID-19, is it really necessary for our NRL players to be spitting and blowing stuff out of their noses on the field and in the change rooms. Guys, if you aren’t concerned about the virus, remember the game is televised.
Peter Jensen, Harrington

Data harvested by tech giants Google and Apple has illustrated in stark detail the sharp impact of coronavirus containment measures across the country, with the information showing just how effect­ive measures to limit movement have been.
Australia’s Chief Medical Officer Brendan Murphy released new information on Friday showing the dramatic changes in the way people across the nation had changed their behaviour during the outbreak.
The data shows a 60 per cent-plus fall in searches for driving directio­ns through Apple tech­nology in NSW, reflecting what Professor Murphy said was the success of the restrictions introduced in the state.
“This is showing how well people have adhered to our measures that we’ve put in place,” he said. “You can see some little spikes around Easter time but, generally, people are doing the right thing.” Data from Google shows similar trends. Google inform­ation shows that time spent by people in transit stations fell as much as 80 per cent in the wake of various measures aimed at limiting gatherings and restricting movement, with the data also pointing to an inverse rise in the amount of time spent at home.
While the uptake of the govern­ment’s COVIDSafe app has been slowed by concerns about privacy and the safety of data, the data highlighted by the professor shows that Australians have few concerns about giving away that same data to tech giants.
It was a point not lost on Professo­r Murphy, who again called for more Australians to sign up to COVIDSafe.
“Google does track people, the COVIDSafe app doesn’t,” he said. The data has been compiled by the Peter Doherty Institute for Infection and Immunity, which will release a report on Monday detailing similar measures for other states. The latest update came as Australia continued to make progress in tackling the virus.
Just 16 new cases were confirmed nationwide in the 24 hours before Friday’s update, continuing the flattening of the curve.
Australia’s success means bureaucrats have the very welcome problem of not having sufficient data to run their modelling.
Professor Murphy said NSW and Tasmania were now the only two states that had a statistically significant volume of cases to warrant modelling of the virus’s effect­ive reproduction rate number — a figure that illustrates the pace at which the virus spreads to other people.
Figures out of the ACT and the Northern Territory fell below the required threshold last week, and almost every other state has now dropped below that level.
“The case numbers in every other jurisdiction are so small that the modellers feel that they can’t usefully use the effective reprod­uction number,’’ he said.
“Those error margins are so broad in the other jurisdictions that the modellers aren’t comfortable with producing it, “Only in NSW and Tasmania are there enough numbers to show an effective reproduction number. And even then, they’re pretty much at the lower limit of what you would expect.”The reproduction number in Tasmania has now fallen below the benchmark of one, at which the virus diminishes.

Full text: JOHN F. Kennedy said: “Ask not what your country can do for you – ask what you can do for your country.” The question for today is what is the difference between COVID-19 and global heating.
There will be a great many that can be put forward but one of the biggest differences is how quickly these influences have taken up residence in our mind and societies lobally.
The fact that CO2 in our atmosphere is killing some people, maiming others, affecting land and farming and – if the computer modelling is correct – will gradually do these things in an even more draconian way is easy to push to the back of the mind (in the queue). For COVID-19, the deaths – and potentially your own – is definitely at the front of mind. That fact is very understandable.
Both influences need to be kept in the queue and while we sit out COVID-19 in the house and at great distance we are presented with a great opportunity to bring our changed climate forward in our thoughts.
After all, global heating and its effects are increasing despite the ‘show off’ COVID-19 doing “in your face”.
While we get on with this it’s a good time to remember Kennedy’ words. Anything that we can do to make it easier for our government and experts to slow the deaths and disruption needs to be our priority.
