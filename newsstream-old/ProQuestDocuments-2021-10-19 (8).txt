Full text: Daniel Andrews says his Victoria will stick with its road map out of lockdown and begin unwinding health restrictions when 70 per cent of adults are vaccinated next week, despite a sharp increase in the number of Covid-19 infections recorded.
While a record 2297 cases were reported on Thursday – higher than the forecast by the Burnet Institute modelling that the road map was based on – hospitalisations are lower than expected.
An analysis by The Australian comparing the NSW and Victorian Delta outbreaks also shows the latter state with a lower proportion of hospitalisations despite higher case numbers, at a point where a higher percentage of the population is vaccinated.
The Burnet Institute, which is due to update its modelling this week, predicted a seven-day ave­rage of 1960 cases by October 25, with 1666 people in hospital and 360 in ICU. As of Thursday, the seven-day average had reached 1806, but there were only 706 hospitalisations and 147 in ICU.
Eleven deaths reported on Thursday brought the state’s toll for the current outbreak to 125.
Thursday marked the 66th day of Victoria’s outbreak, which began amid short-lived celebrations of zero cases being reported on August 4. On the 66th day of the NSW outbreak – August 30 – that state had a seven-day average of 1018 cases, with 840 people in hospital, of whom 137 were in ICU. There had been 93 deaths.
While comparisons between the two states are imperfect, and there is generally a lag between people testing positive and being hospitalised or dying, the statistics point to those infected in the NSW outbreak in late August being more than twice as likely to require hospital treatment as their Victorian counterparts. As of Wednesday, 87.15 per cent of Victorians aged 16 and over had received one dose of Covid vaccine, and 62.65 per cent were fully vaccinated.
On August 30, 68.16 per cent of people in NSW aged 16 and over had received one dose, and just 37.07 per cent of the state’s population were fully vaccinated.
The Premier said case numbers were becoming less relevant as Victoria approached the 70 per cent full vaccination target set to be reached as soon as next Friday, when Melburnians would be released from lockdown.
“Once we’re open, which is sometime next week, we’re going to hit 70 per cent, then the case numbers do become less relevant,” Mr Andrews said.
Asked whether there was a danger of reopening being delayed because of the surge in case numbers, Mr Andrews said he’d struck a deal with Victorians, and they had kept up their end of the bargain. “We have, fundamentally, a very important agreement with the Victorian community. You get vaccinated and we will open up,” he said. “You know, we do what we say. We’re going to be opening up because people got vaccinated in record numbers.” Only 11 per cent of Victorians in hospital with Covid-19 on Thursday were fully vaccinated.
Some 46 per cent of Thursday’s 2297 cases were in people aged under 30, and 63 per cent were aged under 40.
There were 406 cases reported in NSW – and six deaths – while the ACT recorded 46 infections.
NSW is expected to hit 80 per cent vaccine coverage at the weekend, with more restrictions to ease on Monday.
Sonya Bennett, the commonwealth’s deputy chief medical ­officer, said the number of infections in Victoria was “disappointing but not unexpected”. “We don’t expect case numbers are going to rise exponentially, but we’ll probably continue to see high case numbers for some time, and then expect to see them come down as vaccination continues to increase daily, which is what we’re seeing.” she said.

ICU beds for very ill harder to find

Full text: Doctors say it is becoming harder to find beds for critically ill Victorians and patients who have undergone life-saving surgery amid rising COVID-related hospitalisations, and they predict the pressure will worsen before it gets better.
As Victoria reported a national daily record of 1763 new COVID-19 cases and four more deaths yesterday, Australian Medical Association Victoria vice-president Sarah Whitelaw said the hospital system faced mounting challenges in caring for COVID and non-COVID patients.
A key aim of repeated lockdowns was to stop the hospital system being overwhelmed, but Dr Whitelaw said it was increasingly likely Victoria would face that scenario in coming months.
"I think it would be fair to say everybody is saying this is escalating more quickly than we had hoped," she said. "It's tracking pretty much along the Burnet [Institute] modelling curve, and we are desperately all hoping for a bend in the curve."
The modelling shows that in 63 per cent of simulations the state would need more than 2500 beds for COVID-19 patients by mid-December, a scenario The Age this week revealed would reduce emergency care capacity to a minimum and mean only the sickest people get treatment.
Director of the Centre for Integrated Critical Care at the University of Melbourne David Story said intensive care wards in Melbourne's major hospitals were quickly filling with coronavirus patients, making it hard to find beds for critically ill non-COVID patients and those needing care after surgeries.
"We are now very concerned about being able to provide the appropriate care for people who require critical care," he said.
"People will need to come into the intensive care unit with non-COVID problems and the place is full."
Austin Health intensive care director Stephen Warrillow said beds would always be found for patients who need them, and even before the pandemic this process may have required someone to stay in the emergency department receiving care before a bed was available elsewhere. "It's very common for us to have to reorganise ourselves to accommodate that person in entirely normal times," he said.
There was general agreement among senior doctors contacted by The Age that pressure on the healthcare system was higher than ever, even before the predicted influx of coronavirus patients needing hospitalisation.
"The pressure being so consistent and persistent is causing higher levels of fatigue than we would usually see," Dr Warrillow said.
Royal Australian College of General Practitioners Victoria chair Anita Munoz said that over the past few weeks she had heard a number of "incredibly concerning" stories about the impact of the hundreds of COVID-positive patients needing hospital care.
She cited an instance in which surgery for a heart attack patient was delayed because no intensive care unit beds were available.
"Because the ICU was full of COVID-positive patients, the man couldn't have the surgery that he required. He actually ended up having a second heart attack, before his surgery could be done," Dr Munoz said. "I also know of another person who went to a hospital with sepsis and had a similar experience. He couldn't access an ICU bed so he had to be treated on the ward when he really should have been in ICU.
"These stories are becoming more and more common and the issue is ICUs are filling up with unvaccinated COVID patients and we are seeing other patients - fully vaccinated patients - having medical conditions and they can't access the optimal treatment because of this ongoing wave of COVID."
More than 500 Victorians are in hospital with COVID-19, including 101 people in intensive care.
In another sign of the health system straining under the weight of rising COVID-19 cases, elective surgeries have been cut by 50 per cent at some private hospitals as doctors are told to use greater discretion to prioritise only the sickest patients.
Things could be far worse without ongoing restrictions, according to Premier Daniel Andrews, who suggested daily case numbers would have been above 10,000 without Melbourne's lengthy lockdown. "We have more cases than we would like but without a lockdown on, then we would have many, many more cases and many, many more people in hospital," he said yesterday.
The Premier said Victoria remained on track to reopen in about three weeks at the 70 per cent double-dose vaccination target.

Full text: But the owners of Kirramisu Cafe and Restaurant are brushing off Queensland Health’s blunder despite the list – and subsequent error – taking more than eight hours to become public.
The cafe was last week mistakenly identified after a confirmed case was believed to have visited, however, health officials later learned that was incorrect.
Haig St Cafe and Restaurant – which operates next door to Kirramisu on Musgrave Street under the same ownership – was in fact the exposure site.
Premier Annastacia Palaszczuk visited that same cafe on September 27 about an hour after the infected man: “Due to the mix up we decided we’d deep clean as a precaution across the two venues. At least Annastacia knows where the best coffee in Kirra is … or does she,” management joked in a post to social media.
For rolling coverage watch Sky News Australia on Foxtel or visit www.skynews.com.au.
The blunder was quickly realised at the weekend when it became evident Kirramisu had been closed since August due to the current border situation.
Both venues will be closed until at least October 11: “(This) has been such an emotional time and loss for our team but we will keep you updated as much as we can,” management wrote.
“This caused a great deal of confusion for all involved, including the Premier that apparently visited Kirramisu this week.”
Bosses confirmed a total 14 of the cafe’s 17 staff members had been tested and were self-isolating. The remaining three staffers are locked out of state in Tweed.
A spokesperson for the premier said Ms Palaszczuk was not required to get tested or self-isolate as she did not attend the venue at the same time as the Covid case.
“The Premier was in that area on Monday but not during the exposure time” the spokesperson said, adding Queensland Health confirmed no further action was required.

FULL LIST: New exposure sites in Tweed Heads, northern NSW October 1, 2021
NSW Health has updated its exposure sites to include Tweed Heads businesses as well as eateries in Cabarita Beach and a petrol station in South Murwillumbah.

EARLIER
MORE than ten southern Gold Coast businesses have been named as new exposure sites after a confirmed Covid case visited the area in recent days.
Queensland has recorded two new local Covid cases and two overseas-acquired cases detected in hotel quarantine on Saturday.
NSW recorded 813 cases and 10 deaths in the same time period.
Queensland Premier Annastacia Palaszczuk revealed on Friday a man - linked to the Eaton’s Hill aviation cluster - had spent time in the Kirra area since September 25 while holidaying with his family, moving about the community while unknowingly infected.
His two children have now tested positive as well.
Chief health officer Jeannette Young said: “We’re double checking there weren’t any other venues they attended.
“But now every single day that we don’t have community transmission is another day that more than 50,000 Queenslanders have the opportunity to get vaccinated.
“We have plenty of vaccine.”
The cases were detected in home quarantine, however authorities are still looking at whether they spent any time in the community.
Meanwhile, the state government is still refusing to say if the border will open when 80 per cent of the population is vaccinated.
“I have said continuously around the 80 per cent threshold that the Doherty Institute modelling is not just about percentage,” Ms D’Ath said.
“It’s also … the number of outbreaks you’ve got.”
Greenmount Surf Club and popular eatery Kirramisu Café and Restaurant have been listed among 11 exposure sites in the border community.
If you are a potential contact, please refer to Queensland Health for further advice.

South Gold Coast venue reveals exposure site status October 1, 2021
A GOLD Coast Surf Club feared to be an exposure site after a confirmed Covid case visited late last week has been given the all-clear by health authorities.
Surf Life Saving Queensland released a statement late Friday afternoon, revealing Kirra Surf Club officials had been informed by Queensland Health it was not an exposure site.
It comes after a Covid-positive man visiting from Brisbane spent four days moving about the Kirra area while unknowingly infected.
Queensland Premier Annastacia Palaszczuk revealed earlier today the case was linked to the Eatons Hill aviation cluster detailed earlier this week.
The man stayed at the iconic Kirra Beach Resort with his wife and two children and they visited North Kirra Surf Life Saving Club, Kirra Surf Club, Timezone at Coolangatta, Woolworths at The Strand shopping complex, as well as cafes in the area.
No further Kirra sites have been added to Queensland Health’s exposure sites at this time.

New Covid cases travelled to southern Gold Coast October 1, 2021
QUEENSLAND has recorded two new local Covid-19 cases, but the southeast has dodged a lockdown for now despite concerns about exposure sites on the southern Gold Coast.
Premier Annastacia Palaszczuk revealed the two new locally acquired cases and one new overseas case at a press conference at Brisbane just after 10am on Friday morning.

She said one local case was linked to the Eatons Hill aviation cluster detailed earlier this week and that the person had spent four days on the southern Coast on holidays from September 25.
He stayed at the iconic Kirra Beach Resort with his wife and two children and they visited North Kirra Surf Life Saving Club, Kirra Surf Club, Timezone at Coolangatta, Woolworths at The Strand shopping complex, as well as cafes in the area.
Specific dates, times and locations will be posted on the Queensland Health website soon.
“Anyone who has been to any of those venues or in that part of the Gold Coast over the past week and has any symptoms it’s important, now is the time to really please come forward and get tested,” Dr Young said.

The second local case, a man who travels the east coast relocating animals, became infected in New South Wales and was in the southern Coast community for one day on September 29.
Dr Young said that case was not of particular concern.
“I don’t think he’s a risk,” she said.
Ms Palaszczuk said the new overseas case became infected in Egypt and was detected in hotel quarantine.
No mystery cases have emerged, which would have been a likely trigger for a snap lockdown.
“It’s encouraging news today that we don’t have unlinked community transmission and we have high levels of testing,” Ms Palaszczuk said.
“If the advice is to go into lockdown, we will go into lockdown.
“The fundamental reason we’re not in lock down is because we don’t have any seeding or unlinked community transmission."
Ms Palaszczuk said 19,764 tests had been undertaken in the previous 24 hours, which gave the government “an additional level of confidence”.
There was 22 coronavirus cases active in the community on Friday.

Health Minister Yvette D’Ath said compared to the situation ahead of the previous lockdown related to the Indooroopilly cluster, Queensland’s vaccination rate was now 20 per cent higher, and 4.8 million doses of the Covid vaccine had been administered across the state.
She urged everyone to get a vaccine, even those on holidays, saying they shouldn’t wait for appointments but should instead get a jab “today”.
“Please don’t wait, we want people to come out and get vaccinated,” she said.
Ms D’Ath said with walk-ins were available at every Queensland Health vaccination centre. She urged people to get their vaccine ahead of scheduled appointments, even if it was only days away.

On Thursday Queensland Police stopped more than 14,600 vehicles at the border and more than 100 were refused entry because they did not have the proper exemptions to enter Queensland.
Officers also handed out 67 masks.
Meanwhile, Victoria has 1143 new local cases and three deaths, it was announced on Friday, while NSW recorded 864 new cases and 15 deaths
Queensland has recorded 2039 cases in total since the pandemic began, seven people with the virus have died and 2005 patients have recovered.
On Thursday, Ms Palaszczuk warned the state is in a “critical” period to stop the spread of the Delta variant of the virus throughout Queensland.
Queensland Stage 2 restrictions reintroduced 30/9/21
Locally acquired cases have been spreading across the Coast, Brisbane, Moreton Bay and Townsville, but contact tracers have pinpointed their origins within a day.
A lockdown has been avoided partially due to rising vaccination rates and the use of face masks.
Late on Thursday, it was reported 52 people had been forced into home quarantine after a 14-year-old girl attending a bronze medallion course at Southport Surf Life Saving Club tested positive.
The girl was one of six new cases of Covid recorded in Queensland on Thursday, which came after a Biggera Waters resident and a Gaven resident both tested positive.
The trio of new cases resulted in the publication of new exposure sites across the Coast.
The Queensland government has urged the community to continue to social distance.
Anyone who is unwell, or displaying even the mildest coronavirus symptoms, should stay home and immediately phone their GP or 13 HEALTH (13 43 25 84) to arrange a test.

Hospitals face rationing of care

Full text: An official state government document reveals Victorian hospitals would be forced to ration care in emergency departments to a minimum level and turn away all but the sickest COVID patients if a predicted rush of cases hits the system in mid-December.
The document released by the Premier's office says if more than 2500 COVID patients are admitted to hospital - a scenario in 63 per cent of road map simulations conducted by the Burnet Institute - the system would come under "unviable workforce pressure".
The result would be that only a minimum level of emergency medical care could be provided in an "indicative scenario" outlined in the government briefing document.
A peak in COVID-19 cases is predicted to arrive around mid-December after key restrictions are scrapped, allowing Victorians to have people in their homes, dine out and hold large weddings.
But the document also suggests that hospitals could be forced much sooner to make big compromises to the care they provide. When more than 1000 COVID patients need care, it is expected that category-one elective surgeries, which should be performed within 30 days, would need to be paused.
There are already almost 500 COVID patients in hospital, and the government's briefing document suggests that once this number hits 600, alternative staffing arrangements might have to be considered, more patients cared for at home and further "non-urgent" elective surgeries delayed.
The latest revelations came as Melbourne yesterday became the most locked down city in the world, having endured a total of 245 days in lockdown, with at least another three weeks before restrictions ease.
However, Chief Health Officer Brett Sutton blamed Australia's slow vaccination rollout, saying the state had "no choice" but to "have a lockdown to manage potentially catastrophic numbers and catastrophic numbers of deaths".
"The difference of vaccination is really going to be our pathway out of here," Professor Sutton said.
The state recorded 1377 new daily cases yesterday and 498 people in hospital with COVID-19, of whom 96 are in ICU and 59 are on a ventilator.
As hospitals attempt to keep up with the demand, The Age can reveal some government policies designed to take pressure off the system are, in fact, putting patients at risk, according to a physician.
One such policy, known as "rapid offloading" now requires certain non-COVID patients who are transported to emergency departments to be placed in a chair to await treatment, while patients with COVID and suspected COVID are assessed and treated as a matter of priority.
In theory, paramedics transfer the patient, while triage nurses and doctors determine whether they are "fit to sit". However, Mya Cubitt, the Victorian faculty chair of the Australasian College for Emergency Medicine, said a lack of department clarity over this measure was creating "some dangerous situations for patients and unnecessary conflict between staff".
"While there might be a spare chair, there's not necessarily a nurse or a clinician to care for that patient and keep them safe while they're in their chair," Dr Cubitt said.
"The rapid offload policy is a deeply understandable solution to a ramping crisis, but it will lead to a patient being offloaded into an increasingly overcrowded emergency department, and it may unintentionally put patients at risk and increase the chance of an emergency department COVID-19 exposure."
It is another example of the intense strain already being felt by burnt-out staff as rising COVID cases add to record demand on the health system. Last week a Melbourne hospital in a COVID hotspot reported its highest ever number of emergency department presentations, while calls to triple zero reached levels not seen since the 2016 thunderstorm asthma event.
Of concern, Victoria's daily cases are still tracking within the range that's been predicted by the Burnet Institute, which estimated weeks ago that there would be 1400 to 2900 daily diagnoses by the end of October.
But the experts behind this modelling, including co-author Professor Margaret Hellard, said Victorians still have the power to change this trajectory, reduce the severity of the peak and thereby the impact on the hospital system, by getting vaccinated, getting tested if they have COVID symptoms and abiding by restrictions.
Professor Hellard cautioned that the modelling wasn't able to predict the future, but instead outlined what cases could look like under certain circumstances.
Other scenarios modelled show that relatively small changes to behaviour, such as more vaccinated people coming forward to get tested for COVID if they had mild symptoms, could ultimately lead to a drastic reduction in case numbers and hospitalisations - in some cases, by the thousands.
In the government's outline of the impact of COVID cases on health system capacity, there are five different levels of response. The first and current stage, for when hospital patients are up to 600, involves changes to elective surgery and an increase in home-based case.
Elective surgery would be reduced to a minimum at stage three, between 1000 and 1500 cases, and there would be reduced access to emergency care at stage four, between 1500 and 2500 hospitalisations.
Stage five, described as an "indicative scenario only" when the number of patients in hospital with COVID exceeds 2500, would result in hospitals only treating the sickest COVID-19 cases, minimal emergency department access and "unviable workforce pressure".

COVID raises the stakes - are we ready?

Full text: That long anticipated day when NSW re-opens from its COVID hibernation is drawing closer. But is our health system ready for it?
It will begin with some eased restrictions on the Monday after the state hits 70 per cent double vaccinations. Even greater freedoms can be expected when that double vaccination rate hits 80 per cent.
The state-wide road map to re-opening is based on modelling by the Doherty Institute, and that first target is shaping up to be mid-October. While at first glance the promise of more freedoms seems like a positive, the big question is 'are our rural, regional and remote communities ready?' More specifically 'is our health system ready?'
How will our health professionals cope with an anticipated increase in patients, in particular COVID-affected patients requiring isolation, and possibly intensive care and ventilation?
The Doherty report notes that "even high levels of vaccination will not be sufficient to stop COVID-19 in its tracks".
Many would argue that our health system has been in poor health for quite some time - well before the threat of COVID added significantly to the expectations and burden on our frontline workers such as doctors, nurses and paramedics. Submissions and witness testimony to a State parliamentary inquiry that began in September last year paint a picture of an already chronically ill system.
Health Services Union NSW Secretary, Gerard Hayes, has been quite clear about his concern that our regional and rural health care services are not prepared for what lies ahead. "I'm not saying this to be obtuse, but what we have seen over the past decade has been a system tightening its belt constantly and working to be as lean as possible," Mr Hayes said.
There have been millions of dollars allocated to hospital upgrades across the state in recent years but this is all window dressing. More skilled health specialists on the ground are what is really needed.
What good are extra beds in an upgraded hospital if there are not enough staff to adequately support the patients in those beds? It is apparent that the powers-that-be have belatedly realised this fact with a recent call out to retired health staff to return to the fold. This may well be too little too late. Our health service should never have been allowed to get to this state.
Burn out among health professionals, pushed beyond the limit to provide care for patients, could well be our next health disaster. We don't have a vaccine for that.
We do have them for COVID-19, though. High vaccination rates are key to minimising harm as we do so. So too is an adequately resourced and funded health system. It is well past time regional, rural and remote NSW had one.

It will begin with some eased restrictions on the Monday after the state hits 70 per cent double vaccinations. Even greater freedoms can be expected when that double vaccination rate hits 80 per cent and then again when it reaches 90 per cent.
The latter is expected to occur in December.
If the situation just down the road at Cowra over the past two weeks is a window into what will happen statewide when restrictions are eased we should all be concerned.

The new Parkes Hospital is an excellent case in point where the maternity ward isn't used because, we're told, staff can't be sourced.
It is apparent that the powers-that-be have belatedly realised there is staffing crisis statewide with a recent call out to retired health staff to return to the fold. Quite frankly this may well be too little to late. Our health service should never have been allowed to get to this depleted state.
Dr Debra King, North Coast representative on the Royal Australian College of General Practitioners NSW board fears an increase in general practitioners getting burnt out with the increased workload.
"Our workforce doesn't go up, we just work longer hours," she said.
Burn out among health professionals, pushed beyond the limit to provide care for patients, could well be our next health disaster. We don't have a vaccine for that.
We do have them for COVID-19, though.
Ready or not, we must move out of the lockdown phase of the pandemic.
High vaccination rates are key to minimising harm as we do so.
So too is an adequately resourced and funded health system.

Full text: VICTORIA’S Health Department has been hit with 58 charges over alleged safety failings in the state’s hotel quarantine program, as the state again recorded more Covid cases than NSW.
The Health Department faces a total fine of $95.1m if found guilty of all charges.
WorkSafe Victoria issued the charges following a 15-month investigation into hotel quarantine bungles that led to Melbourne’s second wave.
The regulator alleges the department failed to provide a safe working environment for employees and put others not employed by the department at risk.
The news came as Victoria marked a grim new record, recording 950 new cases and seven deaths. The results came from 61,322 tests.
But as case numbers continue to climb in Victoria, the NSW outbreak appears to be on the decline.
NSW reported 863 new cases on Wednesday, but in the state’s deadliest day yet, 15 deaths were reported.
Deakin University epidemiologist Catherine Bennett is hopeful the speed at which case numbers are increasing in Victoria will continue to slow.
Victorian infections have surpassed NSW case numbers for three days running. Despite Victorian Premier Daniel Andrews imposing some of the harshest lockdown measures in the country, the state is on track to hit a rolling seven-day average of 1960 cases a day by October 25, according to Burnet Institute modelling. It shows ­infections then beginning to decline.
Professor Bennett said the “rapid growth” in the early stages of the outbreak suggested ­“restrictions in place in Victoria weren’t working as well (as in NSW)”.
But she said the concentration of cases in western and southwestern Sydney benefited NSW, compared to Victoria where cases are more spread out.
“It’s harder to have good compliance at a whole city or state level,” she said. Burnet Institute modelling, prepared for the NSW government, predicted cases in local government areas of concern would peak at a seven-day average of about 1500 new infections a day in mid-September.
Premier Gladys Berejiklian has been hesitant to declare that NSW has reached the peak of infections, but analysts have projected cases will continue to fall.
University of Melbourne Research fellow Chris Billington has estimated that NSW’s “R-effective” – the rate at which Covid spreads – is now at 0.85. The same researcher has estimated Victoria’s R-effective at 1.31, meaning cases will continue to increase.
The percentage of positive swabs in Victoria is significantly higher than in NSW. The 950 cases reported by Victoria on Wednesday came from 61,300 tests – with 1.55 per cent of tests positive.
Significantly more tests are being done each day in NSW. On Wednesday, just 0.72 per cent of tests came back positive. Professor Bennett said that the speed at which case numbers were increasing was slowing down, but the growth appeared more dramatic due to high infection numbers.

Premier Gladys Berejiklian has been hesitant to declare that NSW has reached the peak of infections, but analysts have projected cases will continue to fall.
University of Melbourne Research fellow Chris Billington has estimated that NSW’s “R-effective” – the rate at which Covid spreads – is now at 0.85. The same researcher has estimated Victoria’s R-effective at 1.31, meaning cases will continue to increase.
The percentage of positive swabs in Victoria is significantly higher than in NSW. The 950 cases reported by Victoria on Wednesday came from 61,300 tests – with 1.55 per cent of tests positive.
Significantly more tests are being done each day in NSW. On Wednesday, just 0.72 per cent of tests came back positive. Professor Bennett said that the speed at which case numbers were increasing was slowing down, but the growth appeared more dramatic due to high infection numbers.

Full text: That long anticipated day when NSW re-opens from its COVID hibernation is drawing closer. But is our health system ready for it?
It will begin with some eased restrictions on the Monday after the state hits 70 per cent double vaccinations. Even greater freedoms can be expected when that double vaccination rate hits 80 per cent and then again when it reaches 90 per cent.
The latter is expected to occur in December.
If the Cowra situation over the past two weeks is a window into what will happen statewide when restrictions are eased we should all be concerned.
Cowra celebrated when it came out of lockdown but the freedom of movement that we received resulted in the town's first cases.
Since the first case the situation has worsened with Cowra now fast approaching 30 cases, most of them children under the age of 10.
The state-wide road map to re-opening is based on modelling by the Doherty Institute, and that first target is shaping up to be mid-October. That's now just a matter of weeks away.
While at first glance the promise of more freedoms seems like a positive, the big question is 'are our rural, regional and remote communities ready?' More specifically 'is our health system ready?'
How will our health professionals cope with an anticipated increase in patients, in particular COVID-affected patients requiring isolation, and possibly intensive care and ventilation?
The Doherty report notes that "even high levels of vaccination will not be sufficient to stop COVID-19 in its tracks".
The health landscape has changed forever because of this pandemic. And that impacts every one of us.
Many would argue that our health system has been in poor health for quite some time - well before the threat of COVID added significantly to the expectations and burden on our frontline workers such as doctors, nurses and paramedics.
Submissions and witness testimony to a State parliamentary inquiry that began in September last year paint a picture of an already chronically ill system.
Health Services Union NSW Secretary, Gerard Hayes, has been quite clear about his concern that our regional and rural health care services are not prepared for what lies ahead despite assurances from health, including Western NSW Local Health District which manages Cowra Hospital, that all is well.
"I'm not saying this to be obtuse, but what we have seen over the past decade has been a system tightening its belt constantly and working to be as lean as possible," Mr Hayes said.
Sure there have been millions of dollars allocated to hospital upgrades across the state in recent years but this is all window dressing. More skilled health specialists on the ground are what is really needed.
What good are extra beds in an upgraded hospital if there are not enough staff to adequately support the patients that may occupy those beds?
The new Parkes Hospital is an excellent case in point where the maternity ward isn't used because, we're told, staff can't be sourced.
It is apparent that the powers-that-be have belatedly realised there is staffing crisis statewide with a recent call out to retired health staff to return to the fold. Quite frankly this may well be too little to late. Our health service should never have been allowed to get to this depleted state.
Dr Debra King, North Coast representative on the Royal Australian College of General Practitioners NSW board fears an increase in general practitioners getting burnt out with the increased workload.
"Our workforce doesn't go up, we just work longer hours," she said.
Burn out among health professionals, pushed beyond the limit to provide care for patients, could well be our next health disaster. We don't have a vaccine for that.
We do have them for COVID-19, though.
Ready or not, we must move out of the lockdown phase of the pandemic.
High vaccination rates are key to minimising harm as we do so.
So too is an adequately resourced and funded health system.
It is well past time regional, rural and remote NSW had one.

Full text: The Health Department faces a total fine of $95.1m if found guilty of all charges.
WorkSafe Victoria issued the charges following a 15-month investigation into hotel quarantine bungles that led to Melbourne’s second wave.
The regulator alleges the department failed to provide a safe working environment for employees and put others not employed by the department at risk.
The news came as Victoria marked a grim new record, recording 950 new cases and seven deaths. The results came from 61,322 tests.
But as case numbers continue to climb in Victoria, the NSW outbreak appears to be on the decline.
NSW reported 863 new cases on Wednesday, but in the state’s deadliest day yet, 15 deaths were reported.
Deakin University epidemiologist Catherine Bennett is hopeful the speed at which case numbers are increasing in Victoria will continue to slow.
Daily Telegraph - News Feed latest episode
Victorian infections have surpassed NSW case numbers for three days running.
Despite Victorian Premier Daniel Andrews imposing some of the harshest lockdown measures in the country, the state is on track to hit a rolling seven-day average of 1960 cases a day by October 25, according to Burnet Institute modelling. It shows ­infections then beginning to decline.
Professor Bennett said the “rapid growth” in the early stages of the outbreak suggested ­“restrictions in place in Victoria weren’t working as well (as in NSW)”.
But she said the concentration of cases in western and southwestern Sydney benefited NSW, compared to Victoria where cases are more spread out.
“It’s harder to have good compliance at a whole city or state level,” she said.
Burnet Institute modelling, prepared for the NSW government, predicted cases in local government areas of concern would peak at a seven-day average of about 1500 new infections a day in mid-September.
Premier Gladys Berejiklian has been hesitant to declare that NSW has reached the peak of infections, but analysts have projected cases will continue to fall.

Many would argue that our health system has been in poor health for quite some time - well before the threat of COVID added significantly to the expectations and burden on our frontline workers such as doctors, nurses and paramedics.
Submissions and witness testimony to a State parliamentary inquiry that began in September last year paint a picture of an already chronically ill system.
Health Services Union NSW Secretary, Gerard Hayes, has been quite clear about his concern that our regional and rural health care services are not prepared for what lies ahead.
"I'm not saying this to be obtuse, but what we have seen over the past decade has been a system tightening its belt constantly and working to be as lean as possible," Mr Hayes said.
Sure there have been millions of dollars allocated to hospital upgrades across the state in recent years, including new Eurobodalla Regional Hospital, but this is all window dressing.
More skilled health specialists on the ground are what is really needed.
What good are extra beds in an upgraded hospital if there are not enough staff to adequately support the patients that may occupy those beds?
It is apparent that the powers-that-be have belatedly realised this fact with a recent call out to retired health staff to return to the fold.
Quite frankly this may well be too little to late.
Our health service should never have been allowed to get to this depleted state.
Dr Debra King, North Coast representative on the Royal Australian College of General Practitioners NSW board fears an increase in general practitioners getting burnt out with the increased workload.
"Our workforce doesn't go up, we just work longer hours," she said.
Meanwhile, our paramedics are being pushed beyond the limit to transport seriously ill COVID patients to a hospital equipped for suitable treatment and isolation.
This is on top of a the normal workload typical of a pre-COVID environment.
Burn out among health professionals, pushed beyond the limit to provide care for patients, could well be our next health disaster.
e don't have a vaccine for that.
We do have them for COVID-19, though.
Ready or not, we must move out of the lockdown phase of the pandemic.
High vaccination rates are key to minimising harm as we do so.
So too is an adequately resourced and funded health system.
It is well past time regional, rural and remote NSW had one.

Full text: Is our health system ready for re-opening? That long anticipated day when NSW re-opens from its COVID hibernation is drawing closer.
But is our health system ready for it?
It will begin with some eased restrictions on the Monday after the state hits 70 per cent double vaccinations.
Even greater freedoms can be expected when that double vaccination rate hits 80 per cent.
The state-wide road map to re-opening is based on modelling by the Doherty Institute, and that first target is shaping up to be mid-October.
That's less than a month away.
While at first glance the promise of more freedoms seems like a positive, the big question is 'are our rural, regional and remote communities ready?'
More specifically 'is our health system ready?'
How will our health professionals cope with an anticipated increase in patients, in particular COVID-affected patients requiring isolation, and possibly intensive care and ventilation?
The Doherty report notes that "even high levels of vaccination will not be sufficient to stop COVID-19 in its tracks".
The health landscape has changed forever because of this pandemic.
And that impacts every one of us.

Full text: Sydney hits another hurdle on road to freedom as life is close to normal in other global cities SYDNEY’S so-called road map to reopening will leave Australia’s biggest city stuck in the slow lane, with not even the Doherty Institute’s ambitious goal of 80 per cent vaccination enough to fully win us back our freedom.
Instead, Premier Gladys Berejiklian made good on her promise that there would be no “freedom day”, announcing Monday that with 80 per cent of over-16s double dosed a swag of restrictions would remain in place, from a cap of 10 vaccinated visitors to the home to 4sq m limits on indoor hospitality.
“I don’t want to be a party pooper but I’ve said let’s not think about this as a freedom day but let’s think about this as a staged reopening to getting back to normal,” she said.
And while the announced road map does provides for a further winding back of ­restrictions in December, ­including allowing the ­unvaccinated to participate in more activities, it also foreshadows ongoing restrictions and localised lockdowns for years.
NSW residents also potentially face years of checking in to shops and venues after the Premier contradicted Customer Services Minister Victor Dominello, who was quoted on the weekend saying that QR codes and vaccine passports would be over once we reached “saturation levels” of vaccine coverage.
“Notwithstanding that these are my babies, I will be the first to turn them off,” Mr Dominello told local media.
“They are only to be used in pandemic situations.” However, suggesting that the government is not prepared to treat Covid as endemic, rather than pandemic, as much of the rest of the world is doing, Ms Berejiklian said Monday that “QR codes could be with us (as long as) Covid is”.
This despite the agreed ­national cabinet plan being to “manage Covid-19 consistent with public health management of other diseases”.
However a look around the world at places like New York, the UK, and Denmark shows that Sydney’s new “normal” will not be so normal after all – though they might point a way forward for our overly-cautious policy makers.
NEW YORK CITY The Big Apple is back.
Having experienced a horror start to the pandemic, made worse by government orders shipping positive Covid patients to nursing homes, New York City began planning to re-open the city as early as June, 2020, long before the ­development of vaccines.
While there were strict limits on indoor dining for much of the pandemic, through the winter of 2020-2021, hospitality continued to trade, with restaurants creating sometimes quite elaborate makeshift table areas carved out of streets with concrete bollards.
Notably, while the city experienced a second wave of deaths that peaked at about 100 a day earlier this year, this was a fraction of the 700 or more lives lost daily at the worst of the pandemic.
Today, the city has vaccination rates lower than locked-down Sydney’s, but comparable fatality rates – even as most of the city gets back to business.
Restaurateur Keith McNally, who owns a number of the city’s most famous restaurants including Balthazar and Minetta Tavern, regularly posts reports of the recovery on his Instagram account.
One recent report he shared from one of his maître d’s tells the story: “Tonight was a very busy night from the start. Lots of walk ins throughout to go with the reservations we had.
“We ended up with a total of 580 covers, 310 reservations, 270 walk-ins, 58 no-shows and 6 cancellations.” And all without a square- metre rule in sight.
UNITED KINGDOM When British Prime Minister Boris Johnson announced that the UK would end all coronavirus restrictions on what quickly became known as “freedom day”, commentators and many epidemiologists were aghast.
“In the competition between cautious policy change and recklessness, the British government appears to have chosen recklessness,” wrote Australian epidemiologist and Oxford University professor David Hunter at the time, summing up the views of many.
However, in a country that had endured some of the highest casualty rates from the pandemic as well as some of the toughest lockdowns, the prospect of an end to the rolling nightmare was worth the risk.
And, contrary to those who thought that an end to restrictions would mean total disaster, cases rose but deaths stayed far lower through a wave of the Delta variant than they did during the worst of the earlier waves of the pandemic.
Much of this is credited to a high rate of immunity in the population, with as many as 90 per cent of the population thought to have antibodies via vaccination or previous infection.
More important though is the change in attitude. Australian expats living in London remark that the local press barely covers coronavirus, while in Sydney it remains front-page news.
”It’s pretty much back to normal here," Londoner David Scullion said. “The only thing different is travel in and out of the country and you’re supposed to wear a mask on the Tube, but it’s not the law anymore and lots of people don’t.”
DENMARK Earlier this month Denmark took the extraordinary step of ending all pandemic restrictions – and getting to the stage envisioned by Australia’s own Doherty Institute modelling, which imagines that one day we too will live with the disease as we do with the flu and other illnesses.
With a population almost exactly that of Sydney, Denmark has had a relatively easy pandemic, suffering 2642 deaths.
Starting earlier this year, the country embarked on a program to see it out the other side of the pandemic, focusing on a vaccine program that concentrated on older and more vulnerable populations.
They also instituted a Coronapas, or coronavirus passport app, that showed the holder had either been vaccinated, been infected within the last three months (thus proving antibodies) or had recently had a negative test.
Experts say that high levels of social trust enabled the society to get there but that it is not impossible, even for Australia, where community spirit has been battered by extended lockdowns and state versus state bunfights.
“By end 2021, NSW should reach 90 per cent of eligible populations fully vaccinated (equating to more than 75 per cent total population),” infectious diseases physician Greg Dore of the UNSW’s Kirby Institute said.
“It would then be in a similar position to countries such as Denmark which has very safely removed almost all Covid restrictions.”

Surviving in epicentre of city's outbreak

Full text: COVID-19 has closed in on the City of Hume, report Sumeyya Ilanbey and Melissa Cunningham.
In early September, Harmeet Bedi received a notification from the Department of Health. Her five-year-old daughter, Baneet, had been exposed to COVID-19 at a Craigieburn childcare centre, and the family were told they would need to go into quarantine.
As more staff, children and parents linked to the centre became infected with coronavirus, their 14-day quarantine was extended. It's now been almost three weeks since the family have stepped outside their home.
"The virus is all around us," Ms Bedi says. "You feel targeted by it. We feel like we have been left to fend for ourselves out here. You feel like sitting ducks."
So far, they have tested negative. But they are among tens of thousands of families in the City of Hume - the epicentre of the outbreak - who were exposed to the virus, and forced into isolation, as positive cases or close contacts.
"We have no idea when we will be allowed to leave our home," Ms Bedi says. "But even when we are allowed to leave, there is a sense of just nervously waiting until you get told you've been at another exposure site. Will it be at the supermarket or the chemist? Many people around here are very scared."
On Friday morning, GP Umber Rind took to social media, revealing dozens of the 46 Victorians on ventilators in intensive care were from the Arabic-speaking community in the northern suburbs. Dr Rind, who has Arabic heritage, likened the scenes in the intensive care unit to a horror movie. Young and old in induced comas, strapped to breathing machines, their organs failing.
"This is not is not an exaggeration. It is a catastrophe," she said. "They are our people. Not one is vaccinated. The numbers are stacked up against us unless we act together. COVID is real."
Roughly 60 per cent of the Austin Hospital's intensive card ward is occupied by Arabic-speaking patients - a situation doctors in Australia have never seen before.
"It is heartbreaking, these are people in the community that we know," Dr Rind says. "I feel sad because this was all so predictable. It makes me so upset that our area in the north was not targeted for vaccines earlier."
COVID-19 has exploited vulnerabilities globally, and has pelted the City of Hume. While the stark contrast of haves and have-nots has always existed in the melting pot of Melbourne, the pandemic has widened that gap.
A once-bustling shopping strip in Dallas, 20 kilometres north of Melbourne's CBD, is deserted as the virus rapidly spreads through the municipality. Non-essential shopfronts are shuttered, and grocery stores are barely surviving as a few masked locals meander through. Outdoor tables, usually occupied by elderly men smoking cigarettes and playing backgammon, stand empty. The community hub is dormant.
Traders told The Age their businesses were desperately clinging to life as shops around them became exposure sites, visitors were locked in 14-day quarantine, and other potential patrons were scared off. Businesses are hurting, not just because customers have dried up, but because of delivery delays due to the outbreak.
Fear is gripping the region, according to Hume mayor Joseph Haweil, with people acutely aware an essential trip to the grocery shop could send them into quarantine, or worse, expose them to the virus.
"The people around here are very fatigued, very tired, very frustrated, and this added element of COVID being so prevalent in the community has put many people on the edge," Cr Haweil says.
"For a long time, people were concerned about the economic element, worried about their businesses no longer being allowed to operate, or they've lost their jobs. More recently, people are saying they're worried for their own safety, health and wellbeing."
Since the state's first Delta case in mid-July, about one-third of the total cases have been detected in Hume. Of almost 5000 cases reported in the municipality since the pandemic began, two-thirds were detected in recent weeks.
So, why has the virus spread like wildfire in the region? It's not simply because of egregious rule-breakers. COVID-19 commander Jeroen Weimar said yesterday about 55 per cent of transmission had occurred within the home, and the remaining through social interactions between households - someone helping their mother to do chores or another popping in to see their cousin. The virus has exploited Hume's weaknesses, accentuated society's fault lines and exacerbated the city's divide.
In comparison to other areas, the region has low vaccination rates, and fewer GPs per head of population. Until recently, it did not have a state-run vaccination hub. Its workforce is largely young and mobile, and it has a high number of large, multi-generational families, many of them new arrivals. These factors have helped create a perfect storm for transmission.
Hume is densely populated. It's home to 240,000 people, about 4.5 per cent of Greater Melbourne's population, with an average household of 3.1 people, compared with Greater Melbourne's average of 2.7, according to SGS Economics and Planning.
When the fast-moving Delta variant infects one member of a family, it can rapidly spread through a home. In Hume, where large families are common, that effect is more pronounced. While the municipality has about 3.9 per cent of all households in Melbourne, it has 8.5 per cent of the households with more than six residents, and 10 per cent of households that have more than eight people.
Fifty-four per cent of Hume's workforce are essential workers who might need to travel for their jobs, making it the sixth-most mobile local government area in metropolitan Melbourne. Comparatively, about 35 per cent of workers in the affluent Stonnington, Yarra and Port Phillip regions potentially need to travel.
"I think it does highlight that Hume and a few of these outer areas have higher risk factors, which would mean there's potential for residents in that area to contract COVID more easily, and spread it within their larger households," says Julian Szafraniec, SGS Economics and Planning's principal and partner.
Despite its vulnerabilities,
Hume's access to vaccines was among the lowest in Victoria. As soon as the federal government declared in February that general practice clinics would be the "cornerstone" of Australia's vaccination scheme, the rollout was doomed to be inequitable.
While Yarra had 8.5 GPs per 1000 residents, Stonnington 6.8 and Monash 5.5, Hume had only 2.9 GPs per 1000 people.
Then there was the advice from the Australian Technical Advisory Group on Immunisation, which ultimately assessed individual risk as opposed to societal risk. It stated vaccines should be prioritised for quarantine workers, healthcare staff, the elderly and the ill. Those who were younger, mobile and more likely to spread the disease were not considered a priority.
So, the City of Hume - where large swaths of the region are ranked as "most disadvantaged" by the Australian Bureau of Statistics - was sent to the back of the queue with its young population, despite its vulnerabilities.
"This whole time we were in the wilderness, yelling out, 'Hey we know the demographic of this area - it has a low socio-economic status, people who work across different shifts and jobs, travel from place to place to get to work, have large families. This is a recipe for disaster'," Cr Haweil says.
In early September when coronavirus cases skyrocketed, Hume again proved to be a fertile ground for transmission.
On September 5, only 26 per cent of the eligible population was fully vaccinated, and 48.2 per cent had received one dose. The statewide average at the time was 37.2 per cent and 59.7 per cent, respectively. Since then, vaccination uptake has increased by one-third, as health authorities diverted resources and attention to the region starved of access to jabs.
About two weeks ago, the Commonwealth sent several hundred thousand extra Pfizer and Moderna jabs to GPs, pharmacies and state-run hubs in Melbourne's north and west. The state government established a drive-through vaccination clinic at the old Ford factory in Campbellfield (which had cars banked up on the main road when The Age visited this week), a mass vaccination centre at Broadmeadows Town Hall, a culturally appropriate hub at Broadmeadows Community Hub (where half the patients required translators), and several walk-in pop-ups at schools.
"What was required in Hume was a big team effort, and everyone putting in the effort together ... It's now a race between the virus and the vaccine, I can see that playing out in Hume," says local GP Dr Amrooha Hussain.
Kerim Buday, a Hume local, has phoned many people in recent weeks about the unfolding crisis. Some want to know how they can help with the vaccination effort, others offer to support those infected or forced into isolation.
He cites the Turkish proverb, Ates dustugu yeri yakar - no one else can fully understand the pain or grieve as much as the person who suffers it - to explain the experience in Hume, where the virus has hit so close to home this year.
"People we know really well in the community are being affected; they are being hospitalised, they're in intensive care," he says. "It also feels like every second place you walk into is an exposure site. It's all around us, and it feels like it's everywhere. More and more people are hesitant to step outside and get caught up. But having said all of that, the community is really coming together, trying to help wherever it can with whatever it can."
Though there is frustration and fatigue, there is also a deep sense of sorrow for all the people this tight-knit community has lost. Broadmeadows man Abdul was caught up in the MyCentre cluster, that began when a staff member worked while symptomatic for about a week before getting tested, early this month.
One of his children caught the virus and passed it to her three siblings, mother and grandmother. Abdul says the elderly woman waited too long to seek medical help, and she died, becoming Victoria's first COVID-19 death this year. Abdul pleaded with people to get tested and vaccinated.
"I haven't tested positive to COVID, Alhamdulillah (thank God). But COVID doesn't care about your faith, your community, or your gender. COVID affects everyone the same," he says.
Despite a harsh lockdown, the virus continues to spread in the northern suburbs, infecting hundreds a day. Community groups have quietly banded together, sending food and supplies to the thousands isolated at home.
Dalal Sleiman is president of Australian Chaldean Family Welfare, a not-for-profit organisation supporting Chaldean and Arabic-speakers. During the outbreak, she has made videos providing vaccination information in Chaldean, Assyrian and Arabic.
She has supported eight large Arabic families in Hume, all infected with the virus, and countless other families isolating after being exposed to it.
One family she supported had just received their first vaccination dose when the entire household was infected with the virus, including a two-year-old boy, who got so sick he was in intensive care.
"One of the sons caught the virus from a colleague at work, and he did not know he was infected, and he came home and infected his whole family," she says. "The family were so worried they thought they were going to lose their child ... Mentally and emotionally, people are doing it so tough."
The Delta variant has changed the course of the pandemic. An increasing number of people have died at home with the virus in Australia this year, including two Victorian women and a NSW mother of three in her 30s.
Each day, staff at Cohealth - which supports about 40 per cent of those infected with coronavirus in Melbourne's north and west - calls ambulances for people who fall critically ill at home.
Cohealth GP Nicole Allard says that while last year it was the elderly and frail, this year young, unvaccinated people are falling seriously ill, most on or after day five of their diagnosis.
"We've got a lot of people in intensive care, in hospital, but what the public is not seeing is the high number of people who are very unwell at home," she says.
Dr Allard says the disease is far milder for those vaccinated, and they rarely require intensive care.
If there could be a silver lining from the pandemic, University of Melbourne researcher Jason Thompson hopes it will highlight, then help break, the entrenched societal patterns whereby diseases disproportionately affect the most vulnerable. Across the world, lower socio-economic communities, the culturally and linguistically diverse, and those with insecure but essential work, have been infected, impoverished and killed at the highest rates by COVID-19.
"This comes down to issues that are being raised across Australia about who's going to be left behind in this vaccination race," says Dr Thompson, who worked on the state government's epidemic modelling. "The tragedy is that it will be the same people who are always vulnerable: the poorest, the people who don't have social support or secure work.
"This will play out in coronavirus, like it does with everything else, whether it's workplace injury, road safety or cardiovascular disease. We should be trying to do everything we can to help them catch up. And, that's not just for coronavirus, it's
for everything."

Full text: A FORMAL complaint has been lodged by the Queensland Opposition over allegations Premier Annastacia Palaszczuk deliberately misled parliament on Covid-19 pandemic modelling.
The Premier, in a highly charged parliamentary performance earlier this month, relied on extrapolated worst-case scenario Doherty Institute modelling to claim thousands would die if there wasn’t a “serious discussion” on the path out of Covid-19.
“Doherty Institute modelling predicts that even with 70 per cent of the population vaccinated, 80 people will die each day from Covid once the outbreak reaches six months after it started,” she said. “That is 2240 who will die each month.” The assertions, which were also made on social media, have been debunked by the media and experts, including ABC’s Fact Check, as misleading.
On Friday, Opposition Integrity spokeswoman Fiona Simpson confirmed the LNP had formally asked Speaker Curtis Pitt to refer the Premier to the Ethics Committee.
A spokesperson for Ms Palaszczuk said the Premier was using figures outlined in the Doherty report which is publicly available. COVID LATEST: P6-8

Push beyond 80 per cent vax rates needed: report

Full text: Vaccinating 80 per cent of adults against coronavirus won't be enough to end lockdowns, according to new modelling urging Australia to immunise children as young as five.
While vaccinations are crucial, University of Melbourne epidemiologist Tony Blakely also flags they aren't the only tool in the box.
Maintaining minimum density limits, people continuing to work from home, having mass rapid antigen tests and better air filtration systems would all help reduce lockdowns.

Bendigo to hit 90 per cent first-dose vaccination rate by end of month Professor Blakely foreshadows vaccinating 90 per cent of the population down to the age of five would result in lockdowns being used 14 per cent of the time.
"What the modelling shows is that at 80 per cent of adults vaccinated, life won't be tickety-boo next year. We need to do more than that,' he told the ABC on Tuesday.
"Sometime early next year, probably, we'll get to 90 per cent. As people see their friends get incentivised because they see their friends getting sick, or as people realise that if they go to the pub or the community sports centre they need to be vaccinated."
It comes as updated Doherty Institute modelling, underpinning a national reopening plan, predicts stay-at-home orders will be needed with double-dose rates of between 70 and 80 per cent.
Its initial advice compared outbreaks seeded with 30 cases. But the institute has now taken into account scenarios with hundreds and thousands of cases.
More news: Public toilets too risky for testing sites, Bendigo Health says after long wait times
Its epidemiology director Jodie McVernon said conclusions about the 70 and 80 per cent vaccine goals remained robust under the updated model.
But "medium" public health safety measures should be retained during the transition between the targets in places like NSW and Victoria where new daily cases are in high numbers.
That includes staying at home except for essential purposes, retail and hospitality opening with density limits, working from home where possible and closed or graduated return to schools.
The modellers also cited falling case numbers in hotspot areas of Sydney as proof vaccination is working.
Mathematical biology professor James McCaw urged states without the virus to pursue high vaccination rates.
While border closures had been extremely effective, Professor McVernon said the Delta strain provided a reality check about the limited power of lockdowns and harsh restrictions in the future.
Australia has fully vaccinated more than 47 per cent of its population aged 16 and above, while more than 72 per cent have received a first dose.

Cautious road to Christmas

Full text: Victoria has outlined a significantly slower and more cautious path out of COVID-19 lockdown than NSW, with only those who are fully vaccinated able to feel the benefit of easing restrictions and a timeline that stretches out to Christmas.
Even so, the Burnet Institute modelling on which the road map is based predicts up to 4000 infections a day, several thousand deaths and a hospital system stretched by new admissions at the end of December as freedoms increase.
Despite those projections, Premier Daniel Andrews declared yesterday: "We are opening up, no doubt about that. There will be no turning back. We have to normalise this, we have to pass through this pandemic."
To mitigate the worst of the harm, the modellers have suggested vaccines be mandatory for a significant number of Victorians including teachers, childcare workers, parents of childcare workers, hospitality workers and hospitality patrons. Chief Health Officer Brett Sutton said he was actively considering making these orders, with school and childcare staff prioritised for assessment.
The road map was welcomed by health experts, but Victoria's business lobby groups say they are bitterly disappointed at the pace of reopening, adding that shop workers are bracing for an upsurge in customer aggression if they have to exclude unvaccinated customers.
The Australian Hotels Association said it was "gutted" by yesterday's announcement.
Opposition Leader Matthew Guy said while he welcomed the government announcing its road map, the promised freedoms were "too harsh for too long".
The easing of restrictions in Victoria will not begin until next week when 80 per cent of Victorians aged 16 and over are expected to be single-dose vaccinated, and then only with permission for people to play open-air, contactless sport such as golf and tennis.
School is likely to reopen on October 5 as year 12 students return to classrooms. From October 18, students in prep, grade 1 and grade 2 will also return but most are limited to only two days a week, and the days are staggered to minimise the number of children in school at any one time.
When the state reaches the 70 per cent fully vaccinated mark, likely on October 26, the five permitted reasons for leaving the home will no longer apply for residents of metropolitan Melbourne who are double-dosed. Up to 10 people will be allowed to gather but only outdoors, while pubs and clubs can open to 50 fully vaccinated people sitting in the open air.
Mr Andrews said the government was working towards having a "vaccine passport" working by then, allowing vaccination status to show up when people scan the Services Victoria QR check-in code.
The most significant threshold comes when 80 per cent of eligible Victorians are fully vaccinated, likely on November 5. Then regional Victoria and Melbourne come under the same rules. Melburnians will be able to travel outside the city, and host 10 people at their houses, and 150 fully vaccinated people can dine indoors. Masks will still be required in indoor spaces. People who are fully vaccinated can return to work.
Crowds could return to the Melbourne Cup, on November 2, if the state reaches its 80 per cent double-dose vaccination coverage ahead of the projected date.
"If we deliver it by Cup Day, or it's really clear that we're going to, then we'll have options to have a crowd," the Premier said. "I can't say how big ... but it's a great goal. It'd be a great signal to the world, signal to the rest of the country that Victoria is open."
If all goes well, by Christmas people should be able to host 30 visitors to their home.
"We cannot permanently suppress this virus," Mr Andrews said. "We have got to open the place up because remaining closed forever has its own cost."
Chief Health Officer Brett Sutton said: "It is a long path still but it is absolutely right to consider it our home stretch.
"We would all like to already be at the settings that might apply for Christmas to see our friends and family overseas, to be able to gather in large groups, but there's a long haul in front of us and there is a lot of work we still need to do collectively to protect ourselves, protect each other through that pathway."
Despite the general push to ease restrictions, Health Minister Martin Foley said local and regional lockdowns might still be necessary.
From 11.59pm yesterday, Geelong, Surf Coast Shire and Mitchell Shire were plunged into a seven-day lockdown. There will not be a curfew there.
"It remains a tightrope between ensuring that our health system is not overwhelmed but also being able to sustain us in our wellbeing and to protect us from those other harms that come from lockdown," Mr Andrews said.
But Mr Guy said: "The plan appears to be full of ifs, buts and maybes, and the plan to get kids back to school appears to be very long."
Michael Lydeamore, a Monash University researcher who has contributed to the Doherty Institute's reopening modelling, said the government's announcement was a good plan. "It's clearly reopening slowly, and I think that's the right move because it's only going to go in one direction. You can't turn this around. Once those cases go up, they are going to keep on going up, and no amount of locking it down is going to turn things around."
The Premier announced all healthcare workers would be required to have received at least the first dose of their COVID-19 vaccine by October 15 or provide evidence they had an appointment to be immunised by November 1.
"It's going to get very tough and [healthcare workers] know that. It was tough last year, and this is going to be even harder but at 80 per cent double dose, there will never be a better time. As hard as it will be, there is no better time than to move through that gateway and move beyond this," he said.
Meanwhile, 66 local government areas in New South Wales have been downgraded from "extreme red zone" to "red zone", meaning Victorians will be allowed to apply for a permit and return home to complete their 14-day isolation.

Full text: VICTORIA faces a peak of more than 4500 daily cases of Covid-19 by Christmas and 2200 deaths in the New Year, after restrictions are eased over the next seven weeks.
But epidemiologists behind the modelling that has guided the road map out of lockdown, say if Victorians “make an extra effort” to follow the rules over the next two months, the burden on the healthcare system could be significantly less.
On Sunday, Premier Daniel Andrews announced details of the staggered return of freedoms starting next weekend when 80 per cent of Victorian will have received their first vaccination dose.
More substantial restrictions are due to be lifted on November 5 when 80 per cent of eligible Victorians are fully vaccinated.
The road map, based on modelling by Melbourne’s Burnet Institute, shows the peak seven-day average is ­expected to be reached on ­December 15. By the end of the year 3150 people will be in ­hospital, with more than a quarter of those in intensive care.
“These are sobering numbers,” Mr Andrews said.
“There are going to be some very difficult days and weeks, perhaps longer, in our health system. We will stand with you and support you, and we will ­monitor very closely … that ­impact on you, on your ­patients, on our health ­system.” Burnet Professor Margaret Hellard, one of the authors of the modelling, said Victorians could “individually make a difference” to the projections, based on the choices they made.
The modelling shows if the road map is accompanied by increased testing of vaccinated people with mild symptoms, the peak number of cases could be almost halved and about 1000 fewer people would die.
“There is fatigue, but we shouldn’t be pessimistic. We should instead be going ‘it’s the final quarter, and we’ve really got to run hard for the ball’,” Prof Hellard said. “If Victorians wear their masks, meet outdoors and don’t go to each other’s houses, if we get ­vaccinated, if we get tested when we need to, if we try our best to do all the things we’re being asked to do, we can change that.
“If the health system gets overwhelmed, people die. We don’t get to rewrite the story then, but we have the chance to rewrite it now.” AMA Victoria president Roderick McRae said while the easing of restrictions was “premature”, it was reassuring the load on hospitals would be monitored carefully.
Australian Nursing and Midwifery Federation (Victorian Branch) secretary Lisa Fitzpatrick said the plan was sensibly “cautious”.
“It will be the number of ­unvaccinated Victorians that will determine whether our health system can cope or not,” Ms Fitzpatrick said.

Full text: New group stuck in an overcautious mindset at the expense of personal freedom
THEY say misery loves company and hasn’t this pandemic just proved it? It seems like every time there is a light at the end of the tunnel, along comes a rump of like-minded experts who think only in worst case scenarios to tell us it is in fact an oncoming train.
Australia, meet OzSAGE, which came to prominence this week and appears to be the umbrella group for the Covid alarmist wing of the country’s scientific community.
OzSAGE made its debut in a sympathetic press that seems addicted to bad news by trotting out its prediction that the nation’s two-stage, 70-then-80 per cent reopening plan would be a double-barrelled disaster, and NSW’s hospitals would be “overwhelmed by Christmas” if in five weeks fully vaccinated Sydneysiders are allowed back to the pub.
If the name rings a bell, it’s because OzSAGE is modelled on the UK’s own Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies.
The UK’s SAGE was led by Professor Neil Ferguson, who famously used dodgy modelling to scare the nation into believing Covid-19 would kill 550,000 Britons before being forced to resign when it came out that he was breaching lockdown rules to meet his married lover.
While not having the government imprimatur of the UK’s SAGE, OzSAGE clearly wants to be taken just as seriously.
It website attempts to make it come off as sober and reasonable and not at all extreme.
Dissect it more closely, though, and the group’s manifesto relies on a deep belief in the precautionary principle and a puritanical obsession with crushing Covid that sees personal liberties left by the wayside.
Elimination, they admit, is their goal, though they redefine it as keeping Covid down to occasional outbreaks rather than living with the virus circulating through a largely vaccinated population.
Opening up the nation under the agreed Doherty framework would be catastrophic, they say, particularly if children are not jabbed – though all available evidence suggests that for otherwise healthy kids, Covid is not a big deal.
There is no talk of international borders, though we can assume quarantine camps will be the order of the day for those who do decide to visit or return to OzSAGE’s mask-topia.
OzSAGE is also very big on providing proper ventilation to schools and other public buildings.
Cynics might note that these two policies could provide plenty of opportunities for a future Labor government to turn the pandemic into an infrastructure spending spree. Building the Covid Revolution, anyone?
Of course, things such as restaurants, hospitality, tourism, and anything that might count as real life doesn’t seem to get much of a mention. Instead, “normal” life is made the servant of the health system.
The group also calls for “vaccines plus”, saying the current jabs are not sufficient and that we will need to do things such as wear masks in public places potentially for years, despite outdoor transmission being negligible. You see where this is going.
So who is behind OzSAGE?
It’s certainly no surprise to find the Kirby Institute’s Raina MacIntyre amid OzSAGE’s number.
One of the loudest restrictionists in public health, Prof MacIntyre is on the speed dial of every ABC producer who wants a grab about why we should wear masks outdoors until kingdom come or hold back reopening far beyond the 80 per cent target set by the Doherty Institute.
Prof MacIntyre has been a longstanding believer in eliminating the virus from Australia and was also one of the loudest voices calling for Christmas’ Northern Beaches lockdown to be extended across all of greater Sydney.
On December 20 of last year, she predicted “with 100 per cent certainty” Christmas and New Year’s Eve would turn into “the mother of all super-spreading events,” leading to 1000 or more cases a day by the first week of the year. There are plenty of other OzSAGE names that will be familiar to readers including Tony Blakely, who just two weeks ago was on The Project – where Lisa Wilkinson recently led the cheers for tighter lockdowns – saying Gladys Berejiklian’s plan to reopen NSW was “overpromising completely”.
But OzSAGE’s scary stories only make sense if you spend too much time with the other six per cent of Australia that regularly uses Twitter, where the group’s members find a ready echo chamber for their stories about “long Covid” in children and attempts to drag the goalposts for reopening out to kingdom come.
Happily other experts in the field are speaking up about the group, with epidemiologist Peter Collignon saying on Wednesday: “We need to be very careful in accepting these dire predictions. Just look at what some of these people predicted over the last year or more about Covid spread and deaths in Australia.” The fact is, most of the rest of the world is learning to accept Covid cases and, yes, some deaths, are now a part of life, and can be without overwhelming the healthcare system.
In New York this week unmasked celebrities and politicians partied at the Met Ball, in a city whose eight million people are sitting at about 60 per cent fully vaccinated. There, bars and restaurants are pumping, a vaccine passport is anecdotally semi-enforced and they are managing to cope with a wave of Covid infections that has already seen the link between cases and deaths all but broken.
It’s the same across much of the world.
Denmark has declared the disease will no longer be considered an emergency, and even Ireland – which led as grim a campaign against Covid as Australia – is opening up. Unlike OzSAGE, they realise eliminating Covid must be balanced against lost schooling, mental health, destroyed businesses and the simple fact that it is cruel and counter-productive to keep people locked up through summer when outside is the safest place to be.

Full text: Sydney's lockdown and vaccine roll-out has prevented almost 5000 deaths and almost half a million COVID-19 infections, while the death toll in hotspots could have been as high as 5800 without targeted measures, new modelling suggests.
An assessment from the Burnet Institute, a medical research organisation, attempts to measure the extent to which the 11-week lockdown in Greater Sydney and a surge in vaccinations has prevented far more case numbers and deaths.
The calculations, prepared for the state government, suggest the restrictions in south-west and western Sydney and half a million extra Pfizer doses have thwarted more than 580,000 cases and 5808 deaths between June and December.
The 530,000 Pfizer doses sourced from Poland alone prevented an 24,267 infections and 254 deaths, as outlined by the modelling simulating the 12 areas of concern and the rest of Greater Sydney.
Professor Margaret Hellard, a director at the Melbourne-based Burnett Institute who worked on the modelling, said: "while restrictions are tough, they are having effect, combined with upscaling of vaccination".
"As much as they are tough decisions for government to make and tough for people to follow, they do save lives," she said.
The figures form part of the Burnet project released by the state government on Monday for the 12 local areas of concern, which projected up to 2000 cases a day in Sydney's hotspots by next week.
In those areas, based predominately in the west and south-west, cases are predicted to peak at a seven-day average of 1129 to 1967 in the week starting September 13. Across all of Greater Sydney the figure is estimated to be 1219 to 2046 cases.
One of the key assumptions the modelling is based on is NSW reaching 80 per cent first dose coverage among 16-39 year-olds in the 12 areas of concern by early September.
The additional figures, released late yesterday afternoon, included projections for the rest of Greater Sydney.
If restrictions and vaccinations continue, "diagnoses and hospitalisations in Sydney will continue increasing for several weeks before reaching a peak and declining once sufficient vaccine-acquired immunity is achieved," the Burnet states.
The Burnet said the estimates for Greater Sydney were "an underestimate of actual current daily diagnosis as they are part of an initial model calibration".
Premier Gladys Berejiklian warned unvaccinated people would be left behind when NSW started reopening next month. Ms Berejiklian said the return of "things we've all missed" would be granted only to people who had received two doses.
"Don't be left behind," she said. "There's time now to get your first dose and then fit in your second doses before NSW starts opening up."
More than 74 per cent of people in NSW have received their first doses.
The state reported 1220 new local cases yesterday and eight deaths, including that of an Aboriginal woman in her 70s, whose death was reported on Monday.
There are 192 cases in intensive care, 75 of whom require ventilation. Of those in ICU, 155 are not vaccinated, 29 have received one dose and eight are fully vaccinated.
Chief Health Officer Kerry Chant said she believed NSW could reach a statewide vaccination rate of 90 per cent.
"Maybe I'm being too optimistic, but I actually think we can," she said. "And what I'd like the community to do is to be with us on that journey".
Dr Chant said she would like to see NSW surpass 80 per cent of first doses by early next week, as well as greater vaccine uptake among the over 50s and over 70s age groups.
NSW Labor and members of the crossbench yesterday called for the return of the upper house, which did not sit this week as scheduled, following health advice.
Upper house Labor MP John Graham said the return of parliamentarians was critical to supporting the community response to the outbreak and holding the government to account.
Greens MP David Shoebridge said the Premier was "blocking democracy" by refusing to recall Parliament.
"This is not a time to run away from accountability," he said. "We want the upper house to return."
The Premier said yesterday she looked forward to the return of Parliament in October.

Full text: Vaccination rates have soared in some of the Sydney suburbs worst affected by the Covid-19 outbreak, putting them well above the ­national average as the NSW government pushes ahead with plans to lift health restrictions.
Almost 86 per cent of residents in the Blacktown local government area have received their first dose of the Covid-19 vaccine, the sixth-highest coverage rate across any part of the country.
The new vaccine coverage figures came as modelling for the NSW government forecast the outbreak to peak with 2000 daily infections in mid-September.
The modelling, prepared by the Burnet Institute, suggests hospital intensive care units may have to move to a status classed as “overwhelming impact” as total admissions triple in October.
Gladys Berejiklian will press ahead with planned health restriction relaxations, starting Monday, and said ICU capacity could be ­expanded to 1550 patients.
“We certainly don’t want to have to use all of those beds and staff because we know what pressure it will put on the system, but we want everybody to be reassured that the capacity is there,” the NSW Premier said.
Anthony Holley, the president of the Australian and New Zealand Intensive Care Society, said ICU nurses who worked at a ratio of one nurse to one patient would likely face increased workloads.
“The way that could work is that you could have one qualified critical care nurse supervising two other nurses with a good skill set, but not necessarily having a certificate in critical care,” he said.
If Covid-19 patients in ICU ­exceeded 1000 then interstate support would likely be required “in one shape or another”, including the use of additional staff, Dr Holley told The Australian.
But Australia was in a stronger position than most other countries, he said, with a ratio of 9.1 ICU beds per 100,000 people, compared with 3.4 in Britain.
Ms Berejiklian is this week ­expected to announce further details of rule relaxations – contingent on 70 per cent of residents being fully vaccinated.
Data released by the commonwealth showed Queenscliffe, a small government area near Geelong, has the country’s highest single-dose rate – 91.8 per cent.
But the local councils of Blacktown, Campbelltown and Parramatta – all classified as areas of concern by the NSW government – had first-dose coverage rates of more than 80 per cent.
There were five deaths and 1281 cases recorded in NSW on Monday – 831 in Sydney’s western and southwestern suburbs – while Victoria reported 246 new infections.
The ACT recorded 11 cases.
In Victoria, Daniel Andrews has also outlined a vaccine-dependent road map out of lockdown. On Monday, the Victorian Premier said he hoped regional areas in his state would come out of the lockdown next week.
“That’s great news for regional Victoria but it would also be a ­pretty logical place for us to do some of this piloting work,” he said.
Across Victoria, 61 per cent of adults have received at least one dose. In NSW, 74.1 per cent of people have received their first dose of a vaccine, with 41 per cent of residents fully inoculated.
The NSW modelling released on Monday predicts a spike in case numbers to occur next week followed by a significant increase in hospitalisations during the latter half of October and the first two weeks of November. It will occur just as the state embarks upon its most ambitious plans to reopen the economy.
The six-page document predicts that ICU occupancy – including non-Covid related cases – will reach 947 cases in October before tapering off in late November.
Of these cases, approximately 560 are expected to be directly attributable to Covid-19. As of Monday there were 177 Covid-19 patients receiving intensive care across the state’s hospitals, including three children.
To cope with the strain on ICU operations, operating theatres will be used as makeshift intensive care facilities and each staff member will be tasked with a higher number of patients. Other “pandemic resource-based strategies” will also be deployed, the document said. “Achieving uniform vaccination in the LGAs of concern is critical as vaccination rather than reduced infection numbers will be the intervention that leads to a fall in hospitalisation,” the modelling stated.
The modelling indicates that the health system will likely experience an “overwhelming impact” on its usual operations during mid-October, the designation being the highest level of impact specified in the document; others include “minimal”, “moderate” and “severe”.
Last week the Australian Medical Association wrote to Scott Morrison and state and territory leaders warning that the nation’s hospitals were “ill prepared for plans to open up” their respective state economies.
Omar Khorshid, the association’s president, said although he believed expanded ICUs would be able to cope with increasing numbers of Covid-19 patients, he cautioned there may be ongoing elective surgery suspensions.
“In order to look after the people with Covid we’re going to compromise the care of everyone else,” Dr Khorshid said.
Health Services Union NSW secretary Gerard Hayes said the modelling showed a system “planning for the worst and hoping for the best”, which made “good sense”. But he cautioned that regional and rural centres would be far more vulnerable if an outbreak were to occur during the peak hospitalisation period across Sydney.
“Unfortunately, the same capacity does not exist in the regions, where the distances are longer and the ICU capacity is lower. We simply cannot afford a significant delta outbreak outside.”

Full text: Vaccination rates have soared in some of the Sydney suburbs worst affected by the Covid-19 outbreak, putting them well above the ­national average as the NSW government pushes ahead with plans to lift health restrictions.
Almost 86 per cent of residents in the Blacktown local government area have received their first dose of the Covid-19 vaccine, the sixth-highest coverage rate across any part of the country.
The new vaccine coverage figures came as modelling for the NSW government forecast the outbreak to peak with 2000 daily infections in mid-September.
The modelling, prepared by the Burnet Institute, suggests hospital intensive care units may be overwhelmingly impacted as Covid-19 admissions more than triple in ­October. Including non-Covid cases, ICUs face almost 1000 ­patients.
Gladys Berejiklian will press ahead with planned health restriction relaxations, starting Monday, and said ICU capacity could be ­expanded to 1550 patients.
“We certainly don’t want to have to use all of those beds and staff because we know what pressure it will put on the system, but we want everybody to be reassured that the capacity is there,” the NSW Premier said.
Anthony Holley, the president of the Australian and New Zealand Intensive Care Society, said ICU nurses who worked at a ratio of one nurse to one patient would likely face increased workloads.
“The way that could work is that you could have one qualified critical care nurse supervising two other nurses with a good skill set, but not necessarily having a certificate in critical care,” he said.
If Covid-19 patients in ICU ­exceeded 1000 then interstate support would likely be required “in one shape or another”, including the use of additional staff, Dr Holley told The Australian.
But Australia was in a stronger position than most other countries, he said, with a ratio of 9.1 ICU beds per 100,000 people, compared with 3.4 in Britain.
Ms Berejiklian is this week ­expected to announce further details of rule relaxations – contingent on 70 per cent of residents being fully vaccinated.
Data released by the commonwealth showed Queenscliffe, a small government area near Geelong, has the country’s highest single-dose rate – 91.8 per cent.
But the local councils of Blacktown, Campbelltown and Parramatta – all classified as areas of concern by the NSW government – had first-dose coverage rates of more than 80 per cent.
There were five deaths and 1281 cases recorded in NSW on Monday – 831 in Sydney’s western and southwestern suburbs – while Victoria reported 246 new infections.
The ACT recorded 11 cases.
In Victoria, Daniel Andrews has also outlined a vaccine-dependent road map out of lockdown. On Monday, the Victorian Premier said he hoped regional areas in his state would come out of the lockdown next week.
“That’s great news for regional Victoria but it would also be a ­pretty logical place for us to do some of this piloting work,” he said. Across Victoria, 61 per cent of adults have received at least one dose. In NSW, 74.1 per cent of people have received their first dose of a vaccine, with 41 per cent of residents fully inoculated.
The NSW modelling released on Monday predicts a spike in case numbers to occur next week followed by a significant increase in hospitalisations during the latter half of October and the first two weeks of November. It will occur just as the state embarks upon its most ambitious plans to reopen the economy.
The six-page document predicts that ICU occupancy – including non-Covid related cases – will reach 947 cases in October before tapering off in late November.
Of these cases, approximately 560 are expected to be directly attributable to Covid-19. As of Monday there were 177 Covid-19 patients receiving intensive care across the state’s hospitals, including three children.
To cope with the strain on ICU operations, operating theatres will be used as makeshift intensive care facilities and each staff member will be tasked with a higher number of patients. Other “pandemic resource-based strategies” will also be deployed, the document said. “Achieving uniform vaccination in the LGAs of concern is critical as vaccination rather than reduced infection numbers will be the intervention that leads to a fall in hospitalisation,” the modelling stated.
The modelling indicates that the health system will likely experience an “overwhelming impact” on its usual operations during mid-October, the designation being the highest level of impact specified in the document; others include “minimal”, “moderate” and “severe”.
Last week the Australian Medical Association wrote to Scott Morrison and state and territory leaders warning that the nation’s hospitals were “ill prepared for plans to open up” their respective state economies.
Omar Khorshid, the association’s president, said although he believed expanded ICUs would be able to cope with increasing numbers of Covid-19 patients, he cautioned there may be ongoing elective surgery suspensions.
“In order to look after the people with Covid we’re going to compromise the care of everyone else,” Dr Khorshid said.
Health Services Union NSW secretary Gerard Hayes said the modelling showed a system “planning for the worst and hoping for the best”, which made “good sense”. But he cautioned that regional and rural centres would be far more vulnerable if an outbreak were to occur during the peak hospitalisation period across Sydney. “The same capacity does not exist in the regions, where the distances are longer and the ICU ­capacity is lower. We simply cannot afford a significant delta outbreak outside.”

Clash on plan out of Covid

Full text: THE bickering and finger-pointing between the state and federal governments over support for Far North business has stepped up as the tourism sector bleeds an estimated $7m a day from the local economy.
In a blistering opinion piece published in today’s Cairns Post, Leichhardt MP Warren Entsch has called on Premier Annastacia Palaszczuk to outline her plans for the Far North once the state reaches 80 per cent vaccination coverage and what financial support is forthcoming in the meantime.
“These are legitimate questions she needs to answer. My guess is nothing will be forthcoming except more fearmongering, misinformation and a good old dose of blaming the Australian government,” Mr Entsch said.
Repeated leaks of Covid-19 from hotel quarantine combined with what was until recently a sluggish vaccination rollout have put most of Australia’s east coast in lockdown, hammering tour operators dependent on domestic travel.
A spokesman for the Premier said the state government was supporting business, and that the federal government’s response to providing more support to Far North businesses was “met with a flat ‘no’”.
Caught up in the midst of the blame game are Far North families and businesses who rely on tourism to survive.
According to Tropical North Queensland Tourism, since the borders were closed last year, the international tourism market has been decimated, the region is losing $7m a day out of its economy, 6000 staff have lost their jobs, and another 3150 are under threat between now and Christmas.
And to top it off, the region’s businesses have had just 72 days since March 2020 where they have not had to contend with some sort of state border restraint or restriction.
The industry has spent more than a month stridently advocating for either government to come up with some sort of wage support but none has so far been forthcoming.
On Sunday morning, the Premier appeared supportive of the national plan to reopen the country once all states hit the 80 per cent vaccination target for those eligible.
“We’ve been hearing extensively about the modelling of 80 per cent … and the reports of national cabinet. Absolutely we need to aim for 80 per cent and above,” Ms Palaszczuk said.
She also said there was more data and modelling coming to national cabinet from the Doherty Institute and that “what we were hearing about the 80 per cent plus vaccination rates for all of the country, was very encouraging”. Opinion – Page 10

Herd immunity requires jabs for teenagers: experts

Full text: New modelling put together by independent experts suggests vaccination efforts against COVID-19 should now move from targeting vulnerable groups to prioritising those aged 12 to 40.
The modelling, developed by researchers from James Cook and Monash universities, was headed by Professor Emma McBryde from JCU's Australian Institute of Tropical Health and Medicine.
Professor McBryde said the modelling indicated Australia could achieve herd immunity even against the more infectious Delta strain of the virus, but to do so, 85 per cent of the total population would need to be vaccinated.
"To achieve that level of vaccination, you would have to vaccinate teenagers," she said. "We can achieve that, but it would require a huge uptake of vaccination across the community."
Under the current national plan, based on modelling provided to the federal government by the Doherty Institute, many restrictions would start to be lifted once there was a vaccination rate of 70-80 per cent.
However, at this stage, that only takes in eligible people aged 16 and over, meaning it is a smaller percentage of the overall population.
The federal government announced last week that it was opening Pfizer vaccines to children aged 12 to 15 from September 13, and the Therapeutic Goods Administration announced at the weekend that it had given provisional approval for the incoming Moderna vaccine to be given to children over 12.
However, much of the focus of the rollout was still focused on older cohorts who were more at risk from the effects of COVID.
Professor McBryde said that was a good strategy at earlier stages of the pandemic, but her modelling showed there now needed to be a shift in focus for the rollout to prioritise younger people, especially children.
"When we don't have a lot of vaccine supply, the highest vaccine priority groups are the elderly because they're most at risk from COVID," she said.
"But once you get to that final stretch before herd immunity, the 'transmitters' become more important.
"That's why we've said to vaccinate 12- to 40-year-olds, because we know they more readily transmit the virus and they've been under-vaccinated up until now."
The Australian modelling came after experts in the UK advised against vaccinating children as young as 12.
The UK's Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation said the benefits of doing so were only "marginally greater than the potential known harms".
The body's position was at odds with moves by Australia, the US, Canada, Israel and many European countries to vaccinate children aged 12 and over.
Queensland Premier Annastacia Palaszczuk came under fire from Canberra last week for suggesting she may not open the state's borders unless children under 12 could be vaccinated.
The researchers have published the modelling in the latest issue of the Medical Journal of Australia.

Full text: EDITORIAL FACTS matter, particularly when you are dealing with issues as significant as public health measures through a once-in-a-century global pandemic.
Premier Annastacia Palaszczuk stretched the truth yesterday when she told Parliament that the Doherty Institute modelling prepared for National Cabinet had predicted that “2240 ... will die each month” from Covid “even with 70 per cent ... vaccinated”.
The Premier based her 2240 figure on an extrapolation of the forecast in the modelling that said (six months in) 80 Australians could die on a single day from Covid with 70 per cent of us vaccinated, if no public health measures were in place to restrict the spread of the virus. But that is 80 people a day on a single day six months in.
The modelling actually says there could be 2710 deaths over six months – not each month, and only then in a worst-case scenario. That is the equivalent of 450 a month – still a shocking statistic, but a long way from 2240. The modelling did not forecast what would happen to case rates after those six months, but did suggest the 80 per day figure would likely be the peak.
Chief Health Officer Jeannette Young – who, remember, will be governor from November after being appointed by the Premier – defended the comments as “responsible” because “you’ve got to look at the extremes”.
But the Doherty Institute has also forecast that if the country opened up at 70 per cent and the national public health plan was followed there would only be 12 deaths in total, according to the snapshot of the modelling prepared by the Prime Minister’s department. The worst-case scenario – where test-and-trace measures were only partially effective – would be 1456 deaths over six months. That is 242 a month nationwide.
Any death is a tragedy. Every Queenslander understands that. That is why we have all been so willing to accept restrictions on our lives in the name of trying – effectively so far – to eliminate Covid from our community.
But there is now a vaccine, a simple two jabs that ensure you are not only far less likely to catch Covid – but that if you do you are seriously unlikely to end up in intensive care, let alone die from it.
That being the case, the vaccine is our ticket out of this nightmare of uncertainty that is now messing with our mental health and destroying businesses.
One in 10 Queensland businesses are currently late in paying their creditors – a sign of uncertain cashflow, a lead indicator of troubling times ahead.
Meanwhile support services like Lifeline are reporting record call volumes as Australia experiences a pandemic-induced mental health crisis – suggesting that while the Premier has indeed “kept Queensland safe” from Covid, she has failed to take into account a ticking time bomb that will swamp our health services in coming months and years.
The cards we have been dealt are that we are living through a pandemic. That’s just tough luck. At some point we need to accept that fact and start switching our lives back on – albeit in a new normal. We would suggest that time is when all Queenslanders who are able to be vaccinated (the over-12s) have had the opportunity to be vaccinated. That is the day we need to put lockdowns and border closures and political point-scoring and scaremongering behind us.

Private hospitals plan for virus wave

Full text: - HOSPITALS BOOST ON NATIONAL CABINET AGENDA - PM SELLING FALSE HOPE: DEPUTY PREMIER State and territory health systems will withstand high Covid case numbers with the support of ­private hospitals when lockdowns and restrictions ease under the national reopening plan, according to a report prepared for national cabinet.
A taskforce, led by Health ­Department secretary Brendan Murphy and counterparts across the country, will on Friday address the concerns of governments about health workers being furloughed during outbreaks and strains on public hospitals.
National cabinet leaders will be told state and territory public health networks can cope with higher caseloads, assisted by an additional 30,000 beds and 57,000 nurses across the private hospital system.
Detailed analysis to be presented at the national cabinet meeting will outline pressure points in the health system and potential gaps during outbreaks in regional and vulnerable communities.
Scott Morrison will face a divided national cabinet. Recalcitrant states and territories have ramped up attacks this week over vaccines for children and rising death rates when the country reopens after 70 per cent of the population is fully vaccinated.
South Australia on Thursday joined Victoria and NSW in strongly backing the national plan, as Covid-free states including Western Australia, Queensland and Tasmania baulked over easing border restrictions.
Writing in The Australian, Queensland Deputy Premier ­Steven Miles accused the Prime Minister of selling “false hope” in states with high Covid case numbers that the nation could “live with the virus”. Mr Miles said the Doherty ­Institute modelling was “much more complicated than that” and would require a collective decision to be made about “how many people’s lives we risk and how we protect those who cannot be vaccinated”, including children, transplant recipients and cancer patients.
“Decide how many people should die and work back from there – what level of vaccination you need and what other public health measures need to stay in place,” he wrote. “That is the ­complex, difficult, life-and-death decision Scott Morrison tried to simplify down to a simple number and three-word slogan.” Health Minister Greg Hunt on Thursday accused Queensland Premier Annastacia Palaszczuk of “profound moral failure” after letting NRL staff and players’ families enter the state while shutting out thousands of others including children and cancer patients.
Health experts also attacked Ms Palaszczuk’s claims that children could become severely ill from Covid-19 and that 80 people would die each day from the virus when the country moved to stage two of the reopening plan.
Mr Hunt said national cabinet’s modelling projected 13 deaths across 180 days when Australia reached 70 per cent vaccine coverage and described Ms Palaszczuk’s comments as “selective misuse” of the Doherty Institute advice.
Ms Palaszczuk had earlier claimed that even after 70 per cent of the population was vaccinated, “80 people will die each day six months after the outbreak”.
“That’s 2240 who will die each month,” Ms Palaszczuk said. “I sympathise with people interstate enduring months of lockdown but my job is to protect ­Queenslanders.
Despite no country in the world vaccinating under 12s, and only preliminary work underway to trial vaccines in young children, Ms Palaszczuk demanded more information be provided to national cabinet.
Chief Medical Officer Paul Kelly said there was no evidence the Delta strain was more severe in children, with national data this year showing only three children under the age of 12 had been admitted to intensive care.
“There have been 134 hospitalisations,” Professor Kelly said. “Most of the kids who have been admitted to hospital have been for social reasons, not because they are particularly unwell. There have only been three children under the age of 12 that have been admitted to intensive care. Three out of 3815. That is way less than one in 1000. The disease in children is very different from what we’re seeing in adults.” The national cabinet agenda includes discussions around the transition plan, Doherty scenarios and indigenous vaccine surge strategy. Professor Murphy’s “optimising health system” briefing will discuss what test, trace, isolate, quarantine and public health measures will be required to support hospital and workforce capacity. Jane Halton will update leaders on her second review of the national quarantine system and the South Australian home quarantine trial.
Amid warnings from the Australian Medical Association on Thursday that hospitals were ill-prepared for a surge in cases, Mr Hunt said the private hospital network would bolster access to care and health professionals.
“It’s about the partnership ­between the public hospitals and the private hospitals,” Mr Hunt said. “In particular, it brings 57,000 nurses, over 30,000 beds, over 100,000 staff all up into that partnership, so to provide a massive surge capacity.” Mr Hunt said significant work had been done to prepare hospitals, including increasing ventilated beds from 2000 to 7500. He singled out the NSW government for boosting ICU capacity.
Professor Kelly said that, since January last year, the focus had been on preparing for Covid-19 spikes in hospitalisations and ICU admissions. “We’ve still got 4000 invasive ventilators in our national medical stockpile, as well as other treatments,” he said. “There’s an issue of workforce. We need to work through that. And we did last year and provided training to extra nurses at that time with an idea we would have had to surge last year.” Federal government sources said some states and territories “had been better than others” in scaling up hospital and staffing arrangements.
AMA president Omar Khorshid said new modelling based on hospital and staffing capacity must be urgently undertaken. “Even pre-Covid, emergency departments were full, ambulances ramped, and waiting times for elective surgery too long,” he said. ADDITIONAL REPORTING: PAUL GARVEY, RACHEL BAXENDALE

Full text: Ms Palaszczuk on Wednesday withdrew her support for the national reopening plan once the vaccination targets are reached, declaring opening Queensland’s borders would be too risky for unvaccinated children.
“You open up this state and you let the virus in here and every child under 12 is vulnerable, every single child,” she told the Queensland parliament.
The premier said the government must conduct further modelling into the dangers before she would reaffirm her support for the national plan.
Treasurer Josh Frydenberg said Ms Palaszczuk was deluded, as medical advice clearly indicated the national reopening plan was safe for Australia’s children.
“She said she’s scared for Queensland kids, does that wash with you?” Sunrise host David Koch asked Mr Frydenberg.
“No. It’s a desperate denial of the reality and is not based on the medical advice,” the Treasurer replied.
“The medical advice is that we should vaccinate people aged 12 to 15, which we’re doing.
“The medical advice is what we are following. The medical advice is what the Doherty modelling is based on.”
Mr Frydenberg then warned Ms Palaszczuk about the consequences and realities of attempting to follow a zero-Covid policy past the vaccination reopening targets.
“The states and territories should have no expectation that that level of economic support that we are providing today will continue once we reach those 70 per cent to 80 per cent targets,” he told the Today show.
“The people of Queensland are recognising they have to live with Covid – it’s a reality that is now being accepted.
“They can’t eliminate (Covid-19). No country has eliminated it. That is why it’s so important we stick to the plan and open up accordingly.”
But Ms Palaszczuk insisted her state’s hospital system would crumble if Delta crossed into Queensland’s borders.
“The peak (in infections) is not going to be until October. If you want to see a health system on the verge of collapse, you will see that in October,” she told the Queensland parliament on Wednesday.
“I don’t want that here.”
Despite Ms Palaszczuk’s concerns, Mr Frydenberg maintained that for the sake of the economy, the Queensland Premier should trust in the Doherty modelling and follow the national plan.
“Yesterday we saw 80 of Australia’s largest companies go very public and say how important it was for the economy that we stick to that plan,” the Treasurer said on Sunrise.
“In Queensland, the tourism businesses are doing it really tough.
“Why does (Ms Palaszczuk) want to keep the borders closed when the rest of the country is opening up?”
Speaking to reporters in Canberra, Health Minister Hunt also rebuked Ms Palaszczuk’s commentary, quoting her own health department’s medical advice in his take-down.
“Serious illness remains extremely rare in children,” he read.
“Even children with serious underlying conditions will mostly only experience a mild illness with Covid-19.
“The single most effective tool available to prevent infection in children is to reduce infection in adults. Countries around the world have demonstrated the effectiveness of vaccination in achieving this.”
Australia’s chief medical officer Paul Kelly refused to weigh in on the stoush but insisted children would not be severely affected by the nation opening up.
“Since 1 January this year until last night, there have been 3815 cases of Delta virus infection in children under the age of 12.”
He added that out of those cases, only 134 children had been admitted to hospital.
“We know from particularly New South Wales data that most of the kids that have been admitted to hospital have been for social reasons, not because they are particularly unwell – their parents are sick and can’t look after them, a whole range of elements I won’t go into.”
Ms Palaszczuk is not alone in her views within the national cabinet.
ACT Chief Minister Andrew Barr on Thursday said he was “very concerned” about the impact of the virus on children and would welcome further modelling on how the nation’s reopening would affect the cohort.

Full text: Australian hospitals will not ­remain functional unless vaccination rates are higher than 80 per cent once the nation begins to open borders, the Australian Medical Association has warned, casting doubt on the system’s ­ability to cope with the rising case numbers predicted by Doherty Institute modelling.
AMA president Omar Khorshid has written to Scott Morrison ­requesting new modelling based on the hospital system’s ability to cope with higher case numbers, saying unless there is an immediate increase in resourcing hospitals will be plunged into a “permanent cycle of crisis”.
“Despite lockdowns across many parts of the community, very low levels of influenza, and low levels of Covid-19 in most of the country, our hospitals are ­already at breaking point,” Dr Khorshid wrote. “As it stands, many of the process changes, protocols, staffing and policies ­required for the health system to remain functional during a substantial outbreak do not exist.
“Therefore, these are significant changes that need to be modelled, developed, and then enacted. Ultimately, the modelling should provide the basis for preparing our hospitals and the health workforce to handle increased patients – both from Covid-19, but also from the ­delayed care and increased chronic disease severity in our community, resulting from protracted lockdown periods.
“The modelling may also indicate that a higher level of community vaccination is required to ensure that the hospital sector ­remains functional once restrictions are eased. The AMA ­believes that it is likely that a vaccination rate higher than 80 per cent of the adult population is likely to be required, given the ­existing constraints on hospital capacity and staffing.” The Doherty Institute modelled scenarios for various vaccination thresholds that may be seen once the nation begins to open up.
The institute said that once Australia reaches 70 per cent of the population fully vaccinated, the country would be able to begin to open up, but without ongoing public health measures there could be 385,983 symptomatic cases and 1457 deaths over six months. However, this would ­reduce in a best-case scenario to 2737 infections and 13 deaths if test, trace and isolate measures were continued.
The AMA’s warning came as NSW recorded 1116 new locally acquired cases of Covid-19, with 150 patients in intensive care, 66 of whom required ventilation.
Dr Khorshid said although he believed expanded ICUs would be able to cope with increasing numbers of Covid-19 patients, there may be ongoing elective surgery suspensions.
“Public hospitals around the country before Covid were full to the brim and were unable to provide the care that the public ­requires,” he said. “The evidence for that is ambulance ramping and elective surgery delays.
“The only way hospitals can deal with the extra Covid demand is to reduce their normal activity. And the main target is elective surgery.
“In order to look after the people with Covid we’re going to compromise the care of everyone else. We are confident that we will be able to measure excess death down the track because of the ­impact of Covid on our broader health system, whether they be cancer deaths or heart disease deaths.” The AMA is now calling for a new national health reform agreement to provide increased beds, extra staff and to address avoidable admissions in light of the pressure on hospitalised caused by Covid-19. National cabinet is set to ­discuss hospital preparedness on Friday.

Full text: IT’S THE ONE QUESTION WE WANT ANSWERED BUT PREMIER WON’T COMMIT THE Palaszczuk government is still refusing to commit to opening the state without further lockdowns at an 80 per cent vaccination rate, saying it is yet to receive the latest Doherty Institute modelling that was discussed at national cabinet.
Senior minister Grace Grace on Saturday said the state government wanted to have “a look” at the new modelling and determine what it meant for Queensland before announcing a plan.
The Doherty Institute reiterated to national cabinet on Friday that it would be safe to reopen the country once 80 per cent of over-16s were fully vaccinated – regardless of case numbers.
In a one-line statement, a spokesman for Premier ­Annastacia Palaszczuk on Saturday said the state government was yet to receive the Doherty paper and that it “looks forward to further discussions next week”.
The spokesman would not say if Queensland would no longer have lockdowns at an 80 per cent vaccination rate, or what changes would be made once 70 to 80 per cent of Queenslanders had received their jabs.
It comes after the Premier last week would not rule out pulling out of the Doherty ­Institute plan until she saw the new modelling.
Ms Grace said it was appropriate that authorities had a look at the new modelling to determine what it meant for the Sunshine State.
“I understand the Prime Minister also made comments that hospital capacity and workforce needs are also needing to be further looked at,” the minister said.
“And I believe that will be available at the next meeting of the national cabinet.
“Of course we will consider that modelling.” Asked how long Queensland would take to consider the new modelling before making a call on it, Ms Grace said: “I think that’s up to the national cabinet discussions and up to the Premier and us to discuss.
“I’m sure that once we land on a position, that will be made known.” Before Friday’s national cabinet meeting, Ms Palaszczuk had insisted she would want to take the advice of the state’s chief health ­officer and discuss the modelling with senior cabinet ministers before making a decision on it.
National cabinet was told that, at a 70 per cent to 80 per cent vaccination rate, measures such as mask wearing, restrictions and contact tracing would still be needed.
Meanwhile, Queensland recorded no new community-acquired Covid cases on Sunday, but there were four cases detected in hotel quarantine in overseas arrivals. In locked down NSW, ­locally acquired case numbers surged by 1035, while Victoria reported 64 new cases.

Rebel state splits the nation

Full text: National cabinet has moved to bolster state and territory health systems when Australia hits 80 per cent vaccine coverage, as West Australian Premier Mark McGowan broke away from the four-stage reopening plan and ­declared he would not “deliberately infect our citizens”.
With the NSW hospital system under increasing pressure from surging ­Covid-19 infections and hospitalisations, there are rising fears that public health systems could be stretched if the national cabinet plan was rushed.
A new taskforce, led by senior health officials from all jurisdictions, will report to national cabinet next Friday on public hospital and health system capacity, the support role of private hospitals and workforce management when frontline staff are forced to isolate.
Updated modelling presented by Doherty Institute professor Jodie McVernon, showed that under the three case scenarios modelled, as revealed by The Australian, there would be no need to change the national plan to end lockdowns at 80 per cent vaccination rate, even if Covid-19 cases were in the thousands.
It did, however, say that, at 70 per cent vaccination, some level of public health orders would be appropriate but would be favoured toward localised and targeted restriction as opposed to statewide lockdowns. But from that point, a gradual easing of restrictions would begin before a complete opening at 80 per cent.
Scott Morrison said that when Australia achieved 70 and 80 per cent vaccine coverage and moved out of the suppression phase, ongoing Covid-19 measures would be needed as the nation transitioned from harsh restrictions and lockdowns. The Prime Minister – who held a pre-national cabinet briefing in his office with senior advisers including chief medical officer Paul Kelly, Health Department secretary Brendan Murphy and vaccine co-ordinator John Frewen – said the reopening plan must support a cautious return to normal life.
“It’s about opening safely. It’s about opening smartly. It’s about opening in a way that is phased,” Mr Morrison said. “It all doesn’t happen on one day. It happens in Phase B, which is what I’d call a very soft, careful opening. And our task now is to ensure we get those careful settings, because I agree with the Doherty ­Institute that we have to be careful in 70 to 80 per cent. It’s a soft opening period, not a big opening period.” The Doherty Institute will continue updating its scenarios and finalise new modelling on “optimisation of the public health measures and managing outbreak responses and scenarios to support vulnerable cohorts and areas with low vaccination uptake”.
Health data presented to ­national cabinet revealed that Western Australia and South Australia were the most vulnerable to virus outbreaks because their vaccination rates remained low.
Modelling presented to state and territory leaders analysed the ­effective reproduction rate of the virus, taking into account Covid-19 restrictions and levels of vaccination. It showed the ACT and NSW, which have lockdowns in place and high vaccine take-up, had rates of 0.86 and 1.03 respectively. WA had a rate of 3.09, followed by South Australia on 2.45.
After announcing that two NSW truck drivers had entered WA and then learned they had tested positive to Covid-19 before crossing the border, Mr McGowan said the state wouldn’t open up to the country even if it remained Covid-free when it reached the 70 per cent vaccination threshold.
Following heated exchanges in the national cabinet meeting, Mr McGowan said there would still be one million unvaccinated West Australians at that stage and he would not risk their health.
“That’s the problem that jurisdictions that have no Covid face, and I raised that point today,” he said. “The idea that we just ­deliberately infect our citizens, if we have no Covid when we get to 70 per cent two-dose vaccination, I just can’t do.
“People would die and we would have huge dislocation. It’s different for other states that have Covid-positive people.” Mr McGowan’s recommitment to keeping WA’s borders closed even when vaccination milestones are reached is a setback to Mr Morrison’s plans to reconnect the country.
The Premier defended vaccination rates in WA, which lag those of other states, noting that the state had agreed for additional doses to be prioritised for NSW.
“We haven’t had the additional supply,” he said. “I know we are getting attacked by people, the federal treasurer (Josh Frydenberg) has launched a bit of a spray today, but we didn’t get the additional supply that NSW got.
“Frankly it’s pretty unfair to be attacking a state that didn’t get additional supply for not being vaccinated at the same rate as a state that did. Once we get additional supply, we will roll it out.” Mr McGowan also announced that WA would send 260,000 N95 masks to support the NSW Delta outbreak crisis.
“It’s clear we need a national plan to assist if and when things get worse in NSW,” he said. “I raised that again at national cabinet today. It’s the compassionate, sensible thing to do.” The national cabinet endorsed a plan to begin administering vaccines to children aged 12 to 15 from September 13 after the Australian Technical Advisory Group on ­Immunisation rubber-stamped jabs for teenagers on Friday.
Some states and territories argued that younger children should be included in the overall vaccination pool, which is currently 16 and over. Vaccination data for high school students will be included in public reporting.
Mr Morrison said that, under the second and third stages of the plan, baseline restrictions and “common sense” were required to protect Australians from the virus.
“But that doesn’t mean lockdowns,” he said. “I’ve already said on many occasions that where you have discrete communities or particularly vulnerable communities that may have very low levels of vaccination and so on, then of course, there is the actions that are available to states in those circumstances. But once you get particularly into Phase C, then you’re in a position to use those common sense measures.” Mr Morrison said he expected the Qantas announcement that it planned to resume international flights in mid-December when vaccine rates hit 80 per cent would be an incentive for Australians to get jabbed. “Phase C of the plan enables Australians who are vaccinated to be able to leave Australia and return,” he said.

Full text: NSW has shown that vaccinations, not lockdowns, are the key to a return to normality, writes Joe Hildebrand
THE age of the lockdown is over. The only catch is we can’t quite celebrate yet because half the nation is in lockdown. And there is perhaps no more fitting final act of the coronavirus saga than this tragi-comic theatre of the absurd.
After more than a year-and-a-half of Orwellian doublespeak and Machiavellian powerplays Australia has finally come to its senses. Unfortunately it has only done so in theory, not practice.
From the very beginning of the pandemic there were those of us who could clearly see that mass lockdowns were never going to be a long-term solution, let alone a humane one. We pleaded the vital importance of children going to school and adults going to work and thus were naturally condemned as granny-killing capo-fascists.
It would be unbecoming to crow now that we were right but, well, we were right. Victoria subjected its citizens to four months of lockdown across the bitter winter of 2020 in an effort to beat the bug. But the bug came back and the state went into lockdown again. And again. And again. Meanwhile, NSW showed that with a well-managed and well-resourced contact tracing system you could beat Covid-19 without city or statewide lockdowns. The Casula outbreak, the Northern Beaches outbreak, the Croydon outbreak, the Berala outbreak and countless other leaks from hotel quarantine were all contained and crushed.
This all changed with the Delta variant. NSW officials clearly thought they could beat it as they had the others, first with just contact tracing, then with local lockdowns, then with a citywide “lockdown lite” and lastly with some of the harshest measures ever seen.
None of it has worked. As every health expert and blind Freddy himself now knows, we will not be getting back to zero ever again.
The predictable Pavlovian response from the hardliners was that this was because we didn’t lock down fast or hard enough.
And sure enough when Delta went down south Victorian Premier Daniel Andrews locked down hard and fast. After a couple of weeks he announced they had reached zero overnight cases.
That very same day Melbourne went into lockdown again. For the sixth time. On Wednesday it looked like Victoria might have again started to bend the curve, posting just 45 overnight cases. The next day that number almost doubled.
Andrews finally admitted there were “not many more levers we can pull”. In short, he has gone as hard and fast as possible and still the virus is circulating and still Melburnians are living under the yoke. Maybe it was bad luck but if so there’s an awful lot of that going around.
In Fortress New Zealand, the global poster girl for ultra-hard lockdowns, they shut down the country at one single case. On Thursday there were more than 60 new cases. Sure, Delta might possibly be held at bay for a while in some sparser scenarios but unless these jurisdictions are planning on becoming hermit states it is difficult to see what their long-term strategy is. It is also true that both the Victorian and New Zealand outbreaks were caused by people from NSW. Sorry about that! But NSW could equally argue that its outbreak came from somewhere else too. Or indeed that Sydney’s big second wave scare came from Victoria. The problem with the finger of blame is that it always ends up pointing in a circular direction.
The important thing is that even the most reluctant and recalcitrant are now finally seeing the light: Hard and fast or soft and slow, lockdowns now belong in the same historical dustbin as eugenics and ether theory.
They were never truly necessary in Australia, as its most populous state proved time and again, and when it comes to the current outbreak they clearly don’t work.
The New Zealand and Victorian governments are now subtly suggesting what NSW has been shouting from the rooftops — that it is not possible to beat the Delta variant with such medieval measures.
It is also worth noting that as of Thursday, NSW and Victoria had reached almost the exact same number of Covid cases – around 21,500. In Victoria 820 people died, in NSW just 133.
That is the difference vaccination makes and that is why even with record high case numbers NSW is now lifting restrictions instead of tightening them. Indeed, new Doherty Institute modelling confirms this will not increase the death toll but anyone who can count could see that with their own eyes.
Even one of the Andrews government’s key lockdown advisers, epidemiologist and former staunch eliminationist Tony Blakely, is now advocating a softening of the current lockdown. Likewise federal Labor Leader Anthony Albanese has now endorsed the national pathway out of lockdowns. And NSW Labor’s Chris Minns has delivered from opposition what some of his counterparts have failed to deliver: Leadership.
With Labor MPs representing virtually all the Sydney Covid hot spots, Minns last week instructed every local member to ensure their communities were getting vaccinated. And this week he threw his weight behind a strategy to get kids back to school next term, for which opposition support will be critical. This is Labor at its best, putting people ahead of pointscoring.
Meanwhile, the isolationist premiers of Queensland and Western Australia are looking increasingly like the apocryphal last Japanese soldier on the island, fighting a solitary long lost war. The final irony in all of this is that those who are locked down now will perhaps be the longest free, as vaccination rates surge in NSW and Victoria and stagnate in the separatist states. Soon we will be reunited with the world while the wallflowers chew their nails in the corner.

Businesses have right to refuse entry to unvaccinated Aussies

Full text: Prime Minister Scott Morrison yesterday stressed that under existing property law, businesses had the right to deny entry to unvaccinated people.
“That’s a legitimate thing for them to do. They’re doing that to protect their own workers, to protect their other clients,” he said.
“It’s got nothing to do with ideology, or these issues around liberty.
“We all believe in freedom, but we also believe in people being healthy.
“And the simple fact is, if you’re not vaccinated you present a greater health risk to yourself, to your family, to your community and others about you.”
Under existing laws, a business or a shop can refuse entry or service to any person, as long as they don’t breach anti-discrimination laws.
This would include if it was on the basis of race, age, gender or disability.
For example, restaurants are able to deny entry to customers who choose not meet dress codes as long as the rules apply equally to every one.
There is a separate debate over whether businesses can mandate staff be vaccinated, with the Fair Work Ombudsman indicating it will be “more likely” to be legal for workplaces such as
hotel quarantine, border control, health care and aged care.
Queensland Vaccine Locator
Meanwhile, national cabinet is tomorrow expected to discuss potential exemption from restrictions the vaccinated Australians may be able to enjoy once jab rates reach 70-80 per cent.
While specific exemptions will likely be up to chief health officers, Doherty Institute modelling to be presented to national will help set out what exemptions should be considered.
Currently just 47.6 per cent of Queenslanders have had at least one dose of the vaccine, fewer than any other state or territory except WA.
Mr Morrison warned Queensland was lagging but says there is a sense of urgency that is necessary.
“Delta can strike Queensland and WA,” he told 2GB.
“The powers of the state government are not more powerful than the Delta strain of the virus and they’re not more powerful than the vaccine.”
He said low case numbers in Queensland meant that people did not feel the same compulsion to get the jab as states like NSW and Victoria, but easing of restrictions from 70 per cent and 80 per cent vaccination rates will give added incentive.
CM shot to shop poll
Queensland Labor senator Murray Watt said Mr Morrison was blaming Queenslanders for his own failures.
“The vaccine rollout is his job. Running a public information campaign, to beat vaccine hesitancy fuelled by his MPs is his job,” Senator Watt said.
The number of Queenslanders willing to get the Covid-19 jab is increasing, according to vaccine hesitancy research.
Melbourne Institute’s latest report card, to be released on Thursday, revealed vaccine hesitancy in the Sunshine State has dropped to a low of 22.8 per cent.
A month ago one in three Queenslanders were vaccine-hesitant.

Full text: Teenagers get call-up but experts say junior jabs vital to all
HIGH numbers of vaccinated children in all communities will be vital to safely unlocking our strict COVID-19 rules, researchers from leading Australian universities claim.
Researchers argue at least 90 per cent of all Australians, including children, must be vaccinated against COVID-19 before fully relaxing public health measures and opening the international border. Such numbers question Doherty Institute modelling that guides the federal government's vaccine targets.
This comes as the Victorian government has made a push for younger people to access a COVID vaccine from state-run vaccination centres. A new release of Pfizer will be open for 16 to 39-year-olds from Wednesday.
This is the first time 16 and 17-year-olds, without special circumstances, have been able to book a jab and comes a week after adults under-40 were granted AstraZeneca.
New research, led by Australian National University, found it would be too dangerous to relax restrictions at the federal government's 80 per cent target for adults to be fully vaccinated. This modelling showed it was too dangerous to treat COVID "like the flu" and overlook children's protection.
Vaccinating children would reduce projected COVID fatalities by 60 per cent should at least 90 per cent of the Australian population be fully vaccinated.
Kirby Institute's head of biosecurity Raina MacIntyre told The Courier Ballarat only needed to look at Dubbo or Shepparton to see how fast the Delta strain could take hold and put regional healthcare under great strain.
Professor MacIntyre pointed to nations such as the United States and Israel where children aged 12-plus were vaccinated early. In contrast, there were crippling effects on school closures and paediatric intensive care in the United Kingdom and low vaccinated areas in southern America.

Full text: Crood culture
The Prime Minister’s latest road map to recovery is based on a fictional prehistoric family who live in a cave. You know what they say, it’s always darkest before the Delta dawn. “It’s like that movie, The Croods,” Morrison waxed comical. “Some wanted to stay in the cave, and that young girl, she wanted to go out and live again and deal with the challenges of living in a different world. Well, Covid is a new, different world, and we need to get out there and live in it. We can’t stay in the cave.” His review? “I like the movie.” No doubt temporary The Lodge resident Josh Frydenberg is breathing a sigh of relief he’s dropped “under the doona” metaphors.
Coming out of my cave
For those unfamiliar, The Croods is based on a story by John Cleese and made $23.8m at the Aussie box office in 2013. It stars Nicolas Cage (in a cave!), Emma Stone, Ryan Reynolds and Catherine Keener . Strewth had a spare 94 minutes before question time so we took some animated PG notes. The Quiet Australian neanderthals – Grug, Eep, Ugga, Thunk, Sandy and Gran – live in a cave (lockdown) without light. State premier Grug is stubborn and overprotective so institutes a ring of steel and curfew. The Croods’ neighbours die from natural selection: smashed by a mammoth, swallowed by a snake, mosquito bite and the common cold (the UK’s Freedom Day). Rebellious daughter Eep (Morrison) meets inventive orphan Guy ( Doherty Institute ), who has a pet sloth named Belt (Dan Murphy opening hours). Guy can make fire (modelling) and warns of the impending apocalypse (double dip recession). An earthquake (Delta) destroys the cave, the Croods flee to find a new cave (in-principle agreements). The family escape a volcanic eruption (anti-vaxxers who punch horses) and learn to live outside in a tropical paradise (70 per cent vaccination). The end! If only The Croods had fled earlier and harder, they could have reached the sun sooner! Morrison told the Coalition partyroom there’s a sequel (The Crood 2: A New Age), and he hopes for his own sequel next year when we heads to the polls. As Grug philosophised: “No one said survival was fun.”
Jibber jabber
Remember: it’s not a (fast food) race. “There’s more places you can get the vaccine in Australia then you can get a Big Mac now,” ScoMo claimed on Tuesday. Even in Engadine?
Head in the game
Scott Morrison has taken a job as the new leader of the Perth Wildcats. No, not that Scott Morrison. Coach ScoMo is a 44-year-old Canadian, and former assistant at the Boston Celtics. He’s signed a three-year NBL contract to replace head coach Trevor Gleeson , who is moving to man the whistle for Canada’s Toronto Raptors. Coach ScoMo will be the Wildcats 14th head coach in its 40-year history, with 10 winning seasons. PM ScoMo is the Liberal Party’s 14th leader in its 76th-year history, with 19 election wins. Coincidence? “Over the years, it’s been kind of funny to get a lot of people hitting me up on Twitter, cursing at me and complaining about me,” coach ScoMo reflected. “I’m not really sure what they were upset about. If the shoe was on the other foot and my favourite Canadian team hired Justin Trudeau to coach the team, I think I’d get a great kick out of that, so I don’t blame anybody for laughing.” The self-described “players coach” hopes he can keep top spot on the ScoMo popularity poll, but with his second child due this weekend could use a favour from his namesake before the season starts on November 18. “If the other Scott Morrison can help me cut down my quarantine, I’m happy to step down and give him my vote,” he joked. Maybe he should ask Mark McGowan . So does PM ScoMo play ball? Continuing the parable of political sporting fails (see: John Howard , cricket), Morrison once posted a video playing basketball with his skilled daughter Abbey in 2019. After missing the hoop, he turned to the camera and said: “Needs a bit of work”. Sure … but has coach ScoMo seen The Croods? You can’t play basketball inside a cave.
Love it or list it
David Littleproud has scored a coveted 10 out of 10 from Rate My Skype Room. Run by Jessie Bahrey and Claude Taylor from Washington DC, the Twitter account shot to fame at the start of the pandemic for its humorous voyeurism of the backdrops used in televised interviews, virtual parliaments, celebrity livestreams and online events around the world. The armchair critiques are fairly simple in format, focusing on the set-up and lighting, with particular attention paid to the WFH rooms that resemble hostage videos. “Nice grouping of urns/ceramics/porcelain. Twigs. Art. Doing rural Australia proud,” RMSR said of the deputy Nationals leader’s Ryeford residence. Littleproud thanked the interior interpreters, adding: “I only wish it was me who designed it!!!! (Brownie points at home for this tweet but!).” We’re reliably informed full credit should go to his partner, Amelia .

Full text: It comes as she announces employees at food depots will be offered the chance to be vaccinated at work under a priority plan to protect critical food supply.
Ms Palaszczuk announced the plan at a Woolworths food distribution centre at Larapinta Monday morning – one of 28 crucial depots identified.
Two new cases were recorded in Queensland overnight, including one that is linked to the Indooroopilly cluster.
Ms Palaszczuk said the other case was detected in hotel quarantine and acquired overseas.
She said authorities were very concerned about what was happening in southern states.
“We have to be incredibly vigilant,” she said.
Ms Palaszczuk said she was “extremely disappointed” by the protesters at the Queensland border with NSW on Sunday
She said people in northern NSW who took place in the protest need to abide by the NSW Government’s stay at home orders.
“We are seeing an escalation of the Delta strain in NSW and of course we are concerned that will creep further north,” she said.
“Our police are doing everything they possibly can to keep Queenslanders safe and I would ask people to be respectful towards police and respectful towards their community.
“I know this is a difficult time for the community.
“The way you get through this, if you have a stay at home order is to stay at home.”
Asked what states agreed to regarding the Doherty research, the Premier said that work was done predicated on 30 cases.
“At the moment, there’s thousands of cases,” she said.
She said further work was now being done in recognition of that.
“But we know the fastest way out of this is through vaccinations,” she said.
Ms Palaszczuk said Delta was incredibly infectious, and the other concern was children.
“We have to get children vaccinated, especially in those high school years … because we know that it can be spread.”
“This is a big job,” she said.
Ms Palaszczuk said everyone was still aiming for the 70 to 80 per cent vaccination goal.
But everyone on national cabinet had also agreed the extra modelling needed to be done based on the current situation.
“They have commissioned more research because the goalposts have changed. it was premised on there being 30 cases in the community and now there are thousands,” she said of the Doherty research.
She said her goal was always to suppress the virus and so there would be some limited and specified restrictions and lockdowns going forward.
“This is a book that hasn’t been written, folks,” she said.
“This is uncharted territory.”
She said she “absolutely” still supported the 70 to 80 per cent vaccination targets and her government was doing everything it could to make it easier to get a jab.
Ms Palaszczuk said “we want to see Australia reunited again as quickly and safely as possible”.
“But this is the Delta strain, we know how infectious it is,” she said.
Vaccinated co-ordinators are working with eight food distribution centres and 20 meatworks that the Department of Agriculture and Fisheries have identified as critical for food supply throughout Queensland.
The jabs will begin at those workplaces next week.
Ms Palaszczuk is providing an update on its vaccination rollout will come amid growing anger over border restrictions and lockdown targets.
Chief health officer Jeannette Young said the new case posed no risk to Queenslanders because it was detected in home quarantine.
She said the biggest risk going forward were the growing cases interstate.
“Eventually it will cross,” she said.
Queenslanders have again been encouraged to get vaccinated.
Dr Young said authorities were rapidly immunising those who had registered and that more people needed to register.
Deputy Premier Steven Miles said Queenslanders were grateful for distribution centre workers throughout lockdowns.
“We’ve worked really closely with our supermarket chains to make sure they’ve been able to keep operating throughout the pandemic,” he said.
Health Minister Yvette D’Ath said it was important Queenslanders entering NSW followed stay at home directions when returning to Queensland.
Ms D’Ath said 112,397 people had been vaccinated in the past seven days, as well as 221 people vaccinated in the state’s First Nation’s clinic.
More than 210 essential workers have crossed the Queensland border since 5pm yesterday, with none refused entry.

Full text: Australia's third wave is showing no sign of peaking. All of NSW, ACT and Melbourne are in lockdown; all outbreaks have originated from the international border breach in NSW. It's hard not to conclude NSW has lost control of its COVID outbreak with the seven-day average at 502 and a current doubling time of 11 days. If the trend continues, it translates to 1000 cases a day by the first week of September and jettisons the nation's roadmap out of the pandemic.
The federal government's roadmap defines vaccination levels needed for restrictions to be eased - but it relies on a starting point of zero cases. This is what's required at the end of Phase A for any restrictions to be lifted. It also relies on Phase B dealing with an outbreak of just 30 cases Australia-wide.
Until now, every state and territory has pursued a policy of zero COVID (no community transmission) but recent signals from Premier Gladys Berejiklian suggest NSW has deviated from this goal. This makes the Doherty Institute modelling of scenarios based on 70 to 80 per cent vaccination redundant. Even if it gets to 80 per cent, the state cannot afford to lift restrictions at current case levels or the health system will be overwhelmed.
It is clear the state needs to reset its response to this outbreak if it is to grant its citizens more freedoms, in the long term, in line with the national roadmap. The current approach has the state government always behind the virus - gradually expanding local government areas of concern on the basis of infections that occurred a week earlier.
All of Greater Sydney at least should be under the same level of restrictions to simplify the message. The government should share more information about how and where transmission is occurring, especially the role of workplaces.
Stage 4 restrictions were introduced in Melbourne on August 3 last year when the daily number of new cases reached 671. This led to a steady decline that reached fewer than 10 a day 10 weeks later. And that was without vaccination. That package included mandatory masks indoors and outdoors, a five-kilometre travel limit, closing all non-essential retail, containment of workplace transmission, a night curfew, and a strict definition of essential workers. It's worth trying at least in Greater Sydney and western NSW.
Britain - an early adopter of the "live with COVID" philosophy - spent much of the past 12 months in lockdown. Yet it ended up with 130,000 dead, half a million hospitalised and more than 2 million suffering long COVID.
This is why lockdowns are still a possibility even in a highly vaccinated population. It's important to recognise the real drivers of lockdowns: the Delta variant and its potential to overrun our health system, which will remain if about 20 per cent of adults (4.1 million) are unvaccinated and at risk of hospitalisation.
The evidence is clear: lockdowns are most effective at stopping transmission if implemented early. And NSW shows how a reluctance to go early can result in an extended lockdown. When you "go hard, go early", the less lockdown you eventually have - the less economic damage, the more freedom. The degree to which we mitigate airborne transmission and apply other non-lockdown tools will have a lot do with avoiding future lockdowns. This is what we call vaccines-plus. We need to plan and implement the "plus" as much as vaccination. The modelling used in the national roadmap assumes such measures - testing, tracing, masks, and some restrictions - are continued alongside vaccination.
The only way to live freely prior to high vaccine coverage is by being free of transmission or close to zero COVID.
A vaccine-led "exit" from this pandemic is on the way, but it is six months or so away. And all indications are that once high vaccination rates are achieved, our best shot at living freely is to start with almost no COVID in the community. It's time to be ambitious and bold about the pursuit of low COVID in Greater Sydney and zero COVID in the regions through vaccine-plus.

Full text: Premier Gladys Berejiklian confirmed the numbers on Thursday, and added at least 59 cases were infectious while in the community.
Ms Berejiklian said the man who died from the virus at St George Hospital had underlying health conditions and had received one dose of a Covid-19 vaccine.
The number of cases eclipses the state’s record day on Wednesday, when 633 infections were reported.
“Western and southwestern Sydney are generating the vast majority of our cases,” Ms Berejiklian said.
She also conceded that reaching zero cases was now not possible.
“I appreciate what we are going through looks difficult but every state in Australia will need to come to terms with the fact that when you get to a certain level of vaccination and open up, Delta will creep in,” she said.
“We can't pretend that we will have zero cases around Australia with Delta.
“As the Doherty (Institute) report says, once you get to 80 per cent double dose and you have to open up, everyone will have to learn to live with Delta.
NSW Covid Exposure Sites
She said 110,000 people rolled up a sleeve to get a vaccine yesterday, and 52 per cent of the population had now received at least one dose. Twenty-eight per cent are fully vaccinated.
The lockdown affecting regional NSW will also remain in place after the restrictions were extended to align with Greater Sydney.
It was set to expire on Thursday night but given Covid-19 cases have been recorded as far west as Broken Hill, Ms Berejiklian and deputy premier John Barilaro said they had no choice but to extend it to at least August 28.
Ms Berejiklian doubled down on her message that September and October would be difficult months for the state.
She said once 80 per cent of the NSW population was fully-vaccinated by mid-November, decisions would “need to be made as to how freely we can live.”
“It will depend on the case numbers but life will be much freer than what it is now,” she said.

VICTORIA”S 345-DAY VIRUS HIGH Victoria has recorded 57 new locally acquired Covid-19 cases on Thursday as Melbourne reached a grim milestone of 200 days in lockdown since the start of the pandemic.
The alarming daily case figure – a jump of 33 from Wednesday’s 24 infections – is the highest number of new cases since 70 cases were recorded on September 8 last year during the state’s deadly second wave.
Victoria’s health department confirmed the new local cases just after 8.30am, but in a positive sign they said only three were mystery infections.
The department revealed 54 of the 57 new local cases could be linked to existing outbreaks but only 44 positive people were in isolation during their infectious period.
The significant jump in cases was understood to be expected, as many of the new cases had just completed their day 13 tests in quarantine after being identified as a close contact.
It’s now 15 days since the first positive teacher at Al-Taqwa College in Truganina was detected with almost 2500 primary close contacts connected to the school starting 14 days of isolation a day later.
Those who have now tested positive are facing at least another 14 days in quarantine.
Premier Daniel Andrews said 41 of the 44 in isolation were day 13 tests.
“The system is working exactly as it should,” he said.
“57 seems a very big number, but when the vast majority of those have been in isolation for their infectious period, that’s exactly what we want.”
Covid-19 commander Jeroen Weimar has previously praised the school community for their co-operation with health authorities during the outbreak, with Western Health even establishing a vaccine hub at the college.
The suburb of St Kilda, along with the local government areas of Port Phillip and Glen Eira, remain a concern for health authorities after multiple mystery cases were uncovered in the region this week.
Mr Weimar urged anyone who lives, works, visits or actively uses that St Kilda area to get tested.
“There have been a growing number of unlinked cases in an area stretching from the outer areas of Middle Park to North Caulfield, across the LGAs of Port Phillip and Glen Eira,” the health department said in a statement.
“There is potential transmission along Fitzroy St and other commercial areas in St Kilda.
“People must get tested if they have been to exposure sites, or if they have had any symptoms – but the department’s public health teams are asking for more people to come forward for testing across the region, even if they aren’t currently showing symptoms.
“Testing operations in the Port Phillip and Glen Eira area have been enhanced and a new testing site has been established at the Palais Theatre car park in St Kilda. It will operate from 9am to 5pm and is both a drive-through and walk-in centre.”
There are now more than 550 exposure sites in multiple suburbs across metropolitan Melbourne.
There are 296 active cases across the state, up from 246 on Wednesday.
No new cases were recorded in hotel quarantine on Thursday.

CANBERRA OUTBREAK GROWS TO 83 Canberra has recorded 16 new local coronavirus cases as authorities in the capital scramble to contain a growing outbreak.
The total number of cases in the outbreak has hit 83.
Five of the new cases are still under investigation, and the rest have been linked to previous ones.
Out of the total number of cases in the outbreak, a total of nine have not yet been linked to other infections, Australian Capital Territory Chief Minister Andrew Barr said.
“This is a crucial time in our public health response,” Mr Barr told reporters on Thursday.
“Please stay at home and support this effort. We need to drive these case numbers down to zero.”
The ACT was supposed to get out of lockdown this Thursday but the stay-at-home orders have been extended until September 2.

ANNASTACIA’S STERN MESSAGE TO NSW The Queensland Premier has doubled down on her threats to lockdown the southeast yet again if northern NSW residents don’t do the right thing.
While on Thursday Queensland recorded its second “double doughnut” day in a row and is easing restrictions from Friday, NSW is expected to record high case numbers after Wednesday’s record 633 cases.
As health authorities and police seek to redefine who is an essential worker allowed into Queensland from northern NSW, Annastacia Palaszczuk said it would only take one person to enter her state with the virus and “all bets are off”.
Ms Palaszczuk reiterated that the entire state of NSW, including northern border towns like Tweed Heads, were under stay-at-home orders, and that’s “what they need to do”.
“It just takes one person to cross the border with Delta and all bets are off,” she said.
“I make no apologies for keeping Queenslanders safe.
“The sooner they (NSW) can get on top of their issues, the sooner we can get back to some sort of normality.”
Health Minister Yvette D’Ath said the concerning growth of cases in NSW, as well as IN the ACT, Victoria and New Zealand, was a cautionary tale for Queenslanders.
“It could be in our community any day now,” she said.
“Please, go out and get vaccinated and keep coming to get tested.”
Ms Palaszczuk warned that if the virus did cross the border into the Gold Coast, she would have no choice but to lock the city down.
“Businesses don’t want to see that,” she said.
“It’s a very tough situation, but everything we are doing is to keep Queensland safe.”
At least 100 Australian Defence Force personnel are expected to be sent to the border in coming weeks to support Queensland Police.
Deputy Commissioner Steve Gollschewski on Thursday said there had been an increase in the number of vehicles coming across into Queensland, but police only had to turn around 317 cars.
“For those persons that are able to come across, question whether you really need to make that trip,” he said.
“Just because you’re authorised to come in, it doesn’t mean you should.”

‘GET VAXXED OR DON’T GO TO WORK’: AUSSIES’ COVID WARNING The Federal Government has written to every nursing home ­operator in Australia warning that it will not extend the September 17 deadline for all staff to be vaccinated.
About 100,000 workers in the industry have not been vaccinated against Covid. The Australian reports that from Monday, the government will begin publishing “staff and resident vaccination rates in individual nursing homes in a bid to accelerate inoculations in the sector”.
Health Minister Greg Hunt and Aged Care Services Minister Richard Colbeck wrote to providers, saying that nursing homes would be held to the cut-off date and unvaccinated staff “would not be permitted to work” after the deadline.
“As of 17 August, 2021, My Aged Care data indicates that over 63 per cent of workers have received a first dose and over 43 per cent are fully vaccinated,’’ Mr Hunt and Senator Colbeck said in the correspondence, according to The Australian.
“While these levels indicate a strong commitment from residential aged-care workers to be vaccinated … there remains a significant proportion of this essential workforce yet to be vaccinated ahead of (the deadline),” the letter reads.
“I expect exemptions to the mandatory requirement to be limited. As such, it is critical the vaccination rates of aged-care workers continues to increase, and that this happens as a priority.”
National cabinet agreed on June 28 that all aged-care workers in nursing homes must have at least one dose of a Covid-19 vaccination by September 17 as a condition of work.
Meantime, Victoria and NSW are bracing themselves for another spike in Covid infections, with Victorian numbers expected to rise to around 40.

NZ COVID CASE ‘ORIGINATED IN AUSTRALIA’ New Zealand Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern confirmed there is a link between a NSW Covid-19 case and the one which sparked an outbreak in NZ, as heath officials fear infections will grow.
Speaking at a press conference, Ms Ardern said genome sequencing had shown the outbreak is the highly-contagious Delta strain, and that it had come from NSW.
“Our case has originated in Australia,” Ms Ardern said on Wednesday. She did not say how, where, or when the transmission occurred.
Two new Covid-19 infections were reported in New Zealand on Thursday, brining the total number of cases in the community to seven.
Ms Ardern said she was “anticipating more cases”, and data modelling showed there could be between 50 to 120 cases linked to the outbreak.
“The key is to find them as soon as possible,” director general of health, Dr Ashley Bloomfield, said.
Everyone over the age of 12 is now required to wear a mask when visiting essential stores that remain open during the lockdown, which was announced on Wednesday and will run for at least three days.

AUSSIE SENATOR IN QUARANTINE Shadow Finance Minister Katy Gallagher is in mandatory isolation after her daughter became one of 17 positive Covid cases in Canberra yesterday.
The Labor Senator revealed her daughter Evie is “feeling pretty unwell and understandably worried about what this means for her and for the rest of her family”.
“Our household remains in strict quarantine until ACT Health advises us that we don’t need to isolate anymore,” Ms Gallagher said in a statement posted to Twitter.
“The rest of our family, including myself, have all returned negative tests. I am lucky as I am fully vaccinated. Unfortunately too many Australians have not had that opportunity.”
Ms Gallagher, who as chair of the Senate’s Covid-19 Committee has been highly critical of Australia’s response to the pandemic, did not indicate how her daughter was exposed to the virus.
“Here I sit tonight, where after doing everything right for 18 months, like millions of other families right around Australia — I am left with my children completely vulnerable to Covid-19,” she added.

Full text: LIVING with Covid-19 long-term will require an ongoing national contact tracing and testing plan, as medical experts focus on emerging new treatments amid hopes one day there will be a simple pill to fight the virus.
Two additional deputy chief health officers have been appointed to help the commonwealth: former Queensland deputy chief health officer Sonya Bennett will oversee a national strategy for contact tracing, while GP Steph Davis will focus on mental health and vaccine modelling.
Dr Davis said even when Australia reached vaccination rates of 70 and 80 per cent, modelling by the Doherty Institute showed an ongoing testing and tracing capacity would be needed to live with the virus.
“All of that is going to be going for a while to make sure that we can keep the virus at (manageable) levels,” she said.
In the future, chief medical officer Professor Paul Kelly is hopeful a super-effective treatment for Covid-19 will be developed: “The real game-changer for this will be when we have a normal pill like we do for … influenza … to give people early in the illness or even indeed to prevent illness.
“That pill does not exist at the moment in the world.” Professor Kelly said as soon as medicines were developed and “shown to be useful” in treating Covid-19, health officials would work to make them available in Australia.
He will also meet with health experts on Monday to develop clinical guidance for use of a new monoclonal antibody drug, Sotrovimab, which Australia has purchased for use treating Covid-19 pending Therapeutic Goods Administration (TGA) approval.
“I’m starting a process this week with clinical colleagues to look at clinical guidelines,” he said. “This medicine is not for everybody, it is an antibody (that) will be mostly aimed at people that are not vaccinated, it will be mostly for people who are at highest risk of severe disease, and it needs to be given early in the treatment.”

Full text: It was barely a month ago that Daniel Andrews, in his first week back at work after his injury, signed up to the national cabinet’s plan to “transition” the nation’s approach to Covid-19.
In black and white, the leaders declared lockdowns were “to be used only as a last resort”.
Victoria is now locked down for the second time since then.
We will wake on Friday to kids missing school, shop owners shutting their doors, florists throwing out flowers, lovers cancelling weddings.
And instead of criticism from Canberra, the Premier’s hard-and-fast approach is fully backed by Scott Morrison — because it’s now the national cabinet’s preferred response.
Last Friday, they changed their minds and agreed that until at least 70 per cent of the adult population is fully vaccinated, state leaders should pull the trigger on “early, stringent and short lockdowns if outbreaks occur”.
Announcing Victoria’s sixth lockdown on Thursday evening — barely 32 hours after celebrating a zero-case day — Andrews said that with a handful of mystery cases, he simply had “no alternative”.
“We only get one chance to go fast,” he said, warning the state could otherwise be locked down until Christmas without the snap shutdown.
Front of mind for Andrews, Morrison and their national cabinet colleagues is the Sydney experience, where Gladys Berejiklian held out on harsh restrictions and inadvertently fuelled a public health bushfire that seems likely to run for weeks — if not months — to come.
In the face of the Delta variant, snap lockdowns are now backed by the Doherty Institute as the right health response and the federal Treasury as the right economic response — endorsements Andrews was quick to cite on Thursday.
That will be cold comfort for Victorians who have now spent more than six months in lockdown in the 500 days since Australia was first frozen to “flatten the curve”.
In the darkest days of last year’s deadly second wave, Andrews maintained the state would gain from that pain.
“We won’t spend 2021 bouncing in and out of lockdowns,” he promised. And yet here we are.
The Doherty Institute’s modelling makes it clear that we have little chance of controlling the Delta variant and preventing widespread loss of life until far more Australians are vaccinated.
That means our sixth lockdown is unlikely to be our last. It must also mean that the federal government throws absolutely everything into fast-tracking the delivery of every single dose it can get its hands on.
Victorians are a remarkably resilient bunch, but there is only so much they can take. They have done everything governments have asked them to do — it’s well past time their sacrifices were repaid with vaccines for all.

Year 12s opting out of Pfizer offer in protest

Full text: The indications of significant hesitancy by students come as new Doherty Institute modelling released on Tuesday found vaccination of young people was a key component needed to move away from lockdowns, with young ­people being the cohort most likely to transmit the virus.
Nearly 20,000 Year 12 students from Sydney’s eight hardest hit areas are scheduled to be vaccinated with Pfizer from Monday as the NSW government pushes to return them to face-to-face learning in time for their exams.
An informal survey conducted among Year 12 students suggests many of those eligible may choose not to have the jab.
A survey of 4507 students within a private Year 12 Facebook group with more than 36,000 members found 40 per cent of respondents would not take up the offer for the Pfizer vaccine.
By comparison, an Australian Bureau of Statistics survey released earlier this month found 73 per cent of Australians would get a Covid-19 vaccine when it was available and recommended for them; just 11 per cent said they would not get one.
Vaccine hesitant responses littered several separate posts in the group, with students raising questions over its efficacy and safety.
“There is no way I’m getting that vaccine. It’s not safe, they need to do more research before they want to give it to people,” one student wrote.
Another one said: “I’m not getting that vaccine and that’s final. If it stops me from getting the same education as everyone else, the government is dumb.”
The survey’s organisers, Greystanes High School students Henley Warner, 17, and Luca Kent, 18, hope to present the results to the Minister of Education, Sarah Mitchell. Henley said she was surprised by the high levels of students opting out of the vaccine, and more needed to be done to target education about the vaccine to school children.
NSW Year 12 students’ final year at school has been riddled with chaos, with the city lockdown forcing them to learn from home for six weeks, and many finding it difficult to concentrate.
On Wednesday, Premier Gladys Berejiklian signalled that Year 12 HSC students might not return to classrooms on August 16, as previously announced.
With the return to school hinging on higher vaccination rates, some students are adopting an anti-vaccination stance to persuade the government to cancel the HSC altogether.
Northwest Sydney student Keira Garland, 18, of Turramurra High School, who has been part of a campaign to cancel the exams, said the weeks of disrupted learning would entrench disparities in the results.
NSW Secondary Principals Association president Craig Peter­son said mixed messaging about which vaccine should be taken by which age group had left students confused. He called for a more co-ordinated approach to help them overcome fears.

Full text: Research commissioned by the federal government found cash payments and lotteries have had “little to no impact on longer-term vaccination rates”, according to The Australian.
Based on the advice received by the government last week, the government is more likely to partner with businesses to give discounts and frequent flyer point bonuses.
It comes as Labor leader Anthony Albanese put forward a plan to give every Australian fully vaccinated by December 1 a $300 cash payment to boost vaccination rates.
Mr Albanese will unveil the $6bn plan on Tuesday.
If an election is held before December 1, a new Labor government would deliver the payments, but Labor would not send out the cash if elected at the poll that is more likely to be held next year.
“The government has failed on its two jobs this year, the rollout of the vaccine and fixing quarantine,” the Opposition Leader said.
“It needs to use every measure at its disposal to protect Australians and our economy.”
It comes as new modelling predicts daily cases in New South Wales will more than double by the end of the week.
The Burnet Institute forecasts that under the current restrictions, there will be about 570 new cases in a single day by Friday.
“This is the result of stable or falling daily cases in south west Sydney Local Health District (LHD) being exceeded by rising cases elsewhere,” the research concludes.
“It takes about a week before new controls have an effect, so we don’t expect new restrictions announced on 30 July to kick in until at least 7 August.”

FOUR NEW CASES IN VIC Victoria has recorded four new locally acquired Covid-19 infections on Tuesday.
The state’s health department announced the new local cases about 8.30am, and said both were linked to existing outbreaks.
In another positive sign as Victoria emerges from its fifth lockdown, the health department said all new cases were in isolation for their entire infectious period.
Just 3750 of more than 20,000 primary close contacts from the state’s latest outbreak remain in isolation as hundreds are freed back into the community each day.
The health department said about 1300 people were cleared as primary close contacts on Monday as the number of exposure sites also continues to dwindle, and had fallen to 56 on Tuesday morning.
No new exposure sites have been added since Saturday.
It comes as chief health officer Brett Sutton tweaked the coronavirus restrictions.
From 11.59pm on Tuesday, group limits will be removed from food and drink facilities, physical recreation and sport, including gym classes, and from tours and tour transport.
An overall venue cap of 100 people and density limits will continue to apply to food and drink facilities, with a cap of 25 and no density limit for those that are less than 100sq m.
Limits of 100 people per indoor space and 300 per outdoor space will continue to apply to physical recreation facilities, as will density requirements.
Victoria has recorded more than 200 cases linked to the two outbreaks that jumped the border from Sydney’s deadly Delta cluster – one from a team of Sydney removalists who transited through the state and the other from a family who returned to Melbourne’s north from a NSW red zone.
One new case was also recorded in hotel quarantine, with the number for active infections in the state falling to 124 – down from 134 on Monday.

HALF-PRICE PLANE SEATS EXTENDED The federal government has thrown a lifeline to the aviation sector as it struggles with the impact of worsening lockdowns, with the popular half-price fares initiative extended until the end of November.
The government will also enable airlines to access $750 weekly payments for 50 per cent of their pilots and cabin attendants, if the business has taken a hit of more than 30 per cent since the Sydney hotspot declaration was made.
The Domestic Aviation Network Support (DANS) and Regional Airline Network Support (RANS) programs would also be extended until the end of the year, Deputy Prime Minister Barnaby Joyce announced.
The half price seats initiative, which prompted a huge flurry of sales when it was announced in March, was being extended “to ensure travellers impacted by lockdowns or border closures can access these tickets and benefit key tourism regions as soon as possible,” Mr Joyce said.
Initially 800,000 half-price seats were offered to 15 destinations most impacted by the downturn in tourism.
Mr Joyce, who is also Minister for Infrastructure, Transport and Regional Development, described the aviation sector as “absolutely seminal,” especially for the tourism industry.
“This is a crucial sector of the economy,” he said.
“It is crucial to keep a sovereign airline capacity, crucial that as soon as the economy opens up, this sector of the economy is up and running and able to deliver.”
“We are laser-focused on keeping the nation connected and supporting economically critical freight movements as we continue to manage the ongoing challenges of this global pandemic and move into a recovery phase.”
A spokesperson for Mr Joyce confirmed that while the half-price seats program was being extended, it was not an increase on the initial allocation of 800,000 seats, and the 15 destinations within the program were not being changed.
Tourism and Transport Forum CEO Margy Osmond welcomed the extended support measures, but said the tourism industry’s biggest challenges were the “devastating impacts of ongoing lockdowns and border uncertainty”.
She also called for timelines to be set against national vaccination targets, saying they would restore confidence to the industry.
Parts of the industry dependent on international arrivals had “effectively been in lockdown for 16 months,” Ms Osmond said, and the domestic sector “continues to be decimated by these extended lockdowns and border restrictions.”
PFIZER OPEN TO TEENS Health Minister Greg Hunt has announced more PPE will be sent to southeast Queensland after it was declared a Commonwealth hotspot, and the Pfizer vaccine will be made available to children aged between 12 and 15 who are immunocompromised.
This change in the vaccine rollout will occur on August 9.
“ … for 12-year-olds to 15-year-olds, as foreshadowed just over a week ago, the Pfizer vaccine will now be made available on ATAGI’s advice for immunocompromised children, or children with underlying medical conditions, indigenous children, and children in remote communities aged 12-15,” he said.
“Although, if any GP wishes to administer before then, then it is free for them, or states, to do so.
“But that’s the commencement of that program. They will be included under phase 1B, which means that they will have access as part of that program going forward.
It includes approximately 220,000 children who will be given access now as a consequence of that decision.”
Mr Hunt said this last week saw a record vaccination week with 1.18 million Australians coming forward, taking us to almost 12.4 million vaccinations.

NSW RECORDS 207 COVID CASES AS MAN DIES Another 207 new cases of Covid-19 have been diagnosed in NSW, including at least 50 who were in the community for their entire infectious period.
The state has also recorded another death with a man in his 90s dying from Covid at Liverpool hospital. He had received one does of the AstraZeneca vaccine in April.
This is the 15th death linked to the current outbreak.
NSW Premier Gladys Berejiklian said more than 107,000 people were tested in the latest 24-hour reporting period but has concerns over two key areas of transmission.
“The main form of transmission remains workplaces and also households,” she said, speaking to the media on Monday.
“That is being consistent and that is what we are trying to break the back of moving forward.”
The premier also reiterated a previous warning about young people being impacted with many forced to seek hospital care.
“Unlike the flu, with Covid, it’s people in their 20s, 30s and 40s that are most mobile,” she said.
Of the new cases, only 89 were confirmed to be in isolation for their entire infectious period.
Sydney’s southwest and western suburbs remain areas of serious concern as the virus continues to spread through households.
Eighty-three of today’s cases were from the southwest, 53 were from the west, 48 from inner Sydney, 17 are from the southwest and six from northern Sydney.
The new figures come as about 300 army personnel join police to help crackdown on those breaking strict lockdown measures.
NSW Covid Exposure Sites

QLD LOCKDOWN EXTENDED Queensland has recorded 13 new locally acquired Covid-19 cases on Monday, on the second day of the southeast corner’s snap lockdown.
Authorities say the new cases are genomically linked to the 17-year-old Indooroopilly State High school student.
The state’s lockdown has now been extended until at least Sunday. Deputy Premier Stephen Miles said the three-day snap lockdown would “not be sufficient” after recording six cases, nine and then 13 in the past three days.
“We’re advising southeast Queenslanders in the 11 local government areas that the lockdown will be extended until 4pm on Sunday,” he said on Monday.
“That will make it an eight-day lockdown. And we desperately hope that that will be sufficient for our contact tracers to get (on top of the outbreak).”
The 11 local government areas of southeast Queensland were plunged into lockdown on Saturday. Dozens of new exposure sites are expected to be listed by Queensland Health later on Monday. NED-3869-Covid-19-Exposure-Sites-Qld

‘WE CAN TURN THIS AROUND’ Sydney could see a relaxation of lockdown restrictions by September with the state on track to reach 70 per cent of vaccination in five weeks.
Premier Gladys Berejiklian said the government had a plan to “break records”.
“Once you get to 50 per cent vaccination, 60 per cent, 70 per cent, that triggers more freedoms. We can turn this around in four weeks,” she said after the state recorded 239 locally acquired cases on Sunday.
“We have the month of August to get the vaccination rates as high as possible. Let August be the month where we break records with the vaccination.”
With more than 82,000 doses distributed in 24 hours, federal health officials believe that weekly vaccinations in NSW could rise to 650,000, allowing for the 70 per cent trigger by September.

HOW QLD COMPARES TO NSW Queensland’s Covid outbreak could become a “significant event” that will likely see numbers rise in the coming days, an infectious diseases expert has warned.
Associate Professor Paul Griffin, director of Infectious Diseases at Mater Health Services in Brisbane, said the state had been in the “enviable position” of avoiding widespread outbreaks of the highly contagious Delta variant so far.
But he said the current outbreak that has shut down southeast Queensland in a strict three-day lockdown had the potential to escalate rapidly.
“I don’t think it will get as bad as it is in Sydney, and we already had a mask mandate at the outset,” Dr Griffin said.
“We have gone hard and gone early with the lockdown, but there’s always a lag. We strongly expect our numbers will climb in the next two days.
“We are probably going to do quite well but it has the potential to be a significant event.”

NED-4109-Qld-restrictions
HANSON SLAMS QLD LOCKDOWN Senator Pauline Hanson has criticised Prime Minister Scott Morrison claiming he had “lost control of Australia” as part of Queensland went into a three-day snap lockdown.
In a video posted online on Saturday, Ms Hanson described the lockdown as “bloody ridiculous”.
“Like a lot of Aussies I was out enjoying my weekend but now we are going to have to be locked down,” she said.
“It is bloody ridiculous for only six cases of Delta. I’m sorry this is over the top.”
“The prime minister said yesterday it would get no worse than what it is at this point, he’s supposed to guide us through this with the premiers.
“As I’ve said all along the prime minister has lost control of the country and the premiers are doing whatever they want to do. I feel sorry for small businesses.”
Ms Hanson went on to say lockdowns were being called “at the drop of a hat”.
“Give people clear direction and what’s going on,” she said.
It came after Mr Morrison explained Australia’s four-step road map out of Covid-19 lockdowns on Friday, where he said Australia had to get to a vaccination target of 70 per cent before restrictions would ease.
He also said premiers had agree to this in principle, with international travel to open after the country had achieved a vaccination target of 80 per cent.
On Saturday, Mr Morrison delivered a pointed reference to wild conspiracy theories during an interview on talkback radio as he pleaded with Australians to follow scientifically supported medical advice – not fake experts on Facebook.
The odd remark comes after the Prime Minister revealed lockdowns would be discouraged and international borders would begin to reopen once 80 per cent of eligible Australians are fully vaccinated against Covid-19.
Morrison said he hoped the agreement on the target would encourage the population to get the jab as vaccine hesitancy persists and disenfranchised citizens take to the streets in anti-lockdown protests.
“By getting vaccinated, you're getting a step closer every single day to getting us back to about as normal as you can be when you’re living with Covid-19,” he told 2GB on Saturday morning.
When discussing the prevailing rate of vaccine hesitancy across the country, Morrison urged Australians to resist following views of conspiracy theorists and to “go and talk to your doctor”.
“If you are concerned, don't talk to Doctor Google, go talk to your doctor,” the Prime Minister said.
“Don’t talk to someone who’s going to tell you you’re going to turn into a magnet or, you know, don’t go on Facebook to listen to people who don’t know what they’re talking about.”
The bizarre magnet reference is likely in relation to the unusual theory among alternative communities who fear the substance of the vaccine, with some even believing it will allow the recipient to connect to the internet.
The theory originated because some mRNA vaccines, a new type of jab used to protect against infectious diseases, include a material called hydrogel, which is used to help disperse the vaccine slowly into the recipient’s cells.
The fear of being a vessel to connect to Wi-Fi is, of course, nonsense and flatly rejected by the federal Health Department.
“Bioengineers have used similar hydrogels for many years in different ways,” the health authority said earlier in the year. “For instance, they’ve used them to help stem cells survive after being put inside our bodies.
“Because of this, some people believe that hydrogels are needed for electronic implants, which can connect to the internet.”
But the Pfizer mRNA vaccine doesn’t even contain hydrogels as a component, instead using a piece of mRNA that is “coated in a lipid (fatty) droplet”.
“The lipid helps the vaccine enter our cells, as the membrane holding our cells together is also made mostly of lipid,” the Department of Health said.
“The vaccine and the membrane can fuse easily, depositing the mRNA inside the cell.”
According to the Centre of Disease Control in the US, no ingredient in any Covid-19 vaccine is capable of producing electromagnetic force – at the injection site or anywhere else in your body.
“COVID-19 vaccines do not contain ingredients that can produce an electromagnetic field at the site of your injection,” official advice states. “All COVID-19 vaccines are free from metals.”
Morrison said he was ambitious the threshold for vaccinations would be reached by Christmas so the country can attempt to return to normalcy by 2022.
“There’ll be enough vaccines,” he said in regards to 80 per cent of the population being vaccinated by the end of the year.
“There’ll be enough pharmacies, enough GPs, enough clinics, enough of all of that to achieve that.
“So it’s all up to all of us now.”

Full text: Scott Morrison has set a goal to fully vaccinate a further 10.7 million Australians by the end of the year under a national reopening plan that will reduce restrictions for inoculated residents, ­resume some international travel and make lockdowns less likely.
Following a marathon national cabinet meeting on Friday, the Prime Minister unveiled a new four-phase national plan that sets a vaccine coverage target of 70 per cent before the country can move out of the current suppression phase.
With more than 3.7 million people already fully vaccinated, the targets will require a further 10.7 million people to receive both jabs to reach the target of 70 per cent of all Australians eligible for the vaccine, or 14.4 million people.
The reopening blueprint, based on health and economic modelling provided by the Doherty Institute and Treasury, outlines four stages ending in a post-­vaccination phase where Australians live with Covid-19 in a similar way to influenza.
The Weekend Australian ­understands there will be enough supply to jab all eligible Australians twice before the end of the year and the federal government is increasingly confident it can hit 80 per cent coverage by December, advancing the country to the third phase of the plan.
Under phase three, there will be targeted lockdowns in exceptional scenarios, restrictions on vaccinated Australians will be lifted, new travel bubbles opened up and caps increased for student, economic and humanitarian visa holders.
In the fourth phase, uncapped international travel will resume with quarantine reserved for high-risk travellers and vaccine boosters provided as necessary.
Mr Morrison, who said that within days vaccinated people would have a digital wallet recording their inoculations, said travellers coming into the country would need to be vaccinated with a dose “recognised in Australia”.
“By the time we get to that stage, digital vaccination certificates for many nations will already be in place,” he said. “Indeed for Australia it will be in place.” On the back of another day of record vaccinations that pushed national vaccine coverage to 18.24 per cent, Mr Morrison said he was confident the nation could hit 70 per cent by December.
“I believe we can get this done but it’s not something that any one government, any one vaccination clinic, any one Australian can achieve on their own – it’s done as a team effort,” Mr Morrison said.
Industry groups questioned the reality of hitting a 70 per cent vaccine rate by December and warned that until the next phases of the national plan were unlocked, business would need to “brace itself for disruption for at least the next six months”.
The in-principle agreement struck by federal, state and territory leaders on Friday does not include specific timelines and will require Australia-wide average vaccination rates to reach 70 and 80 per cent before any one jurisdiction can move to the next step.
Mr Morrison said the national plan would “chart the way back” out of the suppression phase, currently dominated by the extended lockdown in NSW and avoiding outbreaks of the more contagious Delta strain.
“Under this plan, no state or territory is required to increase the restrictions beyond where they are right now. They are a matter for them to set based on the balance of risk that they see in their state or territory,” Mr Morrison said.
“There is no state or jurisdiction in the country that wants to apply a lockdown or hold Australians back should it not be necessary. What the modelling … showed us was that when you get to that 70 per cent level you have achieved a level of coverage which enables you to then ease into that process.” Mr Morrison said the national plan was “not about freedom days”. “We have made our own Australian way through this,” he said. “Sure, we’ve acted with a lot of caution. That’s why there are 30,000 Australians today who are still alive because of that and the decisions that we’ve taken.
“We don’t go from shut one day, open the next. That is a very dangerous path. What we need to do is take steps towards that – sensible, cautious steps. We get to 70 per cent. So let’s get there and then we get to 80 per cent and we make that work and then we get to the next level.” West Australian Premier Mark McGowan said the 70 per cent vaccination target was “fairly modest”, flagging the more significant change would come with the third phase, which requires an 80 per cent threshold.
“In any event, the exact criteria within each of the phases isn’t resolved as yet,” Mr McGowan said. “Some are agreed but not all, and a range of states and territories will work on that over the coming weeks to nail that down. We do need a road map, we need to understand what the plan is.” Queensland Premier Annastacia Palaszczuk said the in-­principle agreement was to achieve 70 and 80 per cent vaccine coverage before states could move to “more limited lockdowns … when needed”. “In the meantime with the threat of variants like Delta we still maintain a strategy of hard and fast lockdowns because they are so fast moving,” Ms Palaszczuk.
Australian Industry Group chief executive Innes Willox said business needed to brace itself for disruption for at least the next six months while lockdowns were a component of “formal national policy”. “We need a formal end point for this disruption no matter the take up rate. Once everyone eligible has been offered a vaccine we need to move to the next phase and not be held hostage to vaccine hesitancy and opposition,” Mr Willox said.
“Our economic recovery depends on all our leaders sticking by their agreements, something they have found impossible to abide by to this point.” With more than 1 billion doses of AstraZeneca now supplied globally, Mr Morrison urged Australians to book an appointment for the jab as the domestic take-up of the Oxford University-developed vaccine increased. “If you want to get vaccinated, the AZ vaccine is there for you. It is a highly effective vaccine as we’ve seen all around the world,” he said.
THE PATH OUT Changes at 70% full vaccination ● Ease restrictions on vaccinated residents ● Restore international border caps to previous levels ● Allow capped entry of student and economic visa-holders subject to quarantine arrangements Changes at 80% full vaccination ● Exempt vaccinated residents from all domestic restrictions ● Abolish caps on returning vaccinated Australians ● Allow increased capped entry of student, economic and humanitarian visa-holders ● Lift all restrictions on outbound travel for vaccinated Australians ● Extend travel bubble for unrestricted travel to new candidate countries (Singapore, Pacific) ● Gradual reopening of inward and outward international travel with safe countries MORE REPORTS P6-9 INQUIRER P15, 18-19, 21 EDITORIAL P20

Full text: 70 per cent the goal to ease restrictions
The Prime Minister Scott Morrison has announced a national COVID-19 vaccination target of 70 per cent will be required for Australia to start to ease debilitating pandemic restrictions.
Mr Morrison says the Commonwealth, state and territory leaders have "agreed in principle" to a plan and the targets for a four-stage plan roadmap out of COVID. Australia is still under "Phase A" or suppression stage of the roadmap.
The next stage is "Phase B" which triggers the easing of restrictions and the newly agreed target is 70 per cent of eligible people.

The target needed for the next stage, "Phase C" - where vaccinated residents will have no restrictions and vaccinated Australians can travel overseas - is 80 per cent.
Mr Morrison says Australia will reopen with caution.
"We don't go from shut one day, open the next. That is a very, in our view, dangerous path," he said.
"What we need to do is take steps towards that, sensible, cautious steps, we get to 70 per cent.
"So let's get there and then we get to 80 per cent and we make that work and then we get to the next level."
There is no timeline or timeframe for this plan.
The Prime Minister has deferred to the Australian people, although it is expected at current rates of vaccination it is still some time away.
"We haven't put timelines on this because the timelines are now in the hands of all Australians together with state and territory governments and the federal government," Mr Morrison said.
The Prime Minister also said the states have agreed that, "no state ... was required to increase restrictions beyond where they are right now."
National cabinet has been reviewing scientific and economic modelling to assess exactly when Australia can dispense with lockdowns and other restrictions. The Doherty Institute was commissioned several weeks ago as part of a four-stage plan to reopen Australia and return to some form of normality.
Treasury did its its own economic modelling which was also presented to national cabinet.
It comes as the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) reveals disturbing new information on the danger of the Delta variant which is spreading in Sydney.
An internal CDC slide presentation, first obtained by The Washington Post, urges the agency to "acknowledge that the war has changed," showing that Delta could be as contagious as chicken pox and more easily spread than the common cold, the 1918 flu and small pox.
The variant, according to the CDC, also likely increases the risk of severe disease and hospitalisation over the original COVID-19 strain.

Full text: 70 per cent the goal to ease restrictions
The Prime Minister Scott Morrison has announced a national COVID-19 vaccination target of 70 per cent will be required for Australia to start to ease debilitating pandemic restrictions.
Mr Morrison says the Commonwealth, state and territory leaders have "agreed in principle" to a plan and the targets for a four-stage plan roadmap out of COVID. Australia is still under "Phase A" or suppression stage of the roadmap.
The next stage is "Phase B" which triggers the easing of restrictions and the newly agreed target is 70 per cent of eligible people.

Mr Morrison says Australia will reopen with caution.

Full text: The Prime Minister Scott Morrison has announced a national COVID-19 vaccination target of 80 per cent will be required for Australia to reopen the nation and end debilitating pandemic restrictions.
Before that, the target that will trigger the start of the graduation easing of restrictions has been set at 70 per cent of vaccinated eligible Australians.
That's seven in every 10 people eligible for the jab receiving both doses of a COVID-19 vaccine.
After assessing scientific modelling from Doherty Institute and economic modelling from Treasury, Commonwealth, state and territory leaders have "agreed in principle" to the plan and the targets for a four-stage plan roadmap out of Covid."
"These are targets for all Australians to achieve," the Prime Minister said.
"States, territories, working together, communities working together, individuals, GPs, pharmacists. Australia will get this done by working together.
"The targets are there for us all to achieve and for us all to work towards."
Australia is still under "Phase A" or the suppression stage of the roadmap.
The next stage is the transition "Phase B" which triggers the easing of restrictions and the newly agreed target is 70 per cent of eligible people. The whole country needs to reach that target as well as all the states individually.
The target needed for the next stage, the consolidation "Phase C" - where vaccinated residents will have no domestic restrictions and vaccinated Australians can travel overseas - is 80 per cent. There will be only highly targeted lockdowns when needed.
No vaccination target has been decided for the final phase.
Mr Morrison says Australia will reopen with caution.
"We don't go from shut one day, open the next. That is a very, in our view, dangerous path," he said.
"What we need to do is take steps towards that, sensible, cautious steps, we get to 70 per cent. So let's get there and then we get to 80 per cent and we make that work and then we get to the next level."
There is no timeline or timeframe for achieving the targets in this plan.
The Prime Minister has deferred to the Australian people, although it is expected at current rates of vaccination it is still some time away.
Just 18.2 per cent of people aged 16 and over have been fully vaccinated against COVID-19 more than five months after the rollout started.
More than 210,000 doses of vaccines were administered in the past 24 hours, the second consecutive record day."
We haven't put timelines on this because the timelines are now in the hands of all Australians together with state and territory governments and the federal government," Mr Morrison said.

Full text: The Prime Minister Scott Morrison has announced a national COVID-19 vaccination target of 80 per cent will be required for Australia to reopen the nation and end debilitating pandemic restrictions.
Before that, the target that will trigger the start of the graduation easing of restrictions has been set at 70 per cent of vaccinated eligible Australians.
That's seven in every 10 people eligible for the jab receiving both doses of a COVID-19 vaccine.
After assessing scientific modelling from Doherty Institute and economic modelling from Treasury, Commonwealth, state and territory leaders have "agreed in principle" to the plan and the targets for a four-stage plan roadmap out of Covid."
"These are targets for all Australians to achieve," the Prime Minister said.
"States, territories, working together, communities working together, individuals, GPs, pharmacists. Australia will get this done by working together.
"The targets are there for us all to achieve and for us all to work towards."
Australia is still under "Phase A" or the suppression stage of the roadmap.
The next stage is the transition "Phase B" which triggers the easing of restrictions and the newly agreed target is 70 per cent of eligible people. The whole country needs to reach that target as well as all the states individually.
The target needed for the next stage, the consolidation "Phase C" - where vaccinated residents will have no domestic restrictions and vaccinated Australians can travel overseas - is 80 per cent. There will be only highly targeted lockdowns when needed.
No vaccination target has been decided for the final phase.
Mr Morrison says Australia will reopen with caution.
"We don't go from shut one day, open the next. That is a very, in our view, dangerous path," he said.
"What we need to do is take steps towards that, sensible, cautious steps, we get to 70 per cent. So let's get there and then we get to 80 per cent and we make that work and then we get to the next level."
There is no timeline or timeframe for achieving the targets in this plan.
The Prime Minister has deferred to the Australian people, although it is expected at current rates of vaccination it is still some time away.
Just 18.2 per cent of people aged 16 and over have been fully vaccinated against COVID-19 more than five months after the rollout started.
More than 210,000 doses of vaccines were administered in the past 24 hours, the second consecutive record day."
We haven't put timelines on this because the timelines are now in the hands of all Australians together with state and territory governments and the federal government," Mr Morrison said.

Full text: AUSTRALIA will need 70 per cent of people under 60 and 95 per cent of seniors vaccinated against Covid to open safely, one of the nation’s top research institutes has found.
Even then, face masks and some restrictions on gatherings will need to be reintroduced during danger periods to keep Covid-19 deaths below the annual flu toll.
Melbourne’s Burnet Institute, a world-leading medical research body, has undertaken modelling to help guide policymakers. It comes at the same time as the Doherty Institute has done similar work for Australia’s national Covid cabinet, which meets today to discuss the data.
The Burnet Institute’s modelling found once 95 per cent of those over 60, 70 per cent for those aged 12-59, and 70 per cent of children were vaccinated Australia could safely reopen its international borders – provided the number of deaths and hospitalisations are balanced with intermittent ­restrictions.
Premier Steven Marshall said it could take several meetings of the national cabinet to work through predictions on vaccine thresholds, and it was unlikely binding agreements would be finalised today.
“We are looking at those thresholds we need to get to, to the various stages where we no longer have lockdowns,” Mr Marshall, pictured, said.
“We need to start the discussion, it might take several meetings, and if we need to have additional meetings or get additional information we will do that,” he said.
“This is a very important decision for Australia and we need everyone around that national cabinet table to be playing their part to create a pathway for certainty for the people of Australia.” Business leaders have called for a vaccine threshold target so they can make plans without the fear of sudden lockdowns or border closures.
Mr Marshall said Australia would learn from lessons in Northern Hemisphere nations which had relaxed restrictions at various levels. These include places such as The Netherlands, where restrictions were eased when vaccination rates hit 50 per cent, but a subsequent surge in cases saw them reintroduced.
“We need a careful and considered pathway,” Mr Marshall said, adding more stocks of vaccine arriving next month would help the rollout. South Australia administered 13,770 vaccinations on Wednesday for a total of 844,675. About 40 per cent of people have now had one shot and 17.9 per cent are fully vaccinated.

Targeted lockdowns ‘to run into new year’

Full text: Scott Morrison and national cabinet leaders are preparing for ­targeted lockdowns to run into next year, with Treasury updating its assumptions on the frequency and economic ramifications of Covid-19 restrictions in response to the highly contagious Delta strain.
Scenarios prepared by the ­Doherty Institute outlining the optimal vaccine coverage required for Australia to begin opening up have been shared with Treasury officials, who have been tasked with modelling the economic costs of various health outcomes.
The Australian understands Treasury is updating its assumptions on the frequency of lockdowns and other Covid-19 restrictions, which will be provided to national cabinet leaders to balance the health and economic advice.
Ahead of Friday’s national cabinet meeting where state and territory leaders will be briefed on the Doherty Institute’s preliminary findings, the Prime Minister refused to commit to lockdowns ending by the end of the year, ­saying “no one can give those guarantees”.
“The virus is unpredictable and it would be irresponsible to do so,” he said. After the federal and NSW governments this week announced a $1bn-a-week rescue package for businesses and individuals, Deloitte Access Economics partner Chris Richardson said the climbing costs of lockdown relief and the hit to taxes from a slump in economic activity would send the federal budget backwards.
The Morrison government’s cautious approach comes after countries with high vaccination rates – including Singapore and Israel – were recently forced to reintroduce lockdowns and Covid-19 restrictions in response to new Delta outbreaks.
Previous modelling on the Alpha variant provided to national cabinet earlier this year has been superseded by the Doherty Institute’s work on the Delta variant. Senior government sources said a final decision on Australia’s four-stage plan to reopen the country, which is likely to be finalised in August, would be based on the best, most current, health and economic data.
Mr Morrison said while he was confident the nation could get on top of Covid-19 outbreaks and restrictions by Christmas, targeted lockdowns in “extraordinary circumstances” could not be ruled out even when vaccination rates reached higher levels.
On the back of a record day of vaccine delivery, with more than 201,000 jabs administered, Health Minister Greg Hunt said the government’s ambition was to return “as close to normal as possible, as quickly as possible”.
Treasury’s updated forecasts, in line with the Doherty Institute’s vaccination scenarios, follows optimistic assumptions in the May 11 budget that said “localised outbreaks of Covid-19 are ­assumed to occur but are effectively contained”.
“It is assumed there are no extended or sustained state border restrictions in place over the forecast period,” they said.
Ahead of the mid-year economic and fiscal outlook this year, Mr Richardson said astounding improvements in the commonwealth budget since May had now been more than reversed.
“The remarkable improvement in the budget before this hit gave us a lot, but it’s now reached a point where the cost of the support measures and the cost of the weaker economy eating into the tax take have taken back more than that,” he said.
Mr Richardson said the federal government would need to borrow up to an extra $20bn to cover new spending initiatives but the decision to ramp up spending was the correct response, and even an extra $20bn in debt would add only marginally to interest obligations.
Moody’s lead analyst for Australia, Martin Petch, said while the lockdowns would trigger a deterioration in the budget, it was not expected to be “material”. Latest Department of Finance figures showed by May a $13.9bn improvement in the $161bn forecast deficit for this financial year as the recovery ran ahead of the most optimistic forecasts.

PM pledges vaccine plan to prevent lockdowns

Full text: Prime Minister Scott Morrison said lockdowns will be a thing of the past by Christmas as he announced national cabinet would begin tomorrow to consider how many Australians must be vaccinated to prevent future city-wide closures.
As Sydney's outbreak continued to worsen and its lockdown was extended by a month, and Melbourne reported one new mystery case, Mr Morrison claimed life would be "very different" by the end of the year, with the vaccination program completed by late December, mitigating the need for further draconian restrictions.
"I would expect by Christmas that we would be seeing a very different Australia to what we are seeing now ... Lockdowns become a thing of the past when you are at that level," he said.
The optimistic prognosis came as federal and state governments agreed on more generous assistance for individuals and businesses affected by COVID-19.
Under a new federal funding package, workers who lose 20 hours or more a week in future lockdowns will receive $750 per week - the same level as the old JobKeeper payment - which will kick in from day one of the lockdown. People who have lost fewer hours of work will get $450.
People on welfare payments such as JobSeeker, pensions and Youth Allowance who have lost work due to lockdowns will be able to apply for the first time for a new $200 weekly supplement.
A new $400 million state-administered business support package will help small and medium businesses and their landlords, including with rental assistance.
Victoria has reintroduced the Commercial Tenancy Relief Scheme to provide rental relief for eligible tenants and an $80 million hardship fund for their landlords.
One more person died in Sydney yesterday and 177 new COVID-19 cases were announced as Premier Gladys Berejiklian extended the lockdown of Greater Sydney for a month and urged people to accept an AstraZeneca vaccine.
In Melbourne, the day after some lockdown restrictions lifted, nine new local cases emerged, including one young man without known links to another case. Health Minister Martin Foley revealed the man worked as a traffic controller at the Moonee Valley Racecourse drive-through testing site for two days while infectious, forcing the site to close and the staff who worked alongside him to isolate. Six new exposure sites were announced.
Mr Morrison said the federal government had been sent the Doherty Institute's modelling on the vaccination levels required to end the need for lockdowns, and said work was under way to combine that with Treasury predictions ahead of tomorrow's meeting.
"That will be our first discussion. I suspect many more will be required after that," he told reporters. "I hope we'll be able to set those targets ... We are setting the targets scientifically, combined with the economic advice as well, and that gets us a road map to Christmas, I think, that means that we'll be living life different at Christmas than what we are now."
At the start of July Mr Morrison revealed a four-phase plan to return Australia to a form of COVID-normal, with open borders and few restrictions. The Age has reported the Doherty Institute's modelling will have different vaccination thresholds for older and younger Australians.
Tomorrow's meeting will be the first time state and territory leaders will have detailed targets on how many of their citizens must get vaccinated in order to end border closures and business shutdowns.
The more generous income provisions came after weeks of criticism of the federal government that its emergency payments to workers and people on welfare were too slow to begin and not generous enough, prompting calls for the reintroduction of JobKeeper. Mr Morrison said yesterday that "JobKeeper was a great scheme but you don't play last year's grand final this year."
About 143,000 Victorians claimed the less generous support package during the state's recently ended lockdown, and Mr Morrison said they would receive a second payment at the end of this week.
The centrepiece of the new business support package is an $80 million "landlord hardship fund" intended to subsidise owners of commercial buildings for rental concessions they will be legally obliged to offer to their tenants. Companies with an annual turnover of less than $50 million that can show a coronavirus hit to their businesses of at least 30 per cent can claim a proportionate rent reduction. At least half of the reduction must be permanently waived, while the rest can be deferred.
The Victorian Small Business Commission will mediate if parties cannot reach agreement.
The cost of another $320 million in business grants will be evenly split between the state and Commonwealth and with extra payments on offer to traders in Melbourne's CBD and the alpine snow fields, the money is expected to boost the cash flows of tens of thousands of firms.With Katina Curtis

Full text: VICTORIA has imposed a hard border on NSW as the Sydney outbreak continues its spread across Australia, with epidemiologists warning that stronger measures are needed to protect the nation.
Premier Daniel Andrews on Tuesday banned any Victorians still in NSW – except essential workers or those given compassionate exemptions – from returning in the next fortnight while suspending all red zone permits from Covid-19 hotspots.
South Australia also became the latest state plunged into lockdown due to the Delta variant, which leaked from Sydney before its lockdown was strengthened on July 9.
University of Melbourne epidemiologist Professor Tony Blakely said restrictions on construction and other worksites implemented this week effectively put Sydney under a stage 4 lockdown, although the current outbreak would present a risk for weeks.
“It could be at least several weeks before they get those numbers to something like five cases per day,” Prof Blakely said.
“The real shame for Sydney is it will take considerable time ... it’s going to take weeks to beat this thing. The question is: What can we do to speed it up by a week or so?” While states have halved their hotel quarantine intake, Prof Blakely said the threat of infected cases travelling over borders now presented the same level of risk for each jurisdiction.
As he extended Victoria’s lockdown, Mr Andrews ramped up his rhetoric on the Berejiklian government’s restrictions, saying a hard border was required to prevent more Delta cases coming from Sydney.
“I’ll just remind you all, we had a ring of steel around Melbourne last year and it didn’t just protect country Victoria, it protected the whole country,” Mr Andrews said.
“They are not locked in Sydney, so they must be locked out of Victoria. “That is the choice I have had to make. We don’t want to get this outbreak under control only to see another outbreak flare up, another incursion.” Victoria deemed SA a red zone after a fifth local case emerged and the state entered a tough seven-day lockdown. Schools and the construction industry are closed, while residents are limited to 90 minutes exercise a day within 2.5km of their home.
Queensland is also on alert after a woman in her 20s tested positive after returning from a Melbourne exposure site on July 10, despite being fully vaccinated. Western Australia and Tasmania have also placed a hard border on NSW, Queensland and Victoria, while restricting travel from SA.
Although Sydney’s Delta outbreak began on June 16, the first “soft lockdown” measures were only introduced on June 26, before being partially streng­thened on July 9 and again stepped up on the weekend.
The lockdown was extended to three towns in the central west after an infected dog food delivery driver visited the area.
The NSW government’s decision not to enter a “hard and fast” lockdown at the early stages of the outbreak is now expected to result in the state enduring weeks – or months – of harsh measures.
Modelling by the Burnet Institute last week revealed the restrictions first placed over Syd­ney would not be enough to drive the outbreak down, resulting in 100-plus daily cases and thousands of deaths over the coming months.
Although the Berejiklian gov­ern­ment has now brought its settings closer into line with the Victorian stage 4 restrictions – which experts say are needed to overcome the Delta outbreak – it may still take more than a month to control its spread.
According to the institute’s modelling, even if the density restrictions introduced in NSW on July 9 were maintained for the next 12 months, they would not eliminate the outbreak, leading to 12 times the number of deaths than during the horror 2017 flu season that claimed 654 lives in NSW.
“When we looked at the NSW numbers, but in a simulation for Victoria, we found that if you didn’t have the stage 4 level of restrictions, we would not be able to control the outbreak – and that you would be in some level of restriction for many months as opposed to weeks,” the institute’s deputy director, Professor Margaret Hellard, said.

Jab targets unlock path to freedom

Full text: Scott Morrison has clinched a deal with premiers to return life to normal by tying the national ­reopening to new vaccination targets, under a plan that will leave potential lockdowns and a ­shuttered international border in place for at least another six months.
National cabinet agreed to a four-step blueprint on Friday for a phased easing of restrictions once Australians have met the new vaccine thresholds, which will be set using scientific modelling from epidemiologists at the Doherty Institute in Melbourne.
But, to secure the support of national cabinet, Mr Morrison was forced to accept demands from Labor states to slash the number of international arrivals by 50 per cent, amid concern over the more-infectious Delta strain.
The numbers of foreign arrivals will be cut to 3034 a week from July 14 with no end date in sight, dampening the repatriation hopes of 34,000 Australians stranded overseas and alarming business, which is warning of critical skills shortages driven by a “Fortress Australia” mindset.
The Prime Minister sealed the breakthrough agreement in separate late-night conversations with NSW Premier Gladys ­Berejiklian and her Victorian counterpart Daniel Andrews on Thursday, following a week of political conflict between the states and commonwealth over vaccine supply.
The broad details of the plan had been thrashed out by Mr Morrison during his two weeks of quarantine at The Lodge before being circulated to the states on Friday morning.
In his first in-person appearance since returning from the G7 summit in Cornwall and France, the Prime Minister said further restrictions on international travel represented a “prudent action while we remain in this suppression phase of the virus”.
Mr Morrison said the first phase of his plan would include new trials of at-home quarantine – most likely in South Australia – and the introduction of a vaccine authentication regime on the international border. Lockdowns would only be used as a “last ­resort.” He rejected suggestions that the halving of overseas arrivals was the result of hotel quarantine system failures, after community outbreaks flared across the nation and plunged 11 million people into lockdown. Rather, it was “about the Delta variant”, he said.
“It’s simple,” he said. “The delta strain is more contagious, and so we’re just seeking to take precautionary steps to overall reduce the risk. I mean infection rates in quarantine are 1 per cent.” Mr Morrison signalled the abandonment of any pursuit of an elimination strategy, making it clear he wanted to get to a stage where Australians had enough protection through vaccinations so that Covid-19 “would be like the flu”.
Australians would need to “learn how to live with those strains, learn about them, and modify our approaches as required”, he said..
Just over 8 per cent of the ­Australian population is fully vaccinated. The nation broke through the 8 million dose mark on Friday, making it one of the slowest rollouts in the OECD.
Medical experts welcomed the plan on Friday, but suggested the delta strain would require an unlikely vaccination take-up of more than 80 per cent to allow for the full unwinding of restrictions.
Australian Medical Association president Omar Khorshid said the plan recognised that the “road out of this crisis is vaccination”. “The four stages of the plan announced today show a ­future that includes a reduction in restrictions, a limited use of lockdowns, an increase in travel caps, and potential return of international outbound travel – particularly for those who are vaccinated,” Dr Khorshid said.
“By the final stage of the plan, we see a vaccinated population and as a result, a health system prepared to treat Covid similar to how we manage the flu.” University of Melbourne epidemiologist Tony Blakely said vaccination was “not sufficient” to unlock restrictions and warned that Australians would need to practice Covid-safe living – such as masks, QR tracing and social distancing – for the next two years.
Business Council of Australia chief executive Jennifer Westacott said the plan provided hope.
“We are pleased to see plans to trial alternative quarantine options and the return of international students and economic visa holders,” Ms Westacott said. “We think we can be more ambitious and provide more incentive for getting the vaccine: for example vaccinated residents should be able to return to Australia as soon as possible. Also, vaccinated residents should be exempt from domestic restrictions.” Australian Industry Group chief executive Innes Willox said it was a “major step forward that ­finally delivers some hope to the Australian community” but he was disappointed at the “unwelcome six-month 50 per cent cap on international arrivals”.
Group of Eight universities chief executive Vicki Thomson said she backed the plan’s inclusion of commercial trials for the limited entry of student and economic visa holders during the first phase. “It seems likely that we may not see significant international student numbers returning to Australia until well into 2022, which is not unexpected but still sobering for the sector – notwithstanding our first priority of keeping Australians safe,” she said.
Chief medical officer Paul Kelly said home quarantine could be more safe than the current hotel system, arguing there was ­“decreased interaction with staff”, Professor Kelly said there would need to be a shift in the national psychology to “concentrate increasingly on severe illness rather than (on) numbers of cases”.
The slashing of arrival caps was a win for the Victorian, West Australian and Queensland governments, which had been pushing for a decrease until more of the population was vaccinated.
NSW Premier Gladys Berejiklian said she didn’t agree with the decision but would respect her fellow state and territory leaders.
While timelines under the four-step plan have not been agreed, Mr Morrison said a new phase could be entered once a yet-to-be specified vaccine threshold was achieved. He was optimistic all Australians would be offered a first jab by the end of the year. “I would hope that we were living in that second phase next year,” he said.
Anthony Albanese said the plan had come too late, arguing that the nation was already 18 months into the pandemic. “We need to fix the rollout of the vaccine and we need to fix the national quarantine,” he said.
THE PATH FORWARD PHASE 1: VACCINATE, PREPARE & PILOT Aimed at continued suppression of Covid-19. NN All Australians offered a vaccination as soon as possible. NN Temporary 50 per cent cut to inbound passenger arrival caps in response to the Delta variant. NN Increased commercial flights for international repatriations to Darwin. NN Trials of alternative quarantine options to commence, including home quarantine for returning travellers who have been vaccinated. NN Digital vaccination authentication to begin at international borders. NN Further review of the national hotel quarantine network to be undertaken.
PHASE 2: POST-VACCINATION Aimed at minimising serious illness, hospitalisation and fatality rates. NN Inbound passenger caps restored to previous levels for unvaccinated and vaccinated travellers. NN Capped entry of student and economic visa-holders allowed, subject to quarantine arrangements. NN New reduced quarantine arrangements to be introduced for vaccinated residents and a vaccine booster program to be implemented. NN Prime Minister hopes ‘we’re living in that second phase next year’
PHASE 3: CONSOLIDATION Aimed at managing Covid-19 in line with other infectious diseases. NN Nation to move out of lockdowns and the abolishment of caps for returning vaccinated travellers. NN Vaccinated Australians to be exempted from all domestic restrictions, and all restrictions on outbound travel for vaccinated Australians to be lifted. NN Cap on entry of student, economic and humanitarian visa-holders to be increased. NN Bubble for unrestricted travel to be extended to new candidate countries beginning with Singapore and Pacific nations.
PHASE 4: FINAL No cap on inbound arrivals. NN Quarantine not required for all vaccinated people. NN Uncapped arrivals of non-vaccinated travellers will be allowed, subject to pre-flight and on-arrival testing. The decision to move between the phases will be triggered by the achievement of key vaccination thresholds. These thresholds have not yet been set and will be informed by scientific modelling conducted for the Covid-19 Risk Analysis and Response Taskforce.

Full text: Scott Morrison has clinched a deal with premiers to return life to normal by tying the national ­reopening to new vaccination targets, under a plan that will leave potential lockdowns and a ­shuttered international border in place for at least another six months.
National cabinet agreed to a four-step blueprint on Friday for a phased easing of restrictions once Australians have met the new vaccine thresholds, which will be set using scientific modelling from epidemiologists at the Doherty Institute in Melbourne.
But, to secure the support of national cabinet, Mr Morrison was forced to accept demands from Labor states to slash the number of international arrivals by 50 per cent, amid concern over the more-infectious Delta strain.
The numbers of foreign arrivals will be cut to 3034 a week from July 14 with no end date in sight, dampening the repatriation hopes of 34,000 Australians stranded overseas and alarming business, which is warning of critical skills shortages driven by a “Fortress Australia” mindset.
The Prime Minister sealed the breakthrough agreement in separate late-night conversations with NSW Premier Gladys ­Berejiklian and her Victorian counterpart Daniel Andrews on Thursday, following a week of political conflict between the states and commonwealth over vaccine supply.
The broad details of the plan had been thrashed out by Mr Morrison during his two weeks of quarantine at The Lodge before being circulated to the states on Friday morning.
In his first in-person appearance since returning from the G7 summit in Cornwall and France, the Prime Minister said further restrictions on international travel represented a “prudent action while we remain in this suppression phase of the virus”.
Mr Morrison said the first phase of his plan would include new trials of at-home quarantine – most likely in South Australia – and the introduction of a vaccine authentication regime on the international border. Lockdowns would only be used as a “last ­resort.” He rejected suggestions that the halving of overseas arrivals was the result of hotel quarantine system failures, after community outbreaks flared across the nation and plunged 11 million people into lockdown. Rather, it was “about the Delta variant”, he said.
“It’s simple,” he said. “The delta strain is more contagious, and so we’re just seeking to take precautionary steps to overall reduce the risk. I mean infection rates in quarantine are 1 per cent.” Mr Morrison signalled the abandonment of any pursuit of an elimination strategy, making it clear he wanted to get to a stage where Australians had enough protection through vaccinations so that Covid-19 “would be like the flu”.
Australians would need to “learn how to live with those strains, learn about them, and modify our approaches as required”, he said..
Just over 8 per cent of the ­Australian population is fully vaccinated. The nation broke through the 8 million dose mark on Friday, making it one of the slowest rollouts in the OECD.
Medical experts welcomed the plan on Friday, but suggested the delta strain would require an unlikely vaccination take-up of more than 80 per cent to allow for the full unwinding of restrictions.
Australian Medical Association president Omar Khorshid said the plan recognised that the “road out of this crisis is vaccination”. “The four stages of the plan announced today show a ­future that includes a reduction in restrictions, a limited use of lockdowns, an increase in travel caps, and potential return of international outbound travel – particularly for those who are vaccinated,” Dr Khorshid said.
“By the final stage of the plan, we see a vaccinated population and as a result, a health system prepared to treat Covid similar to how we manage the flu.” University of Melbourne epidemiologist Tony Blakely said vaccination was “not sufficient” to unlock restrictions and warned that Australians would need to practice Covid-safe living – such as masks, QR tracing and social distancing – for the next two years.
Business Council of Australia chief executive Jennifer Westacott said the plan provided hope.
“We are pleased to see plans to trial alternative quarantine options and the return of international students and economic visa holders,” Ms Westacott said. “We think we can be more ambitious and provide more incentive for getting the vaccine: for example vaccinated residents should be able to return to Australia as soon as possible. Also, vaccinated residents should be exempt from domestic restrictions.” Australian Industry Group chief executive Innes Willox said it was a “major step forward that ­finally delivers some hope to the Australian community” but he was disappointed at the “unwelcome six-month 50 per cent cap on international arrivals”.
Group of Eight universities chief executive Vicki Thomson said she backed the plan’s inclusion of commercial trials for the limited entry of student and economic visa holders during the first phase. “It seems likely that we may not see significant international student numbers returning to Australia until well into 2022, which is not unexpected but still sobering for the sector – notwithstanding our first priority of keeping Australians safe,” she said.
Chief medical officer Paul Kelly said home quarantine could be more safe than the current hotel system, arguing there was ­“decreased interaction with staff”, Professor Kelly said there would need to be a shift in the national psychology to “concentrate increasingly on severe illness rather than (on) numbers of cases”.
The slashing of arrival caps was a win for the Victorian, West Australian and Queensland governments, which had been pushing for a decrease until more of the population was vaccinated.
NSW Premier Gladys Berejiklian said she didn’t agree with the decision but would respect her fellow state and territory leaders.
While timelines under the four-step plan have not been agreed, Mr Morrison said a new phase could be entered once a yet-to-be specified vaccine threshold was achieved. He was optimistic all Australians would be offered a first jab by the end of the year. “I would hope that we were living in that second phase next year,” he said.
Anthony Albanese said the plan had come too late, arguing that the nation was already 18 months into the pandemic. “We need to fix the rollout of the vaccine and we need to fix the national quarantine,” he said.
THE PATH FORWARD PHASE 1: VACCINATE, PREPARE & PILOT Aimed at continued suppression of Covid-19.
* All Australians offered a vaccination as soon as possible. * Temporary 50 per cent cut to inbound passenger arrival caps in response to the Delta variant.
* Increased commercial flights for international repatriations to Darwin. * Trials of alternative quarantine options to commence, including home quarantine for returning travellers who have been vaccinated.
* Digital vaccination authentication to begin at international borders. * Further review of the national hotel quarantine network to be undertaken.
PHASE 2: POST-VACCINATION Aimed at minimising serious illness, hospitalisation and fatality rates. * Inbound passenger caps restored to previous levels for unvaccinated and vaccinated travellers.
* Capped entry of student and economic visa-holders allowed, subject to quarantine arrangements.
* New reduced quarantine arrangements to be introduced for vaccinated residents and a vaccine booster program to be implemented.
* Prime Minister hopes ‘we’re living in that second phase next year’
PHASE 3: CONSOLIDATION Aimed at managing Covid-19 in line with other infectious diseases. * Nation to move out of lockdowns and the abolishment of caps for returning vaccinated travellers.
* Vaccinated Australians to be exempted from all domestic restrictions, and all restrictions on outbound travel for vaccinated Australians to be lifted.
* Cap on entry of student, economic and humanitarian visa-holders to be increased.
* Bubble for unrestricted travel to be extended to new candidate countries beginning with Singapore and Pacific nations.
PHASE 4: FINAL NN * No cap on inbound arrivals.
* Quarantine not required for all vaccinated people.
* Uncapped arrivals of non-vaccinated travellers will be allowed, subject to pre-flight and on-arrival testing.
The decision to move between the phases will be triggered by the achievement of key vaccination thresholds. These thresholds have not yet been set and will be informed by scientific modelling conducted for the Covid-19 Risk Analysis and Response Taskforce.

COVID roadmap to rule all?

Full text: Editorial
Five days after Scott Morrison blindsided state and territory leaders with his backflip on AstraZeneca, he presented a united front.
The group of leaders had devised a new plan for the country to tackle the momentous task of vaccinating the population and re-opening Australia to the world.
Mr Morrison set out the shiny, new outlook with four phases on Friday - one that would see governments move away from lockdowns and hard border closures and toward allowing COVID-19 to become another seasonal virus. But the plan requires crucial checkboxes to be ticked first.
Vaccination percentage thresholds are the missing puzzle piece Australia needs to achieve in order to progress to each new phase and one the Prime Minister shied away from committing to just yet.
A vague indication suggesting the country would start to slowly ease restrictions for vaccinated people - the second phase - next year was flagged but it could hardly be seen as a commitment. While the plan sounds otherwise promising, it feels all too familiar.
Just months earlier, the Prime Minister and Health Minister Greg Hunt had confidently proposed four million Australians would be vaccinated by the end of March.
In reality, the rollout barely reached a quarter of the initial hopes. So, what will make the public believe them this time? After a shambolic rollout and recent confusion over which vaccine should be taken, it's a tough sell. Yet the absence of clear dates or vaccination percentage targets might be the only move the government has left. Mr Morrison said those details would be provided by the Doherty Institute once it's modelling on the sufficient targets had been completed. By placing the load on health experts, the government has shifted the message to its tried and tested method - trusting in expert advice. With expert modelling as the basis for the roadmap, it's a lot harder to argue the failures if targets are missed. But if all falls into plan, we could see a return to international travel - for leisure, not necessity - at some point over the next two years.
Whether the new plan will ultimately be successful this time around is question many tired Australians hope is a yes.

New outbreak dashes hopes

Full text: A new coronavirus outbreak discovered in Melbourne has dashed hopes of an early end to the city's lockdown after genomics testing found it was the more infectious Delta variant that has spread through India and is causing increasing alarm in the UK.
Infectious diseases specialists remained hopeful that Melbourne's stay-at-home orders will be lifted next week as planned but warned restrictions, including the wearing of masks indoors, will need to remain in place for weeks.
The new cluster has been linked back to a West Melbourne family of four who had recently returned from holidaying in Jervis Bay in NSW and has since spread to two adults and a grade five pupil of another family, whose children attend the same North Melbourne Primary School.
"It's a variant of significant concern," said Victorian Chief Health Officer Brett Sutton.
The discovery means there are now two separate outbreaks of coronavirus in Victoria.
The first originated from South Australia hotel quarantine and is the less-infectious Kappa variant of coronavirus, but the origin of the newest seven-case Delta cluster remains a mystery, with public health officials scrambling to establish if it was seeded in Victoria or interstate.
Their working theory is that the virus was transmitted in the school's grade five classroom between two children. The first grade five student infected was at school for up to three days while infectious.
While epidemiologists said it was incredibly concerning to have a new outbreak of the Delta variant in Melbourne, they also said it couldn't have happened at a "luckier" time, when the city was in lockdown.
Burnet Institute epidemiologist Professor Mike Toole said studies of the variant indicated it was up to 60 per cent more infectious than the so-called UK strain. This means it is roughly twice as infectious as the Wuhan strain which plunged Victoria into lockdown last year.
"Instead of an infected person infecting two to three others it could be up to six others," he said.
Unlike Kappa, the variant at the centre of Melbourne's biggest current outbreak, Delta is now considered a variant of concern by the World Health Organisation.
The Pfizer vaccine is about 88 per cent effective against symptomatic disease caused by the variant, while the AstraZeneca's vaccine is about 60 per cent effective. Scientists expect both vaccines to offer much higher levels of protection against serious illness and death.
Professor Sutton said yesterday that officials hadn't yet been able to link the new outbreak to any sequenced cases in hotel quarantine in Victoria or any other states.
Last month, a couple from Sydney's eastern suburbs tested positive to the Delta variant, however there is no link between this cluster and the new Melbourne outbreak.
The West Melbourne family visited Jervis Bay about two weeks ago, from May 19 to 24. Their son and daughter attended school from May 25 to 27, before Melbourne went into lockdown, testing positive for coronavirus on Tuesday.
A second family was tested on Thursday after being asked to isolate and two adults and a child emerged as new cases yesterday. A second child also returned an indeterminate result but is likely to test positive.
A North Melbourne Primary School father who has sons in grade three and five said parents were alarmed by reports the new variant was more infectious.
"You just have to hope you're that majority who haven't contracted it and come out of the other side OK," he said.
Victoria recorded four new local coronavirus cases yesterday. Two cases were also recorded in hotel quarantine. Three people were in hospital with COVID-19, two as precautionary measures. Of more than 6000 primary close contacts 90 per cent had returned negative coronavirus tests.
Three of the four new COVID-19 cases are linked to the West Melbourne outbreak. The fourth was a primary close contact of an existing case who was already isolating.
More than 300 primary close contacts have been identified in the West Melbourne outbreak. So far, about 70 per cent have tested negative.
Infectious diseases paediatrician Robert Booy suspects the outbreak was leaked from hotel quarantine and then most probably seeded in Victoria, but he conceded we may never know its origins.
But the University of Sydney professor said there was no robust evidence children were getting more severe disease, despite anecdotal reports that suggested greater severity of illness in children.
Head of the Epidemiological Modelling Unit at Monash University, James Trauer, said the discovery of the new outbreak should dash hopes of an early end to Melbourne's lockdown and suggested some restrictions would likely remain for many weeks after some businesses were allowed to reopen.
He said masks should be required indoors for at least two to four weeks, even after the state was recording to zero daily cases.
Acting Premier James Merlino said yesterday there were no plans to ease the lockdown earlier than planned.
"The proposition put forward by public health was that we needed this further seven-day period for Greater Melbourne to absolutely run this thing to the ground," he said. "That remains the case."
Paediatrician and researcher at Murdoch Children's Research Institute, Margie Danchin, led a team screening casual contacts at North Melbourne Primary School at the weekend to determine how far the virus has spread.
"The families involved in this outbreak are understandably really struggling," she said.
Victoria's outbreaks have now reached 64 cases.
Top epidemiologist James McCaw said it was "deeply concerning" to have a new outbreak of the Delta variant in Melbourne and it remained "way too early" to say whether the city would be released from lockdown next week.

Nation told to brace for highest risk of outbreak

Full text: The risk of a disastrous coronavirus outbreak in Australia is now at its highest level since the pandemic began and continued escapes from quarantine can be expected at least every month.
James McCaw, who is leading a research team providing modelling on the pandemic to the federal government, said it was "absolutely inevitable" the virus would spread within Australia.
Professor McCaw, an epidemiologist and mathematical biologist with the University of Melbourne, said while outbreaks from the hotel quarantine system over the past six months had been managed very well, Australia had also been lucky.
He said it was "just a matter of time" before one of the outbreaks would avoid the best efforts of contact tracers. Widespread vaccination remained the only way to prevent hospitals being overwhelmed, he said.
Hundreds of people died in Victoria's second wave last year when the virus broke out of quarantine hotels.
Professor McCaw said the risk of a major outbreak was now at the highest level since the pandemic began, about equal to the risk posed around February last year.
He said that was partly due to the British B117 strain. "The strain is more transmissible and it is more severe, and the severity comes to lower age groups," he said.
Professor McCaw, whose team has provided advice to government and briefings given to national cabinet since the start of the pandemic, said: "We will expect incursions at least once a month and more often. And while we mix more socially, the chance of one of those taking hold goes up very quickly.
"The virus will win. But it won't have a devastating impact if we are vaccinated."
This advice echoes that of leading government officials and advisers, who have conceded they can provide no guarantee that the months Australia has enjoyed without any major coronavirus outbreaks will last.
Victoria's Chief Health Officer, Brett Sutton, this week tweeted that while Australia had the great fortune of being effectively free of COVID-19, the pandemic raged on globally. "This presents a serious and ongoing risk to Australia, and vaccination is our best protection against it," Professor Sutton wrote.
The federal government's advisory group on vaccines has also said the "risk of serious disease and death in Australia remains" and cautioned that delays to vaccine uptake increased the vulnerability of the population. Just over 2.5 million doses of coronavirus vaccine have been given in Australia, well short of the 48 million needed to vaccinate everyone aged over 16.
The nation's rollout has been hit by supply shortages, followed by a blow to confidence with news of a rare complication linked to the AstraZeneca vaccine in about one in 100,000 instances following the jab (the risk is lower for older people).
Australians aged in their 50s become eligible for a coronavirus vaccine this week, and infectious disease experts are urging people to get inoculated, warning that Australia has reached a particularly dangerous time in the global pandemic.
Dr Suman Majumdar, an infectious diseases physician at the Burnet Institute, said: "The biggest issue for Australia is the fact the pandemic and epidemic is growing [worldwide]. It's actually worse than ever [and] the virus is very different to the original Wuhan strain."
Catherine Bennett, chair of epidemiology at Deakin University, said complacency was an issue. As winter approached, people with symptoms might ignore them, allowing the virus to spread extensively before being detected, she said.
"The way we're mixing now, across all generations, means that if we don't have enough people vaccinated, the virus can still move so rapidly, particularly with the new variants," Professor Bennet said.
"We could even just, with a large cluster, learn the hard way about the importance of the vaccine if we have been too slow in getting enough people covered."
Professor McCaw said Australia had a unique opportunity to use vaccines to avoid uncontrolled spread.
Improvements to the hotel quarantine system were important to reduce the outbreak risk but that was not a long-term solution, he said. There would not be a significant impact on how the virus spreads until there was wide take-up of vaccines among all age groups.
"It would be unwise to think that the risk of this virus has gone once we have vaccinated the vulnerable," he said. "Especially given that we would expect the B117 [British] variant to come in. We could easily have a situation where our hospital system was overwhelmed with lots and lots of sick young adults."

Professor McCaw said while a spate of outbreaks from the hotel quarantine system over the past six months had been managed incredibly well, the nation had also been lucky and, he said, widespread vaccination of the young and old remains the only way to prevent hospitals being overwhelmed.
It is, he said, "just a matter of time" before one of the outbreaks would avoid the best efforts of contract tracers.

The federal government's advisory group on vaccines has also recently said the "risk of serious disease and death in Australia remains" and cautioned that delays to vaccine uptake increase the vulnerability of the population. About 2.5 million doses of coronavirus vaccine have been given in Australia to date, well short of the 48 million needed to vaccinate everyone aged above 16.
The nation's rollout has been hit by twin issues of supply shortages, followed by a hit to confidence with news of a rare complication linked to the AstraZeneca vaccine in about one in 100,000 instances following the jab.
Australians aged in their 50s become eligible for a coronavirus vaccine this week, and infectious disease experts are urging people to take up the opportunity to get inoculated, warning that Australia has reached a particularly dangerous time in the global pandemic, which is still thought to be in its infancy, despite having already claimed more than 3.2 million lives.
"The biggest issue for Australia is the fact that the pandemic and epidemic is growing. It's actually worse than ever [and] the virus is very different to the original Wuhan strain," said Dr Suman Majumdar, infectious diseases physician at the Burnet Institute.

Professor McCaw said other countries had been using the vaccine to get out of unfolding disasters and turn the tide of thousands of deaths, but Australia had a unique opportunity to use it to avoid the consequences of uncontrolled spread.
"These vaccines are game changers," he said

Full text: One of Brisbane’s busiest hospitals is in lockdown after a senior doctor tested positive to COVID-19.
Victoria’s hotel quarantine program has cost nearly $400m, it has been revealed. Deputy PM Michael McCormack says Victoria’s track record of closing borders ‘at the drop of a hat’ meant the state didn’t receive further cut-price flights as part of the Morrison government’s tourism package. NSW Premier Gladys Berejiklian has expressed her confidence in the vaccination program, saying she is ‘confident we will catch up’. Nordic countries meanwhile have stopped distributing the AstraZeneca vaccine following rare complications that may have caused a death in Denmark.
Robyn Ironside 10.30pm: Hospital lockdown as doctor tests positive
One of Brisbane’s busiest hospitals is in lockdown after a senior doctor tested positive to COVID-19.
The medical registrar from the Princess Alexandra Hospital had been in contact with COVID patients in the early hours of Wednesday, and was active in the community on Thursday while infectious.
Contact tracing is underway and a list of places the doctor visited will be released on Saturday.
The PA Hospital’s emergency department remains open it anyone seeking treatment must wear a mask.
All non-essential visits to patients will not be allowed.
Staff will wear masks at all times and patients will be required to wear masks at all times unless it is not clinically appropriate.
Non-urgent outpatient bookings and elective surgery will be postponed.
The hospital is actively working to ensure the safety of staff and patients on campus while contact tracing is undertaken.

Joseph Lam 9.30pm: Jail time for Malaysians who spread Covid fake news
Malaysians could face up to six years in jail under a drastic new law brought in to curb the spread of COVID-19 fake news.
The law, which came into effect on Friday, sees Malaysian citizens face fines of up to 100,000 Ringit ($33,100 AUD) as well as extended jail sentences for either publishing or reproducing “wholly or partly false” content related to the pandemic.
Critics have called the move an attack on free speech and an attempt by the government to stop criticism of its handling of the COVID-19 pandemic.
The law was able to forgo parliamentary approval after Malaysia entered a state of emergency on January 12.

Joseph Lam 7.15pm: ‘Asian Americans attacked, harassed, scapegoated’: Biden
US President Joe Biden has appeared in a special broadcast to condemn the growing number of “vicious hate crimes against Asian Americans who have been attacked, and scapegoated”.
Over the past several months, numerous videos have circulated showing violent and discriminatory behaviour towards Asian Americans, some of which have resulted in death.
Hundreds have taken to social media including prominent Asian American actors Lucy Liu and Ken Jeong to call out the behaviour and raise awareness.
In a special broadcast on Thursday (Friday AEDT) Mr Biden described the behaviour as “unAmerican” and said in the US “too often we turn against one another”.
“At this very moment so many of them, our fellow Americans, they’re on the front lines of this pandemic trying to save lives,” he said.
“And still, they’re forced to live in fear for their lives just walking down the streets in America.”
“It’s wrong, it’s un-American and it must stop.”

Rhys Blakely 7.05pm: New drug dramatically cuts Covid deaths
A new drug reduces Covid hospital admissions and deaths among high-risk patients by 85 per cent, the drugmaker GlaxoSmithKline has said.
The monoclonal antibody treatment, called VIR-7831, is for people with mild to moderate illness. An independent panel recommended stopping further enrolment in a late-stage trial after evidence emerged of “profound efficacy”, GSK said.
The drug was developed in partnership with Vir Biotechnology, which is based in California. The two companies said they would seek an emergency use authorisation in the US. They may also apply for UK regulatory approval.
Monoclonal antibodies are lab-produced molecules that mimic the antibodies naturally produced by the body when people are infected by the coronavirus. They are seen as a highly promising form of treatment but are very expensive to produce, which is likely to limit how widely they are used.
The study enrolled patients who were either over 55, or who were 18 and older with at least one underlying health condition, such as diabetes.
The drug is said to work differently to other monoclonal antibody therapies. GSK says that it works in two ways - by preventing the virus from entering healthy cells and by promoting the immune system to clear cells that have already been infected.

Evin Priest 6.20pm: Virus warning for 62 Queensland suburbs
Queensland health officials have issued an urgent COVID-19 alert that affects more than 60 suburbs in the state after fragments of coronavirus were found in two wastewater treatment plants.
Coronavirus fragments were detected at the Bundaberg and Gibson Island plants, which cover a total of 62 suburbs.


The state’s chief health officer, Jeanette Young, is concerned because officials are unable to determine whether the fragments contain an overseas variant of COVID-19 or if they are from historical cases.
“We are concerned by the new variants that are emerging overseas that are more contagious than previous variants we have seen in Queensland,” Dr Young said.
“It‘s also possible that this detection relates to previous COVID-19 cases that can shed viral fragments for a couple of months after they are no longer infectious.”

Heidi Han 5.25pm: China reports Covid case 20 days after arrival from Oz
China is reporting a confirmed Covid-19 case who was tested positive 20 days after leaving Australia and initially testing negative.
According to information published by Xiamen health authority, the patient arrived in the southeastern city of China on the February 18 with no symptoms before entering quarantine at a local medi hotel.
The Chinese national who worked in Australia, reportedly tested negatives three times after arriving but was diagnosed with the virus 20 days later, on March 10.
Chinese authorities revealed that other passengers on the same flight, XiamenAir MF 802, were isolated and put under medical observation.
It is unknown whether the patient had lived in Sydney before boarding the direct flight to China from Sydney, which has recorded zero cases for over 30 days at the time of departure.
It is also unknown what variant of the virus the patient has.

Angie Raphael 4.30pm: Premier’s parents come to his defence
The NSW parents of West Australian Premier Mark McGowan did not mince words as they defended his handling of the COVID-19 pandemic, taking a dig at their own state leader in the process.
Mary and Dennis McGowan drove to Western Australia in a caravan, arriving this week from Coffs Harbour just in time for Saturday’s state election.
Mr McGowan on Friday took his elderly parents to tourist attraction Kings Park, where they told reporters they were extremely proud of the way he had dealt with coronavirus.
The couple even said their son had done a better job than NSW counterpart Gladys Berejiklian.
“Much better,” Dennis said and pointed to “the results”.
The Premier said he was looking forward to spending more time with his parents after the election.

Agencies 4.10pm: Britain advises its citizens to leave Myanmar
Britain on Friday advised its citizens in Myanmar to leave the country, as international concerns grow about the junta’s increasingly violent crackdown on anti-coup protests, AFP reports .
“The Foreign, Commonwealth & Development Office advises British nationals to leave the country by commercial means, unless there is an urgent need to stay,” the British foreign ministry said in a statement on its travel advice website.
Myanmar’s military has taken control of the country since a coup on February 1 that ousted civilian leader Aung San Suu Kyi. At least 70 people have been killed since then.

Natasha Robinson 2.30pm: Professor Kelly says AstraZeneca is safe
Australia’s chief medical officer Paul Kelly has dismissed concerns that the AstraZeneca vaccine may be linked with blood clots.
Professor Kelly said the Australian government did not believe people who received the AZ jab were at any greater risk of blood clots, following the suspension of the vaccine in Denmark, Iceland and Norway.
The suspension comes as Denmark health authorities investigate the death of a 60-year-old vaccinated woman from a coagulation disorder and another illness from a pulmonary embolism in a person who had received the AstraZeneca vaccine. No link has yet been established with the vaccine.
Professor Kelly said Australian authorities were not concerned about the cases in Denmark.
“There is currently no evidence that the AstraZeneca COVID-19 vaccine causes blood clots,” Professor Kelly said. “The AstraZeneca COVID-19 vaccine is effective, it is safe, and it’s a high quality vaccine.
“The Australian Government is aware of reports some European countries have suspended the use of the AstraZeneca vaccine due to some reports of blood clots in people who have been vaccinated.
“Safety is our first priority and in a large vaccine rollout like this, we need to monitor carefully for any unusual events so we will find them. This does not mean that every event following a vaccination is caused by the vaccine. But we do take them seriously and investigate – and that’s what Denmark is currently doing.
“There have been more than 11 million people vaccinated in the UK without evidence of an increase in blood clots.”
Professor Kelly said Australia had “a very strong and clear mechanism for adverse event reporting around immunisation” but there was nothing to indicate a link between the AstraZeneca vaccine and blood clots. Australia’s administration of th AstraZeneca vaccine will continue without interruption.

Remy Varga 11.55am: Vic hotel quarantine costs taxpayers $400m
Victoria’s troubled hotel quarantine program has cost state taxpayers nearly $400 million.
According to the mid year financial report released on Friday, the state government in September 2020 entered into contracts with transport, health and hotel providers to provide the program for at least one year.
“The estimated total cost of the contracts is $377 million,” the report said.
With international flights stalled to Victoria for the foreseeable future, the contracted hotels are currently sitting empty.

Richard Ferguson 11.05am: PM denies ‘two-doses by October’ claims
Scott Morrison has denied suggestions his government has recently said all willing Australians would have two doses of the coronavirus vaccine by the end of October.
Health Department Secretary Brendan Murphy told a Senate hearing on Thursday that all Australians would likely have their first dose by October.
The deadline has been pushed out on two doses as the waiting time before the first and second shot of the AstraZeneca vaccine has been shifted from four to 12 weeks.
The Prime Minister - who is also acting health minister - said Health Minister Greg Hunt said the October deadline referred only to the first dose as early as last month.
Health authorities have cast doubt over the federal government’s COVID-19 vaccination program timeline – flagging some Australians may have to wait until next year to receive their second jab. Prime Minister Scott Morrison just yesterday reassured Australians the government’s initial plan to have every adult vaccinated by the end of October was on track to be achieved. However, Chief Medical Officer Brendan Murphy yesterday told the Senate COVID Commission the original modelling was done “when we had a planned four week dose interval with AstraZeneca”. “So, I suspect it’s unlikely we will have completed the second doses of AstraZeneca vaccines by then,” he said. “We don’t know whether we’ll be able to achieve two shots by the end of October, all I’m saying is with a 12-week interval it’s going to be difficult.” A slow overseas supply of the AstraZeneca jab is being blamed in part for the delay, as well as the pushed out timeline from four weeks to 12 weeks between first and second doses. About 125,000 Australians have so far been vaccinated.
“I totally reject that. We were clear a month ago that the October deadline would not include the second dose. The minister said that a month ago and that’s what Professor Murphy said yesterday,” he said in Sydney.
“What the government has said has been very clear and it was the move from four weeks to 12 weeks - which meant the second dose being completed by the end of October for all of those seeking them - that wasn’t going to be possible.”
Mr Hunt at a press conference in February said he would “look” at the timing when asked if the AstraZeneca waiting time would affect the October deadline.
“We’ll look at what it means in regards to the second dose ... it means a position where every Australian who seeks to have it will undoubtedly have had their first dose,” he said.

Natasha Robinson 11.01am: Australia’s vaccine rollout faces fresh hurdle
Australia’s vaccine rollout faces possible interruption with a major insurer of nurses “temporarily pausing” the issue of new policies for nurses who are participating in the COVID-19 vaccine program.
Guild Insurance, Australia’s biggest public liability insurer, says it is in talks with the Federal government “to secure essential support” for insured nurses.
“As we continue these discussions, we are focussed on delivering cover to our existing customers and have temporarily paused the issuing of new policies for nurses who are participating in the COVID-19 vaccine program,” said Guild Insurance’s deputy chief executive officer, Paul Cassidy. “Our aim is to reach successful resolution of our discussions withgovernment to enable us to extend cover sought by nurse practitioners who are not
already insured by us.”
Nurses who do not have the required professional indemnity cover are unable to administer vaccines as they would be in breach of their registration.
The chief executive officer of the Australian College of Nursing, Kylie Ward, said she would be concerned if COVID-19 vaccine administration was excluded from insurance cover.
“Any decision by insurers to not support nurses involved in the vaccine rollout has the potential to put the whole program at risk,” Adjunct Professor Ward said.
“The Australian College of Nursing condemns any insurer that would choose to put the Australian community at risk by not supporting nurses.
“Nurses are the most trusted profession, and among healthcare workers, and will be the largest provider of COVID-19 vaccinations to the Australian public.
“We see this as a direct threat to Australians receiving the vaccine and returning to a form of normal life post-COVID.
“The Australian College of Nursing will not work with any insurer who does not have the best interests of the public and the nursing profession, including nurse practitioners, at its core.”
Mr Cassidy said the insurance company’s focus was on working to ensure existing
healthcare practitioners had appropriate professional liability cover inplace to protect them when administrating the COVID-19 vaccines.
“We are in the process of contacting all existing customers to make changes to their
policy to ensure that they have the appropriate cover that protects them from risks they
face arising from the administration of the COVID-19 vaccine,” Mr Cassidy said.
Australia’s vaccine rollout already faces substantial delay as the federal government admits it may not be able to achieve its goal of having all Australians fully vaccinated by October.

Richard Ferguson 10.50am: Australia won’t halt AstraZeneca rollout: Morrison
Australia will not halt the rollout of AstraZeneca COVID-19 vaccines after Denmark, Iceland and Norway halted their own inoculation programs.
The three Scandinavian countries stopped using AstraZeneca this week after reports of blood clots in some patients and one fatal case.
Scott Morrison said on Friday that Health Department Secretary Brendan Murphy has advised the AstraZeneca rollout in Australia continues.
“That is not the view of our medical advisors,” the Prime Minister said in Sydney.
“The TGA (Therapeutic Goods Administration) obviously looks at these reports when they come through, but they do their own batch testing.
“The batches that were made available going across Australia, there are some 300,000 doses, they are already out and being distributed from AstraZeneca.
“And there is another 400,000 that’s about to go out.”

Ellie Dudley 9.55am: Borders cost Victoria in tourism package: Deputy PM
Deputy Prime Minister Michael McCormack has said Victoria does not deserve a larger share in the half-price flights announced by the federal government on Thursday, after criticisms that only one of the 13 regional areas that will benefit from the scheme was in Victoria.
Acting Premier James Merlino described the package as “unfair” on Thursday, adding that it was a “disappointing outcome” for Victoria.
Mr McCormack however said it was due to snap lockdowns in the southern state.
“Well, the Victorian government locked down their borders like that. At the drop of a hat. Hasty decisions. Locked borders when they had a couple of community outbreaks,” he told Melbourne reporters today.
“I appreciate last July it was difficult when there was that massive outbreak which cost the lives of more than 800 people.
“I know whatever we think and say about our premiers, they have done what they thought they needed to do to protect the people in their state. But it has come at a big cost.”

Ellie Dudley 9.46am: Deputy PM hopeful October target can be met
Deputy Prime Minister Michael McCormack has said the federal government still hopes for all adult Australians to be vaccinated against COVID-19 by October.
Scott Morrison has defended criticisms that Australia’s rollout of the vaccine has been off to a sluggish start, claiming the government are taking their time to ensure they are delivered safely.
Health department officials told a Senate inquiry on Thursday that supply constraints and the longer 12-week window between AstraZeneca doses meant some may have to wait until December to get their second shot.
However, Mr McCormack today said the government will continue to aim for their October target.
“There’s still the plan that’s still the hope,” he told reporters in Melbourne today.
“We have a plan. We’re rolling it out. We’re getting on with the job.
“It won’t go flawlessly all the way through. The Health Minister Greg Hunt has acknowledged that, the Prime Minister acknowledged that, but we do the very best we can.”

Ellie Dudley 9.30am: Cormann left waiting: OECD unable to pick new leader
The new head of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development may not be declared for another month, after the group was unable to declare a clear winner after the fifth round of consultations.
Former Australian finance minister Mathias Cormann and former European trade commissioner Cecilia Malmstrom are the final two contenders for the position of secretary general of the Paris-based OECD.
A report by the OECD from the latest round of consultations, issued overnight, said the group was “unable to identify which candidate has the most support”.
“Following discussion with the selection committee, the chair’s conclusions were finalised and these were communicated first to the nominating ambassadors, and then to the heads of delegations in plenary,” the report read.
“Following these consultations, the chair has been unable to identify which candidate has the most support.”
Further steps will be taken to determine a winner in March, with the aim of concluding the process.

Ellie Dudley 8.24am: ‘It’s safe, worthwhile’: Premier backs AstraZeneca jab
Gladys Berejiklian has again voiced her support for the AstraZeneca vaccine, having received the jab this week.
Questions surrounding the safety of the vaccine have been raised today, after three Nordic countries blocked its rollout due to unforeseen pulmonary complications arising in people who had received the shot.
However, Ms Berejiklian has said the vaccination is still completely safe and has urged Australians to get it “as soon as it’s available”.
NSW Premier Gladys Berejiklian has rolled up her sleeve and received her first dose of the coronavirus vaccine, heralding the start of the AstraZeneca rollout in New South Wales. Ms Berejiklian is keen to scale up the vaccine program but said NSW are still waiting on the Federal government to provide clarity on how many doses will be made available. Two new hubs are now open in Sydney to exclusively rollout the AstraZeneca vaccine and will help support the three Pfizer vaccine hubs which are currently pumping out a shot per minute. From next week five new regional hubs will open to the public which will be followed by the opening of 99 satellite sites to help accelerate the rollout of the vaccine. Approximately 27,000 people have been vaccinated in Sydney.
“It’s safe, and it’s really worthwhile,” she told 2GB this morning.
The federal government has been criticised for a slower-than-expected rollout of the COVID-19 vaccines, which they attribute to Europe’s blocked supply chain.
Ms Berejiklian said she was “confident we will catch up”.
“NSW is doing really, really well,” she said, referencing the three-week, 35,000 jab target she expects the state to meet this week.
“We want to make sure we get the vaccine into the arms of everyone as soon as we can, because that means freedom.”
Mr Berejiklian said while she had a sore arm and felt a little bit tired after receiving the shot, “that’s to be expected”.

Ellie Dudley 8.09am: Joyce on tourism package, return of international travel
Qantas CEO Alan Joyce has disputed claims that airlines are the only section of the tourism supply chain to benefit from the $1.2 billion funding package the federal government announced yesterday.
The package was announced to assist the ailing tourism sector, and includes 800,000 half price flight tickets, a recovery loan scheme for eligible businesses and an aviation plan to help airlines keep up to 8600 employees in work.
Mr Joyce said the money Qantas receives will assist the whole supply chain.
“The money we get from the government we pass on to the consumer so they can make a trip, and it encourages more people to travel than would have otherwise,” he told today.
“It gets them into places like Cairns, to use hotels, to use cafes, to go on tour operators which wouldn’t happen.”
Qantas CEO Alan Joyce is warning Australia will lose its lead on other countries around the world in the fight against COVID-19 unless it is prepared to drop the elimination strategy once the population is vaccinated. “We do have an issue with the conservative nature and the minimum risk taking that’s there. If we applied that to everything else, we would not have cars on the road because people die, and people go to hospital,” he said. “So, you can’t have zero risk for life." He pointed out the “big elephant in the room” was the virus was likely to spread once international borders were reopened – despite the adult population being vaccinated. “But we’re not going to have the deaths, we’re not going to have the hospitalisations,” Mr Joyce said. “And if we don’t get our heads around that we’re going to lose tourists forever, we’re going to lose students forever, we’re going to lose immigration … and we’re going to get behind from being ahead of every other economy in the world. “To be better than every other country at handling this we don’t want to drift behind because we’re too conservative later on in the year." Asked about the impact of the federal government’s $1.2 billion support package – which will see 800,000 discounted airline tickets made available to Australians – Mr Joyce said it was likely to stave off further job losses, however, he could not guarantee it. “We’re still confident where we are with domestically and this package does help us keep the people that we think we need for international,” he told Sky News. “I can’t give a guarantee, I don’t know how this is going to pan out and whether there’s going to be more job losses needed. “That all depends on what happens … with the vaccine rollout, with the new variants of the vaccine and how things work around the globe. “But we think this does help protect jobs and that’s a real positive.”
Mr Joyce said that while he believes the package will “protect jobs”, there is still uncertainty of when the aviation sector will return to normal.
“We don’t know when the vaccine is going to completely rollout. We don’t know if the new variants will make a difference,” he said.
“I don’t think there’s any airline CEO in the world that can guarantee there won’t be future job losses.”
The federal government has planned for Australia’s international borders to reopen in October this year, but Mr Joyce said a number of requirements will be necessary to allow for free-flowing travel.
“What we need to see when they do open up I think is that the hotel quarantine isn’t a requirement,” he said.
“We think there will be a requirement for people to show they have been vaccinated … to leave the country and to come in.”

Ellie Dudley 7.51am: ‘Frustrated’ Premier wants more cheap NSW flights
Gladys Berejiklian has said she is “disappointed” in the federal government’s decision to discount more flights to Queensland than they did to New South Wales.
The federal government announced yesterday that they will subsidise a 50 per cent discount on domestic fares to 13 tourism-dependent regions, in attempts to help the ailing tourism sector.
While only one of the regions is in NSW – Merimbula – five are in Queensland, sparking criticism of the scheme from the NSW Premier.
“That is frustrating,” she told 2GB this morning. “Especially because I think the tourism problems in Queensland are completely self-inflicted.”
She highlighted Sydney as the place in NSW that has been “smashed” by COVID-19 the hardest.
While she said regional areas “have had it tough for a long time”, they are beginning to recover due to a recent spike in intrastate travel.

Ellie Dudley 7.35am: ‘This is a safe vaccine’: Dutton downplays jab fears
Home Affairs Minister Peter Dutton has downplayed the suggestion that the AstraZeneca vaccine is unsafe, despite three Nordic countries blocking the rollout of the jab due to unforeseen complications.
Denmark, Iceland and Norway have all “paused” using the AstraZeneca vaccine from Thursday following issues that may have caused a death in Denmark and other reports of adverse pulmonary embolisms and blood clotting.
Mr Dutton said the government will “wait and see the evidence” but said all current medical advice says to continue with the rollout.
“The fact is the virus needs to be dealt with,” he told Today.
“If there’s a problem the government responds very quickly. At the moment the advice very clearly from the doctors is that this is a safe vaccine and we want the rollout to continue.”

Ellie Dudley 7.22am: AstraZeneca jab still safe despite Euro pause: expert
An Australian infectious disease physician has deemed the AstraZeneca vaccine still “safe” despite large-scale blocks on its rollout in Europe due to unforeseen issues.
Nordic countries have stopped distributing the AstraZeneca vaccination following rare complications that may have caused a death in Denmark and other reports of adverse pulmonary embolisms and blood clotting.
Denmark, Iceland and Norway have all “paused” using the AstraZeneca vaccine from Thursday while the adverse serious events are investigated for any links to the jabs.
However, Professor Peter Collignon from the Australian National University said that while the issues should be investigated, current evidence does not indicate the jab is unsafe.
“No vaccine will be 100 per cent without side effect,” he told Today.
Two European countries have temporarily suspended the use of AstraZeneca's COVID vaccine because of concerns over blood clots. Denmark has paused the jab's rollout for at least two weeks after one person died and three others developed serious conditions. Norwegian authorities have not given a timeline for their review. The relevant batch of vaccines was sent in a shipment of 1 million to 17 European countries. The EU regulator said, "Reports of blood clots received so far are not greater than the number that would have naturally occurred in the vaccinated population." "The safety of the public will always come first. We are keeping this issue under close review but available evidence does not confirm that the vaccine is the cause."
“The good news about these vaccines so far is that both the Pfizer one and the AstraZeneca don’t seem to have serious side effects more than any other vaccine you see.”
Professor Collignon disputed the suggestion that because Australia doesn’t have uncontrolled transmission of COVID-19 the country should hold off on vaccinations.
“The big advantage we have in Australia is we don’t have uncontrolled or transmission at the moment,” he said.
“That may change. Winter is coming. We need to vaccinate the people most at risk particularly the risk of dying which is those over the age of 70.”
He added that he will be getting the AstraZeneca jab in the next month.

Ellie Dudley 6.50am: SA cancels three ANZAC services
South Australia’s three largest suburban Dawn Services have been cancelled due to organisers being unable to meet COVID-19 restrictions.
The decision was made to cancel the services in Brighton, Semaphore and Morphett Vale – which attract 30,000 people collectively – late Thursday.
RSL NSW President Ray James has called for a lift on the number of people being allowed to march in Sydney on Anzac Day. "Every day brings another relief of the COVID-19 restrictions," Mr James told Sky News host Chris Kenny. "So look, we've got 46 days before Anzac Day, so let's see how we travel but that's a start". "We are urging the government to look a bit further". In Sydney on Anzac Day 5,000 veterans will be allowed to march. Mr James said the hope is to be able to "have a normal march, as we had previously in 2019".
RSL state president Cheryl Cates said they would not go ahead, as the volunteer organisers would have been forced to hire barriers they could not afford to control crowd numbers and meet COVID-safe requirements.
“We don’t want to go backwards with COVID,” Mrs Cates told the Adelaide Advertiser.
“We’re all trying to do the right thing for our veterans because they are ageing.”
Anzac Day commemorations will still commence in the Adelaide CBD this year, but will be scaled back in line with COVID-safe plans.

Joe Biden has signed a sweeping trillion-dollar COVID-19 stimulus package into law, in the hopes to both boost domestic growth and spur global recovery.
“This historic legislation is about rebuilding the backbone of this country and giving people in this nation, working people, middle class folks, people who built the country, a fighting chance,” the US President said in the Oval Office before signing the legislation.
“That’s what the essence of it is.”
The package will inject $1.9 trillion in aid into the pandemic-damaged economy by funding small businesses, extending unemployment benefits that were due to expire in days, and sending direct payments of as much as $1,400 to many Americans starting this month.
The Biden administration also continues to ramp up the vaccination efforts across the country, with $14 billion dedicated to the research, development, distribution and administering of vaccines.
So far, 95.7 million Americans have received the COVID-19 jab.
More than 529,400 Americans have died from the virus as of Friday morning (AEDT), according to data from Johns Hopkins University.

Ellie Dudley 6.20am: Kiwis free to travel to Oz from today
New Zealanders will recommence travel to Australia from today, after Auckland was declared to be no longer a hotspot.
About 1.7 million Auckland residents were forced into a week-long lockdown earlier in the month, which was imposed to contain a cluster of the more transmissible UK COVID-19 variant.
Australian Chief Medical Officer Paul Kelly on Tuesday said the situation in New Zealand had “improved greatly” with minimal risk remaining from the country’s cluster.
“The Australian Government will continue to work closely with colleagues in the New Zealand Ministry of Health to monitor and assess the public health risk posed by COVID-19,” the health department said.
The travel bubble remains a one-way situation for now, with Australians still unable to travel over the ditch without quarantining.

Jacquelin Magnay 5.45am: What happens when you get the jab
When I got called up for my coronavirus jab last Saturday – via a sudden text message on my phone from the doctor’s surgery in London – I was mightily impressed by the ruthless efficiency of the logistics and that the inoculation itself felt like a mere scratch on my arm.
I turned to the nurse and remarked; “Is that it?’’ I had thought the tiny prick I had felt was her swabbing the site in preparation for the needle. Not so, it really doesn’t hurt.
A team of volunteers at the health centre had provided the paperwork, checked the details and despite a queue of a couple of dozen people, within five minutes I was rolling up my sleeve in one of ten curtained off areas in a big room. I had worked out I was somewhere around the 22 to 23 millionth person in Britain to get the vaccine, some three months after the rollout began.
It was only when sitting down about to get the jab that I was told I was getting the AstraZeneca vaccine.
NSW Premier Gladys Berejiklian has rolled up her sleeve and received her first dose of the coronavirus vaccine, heralding the start of the AstraZeneca rollout in New South Wales. Ms Berejiklian is keen to scale up the vaccine program but said NSW are still waiting on the Federal government to provide clarity on how many doses will be made available. Two new hubs are now open in Sydney to exclusively rollout the AstraZeneca vaccine and will help support the three Pfizer vaccine hubs which are currently pumping out a shot per minute. From next week five new regional hubs will open to the public which will be followed by the opening of 99 satellite sites to help accelerate the rollout of the vaccine. Approximately 27,000 people have been vaccinated in Sydney.
About two minutes after the inoculation I felt a weird sensation draining through my body, almost like going into a state of shock. I had a quiet sit down for half an hour with another woman who was also feeling a bit faint, and all was fine – for a few hours.
By that afternoon I was so exhausted I couldn’t get off the couch. By the evening I was both feverish and shaking all over with uncontrolled chills. My entire body felt alternatively frozen and then on fire. I cranked the heating up, popped some Panadol, glugged water and crawled into bed with a violent headache.
On Sunday I couldn’t walk the dog without frequent rests, my body ached as if I had been run over by a truck, and the headache nastily persisted all day.
Some 36 hours after my jab I was still feeling peculiar and exhausted but by the 48 hour mark I was starting to feel much better.
Unfortunately I can’t compare this to a flu jab as I have never had one.
But I have taken some consolation that the more extreme the reaction, the more antibodies are produced to help my body fight off the coronavirus. A Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) study also found that women have more side effects from the coronavirus vaccine than men, and younger people also have a stronger response.
But I would have loved to have had a one jab version of the vaccine for in three months time I will have to go through this again.
And of course, having just written about European countries concerns about particular batches of the AstraZeneca vaccine and a sudden pause of its distribution. I immediately checked the slip of paper that details the batch number I have been given. Thankfully it wasn’t ABV5300 or ABV2856.

Jacquelin Magnay 5.05am: AstraZeneca vaccine paused over blood clot fears
Nordic countries have stopped distributing the AstraZeneca vaccine following rare complications that may have caused a death in Denmark and amid other reports of adverse pulmonary embolisms and blood clotting.
Denmark, Iceland and Norway have “paused” the AstraZeneca vaccine while the serious adverse events are investigated for any links to the jabs.
Latvia, Estonia, Lithuania, Luxembourg and Austria have also stopped using one batch of the vaccine, ABV5300, pending a probe in relation to a separate death in Austria of a woman with “severe blood coagulation problems” and some blood clotting episodes in others. This particular batch of a million doses was distributed across 17 European countries.
The sudden halt in using the AstraZeneca vaccine in the Nordic countries could cause a loss of confidence in the vaccine. The development comes as Australia plans to increasingly turn to the locally produced AstraZeneca vaccine, made in Melbourne, within weeks. A batch of 250,000 doses of the AstraZeneca vaccine destined for Australia was stopped following an export ban by Italy to reserve more vaccine for its own use.
NSW Chief Health Officer Dr Kerry Chant says Australia is “very privileged” to have the time to progressively roll out the COVID-19 vaccines since there are no community cases of the virus.

Rosie Lewis 4.40am: Sydney, Melb ‘left for dead’ in cheap travel plan
A $1.2bn Morrison government package to supercharge domestic travel has been rejected by the tourism and hospitality industries, which say it will fail to prevent hundreds of thousands of job losses while favouring major airlines over the rest of the supply chain.
After a months-long wait for the government to outline post-JobKeeper support, there was broad condemnation and confusion about the stimulus unveiled, with industry saying it was too narrow and would “leave Sydney and Melbourne for dead”.
Sky News host Peter Gleeson says the cut-price plane fares the federal government has committed to are being undercut by concerns around border closures, particularly in Queensland.
The centrepiece of the package will see Australians offered 800,000 half-priced airfares to more than a dozen regional centres from April, while cheap loans will be provided to small and medium businesses coming off the $90bn wage subsidy scheme on March 28.
Deputy Prime Minister Michael McCormack stressed other towns and cities would be added to the list of 13 destinations that will receive visitors on half-price flights, as Northern Territory senator Sam McMahon revealed she had managed to include Darwin in the package. Adelaide also made the cut.
The Morrison government has injected $1.2 billion into the tourism industry by slashing 800,000 flight prices in a bid to get Australians travelling this year.

Patrick Commins 4.30am: Employment at risk as CBDs left ‘abandoned’
Struggling businesses in Australia’s CBDs have emerged as the biggest losers in the Morrison government’s targeted support package, with warnings that the end of JobKeeper will trigger a new round of retrenchments in hotel and accommodation staff.
The closure of international borders, the collapse of business travel and a plunge in the number of commuters has damaged the country’s city centres.
With a lack of CBD-specific ­assistance in the Morrison government’s package of support measures aimed at helping COVID-affected industries and regions survive the end of JobKeeper, Accommodation Association chief executive Dean Long said the government had abandoned city hotels that continued to struggle with a collapse in international and business customers.

Natasha Robinson 4.15am: COVID-19 vaccine program may extend into 2022
A 3.1 million dose shortfall in ­vaccine supplies and a revolt from doctors over inoculation payments threatens to push the completion of the nation’s COVID-19 immunisation program into the early part of next year.
Despite assurances from the federal government that the rollout was on track, Health Department secretary Brendan Murphy conceded Scott Morrison ’s October target for the full rollout of the vaccine program was in jeopardy and some people might have to wait until 2022 to receive their second dose.
“We don’t know if we will be able to deliver two doses by the end of October,” Professor Murphy told a Senate committee hearing on Thursday. He said it was “impossible” to know when the first phase, originally due to be finalised by the end of March and targeted at those most exposed to the virus, would be completed.
One in six COVID-19 shots in South Australia has gone to waste contributing to the state lagging behind its vaccine rollout plan.

Full text: But the singer’s lawyer has described the case as “weak, tenuous and vague”.
Jayden Moorea, previously known as Daniel Shearin, is accused of throwing Breeana Robinson from his 11th floor balcony at the H2O building in Southport on January 29, 2013.
Moorea faced a committal hearing in the Southport Magistrates Court for one count each of murder and damaging evidence by destroying a mobile phone.
Magistrate Catherine Pirie ordered Moorea be committed to trial on the eighth anniversary of Ms Robinson’s death.
Ms Robinson’s family burst into tears when Magistrate Pirie announced Moorea would stand trial.
The committal comes after a two-week hearing during which the court was told neighbours heard arguing and a woman yell “no” on the night of Ms Robinson’s death.
Defence barrister Angus Edwards, instructed by Hannay Lawyers, conceded there was a weak case which met the requirements for Moorea to stand trial.
“My position is that this matter is unlikely to have reasonable prospects at the trial but that is not the test at the committal hearing,” he said.
“My position is that the evidence fits no more than that description - weak, tenuous and vague - and limps over that very low bar.”
When asked if he had anything to say, Moorea said: “No, Your Honour”.
He will face trial in the Brisbane Supreme Court in the coming months.
Moorea will remain on bail.
Outside of court Ms Robinson’s aunt, Janine Mackney, made a tearful statement to the media.
“It’s been a long time coming,” she said.
“Eight years to the day.
“There is still another big step to go.
“I was her aunty, I was her friend and I was her boss at work.
“She was so young, she had so much to live for and it’s just all been taken away.”
Ms Robinson’s cousin, Edyn Mackney, said her cousin was a “star”.
“When you think dance, pink flowers and everything girly you think of her,” she said.
“She was sweet and never had a bad word to say about anyone.”
Moorea’s lawyer Chris Hannay, of Hannay Lawyers, said it could take two years before the matter got to trial.
DAY EIGHT: COUSIN SAYS BREEANA TOLD HER ABOUT ARGUMENT
BREEANA Robinson told her cousin that she had been arguing with her boyfriend Jayden Moorea in the lead up to her death, a court has been told.
Moorea, previously known as Daniel Shearin, is accused of throwing Ms Robinson from his 11th-floor balcony in the H2O building in Southport on January 29, 2013.
Moorea is facing a committal hearing in the Southport Magistrates Court for one count each of murder and damaging evidence.
Bianca Robinson said she drove Breeana home from cheerleading training because Moorea had refused.
The Gold Coast Titans cheerleader was unable to drive as she was legally blind.
“On the way home Breeana and I had been chatting and she said over recent weeks they had been arguing as he was not used to having someone around and someone who relied on her that much,” Bianca said.
She told the court Moorea would drop her off to training but told her to get someone else to drive her home.
“Driving her home was an inconvenience so she was told to ask me,” she said.
Bianca, also a Titans cheerleader, said the night Breeana died she drove her home.
She said the pair chatted about a number of things including being estranged from family members.
The court was told Breeana and her mother Elaine Robinson had a strained relationship in the months leading up to her death.
Bianca told the court she had offered to let Breeana move in with her in October 2012 after her mother issued the ultimatum.
“My aunt Elaine just wanted Breeana to come home but to do so she couldn’t be with Dan,” she said.
Bianca told the court it was her understanding that Bianca and her mother had stopped talking.
Breeana moved in with Moorea in December 2012.
The hearing is expected to conclude on Friday.
Earlier in court, Ms Robinson’s mother said her daughter was unrecognisable in the months leading up to her death.
Elaine Robinson also spoke about how her daughter had been bullied throughout high school and primary school.
She gave evidence on Thursday morning with a screen obscuring Moorea from her view.
Elaine Robinson told the court she and Breeana Robinson had an argument in September or October 2012 which led to a strained relationship.
She said the argument had been because Breeana Robinson wanted to go on a cruise with Moorea.
Her mother had said she could not go.
Defence barrister Angus Edwards, instructed by Hannay Lawyers, asked Ms Robinson: “Her behaviour was not consistent with your daughter you knew and understood?”
Elaine Robinson replied: “Yep.”
The cheerleader moved out of her mother’s home not long after the argument to go live with her cousin.
Elaine Robinson said she never gave Breeana Robinson an ultimatum between herself and Moorea.
NED-2822-GCB-APP
She spoke about how she had only seen her daughter one or two times in the months before her death.
She described a time when she saw Breeana Robinson at work.
“When I saw her at work I told her I loved her and she told me that she loved me,” she said.
“When I left her I got a text from Dan saying don’t contact them.”
Elaine Robinson agreed her relationship with her daughter had been strained in the months leading up to her death.
She told the court that as a child Breeana Robinson had been bullied at school including being cut out of photos when graduating primary school.
Elaine Robinson said she agreed that Breeana Robinson was naive, did not have a lot of life experience and was sheltered for her age.
POLICE OFFICER SAYS MOOREA TOLD HIM HE SAW BREEANA ‘LEAPING OUT OF WINDOW’
A CRUISE ship crooner told police he saw his Gold Coast Titans cheerleader girlfriend “leaping out of the window” the night she fell to her death from a high rise balcony.
Jayden Moorea, previously known as Daniel Shearin, is accused of throwing Breeana Robinson from his 11th floor balcony in the H2O building in Southport on January 29, 2013.
Moorea is facing a committal hearing in the Southport Magistrates Court for one count each of murder and damaging evidence.
Gold Coast police Senior Constable Clifford Coetzee told the eighth day of the committal hearing he made notes that night as he spoke to Moorea.
Defence barrister Angus Edwards, instructed by Hannay Lawyers, said part of the reason Sen Const Coetzee had been called as a witness was to help decipher the handwriting in his notebook.
Sen Const Coetzee said the notes showed that Moorea had told him that he was in the master bedroom while Ms Robinson was in the spare.
FULL DIGITAL ACCESS: JUST $5 A MONTH FOR THE FIRST THREE MONTHS
“He said something like five seconds later he came out of main bedroom and saw her leaping out of the window,” he said.
Sen Const Coetzee said without the notes he would have difficulty recalling the conversation.
Last week Gold Coast police Senior Constable George Liasides told the committal hearing he had not taken notes during an “odd and concerning” conversation he had with Moorea the night of Ms Robinson’s death.
He did not record the conversation anywhere until five years after her death.
DAY SEVEN: CHEERLEADER’S TEAMMATES DESCRIBE DAYS BEFORE BALCONY DEATH
FORMER Gold Coast Titans cheerleaders have told a court about conversations with their teammate in the weeks leading up to her falling from an 11th floor balcony.
Breeana Robinson died after falling from a balcony at the H2O Building in Southport on January 29, 2013.
Her boyfriend Jayden Moorea, formerly known as Daniel Shearin, is accused of throwing her from the balcony.
Moorea is facing a committal hearing in the Southport Magistrates Court for murder and damaging evidence.
On the seventh day of the hearing on Wednesday more of Ms Robinson’s teammates gave evidence.
“We had lots of deep and meaningfuls about future and career,” former cheerleader Lauren Boyd told the court.
Ms Boyd said she did not talk to Ms Robinson about her relationship or family.
“Topics were career and sport so like dancing and what she wanted to do, yeah,” she said.
“Nothing personal about families or relationships, no not about that.”
She said they never spent time together outside of training and game days.
“She was very bubbly, always friends and always smiling,” she said.
“She wasn’t very loud and outgoing but she was always friendly when approached.”
Cheerleader Hayley Moulds said she thought Ms Robinson was becoming withdrawn.
“I remember her and Bianca having a quiet moment or talk the night of training before the incident,” she said.
“ … she was withdrawn, was withdrawing to someone she was close to.”
Another former cheerleader Stephanie Power said Ms Robinson was a “work friend”.
She told the court she declined the one time Ms Robinson had invited her to spend time together outside of the Titans.
Numerous cheerleaders have told the court they never spent any time with Ms Robinson outside of training or game day.
They also said they did not attend her 21st birthday party.
Earlier in the committal hearing the court was told that the night Ms Robinson died neighbours had heard arguing and a woman scream “no” before hearing a thud.
Some witnesses said her body landed parallel to the building while others said she landed perpendicular to the building.
DAY 6 – OUT OF SORTS’: TEAMMATE’S REGRET OVER COAST CHEERLEADER DEATH
A GOLD Coast Titans cheerleader said she wished she had asked teammate Breeana Robinson what was wrong during a training session hours before she died.
Ms Robinson died when she fell from a Southport high-rise balcony on January 29, 2013. Her boyfriend, ex-cruise ship crooner Jayden Moorea — formerly known as Dan Shearin — is facing a committal hearing in the Southport Magistrates Court for murder and damaging evidence.
It is alleged he threw her from the 11th-floor balcony of his apartment.
On the sixth day of the hearing on Monday, Ms Robinson’s former teammates gave evidence about what she was like at a training session the night she died.
Teammate Abi Lannoy said Ms Robinson seemed a “bit out of sorts”.
“When I turned around and saw her she seemed a little different, but we had a very hard warm up,” she said in a statement.
Ms Lannoy told the court she remembered thinking as she drove home that she wished she asked Ms Robinson what was wrong.
She said it also may have been because they were in the midst of a particularly hard training session.
Eight other cheerleaders gave evidence on Monday morning.
They all described Ms Robinson as quiet and said they did not socialise with her outside of cheerleader training, game days and events.
The women told the court they had not been invited to Ms Robinson’s 21st birthday party nor did they know of any one on the team who went.
“We trained together twice a week,” cheerleader Ashleigh Andrews said.
“She wasn’t really close friends with anyone in the group but she was in my dance group.”
Another cheerleader, Megan Grant, described Ms Robinson as “outspoken but not loud”.
“She was very sure of herself.”
The cheerleaders’ evidence came after an explosive first week of the committal hearing.
On Friday it was revealed a biomechanical expert had only been given one possible way Ms Robinson had landed after the fall – parallel to the building.
The positioning of her body had been controversial with some saying she landed parallel to the building and others saying she was perpendicular to the building.
Dr Zachariah Couper completed his report saying it was likely she was thrown from the building using the evidence he had – that she landed parallel to the building.
He told the court on Friday it was likely that if she landed perpendicular to the building she stepped back and fell, but he would need to do more modelling.
Magistrate Catherine Pirie gave the legal teams the weekend to determine if they needed Dr Couper to do a further report.
Police prosecutor Gavin Reece told the court on Monday that he had determined a further report from Dr Couper was not necessary.
During the first week of the committal hearing witnesses also told the court they heard arguing and a woman yelling “no” before a thud.
The hearing was adjourned until Wednesday.
DAY FIVE: DOUBT CAST OVER EXPERT REPORT
DOUBT has been cast over the expert report of a key witness in the committal hearing of a former cruise ship crooner accused of throwing his Gold Coast Titans cheerleader girlfriend from a high rise balcony.
Jayden Moorea, previously known as Dan Shearin, walked into the Southport Magistrates Court on Friday flanked by solicitor Chris Hannay and barrister Angus Edwards.
It is alleged Moorea threw Breeana Robinson from his balcony in the H20 building in Southport on January 29, 2013.
Biomechanical engineer Dr Zachariah Couper told the court he based his report on evidence he had been given.
That included that Breeana Robinson landed on a glass awning parallel to the H2O building.
During the committal hearing Dr Couper said he had not been made aware that security guard Gordon Cassidy had said he moved Ms Robinson about 90 degrees to give her medical treatment.
Dr Couper was also not aware that other witnesses had reported seeing her initially lying perpendicular to the building.
He was asked whether the change in body position would mean it was likely Ms Robinson had been thrown from the balcony.
“It would make it more likely that there was a step back and a fall,” he said.
Dr Couper stressed that he would need to do more modelling of the changed body position before he could give a definitive answer.
Magistrate Catherine Pirie said it made sense for Dr Couper to be allowed more time to do more complete modelling.
“The court has heard other evidence and the witness has said he will need to go back and reconsider the modelling and wants to give some thought to the report or what opinion he might have with other information,” she said.
“I am just wondering about whether there needs to be an adjournment for further modelling having regard to further evidence.”
Police prosecutor Gavin Reece and Moorea’s defence team will take the weekend to determine if Dr Couper should be given more time to do modelling of all the evidence.
Ms Robinson’s aunt Janine Mackney declined to comment as she was too upset.
They will make a determination when the hearing continues on Monday.
POLICE OFFICER TELLS COURT MOOREA SPOKE OF FIGHT WITH GIRLFRIEND
A former cruise ship crooner told a police officer he had a fight with his Gold Coast Titans cheerleader girlfriend the night she fell from a high-rise balcony, a court was told.
But the officer, who said he had a “concerning and odd” conversation with Jayden Moorea, did not make any notes or recordings until five years later.
Moorea, previously known as Daniel Shearin, is accused of throwing Breeana Robinson from his 11th floor balcony in the H20 building in Southport on January 29, 2013.
Moorea is facing a committal hearing in the Southport Magistrates Court for one count each of murder and damaging evidence.
Gold Coast police officer Senior Constable George Liasides told the court he had a number of conversations with Moorea the night Ms Robinson died.
“The conversation with him stating they had a fight happened within the unit,” he said.
Sen Const Liasides said he did not ask Moorea if he meant a verbal or physical fight.
The court was told Sen Const Liasides gave a statement in 2015 but did not mention the conversation until 2018.
The statement in 2018 included details of conversations between Sen Liasides and Moorea, the court was told.
FULL DIGITAL ACCESS: JUST $5 A MONTH FOR THE FIRST THREE MONTHS
Sen Const Liasides said he did not record the conversation or make notes following the conversation.
“My greatest regret in my career is not having a digital recording,” he said.
“Things that were said and stuck with me.”
Sen Const Liasides said he did not make any notes of the conversation until he made the statement in April 2018 – about five years later.
He denied he was “reconstructing” a conversation but did not have any explanation as to why he did not make any notes.
DAY FOUR: COURT HEARS DETAILS OF BREEANA’S INJURIES
A GOLD Coast Titans cheerleader most likely landed on her back with her head turned to the right after falling from a high-rise building, an expert has told a court.
Jayden Moorea, previously known as Daniel Shearin, is accused of throwing Breeana Robinson from his 11th floor balcony in the H2O building in Southport on January 29, 2013.
Moorea is facing a committal hearing in the Southport Magistrates Court for one count each of murder and damaging evidence.
FULL DIGITAL ACCESS: JUST $5 A MONTH FOR THE FIRST THREE MONTHS
On the fourth day of the committal hearing Dr Dianne Little, who performed the autopsy, said a majority of the injuries she found on Ms Robinson were likely to be related to the fall.
She some there were some rib fractures which were likely to be related to CPR.
Dr Little also told the court the injuries Ms Robinson received meant it was likely Ms Robinson landed perpendicular to the building.
The court was told Ms Robinson had “tram track” like injuries on her right arm and left calf.
Barrister Angus Edwards, instructed by Hannay Lawyers, asked her if the most likely way Ms Robinson landed to get those injuries would be perpendicular to the building.
Dr Little agreed due to the way some metal strips were positions on the glass.
The court was told Ms Robinson also had significant cuts and bruising on the right side of her face and head.
Mr Edwards asked if it was likely Ms Robinson landed on her back with her head turned to the right.
“That would explain those injuries,” Dr Little replied.
Ms Robinson also had a mark on her throat as well, the court was told.
Dr Little said it was likely that injury was caused when paramedics were trying to resuscitate her.
She said there were no injuries consistent with Ms Robinson being choked.
The doctor who examined Moorea on the night Ms Robinson fell to her death said she only found one injury on his body.
Dr Christine Mirakian said she saw a small cut on Moorea’s right middle finger near the knuckle.
She described it as a 1cm by 0.5cm area of redness with a small cut on the top which was already starting the scab.
“It (the scab) wasn’t something that had occurred within likely just a couple of hours,” she said.
Dr Mirakian said she saw Moorea about 2.30am the morning after Ms Robinson died and it was “likely” the cut had occurred at least 24 hours before she saw Moorea.
She said it was also likely it may have been from psoriasis.
Police scenes of crime officer Senior Sergeant Leon Wort said that four prints were found on the balcony railing in Moorea and Ms Robinson’s apartment.
Two belonged to Moorea and one belonged to Ms Robinson and the fourth has not been identified, the court was told.
Mr Edwards questioned Sen Sgt Wort about the other markings found on the railing which could not be identified.
“Is it the case you are unable to say whether someone climbed over that railing,” Mr Edwards asked.
“That’s correct,” Sen Sgt Wort replied.
Mr Edwards then asked: “They may have, they may not have.”
Sen Sgt Wort replied: “That’s right.”
Forensic specialist Cassie Thompson told the court she examined the clothes Ms Robinson was wearing – a top, a pair of shorts and underwear.
She told the court there were numerous small “severances” in the back of all the clothes.
She said she also found glass in the top and shorts.
Fingerprint expert Sergeant Alicia Finigan said the unidentifiable mark was a hand print but it was unclear who it was from.
“It’s an impression of a hand but here is not enough detail in order to make any other impression,” she said
Sgt Finigan said the print from Ms Robinson was from her palm with it turned at an angle on the top of the railing.
The hearing will continue on Friday with five witnesses, including a biomechanical expert.
HARROWING DETAIL ADDING TO GRIEF OF FAMILY
THE aunt of a Gold Coast Titans cheerleader who fell to her death has revealed her pain at attending court each day.
Breeana Robinson died after falling from the H2O building in Southport on January 29, 2013.
Her former boyfriend, cruise ship crooner Jayden Moorea, previously known as Daniel Shearin, is facing a committal hearing the Southport Magistrates Court for one count each of murder and damaging evidence.
It is alleged he threw her from the balcony.
Janine Mackney, aunt of Breeana Robinson, talks about returning to Gold Coast's Southport courthouse in the committal hearing of alleged killer Jayden Moorea.
Ms Robinson’s aunt posted to Facebook a short clip of why attending court each day is so hard.
In the clip she stands in a car park across the road from the court, films the court building before turning the camera to show the H2O building nearby.
“Let me share with your all one of the hard things about being here,” she says in a teary voice.
“That’s the building where she died. It’s very hard to be in this area.”
Ms Mackney has been attending court each day of the committal hearing carrying a pink rose.
Pink was Ms Robinson’s favourite colours.
She has been supported by her daughters.
FOUR YEARS TO GET A STATEMENT
POLICE took almost four years to get a statement from one of the paramedics who helped treat Breeana Robinson the night she fell to her death from a high-rise, a court has been told.
Jayden Moorea, previously known as Daniel Shearin, is accused of throwing the Gold Coast Titans cheerleader from his 11th-floor balcony in the H20 building in Southport on January 29, 2013.
Moorea is facing a committal hearing in the Southport Magistrates Court for one count each of murder and damaging evidence.
Paramedic Andrew Busby told the court on day three of the hearing that he provided his statement in July 2017.
Mr Busby said when he arrived at the scene other paramedics were already trying to save Ms Robinson.
“When we approached her body she was laying on her back,” he said.
“She was quite precariously close to the edge so we had to move her back so we could treat her.”

Mr Busby said the could not recall any further details about how she was lying.
Throughout the first two days of the committal hearing a number of witnesses have told the court their first statement to police was not until 2017 or 2018.
The positioning of her body has also been controversial with some saying she was perpendicular to the building and others saying she was parallel to the building. Others had no clear recollection.
Paramedic Dean Gamblin told the court they moved Ms Robinson further away form the edge of the glass when they arrived.
He said she was lying in a position parallel to the building.
“I believe that she was in the very similar position so we haven’t changed the angle as such,” she said.
Mr Gamblin said he could not comment is she had been moved before paramedics arrived.
He told the court as paramedics worked on her a firefighter came to assist but the glass began to move.
Mr Gamblin said he could not remember if Ms Robinson had any marks on her face or throat.
“It was dark and the lighting was quite poor,” he said.
H20 resident Ashlee Horvath told the court she was lying on her couch looking out of the balcony when she heard a scream.
“I heard a scream and saw a woman’s body go past,” she said.
Ms Horvath said she saw Ms Robinson’s feet go past, followed by her head.
She told the court the body was not quite straight up and down.
“It was a split second thing,” she said.
“I looked up and went ‘oh my gosh is that what I thought I saw’.
“I heard the loud bang and saw she landed on the glass petition under my balcony.”
Moorea’s former boss Jacqueline Lowein told the court Moorea sounded “scattered and disjointed” when he left a number of voicemail messages for her the night Ms Robinson died.
“He was saying something like ‘oh my God, Jac, Bree’s jumped and thrown herself off the balcony’,” she said.
Ms Lowein said she was working as a travel manager at Travel by Wyndham at the time.
She said she exchanged voicemails with Moorea that night but they never actually managed to speak.
“He was just very scattered, as you would be,” she said.
Defence barrister Angus Edwards, instructed by Hannay Lawyers, asked what Ms Lowein meant when she said in her statement that Moorea did not sound very genuine.
“It just sounded odd … I just remember thinking it was odd,” she said.
Ms Lowein said she thought Moorea sounded upset and at times could hear him crying.
Moorea also told her he was not going to come into work.
The committal hearing will continue on Thursday when forensic experts are expected to take the stand.

AUNT SLAMS LEGAL SYSTEM
THE aunt of a Gold Coast Titans cheerleader who fell to her death from an 11th floor balcony has slammed the legal system for taking so long to hear the case.
Breeana Robinson died after falling from the H20 building in Southport on January 29, 2013.
Her boyfriend cruise ship crooner Jayden Moorea, previously known as Daniel Shearin, is facing a committal hearing the Southport Magistrates Court for one count each of murder and damaging evidence.
It is alleged he threw her from the balcony.
In the first two days of the committal hearing the court has heard from a number of witnesses who did not give their first police statement until 2018 – more than five years after Ms Robinson’s death.
Ms Robinson’s aunt Janine Mackney spoke outside court on Tuesday saying she was upset by the delay.
“Eight years later as I keep saying, It’s just not good enough, our legal system is a joke,” she said.
Janine Mackney, aunt of former Gold Coast Titans cheerleader Breeana Robinson, who fell to her death in 2013.
“Five years later and they are only getting witness statements. You know, you have to do better, you’ve got to do better.”
Ms Mackney became emotional when asked what kept her coming to court each day.
“I made a promise. She was my niece,” she said.
“Someone has to be here for her. I think it’s good that, you know, Dan’s expecting that. I’m never going to give up.”
Mr Robinson said she was reassured by multiple witnesses saying they heard the same thing – about 15 minutes of arguing before a scream.
The hearing continues.
EARLIER
A NEIGHBOUR heard loud voices before a thump the night a Gold Coast Titans cheerleader fell to death from a high-rise balcony, a court was told.
Jayden Moorea, previously known as Daniel Shearin, is accused of throwing Breeana Robinson from his 11th-floor balcony in the H20 building in Southport on January 29, 2013.
Moorea is facing a committal hearing in the Southport Magistrates Court for one count each of murder and damaging evidence.
On the second day of the hearing on Tuesday neighbour Rebecca Adams, who lived on the 18th floor, said she heard loud noises while in her bedroom.
“I thought they were coming from the street,” she said.
“I can’t say how far away the voices were but they were loud enough for me to appreciate from my bedroom.”
Dr Adams said she then heard a thump but she could not say if the loud voices continued up until the thump.
She said she was not sure if they continued after the thump as there was a lot of other noise of people in the building talking.
“I recall the body lying parallel to the building and the head was on the left and legs on the right and I remember that specifically … I could see blood coming out of the head,” she said.
Dr Adams first made a statement to police in June 2018 – more than five years after Mr Robinson’s death.
A neighbour who lived on the same floor as Jayden Moorea and Breeana Robinson described how she heard a man and woman loudly arguing before Ms Robinson fell to her death.
Julie Carroll said: “I heard an argument for at least 15 minutes … I could hear the man’s loud yelling and the woman was crying.”
Ms Carroll said the arguing stopped and she later heard a scream.
She could not recall how long it was between the arguing stopping and the scream.
Defence barrister Angus Edwards, instructed by Hannay Lawyers, showed Ms Carroll Facebook conversations she had the night Ms Robinson died.
In the messages Ms Carroll said she did not hear screaming.
“I meant I didn’t hear screams after it had happened,” she said.
“If I knew someone who fell from a balcony I would be screaming.”
Allan Walker, who lived on the seventh floor, said he was out on the balcony and heard a “swishing noise” before someone said ‘Oh, no’.”
Mr Walker said he then saw Ms Robinson fall past him.
“She was parallel (to the building) as she went past,” he said.
Mr Walker said when he saw her body on the glass awning her head was closer to the street and her feet were pointing to the building.
He said she appeared to be wearing a black bra and underwear and had landed on her back with her right hand twisted under her and her legs apart.
H20 resident Emily Turner, who lived on the eighth floor, said she heard arguing before a period of silence and then she heard a thump.
“(The silence was) no more than a minute,” she said.
Ms Turner said it was possible she had fallen back to sleep during the period of silence between the arguing and the thump.
She told the court when she looked out over the balcony she saw Ms Robinson’s body perpendicular to the building.
Moorea’s next door neighbour Lisa Dunscombe was in the lift with the Moorea as they went to got see Ms Robinson immediately after she had fallen.
She told the court he seemed upset.
Ms Dunscombe said she left her apartment after hearing the thump and seeing Bree on the awning.
She said she saw Moorea coming out with his phone in one hand and doing up his pants.
Ms Dunscombe told the court she and her partner got into the lift with Moorea to go down to see what happened. Moorea told the pair it was his girlfriend he caused the thud.
“He said something about his ‘beautiful Bree’ and his exact words I can’t remember and him saying ‘he could have done more’,” she said.
Ms Dunscombe said she did not remember hearing any arguing or screaming the night Ms Robinson fell.
“I know there was no screaming and there was no noise and there was no previous arguing,” she said.
Ms Dunscombe told the court when she saw Bree’s body from under the awning she was on her back, her arms out at about a 45 degree angle and parallel to the building.
She said she had a conversation that night with Moorea after he came down from the balcony.
Ms Dunscombe told the court that Moorea said to her: “I could have helped her and I could have saved her.
“I could have loved her more.”

TRIPLE 0 CALLS
TWO Triple 0 calls Jayden Moorea made the night his former Gold Coast Titans cheerleader girlfriend fell from a Southport tower has been played to court.
Moorea, formerly Dan Shearin, is facing a committal hearing the in the Southport Magistrates Court on charges of murder and damaging evidence.
It is alleged Moorea threw Breeana Robinson from his balcony in the H20 building in Southport on January 29, 2013.
During the first day of proceedings, the court was played a recording of a Triple 0 call Moorea made the night Ms Robinson died.
“We are down in the foyer, she has landed on the glass,” Moorea said in the recording.
He was asked if she was breathing.
“No, I don’t know, we can’t get up to her,” he said.
Moorea is also heard asking for a ladder.
Former H20 security guard Gordon Cassidy told the court he heard the fall and saw Ms Robinson on the glass.
He said he, another man and Moorea all got up to the awning where Ms Robinson was lying.
Mr Cassidy said she was breathing and he moved her so she was no longer on the broken glass so he could perform first aid.
The downstairs neighbour of Moorea and Ms Robinson said she heard the pair fighting before the cheerleader fell from the balcony.
Mieke Pearce said she does not remember how long it was between the arguing stopping and hearing Ms Robinson scream.
“I just feel like it all happened very quickly. From the memory I have now it all happened one after the other,” she said.
Ms Pearce told the court she heard a woman scream and “yell out no”.
The court was told Ms Pearce had moved into the unit five days earlier and had heard the pair argue two or three times.
Ms Pearce’s partner Ben Pearce told the court he remembered there being a distinct period of time between hearing the arguing and the scream.
He said could not remember the time period but agreed it could be up to 30 minutes between the arguing and scream.
FULL DIGITAL ACCESS: JUST $5 A MONTH FOR THE FIRST THREE MONTHS
Defence barrister Angus Edwards, instructed by Hannay Lawyers, asked a number of witnesses about the position Ms Robinson was in when they saw her after the fall and before someone was able to get onto the awning to help her.
Three witness have said she was perpendicular to the building.
H20 resident Edward Wu, who lived on the ninth floor, said he remembers seeing Ms Robinson lying parallel to the building.
“All I can say is she was facing down … I don’t know whether her feet were closer to the edge of the building,” he said.
A second Triple 0 call made by Moorea has been played to the court where he told operators his girlfriend had climbed over the balcony.
“I went into the bedroom and she just ran onto the balcony and she has gone over the balcony,” he is heard saying on the call.
Moorea made the call prior to going downstairs and prior to the Triple 0 call played to the Southport Magistrates Court earlier on Monday.
His voice sounds high and he spoke in rushed tones.
The Triple 0 operator had to ask him a number of times to repeat information which could not be understood.
Next-door neighbour Alfred Schmetzer told the court he ran out into the hall after he heard a thud.
He said he saw Moorea coming out of this apartment on the phone and using one hand to put on pants.
Mr Schmetzer said his recollection as that Moorea was “focused and calm”.
A H20 resident told the court she heard Mr Robinson scream “no, no” as she feel from her balcony.
Georgina Hadid told the Southport Magistrates Court she also saw Ms Robinson falling past her fourth level balcony for a “split second”.
“She was flat on her back facing towards the sky,” she said.
Ms Hadid first gave a statement to police in November 2018 – five and a half years after Ms Robinson’s death.
She said she later saw Moorea out on the balcony while a security guard and her husband Badawi Hadid tried to help Ms Robinson.
“At one stage I did see him on the awning and he never touched her and never helped her,” she said.
“What I recall is him saying ‘Bree, I’m here for your Bree’ … no emotion, no nothing.”
Ms Hadid said she saw this from her fourth floor balcony.
MOOREA FLANKED BY LAWYERS AS HE ARRIVES AT COURT
A CRUISE ship crooner accused of murdering his Gold Coast Titans cheerleader ex-girlfriend has arrived at court for a committal hearing flanked by his lawyers.
Jayden Moorea, previously known as Dan Shearin, walked into the Southport Magistrates Court on Monday accompanied by solicitor Chris Hannay and barrister Angus Edwards.
It is alleged Moorea threw Breeana Robinson from his balcony in the H20 building in Southport on January 29, 2013.
Moorea was not charged until January 2019.
The group was stopped at the courthouse doors by security asking if they had been in Brisbane in the past 21 days.
Security provided the group with masks and asked them to wear them in the premises.
More than 70 witnesses are expected to give evidence in the committal hearing over the next two weeks.
Witnesses called will include experts, cheerleaders and police officers.
The hearing will determine if there is enough evidence for Moorea to stand trial.
Ms Robinson’s aunt Janine Mackney and another friend of Ms Robinson are in the courtroom waiting for proceedings to start, both holding a pink rose.
Moorea, who was released on bail not long after he was charged, has a clothing line – C.R. U. I. S. E – Can’t Rest Until I Sail Everywhere.
The apparel is sold on Moorea’s website – jdmoorea.com – where he describes himself as an “author, photographer and performance coach”.
In a court hearing in November 2019 a portion of the triple-0 call was read aloud.
“I need an ambulance, please, my girlfriend has just climbed over the balcony … I went into the bedroom and saw her climb over the balcony … she had threatened to do this before,” Moorea is alleged to have said on the call.

The committal hearing is expected to focus on what happened in the lead-up to Ms Robinson’s death and what happened in Moorea’s apartment before her fall.
Evidence from biomechanical experts is expected to shed further light on what happened that night.

Full text: Cheerleader Breeana Robinson died when she fell from a Southport high rise balcony on January 29, 2013.
Her boyfriend former cruise ship crooner Jayden Moorea, formerly known as Dan Shearin, is facing a committal hearing in the Southport Magistrates Court for murder and damaging evidence.
It is alleged he threw her from the balcony.
On the sixth day of the hearing on Monday Ms Robinson’s former teammates gave evidence about what she was like at a training session the night she died.
Teammate Abi Lannoy said she Ms Robinson seemed “a bit out of sorts”.
“When I turned around and saw her she seemed a little different but we had a very hard warm up,” she said in a statement.
Ms Lannoy told the court she remembered thinking as she drove home she wished she asked Ms Robinson what was wrong.
She said it also may have been because they were in the midst of a particularly hard training session.
Six other cheerleaders have given evidence this morning.
They all described her as quiet and said they did not socialise with Ms Robinson outside of Gold Coast Titans events.
The women told the court they had not been invited to Ms Robinson’s 21st birthday party nor did they know of any one on the team who went.
FRIDAY: Day five in committal hearing
DOUBT has been cast over the expert report of a key witness in the committal hearing of a former cruise ship crooner accused of throwing his Gold Coast Titans cheerleader girlfriend from a high rise balcony.
Jayden Moorea, previously known as Dan Shearin, walked into the Southport Magistrates Court on Friday flanked by solicitor Chris Hannay and barrister Angus Edwards.
It is alleged Moorea threw Breeana Robinson from his balcony in the H20 building in Southport on January 29, 2013.
Biomechanical engineer Dr Zachariah Couper told the court he based his report on evidence he had been given.
That included that Breeana Robinson landed on a glass awning parallel to the H2O building.
During the committal hearing Dr Couper said he had not been made aware that security guard Gordon Cassidy had said he moved Ms Robinson about 90 degrees to give her medical treatment.
Dr Couper was also not aware that other witnesses had reported seeing her initially lying perpendicular to the building.
He was asked whether the change in body position would mean it was likely Ms Robinson had been thrown from the balcony.
“It would make it more likely that there was a step back and a fall,” he said.
Dr Couper stressed that he would need to do more modelling of the changed body position before he could give a definitive answer.
Magistrate Catherine Pirie said it made sense for Dr Couper to be allowed more time to do more complete modelling.
“The court has heard other evidence and the witness has said he will need to go back and reconsider the modelling and wants to give some thought to the report or what opinion he might have with other information,” she said.
“I am just wondering about whether there needs to be an adjournment for further modelling having regard to further evidence.”
Police prosecutor Gavin Reece and Moorea’s defence team will take the weekend to determine if Dr Couper should be given more time to do modelling of all the evidence.
Ms Robinson’s aunt Janine Mackney declined to comment as she was too upset.
They will make a determination when the hearing continues on Monday.
POLICE OFFICER TELLS COURT MOOREA SPOKE OF FIGHT WITH GIRLFRIEND
A former cruise ship crooner told a police officer he had a fight with his Gold Coast Titans cheerleader girlfriend the night she fell from a high-rise balcony, a court was told.
But the officer, who said he had a “concerning and odd” conversation with Jayden Moorea, did not make any notes or recordings until five years later.
Moorea, previously known as Daniel Shearin, is accused of throwing Breeana Robinson from his 11th floor balcony in the H20 building in Southport on January 29, 2013.
Moorea is facing a committal hearing in the Southport Magistrates Court for one count each of murder and damaging evidence.
Gold Coast police officer Senior Constable George Liasides told the court he had a number of conversations with Moorea the night Ms Robinson died.
“The conversation with him stating they had a fight happened within the unit,” he said.
Sen Const Liasides said he did not ask Moorea if he meant a verbal or physical fight.
The court was told Sen Const Liasides gave a statement in 2015 but did not mention the conversation until 2018.
The statement in 2018 included details of conversations between Sen Liasides and Moorea, the court was told.
FULL DIGITAL ACCESS: JUST $5 A MONTH FOR THE FIRST THREE MONTHS
Sen Const Liasides said he did not record the conversation or make notes following the conversation.
“My greatest regret in my career is not having a digital recording,” he said.
“Things that were said and stuck with me.”
Sen Const Liadies said he did not make any notes of the conversation until he made the statement in April 2018 – about five years later.
He denied he was “reconstructing” a conversation but did not have any explanation as to why he did not make any notes.
DAY FOUR: COURT HEARS DETAILS OF BREEANA’S INJURIES
A GOLD Coast Titans cheerleader most likely landed on her back with her head turned to the right after falling from a high-rise building, an expert has told a court.
Jayden Moorea, previously known as Daniel Shearin, is accused of throwing Breeana Robinson from his 11th floor balcony in the H2O building in Southport on January 29, 2013.
Moorea is facing a committal hearing in the Southport Magistrates Court for one count each of murder and damaging evidence.
FULL DIGITAL ACCESS: JUST $5 A MONTH FOR THE FIRST THREE MONTHS
On the fourth day of the committal hearing Dr Dianne Little, who performed the autopsy, said a majority of the injuries she found on Ms Robinson were likely to be related to the fall.
She some there were some rib fractures which were likely to be related to CPR.
Dr Little also told the court the injuries Ms Robinson received meant it was likely Ms Robinson landed perpendicular to the building.
The court was told Ms Robinson had “tram track” like injuries on her right arm and left calf.
Barrister Angus Edwards, instructed by Hannay Lawyers, asked her if the most likely way Ms Robinson landed to get those injuries would be perpendicular to the building.
Dr Little agreed due to the way some metal strips were positions on the glass.
The court was told Ms Robinson also had significant cuts and bruising on the right side of her face and head.
Mr Edwards asked if it was likely Ms Robinson landed on her back with her head turned to the right.
“That would explain those injuries,” Dr Little replied.
Ms Robinson also had a mark on her throat as well, the court was told.
Dr Little said it was likely that injury was caused when paramedics were trying to resuscitate her.
She said there were no injuries consistent with Ms Robinson being choked.
The doctor who examined Moorea on the night Ms Robinson fell to her death said she only found one injury on his body.
Dr Christine Mirakian said she saw a small cut on Moorea’s right middle finger near the knuckle.
She described it as a 1cm by 0.5cm area of redness with a small cut on the top which was already starting the scab.
“It (the scab) wasn’t something that had occurred within likely just a couple of hours,” she said.
Dr Mirakian said she saw Moorea about 2.30am the morning after Ms Robinson died and it was “likely” the cut had occurred at least 24 hours before she saw Moorea.
She said it was also likely it may have been from psoriasis.
Police scenes of crime officer Senior Sergeant Leon Wort said that four prints were found on the balcony railing in Moorea and Ms Robinson’s apartment.
Two belonged to Moorea and one belonged to Ms Robinson and the fourth has not been identified, the court was told.
Mr Edwards questioned Sen Sgt Wort about the other markings found on the railing which could not be identified.
“Is it the case you are unable to say whether someone climbed over that railing,” Mr Edwards asked.
“That’s correct,” Sen Sgt Wort replied.
Mr Edwards then asked: “They may have, they may not have.”
Sen Sgt Wort replied: “That’s right.”
Forensic specialist Cassie Thompson told the court she examined the clothes Ms Robinson was wearing - a top, a pair of shorts and underwear.
She told the court there were numerous small “severances” in the back of all the clothes.
She said she also found glass in the top and shorts.
Fingerprint expert Sergeant Alicia Finigan said the unidentifiable mark was a hand print but it was unclear who it was from.
“It’s an impression of a hand but here is not enough detail in order to make any other impression,” she said
Sgt Finigan said the print from Ms Robinson was from her palm with it turned at an angle on the top of the railing.
The hearing will continue on Friday with five witnesses, including a biomechanical expert.
HARROWING DETAIL ADDING TO GRIEF OF FAMILY
THE aunt of a Gold Coast Titans cheerleader who fell to her death has revealed her pain at attending court each day.
Breeana Robinson died after falling from the H2O building in Southport on January 29, 2013.
Her former boyfriend, cruise ship crooner Jayden Moorea, previously known as Daniel Shearin, is facing a committal hearing the Southport Magistrates Court for one count each of murder and damaging evidence.
It is alleged he threw her from the balcony.
Janine Mackney, aunt of Breeana Robinson, talks about returning to Gold Coast's Southport courthouse in the committal hearing of alleged killer Jayden Moorea.
Ms Robinson’s aunt posted to Facebook a short clip of why attending court each day is so hard.
In the clip she stands in a car park across the road from the court, films the court building before turning the camera to show the H2O building nearby.
“Let me share with your all one of the hard things about being here,” she says in a teary voice.
“That’s the building where she died. It’s very hard to be in this area.”
Ms Mackney has been attending court each day of the committal hearing carrying a pink rose.
Pink was Ms Robinson’s favourite colours.
She has been supported by her daughters.
FOUR YEARS TO GET A STATEMENT
POLICE took almost four years to get a statement from one of the paramedics who helped treat Breeana Robinson the night she fell to her death from a high-rise, a court has been told.
Jayden Moorea, previously known as Daniel Shearin, is accused of throwing the Gold Coast Titans cheerleader from his 11th-floor balcony in the H20 building in Southport on January 29, 2013.
Moorea is facing a committal hearing in the Southport Magistrates Court for one count each of murder and damaging evidence.
Paramedic Andrew Busby told the court on day three of the hearing that he provided his statement in July 2017.
Mr Busby said when he arrived at the scene other paramedics were already trying to save Ms Robinson.
“When we approached her body she was laying on her back,” he said.
“She was quite precariously close to the edge so we had to move her back so we could treat her.”
FULL DIGITAL ACCESS: JUST $5 A MONTH FOR THE FIRST THREE MONTHS
Mr Busby said the could not recall any further details about how she was lying.
Throughout the first two days of the committal hearing a number of witnesses have told the court their first statement to police was not until 2017 or 2018.
The positioning of her body has also been controversial with some saying she was perpendicular to the building and others saying she was parallel to the building. Others had no clear recollection.
Paramedic Dean Gamblin told the court they moved Ms Robinson further away form the edge of the glass when they arrived.
He said she was lying in a position parallel to the building.
“I believe that she was in the very similar position so we haven’t changed the angle as such,” she said.
Mr Gamblin said he could not comment is she had been moved before paramedics arrived.
He told the court as paramedics worked on her a firefighter came to assist but the glass began to move.
Mr Gamblin said he could not remember if Ms Robinson had any marks on her face or throat.
“It was dark and the lighting was quite poor,” he said.
H20 resident Ashlee Horvath told the court she was lying on her couch looking out of the balcony when she heard a scream.
“I heard a scream and saw a woman’s body go past,” she said.
Ms Horvath said she saw Ms Robinson’s feet go past, followed by her head.
She told the court the body was not quite straight up and down.
“It was a split second thing,” she said.
“I looked up and went ‘oh my gosh is that what I thought I saw’.
“I heard the loud bang and saw she landed on the glass petition under my balcony.”
Moorea’s former boss Jacqueline Lowein told the court Moorea sounded “scattered and disjointed” when he left a number of voicemail messages for her the night Ms Robinson died.
“He was saying something like ‘oh my God, Jac, Bree’s jumped and thrown herself off the balcony’,” she said.
Ms Lowein said she was working as a travel manager at Travel by Wyndham at the time.
She said she exchanged voicemails with Moorea that night but they never actually managed to speak.
“He was just very scattered, as you would be,” she said.
Defence barrister Angus Edwards, instructed by Hannay Lawyers, asked what Ms Lowein meant when she said in her statement that Mooera did not sound very genuine.
“It just sounded odd … I just remember thinking it was odd,” she said.
Ms Lowein said she thought Moorea sounded upset and at times could hear him crying.
Moorea also told her he was not going to come into work.
The committal hearing will continue on Thursday when forensic experts are expected to take the stand.

AUNT SLAMS LEGAL SYSTEM
THE aunt of a Gold Coast Titans cheerleader who fell to her death from an 11th floor balcony has slammed the legal system for taking so long to hear the case.
Breeana Robinson died after falling from the H20 building in Southport on January 29, 2013.
Her boyfriend cruise ship crooner Jayden Moorea, previously known as Daniel Shearin, is facing a committal hearing the Southport Magistrates Court for one count each of murder and damaging evidence.
It is alleged he threw her from the balcony.
In the first two days of the committal hearing the court has heard from a number of witnesses who did not give their first police statement until 2018 – more than five years after Ms Robinson’s death.
Ms Robinson’s aunt Janine Mackney spoke outside court on Tuesday saying she was upset by the delay.
“Eight years later as I keep saying, It’s just not good enough, our legal system is a joke,” she said.
Janine Mackney, aunt of former Gold Coast Titans cheerleader Breeana Robinson, who fell to her death in 2013.
“Five years later and they are only getting witness statements. You know, you have to do better, you’ve got to do better.”
Ms Mackney became emotional when asked what kept her coming to court each day.
“I made a promise. She was my niece,” she said.
“Someone has to be here for her. I think it’s good that, you know, Dan’s expecting that. I’m never going to give up.”
Mr Robinson said she was reassured by multiple witnesses saying they heard the same thing – about 15 minutes of arguing before a scream.
The hearing continues.
EARLIER
A NEIGHBOUR heard loud voices before a thump the night a Gold Coast Titans cheerleader fell to death from a high-rise balcony, a court was told.
Jayden Moorea, previously known as Daniel Shearin, is accused of throwing Breeana Robinson from his 11th-floor balcony in the H20 building in Southport on January 29, 2013.
Moorea is facing a committal hearing in the Southport Magistrates Court for one count each of murder and damaging evidence.
On the second day of the hearing on Tuesday neighbour Rebecca Adams, who lived on the 18th floor, said she heard loud noises while in her bedroom.
“I thought they were coming from the street,” she said.
“I can’t say how far away the voices were but they were loud enough for me to appreciate from my bedroom.”
Dr Adams said she then heard a thump but she could not say if the loud voices continued up until the thump.
She said she was not sure if they continued after the thump as there was a lot of other noise of people in the building talking.
“I recall the body lying parallel to the building and the head was on the left and legs on the right and I remember that specifically … I could see blood coming out of the head,” she said.
Dr Adams first made a statement to police in June 2018 – more than five years after Mr Robinson’s death.
A neighbour who lived on the same floor as Jayden Moorea and Breeana Robinson described how she heard a man and woman loudly arguing before Ms Robinson fell to her death.
Julie Carroll said: “I heard an argument for at least 15 minutes … I could hear the man’s loud yelling and the woman was crying.”
Ms Carroll said the arguing stopped and she later heard a scream.
She could not recall how long it was between the arguing stopping and the scream.
Defence barrister Angus Edwards, instructed by Hannay Lawyers, showed Ms Carroll Facebook conversations she had the night Ms Robinson died.
In the messages Ms Carroll said she did not hear screaming.
“I meant I didn’t hear screams after it had happened,” she said.
“If I knew someone who fell from a balcony I would be screaming.”
Allan Walker, who lived on the seventh floor, said he was out on the balcony and heard a “swishing noise” before someone said ‘Oh, no’.”
Mr Walker said he then saw Ms Robinson fall past him.
“She was parallel (to the building) as she went past,” he said.
Mr Walker said when he saw her body on the glass awning her head was closer to the street and her feet were pointing to the building.
He said she appeared to be wearing a black bra and underwear and had landed on her back with her right hand twisted under her and her legs apart.
H20 resident Emily Turner, who lived on the eighth floor, said she heard arguing before a period of silence and then she heard a thump.
“(The silence was) no more than a minute,” she said.
Ms Turner said it was possible she had fallen back to sleep during the period of silence between the arguing and the thump.
She told the court when she looked out over the balcony she saw Ms Robinson’s body perpendicular to the building.
Moorea’s next door neighbour Lisa Dunscombe was in the lift with the Moorea as they went to got see Ms Robinson immediately after she had fallen.
She told the court he seemed upset.
Ms Dunscombe said she left her apartment after hearing the thump and seeing Bree on the awning.
She said she saw Moorea coming out with his phone in one hand and doing up his pants.
Ms Dunscombe told the court she and her partner got into the lift with Moorea to go down to see what happened. Moorea told the pair it was his girlfriend he caused the thud.
“He said something about his ‘beautiful Bree’ and his exact words I can’t remember and him saying ‘he could have done more’,” she said.
Ms Dunscombe said she did not remember hearing any arguing or screaming the night Ms Robinson fell.
“I know there was no screaming and there was no noise and there was no previous arguing,” she said.
Ms Dunscombe told the court when she saw Bree’s body from under the awning she was on her back, her arms out at about a 45 degree angle and parallel to the building.
She said she had a conversation that night with Moorea after he came down from the balcony.
Ms Dunscombe told the court that Moorea said to her: “I could have helped her and I could have saved her.
“I could have loved her more.”

TRIPLE 0 CALLS
TWO Triple 0 calls Jayden Moorea made the night his former Gold Coast Titans cheerleader girlfriend fell from a Southport tower has been played to court.
Moorea, formerly Dan Shearin, is facing a committal hearing the in the Southport Magistrates Court on charges of murder and damaging evidence.
It is alleged Moorea threw Breeana Robinson from his balcony in the H20 building in Southport on January 29, 2013.
During the first day of proceedings, the court was played a recording of a Triple 0 call Moorea made the night Ms Robinson died.
“We are down in the foyer, she has landed on the glass,” Moorea said in the recording.
He was asked if she was breathing.
“No, I don’t know, we can’t get up to her,” he said.
Moorea is also heard asking for a ladder.
Former H20 security guard Gordon Cassidy told the court he heard the fall and saw Ms Robinson on the glass.
He said he, another man and Moorea all got up to the awning where Ms Robinson was lying.
Mr Cassidy said she was breathing and he moved her so she was no longer on the broken glass so he could perform first aid.
The downstairs neighbour of Moorea and Ms Robinson said she heard the pair fighting before the cheerleader fell from the balcony.
Mieke Pearce said she does not remember how long it was between the arguing stopping and hearing Ms Robinson scream.
“I just feel like it all happened very quickly. From the memory I have now it all happened one after the other,” she said.
Ms Pearce told the court she heard a woman scream and “yell out no”.
The court was told Ms Pearce had moved into the unit five days earlier and had heard the pair argue two or three times.
Ms Pearce’s partner Ben Pearce told the court he remembered there being a distinct period of time between hearing the arguing and the scream.
He said could not remember the time period but agreed it could be up to 30 minutes between the arguing and scream.

Defence barrister Angus Edwards, instructed by Hannay Lawyers, asked a number of witnesses about the position Ms Robinson was in when they saw her after the fall and before someone was able to get onto the awning to help her.
Three witness have said she was perpendicular to the building.
H20 resident Edward Wu, who lived on the ninth floor, said he remembers seeing Ms Robinson lying parallel to the building.
“All I can say is she was facing down … I don’t know whether her feet were closer to the edge of the building,” he said.
A second Triple 0 call made by Moorea has been played to the court where he told operators his girlfriend had climbed over the balcony.
“I went into the bedroom and she just ran onto the balcony and she has gone over the balcony,” he is heard saying on the call.
Moorea made the call prior to going downstairs and prior to the Triple 0 call played to the Southport Magistrates Court earlier on Monday.
His voice sounds high and he spoke in rushed tones.
The Triple 0 operator had to ask him a number of times to repeat information which could not be understood.
Next-door neighbour Alfred Schmetzer told the court he ran out into the hall after he heard a thud.
He said he saw Moorea coming out of this apartment on the phone and using one hand to put on pants.
Mr Schmetzer said his recollection as that Moorea was “focused and calm”.
A H20 resident told the court she heard Mr Robinson scream “no, no” as she feel from her balcony.
Georgina Hadid told the Southport Magistrates Court she also saw Ms Robinson falling past her fourth level balcony for a “split second”.
“She was flat on her back facing towards the sky,” she said.
Ms Hadid first gave a statement to police in November 2018 – five and a half years after Ms Robinson’s death.
She said she later saw Moorea out on the balcony while a security guard and her husband Badawi Hadid tried to help Ms Robinson.
“At one stage I did see him on the awning and he never touched her and never helped her,” she said.
“What I recall is him saying ‘Bree, I’m here for your Bree’ … no emotion, no nothing.”
Ms Hadid said she saw this from her fourth floor balcony.
MOOREA FLANKED BY LAWYERS AS HE ARRIVES AT COURT
A CRUISE ship crooner accused of murdering his Gold Coast Titans cheerleader ex-girlfriend has arrived at court for a committal hearing flanked by his lawyers.
Jayden Moorea, previously known as Dan Shearin, walked into the Southport Magistrates Court on Monday accompanied by solicitor Chris Hannay and barrister Angus Edwards.
It is alleged Moorea threw Breeana Robinson from his balcony in the H20 building in Southport on January 29, 2013.
Moorea was not charged until January 2019.
The group was stopped at the courthouse doors by security asking if they had been in Brisbane in the past 21 days.
Security provided the group with masks and asked them to wear them in the premises.
More than 70 witnesses are expected to give evidence in the committal hearing over the next two weeks.
Witnesses called will include experts, cheerleaders and police officers.
The hearing will determine if there is enough evidence for Moorea to stand trial.
Ms Robinson’s aunt Janine Mackney and another friend of Ms Robinson are in the courtroom waiting for proceedings to start, both holding a pink rose.
Moorea, who was released on bail not long after he was charged, has a clothing line – C.R. U. I. S. E – Can’t Rest Until I Sail Everywhere.
The apparel is sold on Moorea’s website – jdmoorea.com – where he describes himself as an “author, photographer and performance coach”.
In a court hearing in November 2019 a portion of the triple-0 call was read aloud.
“I need an ambulance, please, my girlfriend has just climbed over the balcony … I went into the bedroom and saw her climb over the balcony … she had threatened to do this before,” Moorea is alleged to have said on the call.

The committal hearing is expected to focus on what happened in the lead-up to Ms Robinson’s death and what happened in Moorea’s apartment before her fall.
Evidence from biomechanical experts is expected to shed further light on what happened that night.

Full text: Jayden Moorea, previously known as Dan Shearin, walked into the Southport Magistrates Court on Friday flanked by solicitor Chris Hannay and barrister Angus Edwards.
It is alleged Moorea threw Breeana Robinson from his balcony in the H20 building in Southport on January 29, 2013.
Biomechanical engineer Dr Zachariah Couper told the court he based his report on evidence he had been given.
That included that Breeana Robinson landed on a glass awning parallel to the H2O building.
During the committal hearing Dr Couper said he had not been made aware that security guard Gordon Cassidy had said he moved Ms Robinson about 90 degrees to give her medical treatment.
Dr Couper was also not aware that other witnesses had reported seeing her initially lying perpendicular to the building.
He was asked whether the change in body position would mean it was likely Ms Robinson had been thrown from the balcony.
“It would make it more likely that there was a step back and a fall,” he said.
Dr Couper stressed that he would need to do more modelling of the changed body position before he could give a definitive answer.
Magistrate Catherine Pirie said it made sense for Dr Couper to be allowed more time to do more complete modelling.
“The court has heard other evidence and the witness has said he will need to go back and reconsider the modelling and wants to give some thought to the report or what opinion he might have with other information,” she said.
“I am just wondering about whether there needs to be an adjournment for further modelling having regard to further evidence.”
Police prosecutor Gavin Reece and Moorea’s defence team will take the weekend to determine if Dr Couper should be given more time to do modelling of all the evidence.
Ms Robinson’s aunt Janine Mackney declined to comment as she was too upset.
They will make a determination when the hearing continues on Monday.
POLICE OFFICER TELLS COURT MOOREA SPOKE OF FIGHT WITH GIRLFRIEND
A former cruise ship crooner told a police officer he had a fight with his Gold Coast Titans cheerleader girlfriend the night she fell from a high-rise balcony, a court was told.
But the officer, who said he had a “concerning and odd” conversation with Jayden Moorea, did not make any notes or recordings until five years later.
Moorea, previously known as Daniel Shearin, is accused of throwing Breeana Robinson from his 11th floor balcony in the H20 building in Southport on January 29, 2013.
Moorea is facing a committal hearing in the Southport Magistrates Court for one count each of murder and damaging evidence.
Gold Coast police officer Senior Constable George Liasides told the court he had a number of conversations with Moorea the night Ms Robinson died.
“The conversation with him stating they had a fight happened within the unit,” he said.
Sen Const Liasides said he did not ask Moorea if he meant a verbal or physical fight.
The court was told Sen Const Liasides gave a statement in 2015 but did not mention the conversation until 2018.
The statement in 2018 included details of conversations between Sen Liasides and Moorea, the court was told.

Sen Const Liasides said he did not record the conversation or make notes following the conversation.
“My greatest regret in my career is not having a digital recording,” he said.
“Things that were said and stuck with me.”
Sen Const Liadies said he did not make any notes of the conversation until he made the statement in April 2018 – about five years later.
He denied he was “reconstructing” a conversation but did not have any explanation as to why he did not make any notes.
DAY FOUR: COURT HEARS DETAILS OF BREEANA’S INJURIES
A GOLD Coast Titans cheerleader most likely landed on her back with her head turned to the right after falling from a high-rise building, an expert has told a court.
Jayden Moorea, previously known as Daniel Shearin, is accused of throwing Breeana Robinson from his 11th floor balcony in the H2O building in Southport on January 29, 2013.
Moorea is facing a committal hearing in the Southport Magistrates Court for one count each of murder and damaging evidence.

On the fourth day of the committal hearing Dr Dianne Little, who performed the autopsy, said a majority of the injuries she found on Ms Robinson were likely to be related to the fall.
She some there were some rib fractures which were likely to be related to CPR.
Dr Little also told the court the injuries Ms Robinson received meant it was likely Ms Robinson landed perpendicular to the building.
The court was told Ms Robinson had “tram track” like injuries on her right arm and left calf.
Barrister Angus Edwards, instructed by Hannay Lawyers, asked her if the most likely way Ms Robinson landed to get those injuries would be perpendicular to the building.
Dr Little agreed due to the way some metal strips were positions on the glass.
The court was told Ms Robinson also had significant cuts and bruising on the right side of her face and head.
Mr Edwards asked if it was likely Ms Robinson landed on her back with her head turned to the right.
“That would explain those injuries,” Dr Little replied.
Ms Robinson also had a mark on her throat as well, the court was told.
Dr Little said it was likely that injury was caused when paramedics were trying to resuscitate her.
She said there were no injuries consistent with Ms Robinson being choked.
The doctor who examined Moorea on the night Ms Robinson fell to her death said she only found one injury on his body.
Dr Christine Mirakian said she saw a small cut on Moorea’s right middle finger near the knuckle.
She described it as a 1cm by 0.5cm area of redness with a small cut on the top which was already starting the scab.
“It (the scab) wasn’t something that had occurred within likely just a couple of hours,” she said.
Dr Mirakian said she saw Moorea about 2.30am the morning after Ms Robinson died and it was “likely” the cut had occurred at least 24 hours before she saw Moorea.
She said it was also likely it may have been from psoriasis.
Police scenes of crime officer Senior Sergeant Leon Wort said that four prints were found on the balcony railing in Moorea and Ms Robinson’s apartment.
Two belonged to Moorea and one belonged to Ms Robinson and the fourth has not been identified, the court was told.
Mr Edwards questioned Sen Sgt Wort about the other markings found on the railing which could not be identified.
“Is it the case you are unable to say whether someone climbed over that railing,” Mr Edwards asked.
“That’s correct,” Sen Sgt Wort replied.
Mr Edwards then asked: “They may have, they may not have.”
Sen Sgt Wort replied: “That’s right.”
Forensic specialist Cassie Thompson told the court she examined the clothes Ms Robinson was wearing - a top, a pair of shorts and underwear.
She told the court there were numerous small “severances” in the back of all the clothes.
She said she also found glass in the top and shorts.
Fingerprint expert Sergeant Alicia Finigan said the unidentifiable mark was a hand print but it was unclear who it was from.
“It’s an impression of a hand but here is not enough detail in order to make any other impression,” she said
Sgt Finigan said the print from Ms Robinson was from her palm with it turned at an angle on the top of the railing.
The hearing will continue on Friday with five witnesses, including a biomechanical expert.
HARROWING DETAIL ADDING TO GRIEF OF FAMILY
THE aunt of a Gold Coast Titans cheerleader who fell to her death has revealed her pain at attending court each day.
Breeana Robinson died after falling from the H2O building in Southport on January 29, 2013.
Her former boyfriend, cruise ship crooner Jayden Moorea, previously known as Daniel Shearin, is facing a committal hearing the Southport Magistrates Court for one count each of murder and damaging evidence.
It is alleged he threw her from the balcony.
Janine Mackney, aunt of Breeana Robinson, talks about returning to Gold Coast's Southport courthouse in the committal hearing of alleged killer Jayden Moorea.
Ms Robinson’s aunt posted to Facebook a short clip of why attending court each day is so hard.
In the clip she stands in a car park across the road from the court, films the court building before turning the camera to show the H2O building nearby.
“Let me share with your all one of the hard things about being here,” she says in a teary voice.
“That’s the building where she died. It’s very hard to be in this area.”
Ms Mackney has been attending court each day of the committal hearing carrying a pink rose.
Pink was Ms Robinson’s favourite colours.
She has been supported by her daughters.
FOUR YEARS TO GET A STATEMENT
POLICE took almost four years to get a statement from one of the paramedics who helped treat Breeana Robinson the night she fell to her death from a high-rise, a court has been told.
Jayden Moorea, previously known as Daniel Shearin, is accused of throwing the Gold Coast Titans cheerleader from his 11th-floor balcony in the H20 building in Southport on January 29, 2013.
Moorea is facing a committal hearing in the Southport Magistrates Court for one count each of murder and damaging evidence.
Paramedic Andrew Busby told the court on day three of the hearing that he provided his statement in July 2017.
Mr Busby said when he arrived at the scene other paramedics were already trying to save Ms Robinson.
“When we approached her body she was laying on her back,” he said.
“She was quite precariously close to the edge so we had to move her back so we could treat her.”
FULL DIGITAL ACCESS: JUST $5 A MONTH FOR THE FIRST THREE MONTHS
Mr Busby said the could not recall any further details about how she was lying.
Throughout the first two days of the committal hearing a number of witnesses have told the court their first statement to police was not until 2017 or 2018.
The positioning of her body has also been controversial with some saying she was perpendicular to the building and others saying she was parallel to the building. Others had no clear recollection.
Paramedic Dean Gamblin told the court they moved Ms Robinson further away form the edge of the glass when they arrived.
He said she was lying in a position parallel to the building.
“I believe that she was in the very similar position so we haven’t changed the angle as such,” she said.
Mr Gamblin said he could not comment is she had been moved before paramedics arrived.
He told the court as paramedics worked on her a firefighter came to assist but the glass began to move.
Mr Gamblin said he could not remember if Ms Robinson had any marks on her face or throat.
“It was dark and the lighting was quite poor,” he said.
H20 resident Ashlee Horvath told the court she was lying on her couch looking out of the balcony when she heard a scream.
“I heard a scream and saw a woman’s body go past,” she said.
Ms Horvath said she saw Ms Robinson’s feet go past, followed by her head.
She told the court the body was not quite straight up and down.
“It was a split second thing,” she said.
“I looked up and went ‘oh my gosh is that what I thought I saw’.
“I heard the loud bang and saw she landed on the glass petition under my balcony.”
Moorea’s former boss Jacqueline Lowein told the court Moorea sounded “scattered and disjointed” when he left a number of voicemail messages for her the night Ms Robinson died.
“He was saying something like ‘oh my God, Jac, Bree’s jumped and thrown herself off the balcony’,” she said.
Ms Lowein said she was working as a travel manager at Travel by Wyndham at the time.
She said she exchanged voicemails with Moorea that night but they never actually managed to speak.
“He was just very scattered, as you would be,” she said.
Defence barrister Angus Edwards, instructed by Hannay Lawyers, asked what Ms Lowein meant when she said in her statement that Mooera did not sound very genuine.
“It just sounded odd … I just remember thinking it was odd,” she said.
Ms Lowein said she thought Moorea sounded upset and at times could hear him crying.
Moorea also told her he was not going to come into work.
The committal hearing will continue on Thursday when forensic experts are expected to take the stand.

AUNT SLAMS LEGAL SYSTEM
THE aunt of a Gold Coast Titans cheerleader who fell to her death from an 11th floor balcony has slammed the legal system for taking so long to hear the case.
Breeana Robinson died after falling from the H20 building in Southport on January 29, 2013.
Her boyfriend cruise ship crooner Jayden Moorea, previously known as Daniel Shearin, is facing a committal hearing the Southport Magistrates Court for one count each of murder and damaging evidence.
It is alleged he threw her from the balcony.
In the first two days of the committal hearing the court has heard from a number of witnesses who did not give their first police statement until 2018 – more than five years after Ms Robinson’s death.
Ms Robinson’s aunt Janine Mackney spoke outside court on Tuesday saying she was upset by the delay.
“Eight years later as I keep saying, It’s just not good enough, our legal system is a joke,” she said.
Janine Mackney, aunt of former Gold Coast Titans cheerleader Breeana Robinson, who fell to her death in 2013.
“Five years later and they are only getting witness statements. You know, you have to do better, you’ve got to do better.”
Ms Mackney became emotional when asked what kept her coming to court each day.
“I made a promise. She was my niece,” she said.
“Someone has to be here for her. I think it’s good that, you know, Dan’s expecting that. I’m never going to give up.”
Mr Robinson said she was reassured by multiple witnesses saying they heard the same thing – about 15 minutes of arguing before a scream.
The hearing continues.
EARLIER
A NEIGHBOUR heard loud voices before a thump the night a Gold Coast Titans cheerleader fell to death from a high-rise balcony, a court was told.
Jayden Moorea, previously known as Daniel Shearin, is accused of throwing Breeana Robinson from his 11th-floor balcony in the H20 building in Southport on January 29, 2013.
Moorea is facing a committal hearing in the Southport Magistrates Court for one count each of murder and damaging evidence.
On the second day of the hearing on Tuesday neighbour Rebecca Adams, who lived on the 18th floor, said she heard loud noises while in her bedroom.
“I thought they were coming from the street,” she said.
“I can’t say how far away the voices were but they were loud enough for me to appreciate from my bedroom.”
Dr Adams said she then heard a thump but she could not say if the loud voices continued up until the thump.
She said she was not sure if they continued after the thump as there was a lot of other noise of people in the building talking.
“I recall the body lying parallel to the building and the head was on the left and legs on the right and I remember that specifically … I could see blood coming out of the head,” she said.
Dr Adams first made a statement to police in June 2018 – more than five years after Mr Robinson’s death.
A neighbour who lived on the same floor as Jayden Moorea and Breeana Robinson described how she heard a man and woman loudly arguing before Ms Robinson fell to her death.
Julie Carroll said: “I heard an argument for at least 15 minutes … I could hear the man’s loud yelling and the woman was crying.”
Ms Carroll said the arguing stopped and she later heard a scream.
She could not recall how long it was between the arguing stopping and the scream.
Defence barrister Angus Edwards, instructed by Hannay Lawyers, showed Ms Carroll Facebook conversations she had the night Ms Robinson died.
In the messages Ms Carroll said she did not hear screaming.
“I meant I didn’t hear screams after it had happened,” she said.
“If I knew someone who fell from a balcony I would be screaming.”
Allan Walker, who lived on the seventh floor, said he was out on the balcony and heard a “swishing noise” before someone said ‘Oh, no’.”
Mr Walker said he then saw Ms Robinson fall past him.
“She was parallel (to the building) as she went past,” he said.
Mr Walker said when he saw her body on the glass awning her head was closer to the street and her feet were pointing to the building.
He said she appeared to be wearing a black bra and underwear and had landed on her back with her right hand twisted under her and her legs apart.
H20 resident Emily Turner, who lived on the eighth floor, said she heard arguing before a period of silence and then she heard a thump.
“(The silence was) no more than a minute,” she said.
Ms Turner said it was possible she had fallen back to sleep during the period of silence between the arguing and the thump.
She told the court when she looked out over the balcony she saw Ms Robinson’s body perpendicular to the building.
Moorea’s next door neighbour Lisa Dunscombe was in the lift with the Moorea as they went to got see Ms Robinson immediately after she had fallen.
She told the court he seemed upset.
Ms Dunscombe said she left her apartment after hearing the thump and seeing Bree on the awning.
She said she saw Moorea coming out with his phone in one hand and doing up his pants.
Ms Dunscombe told the court she and her partner got into the lift with Moorea to go down to see what happened. Moorea told the pair it was his girlfriend he caused the thud.
“He said something about his ‘beautiful Bree’ and his exact words I can’t remember and him saying ‘he could have done more’,” she said.
Ms Dunscombe said she did not remember hearing any arguing or screaming the night Ms Robinson fell.
“I know there was no screaming and there was no noise and there was no previous arguing,” she said.
Ms Dunscombe told the court when she saw Bree’s body from under the awning she was on her back, her arms out at about a 45 degree angle and parallel to the building.
She said she had a conversation that night with Moorea after he came down from the balcony.
Ms Dunscombe told the court that Moorea said to her: “I could have helped her and I could have saved her.
“I could have loved her more.”
Monday, January 18
TRIPLE 0 CALLS
TWO Triple 0 calls Jayden Moorea made the night his former Gold Coast Titans cheerleader girlfriend fell from a Southport tower has been played to court.
Moorea, formerly Dan Shearin, is facing a committal hearing the in the Southport Magistrates Court on charges of murder and damaging evidence.
It is alleged Moorea threw Breeana Robinson from his balcony in the H20 building in Southport on January 29, 2013.
During the first day of proceedings, the court was played a recording of a Triple 0 call Moorea made the night Ms Robinson died.
“We are down in the foyer, she has landed on the glass,” Moorea said in the recording.
He was asked if she was breathing.
“No, I don’t know, we can’t get up to her,” he said.
Moorea is also heard asking for a ladder.
Former H20 security guard Gordon Cassidy told the court he heard the fall and saw Ms Robinson on the glass.
He said he, another man and Moorea all got up to the awning where Ms Robinson was lying.
Mr Cassidy said she was breathing and he moved her so she was no longer on the broken glass so he could perform first aid.
The downstairs neighbour of Moorea and Ms Robinson said she heard the pair fighting before the cheerleader fell from the balcony.
Mieke Pearce said she does not remember how long it was between the arguing stopping and hearing Ms Robinson scream.
“I just feel like it all happened very quickly. From the memory I have now it all happened one after the other,” she said.
Ms Pearce told the court she heard a woman scream and “yell out no”.
The court was told Ms Pearce had moved into the unit five days earlier and had heard the pair argue two or three times.
Ms Pearce’s partner Ben Pearce told the court he remembered there being a distinct period of time between hearing the arguing and the scream.
He said could not remember the time period but agreed it could be up to 30 minutes between the arguing and scream.

Defence barrister Angus Edwards, instructed by Hannay Lawyers, asked a number of witnesses about the position Ms Robinson was in when they saw her after the fall and before someone was able to get onto the awning to help her.
Three witness have said she was perpendicular to the building.
H20 resident Edward Wu, who lived on the ninth floor, said he remembers seeing Ms Robinson lying parallel to the building.
“All I can say is she was facing down … I don’t know whether her feet were closer to the edge of the building,” he said.
A second Triple 0 call made by Moorea has been played to the court where he told operators his girlfriend had climbed over the balcony.
“I went into the bedroom and she just ran onto the balcony and she has gone over the balcony,” he is heard saying on the call.
Moorea made the call prior to going downstairs and prior to the Triple 0 call played to the Southport Magistrates Court earlier on Monday.
His voice sounds high and he spoke in rushed tones.
The Triple 0 operator had to ask him a number of times to repeat information which could not be understood.
Next-door neighbour Alfred Schmetzer told the court he ran out into the hall after he heard a thud.
He said he saw Moorea coming out of this apartment on the phone and using one hand to put on pants.
Mr Schmetzer said his recollection as that Moorea was “focused and calm”.
A H20 resident told the court she heard Mr Robinson scream “no, no” as she feel from her balcony.
Georgina Hadid told the Southport Magistrates Court she also saw Ms Robinson falling past her fourth level balcony for a “split second”.
“She was flat on her back facing towards the sky,” she said.
Ms Hadid first gave a statement to police in November 2018 – five and a half years after Ms Robinson’s death.
She said she later saw Moorea out on the balcony while a security guard and her husband Badawi Hadid tried to help Ms Robinson.
“At one stage I did see him on the awning and he never touched her and never helped her,” she said.
“What I recall is him saying ‘Bree, I’m here for your Bree’ … no emotion, no nothing.”
Ms Hadid said she saw this from her fourth floor balcony.
MOOREA FLANKED BY LAWYERS AS HE ARRIVES AT COURT
A CRUISE ship crooner accused of murdering his Gold Coast Titans cheerleader ex-girlfriend has arrived at court for a committal hearing flanked by his lawyers.
Jayden Moorea, previously known as Dan Shearin, walked into the Southport Magistrates Court on Monday accompanied by solicitor Chris Hannay and barrister Angus Edwards.
It is alleged Moorea threw Breeana Robinson from his balcony in the H20 building in Southport on January 29, 2013.
Moorea was not charged until January 2019.
The group was stopped at the courthouse doors by security asking if they had been in Brisbane in the past 21 days.
Security provided the group with masks and asked them to wear them in the premises.
More than 70 witnesses are expected to give evidence in the committal hearing over the next two weeks.
Witnesses called will include experts, cheerleaders and police officers.
The hearing will determine if there is enough evidence for Moorea to stand trial.
Ms Robinson’s aunt Janine Mackney and another friend of Ms Robinson are in the courtroom waiting for proceedings to start, both holding a pink rose.
Moorea, who was released on bail not long after he was charged, has a clothing line – C.R. U. I. S. E – Can’t Rest Until I Sail Everywhere.
The apparel is sold on Moorea’s website – jdmoorea.com – where he describes himself as an “author, photographer and performance coach”.
In a court hearing in November 2019 a portion of the triple-0 call was read aloud.
“I need an ambulance, please, my girlfriend has just climbed over the balcony … I went into the bedroom and saw her climb over the balcony … she had threatened to do this before,” Moorea is alleged to have said on the call.

The committal hearing is expected to focus on what happened in the lead-up to Ms Robinson’s death and what happened in Moorea’s apartment before her fall.
Evidence from biomechanical experts is expected to shed further light on what happened that night.

Full text: Experts have given Victoria's testing and contact tracing regime their tick of approval - some high-profile wobbles notwithstanding - as the state battles its first COVID-19 outbreak in months.
Victoria recorded four new cases yesterday, three locally acquired. All three have been linked to the Black Rock cluster centred on the Smile Buffalo Thai restaurant.
Delays at COVID-19 testing sites continued yesterday and some were forced to close as waiting times swelled. Other sites were reporting waiting times of more than three hours, although there were also reports of quick turnarounds.
There have also been questions about the accuracy of the information the Department of Health and Human Services has posted and the speed with which it has been contacting people. In several cases, venues and patrons heard only from the media they had potentially been exposed to the virus. But despite those problems, experts said they had been encouraged by what they had seen. "From what we know, I think we're doing really well," said Professor Michael Toole, an epidemiologist at the Burnet Institute.
"Fifty-five thousand people have been tested in the last two days. Of course there were queues, but the queues in Queensland were even worse. Be reassured the contact tracing, testing and isolating system is a lot better than it was six months ago."
Reason Party leader and MP Fiona Patten chaired a state parliamentary inquiry which found Victoria's contact tracing was under-resourced and failed during the state's second wave. She said authorities appeared to have repaired the system.
"I am confident that Victoria is at the top of the game," she said. "It certainly appears that the systems that are now in place are working well."
Deakin University chair of epidemiology Professor Catherine Bennett said contact tracing was "going well so far, from what I can see".
"Contact tracing is looking quite strong. Information [is] coming in quickly." But giving that information quickly and accurately to the public was still a problem, she said.
In one case yesterday, health authorities initially warned patrons at a Chirnside Park Woolworths to get tested, before later switching that for Coles.
Patrons at the Lion Hotel in La Trobe Street were initially told to isolate only until they tested negative, before that advice was upgraded to 14 days of quarantine.
The Grape & Grain bar in Moorabbin alerted customers it was an exposure site, but it took hours for it to be added to the official list of exposure sites on Sunday. A patron of the bar, who agreed to speak on the condition of anonymity, said she visited for a birthday party with a group of about 20 people during the exposure period on December 29 and found out through the bar's social media post.
"The DHHS didn't put the Grape & Grain as an exposure site until 8.51pm last night. If you times that by 20 friends we had at the bar, doing fun things on a summer schedule, you can imagine how that adds to contact and spread," she said.
Data analyst Anthony Macali has been using publicly available data to track Victoria's contact tracing system since the outbreak began. At the peak of Victoria's second wave, he was one of the first to identify data showing the state's contact tracing had become overwhelmed. He said the beefed up system now appeared to be operating "quite well".
The DHHS was releasing new exposure sites as often as every 30 minutes, he said.
Models of Victoria's "transmission potential" by the federal government, which shows how quickly COVID-19 would spread if reintroduced, ranked Victoria as having the best transmission control measures in the nation.
The DHHS said yesterday its south-east suburban contact tracing team was helping the department manage the Black Rock outbreak.
Victoria came under fire from epidemiologists and the federal government during the second wave for its highly centralised public health team that led to problems in contact tracing, with health experts calling for suburban public health units, similar to those that stemmed outbreaks in NSW.
Over the past seven days, Victoria has averaged 16,445 tests, including 32,468 tests yesterday, with 86 per cent of those tests being returned in 24 hours.
A modelling study led by the Burnet Institute - uploaded in December but not yet peer reviewed - found Victoria's current restrictions meant any new cluster had a roughly 80 per cent chance of being suppressed. However, if the government acted quickly after new cases were found, ramping up testing and restrictions, that risk could be pushed to below 10 per cent.

Cases dive but Victorians urged to 'stay the course'

Full text: Premier Daniel Andrews has been urged not to bow to pressure when easing coronavirus restrictions as the falling daily infection rate leads to growing calls for the government to bring forward its road map.
Victoria can avoid repeating the mistakes it made at the end of the first wave of the pandemic by solely focusing on the infection rate - not dates - when guiding the state out of the lockdown, according to leading public health experts.
Industry groups, the Victorian opposition and the Prime Minister have argued for some of the most stringent restrictions in Melbourne to be lifted sooner than planned as a result of falling daily coronavirus case numbers.
Victoria recorded 11 new cases yesterday, its lowest daily rise since June 16 when there were nine cases. However, the daily total was revised to nine after two cases were classified.
State Opposition Leader Michael O'Brien said yesterday the Premier needed to "change course" and reopen the economy, while Mr Andrews has continued to raise hopes restrictions could be eased sooner than expected with Melbourne's 14-day average continuing to plunge.
But University of Melbourne researcher Dr Jason Thompson, who co-authored modelling on which the government based its road map, said easing restrictions too soon risked an explosion of coronavirus cases before Christmas.
Dr Thompson urged Victorians and government to stay the course, and not fall victim to lockdown fatigue by opening up sooner than is safe.
"I would ask people to think about time as an investment - time invested now will pay off later," Dr Thompson said.
"It's the last-ditch effort - we're in the last quarter of a game. We're all tired, we just want to have a drink or sit on the bench, but we know if we do that, the other team will come on top of us."
The modelling he co-authored revealed the state would "never keep a lid" on the virus, risking a third wave, if restrictions were eased too soon.
Burnet Institute epidemiologist Mike Toole said Melbourne should emerge out of the second wave much more cautiously than it had eased out of the first wave.
He said Melburnians would have something to look forward to on September 28, when some of the lowest-risk restrictions were eased, but cautioned against pinning hopes on the October 26 and November 23 dates outlined in the government's four-step road map.
"I can see why people are fixated on Sunday - it will be a six-week stage four lockdown and curfew, and we've all been looking forward to that being over," Professor Toole said.
"From then on, I think it should be case based - it's not even just the number of cases, but the nature of the cases. People should get dates out of their mind."
Mr Andrews declared it a "great day" but warned of complacency, revealing Melbourne's rolling 14-day average had come down to 34.4.
There were 7100 tests processed on Sunday - slightly below the weekend average, which tends to be lower than the weekday rates - but the Premier said it was still within an acceptable range.
The government will consider a testing blitz at high-risk workplaces, including aged-care facilities, in coming weeks.

60,000 virus cases went undetected, says study

Full text: Research by some of the nation's most senior scientists has found that more than 60,000 cases of coronavirus in Australia could have gone undetected,potentially adding to calls to ease restrictions sooner.
The federal government-funded study by a team of researchers including Australia's Deputy Chief Medical officer, Dr Nick Coatsworth, estimates that by July - before Victoria's peak in cases - 71,400 people may have contracted the virus.
At the time, there were only 11,190 officially confirmed cases in Australia.
Of those screened by researchers in June and July, 0.28 per cent had COVID-19 antibodies, the study found, which means they had contracted coronavirus. Antibody testing can tell if a person has ever been infected with a virus, as antibodies remain in the blood for many months after they recover from an infection.
Federal government modelling released in April said Australia's testing program was catching 93 per cent of all symptomatic cases. However, the new study suggests 85 to 90 per cent of all cases were not being picked up.
The study has significant implications. If accurate, it means Australia has had a far-higher number of infections than thought, without overwhelming the hospital system.
"We have had more infection than we thought. And hospitals have coped extraordinarily well," said Professor Elizabeth Gardiner, head of the Australian National University's cancer department and a co-author on the paper.
That put into question whether stricter lockdowns, such as Victoria's current stage four restrictions, were necessary, she said.
"Should we remain at that level of lockdown? No. I don't think the numbers justify it."
But the study also has significant limitations. Its sample size is too small to make a confident estimate about the true level of infection around Australia: only 2991 people were tested, about two-thirds of them from Victoria and NSW. Of those 2991, 41 had antibodies to COVID-19.
Professor Brendan Crabb, an antibody-testing expert and director of the Burnet Institute, who was not involved in the study, said the estimate of 71,400 infections was "on the high side of likelihood, but not out of the realms of possibility."
The antibody test used was developed by ANU researchers and has a false positive rate of 1.09 per cent.
"There is still much margin for error here," Professor Crabb said.
The study's lead author, Associate Professor Ian Cockburn, said it would "not be too surprising" that many infections had not been picked up.
In the early stages of the pandemic in Australia, many people were turned away from testing stations. It is estimated about 40 per cent of people with the coronavirus do not show any symptoms.
The low number of overall infections "tells you the restrictions work," Professor Cockburn said. If Australia's rules had been less strict, there would have been more confirmed cases, but more unconfirmed cases too, stressing healthcare systems, he said.
Professor Kristine Macartney, director of the National Centre for Immunisation Research and Surveillance, said coronavirus cases were probably missed in the first weeks and months of the pandemic in Australia when there were greater limits on who could be tested.
"What we probably now appreciate is that the virus was infecting people who may not have been eligible for testing at that time," she said. "It does indicate that Australia ... has kept control of the spread of the virus."
Other countries that have done similar antibody surveys also discovered their testing programs were missing many infections.
A separate antibody survey in NSW, being run by the Kirby Institute, is expected to release results later this week. Based on early data, NSW Chief Health Officer Kerry Chant estimated in July the true prevalence of coronavirus cases was between 1 and 2 per cent of the state's population.
Infection control expert Professor Mary-Louise McLaws said most other countries had reported rates of coronavirus infections in their communities of between 1 and 10 per cent of the population - much higher than the 0.28 per cent rate reported in the Australian survey.
She said while it was encouraging to see these low numbers of infection relative to the rest of the world, it would be great to see more testing.
"I would like to see both NSW and Victoria opening up their testing to anyone who wished to be tested, while at the same time prioritising people who had a contact or were feeling unwell."
The new study appears on medical research website medRxiv but has not yet been peer reviewed or published in an academic journal.

Kids are paying dearly for mistakes of adults

Full text: YOUNG Australians will ultimately pay the heaviest price for the nation’s coronavirus response.
Saddled with ruinous national debt that will take decades to pay back, Gen Z and Gen Alpha will be burdened with higher taxes and diminished prosperity and opportunity as Australia plunges into a deep recession that is already the worst we’ve seen since the Great Depression. A recession due to federal and state government policy based on hopelessly flawed modelling that dramatically over-estimated the need for intensive care facilities.
The grave errors in the modelling by the Peter Doherty Institute were uncovered by a team led by James Cook University professor of infectious diseases modelling, Emma McBryde.
On top of the economic and social hardship, school-age children in Victoria are having their education adversely affected by hysterical policy making that is not rooted in evidence or science.
When term four starts in early October, all Victorian children should be back at school. Any kids or teaching staff with pre-existing health conditions can continue with distance learning but that should be the exception, not the norm.
As medical experts and researchers around the world have learnt more about the virus and how it affects children, the calls to reopen schools have increased.
Even the UK’s chief medical officer Chris Whitty, who has been criticised for his overcautious advice, has pushed for all pupils to return to the classroom, highlighting the “overwhelming” evidence missing school causes more harm to children than COVID-19 would.
The UK’s deputy chief medical officer Jenny Harries has said coronavirus poses a minuscule risk to children.
“The risk from seasonal flu, we think is probably higher than the current risk of COVID,” she said.
We don’t close down schools during every flu season but the state government is damaging the academic progress of about a million students for a virus that is less deadly for them than the seasonal flu.
Paediatric infectious disease specialists, Benjamin Lee and William V. Raszka, writing in the journal of the American Academy of Paediatrics, concluded school should be open to “minimise the potentially profound adverse social, developmental, and health costs that our children will continue to suffer”.
After reviewing data from Australia, France, China and Switzerland, Dr Raszka said: “After six months, we have a wealth of accumulating data showing that children are less likely to become infected and seem less infectious.” Infectious diseases physician and professor of ANU’s school of medicine, Peter Collignon, has said children under 15 record fewer infections than people in their 20s and above. He has noted even in Sweden, which has widespread community transmission, the number of students infected was relatively small.
“Although Finland closed schools for most children and Sweden did not, and despite Sweden having been more affected by the outbreak overall, infection levels in children in both countries were very similar,” he wrote.
In Sweden, schools have remained open throughout the pandemic for all students under 16.
Prof Collignon explains that as long as teachers take sensible precautions, such as socially distancing from other adults or wearing masks, the risks of infection can be managed.
Victoria’s strategy of bringing back VCE students before other year levels has been criticised for being “the wrong way around”.
“There really isn’t a good reason to shut primary schools and infant schools. Because in terms of total transmission they are not very significant, but it has tremendous educational and social implications,” Prof Collignon said via newsGP.
Year 12 students are understandably worried about having the most crucial year of their schooling hindered by multiple, prolonged school closures. But it’s not just VCE students who are being disadvantaged.
Kids in years 3to 10 have missed the most school this year and will be behind their counterparts interstate. Many vulnerable students, including those with a chaotic home environment not conducive to distance education, will fall through the cracks.
A Save the Children report released on Thursday found the pandemic is having a “devastating impact on the education of children from poorer backgrounds”.
There’s a wealth of scientific data and expert opinion advising against school closures and yet Victorian students have been condemned to inferior remote learning for months.
It is possible to minimise contact between adults, both parents and teachers, and allow schools to reopen safely for term four.

IN SHORT Queensland’s border closures are causing despair among ordinary folks but not AFL officials or Hollywood stars. Tom Hanks was granted an exemption to bypass the regular quarantine hotels and complete his two weeks in a ritzy Gold Coast resort. Hanks also got rare access to hydroxychloroquine when he was last in Australia and infected with COVID-19.

Full text: VICTORIA’S Premier promised a “road map” out of the bans that have smashed his bleeding state.
Instead, Daniel Andrews on Sunday delivered a map to destruction –—to a lockdown that will almost certainly last to Christmas.
Hundreds more businesses will now go broke.
Andrews said he will not lift the curfew, the stay-home law and the bans on shops until October 26 — but then only if new infections are down to an average of just five a day, over two weeks.
Not even NSW has managed that, yet still keeps business ticking. Worse, Andrews says most shops won’t be allowed to open before November 23, and then only if there are no new infections for two weeks.
Not even Queensland has achieved that, yet will still host even an AFL Grand Final that Andrews won’t.
What does Andrews know that NSW Premier Gladys Berejiklian and Queensland Premier Annastacia Palaszczuk do not?
What he “knows” — he thinks — is the modelling he’s seizing on like a drowning man.
It’s from a “supercomputer”, he says — but a supercomputer that seems to have been fed garbage.
It is, in fact, part of Melbourne University’s “agent-based dynamic policy model”, which produced the modelling by academics such as Dr Jason Thompson and Professor Tony Blakely that Andrews now cites.
We must accept this longer lockdown, they say, because look overseas if we don’t: “Stratospheric levels of demand for intensive care occurred and much could not be met.” That’s largely untrue for Western countries, other than Italy, and certainly for Australia. Even now, we have just 27 coronavirus patients in the 7000 intensive care beds that have been prepared.
And what of past predictions of these academics? Blakely in March said his modelling showed 125,000 Australians a day would get sick with the virus, and 165,000 in all would need intensive care, even with social distancing and after closing restaurants.
In fact, just 26,000 have got sick so far, and the vast majority had only mild symptoms.
This is the “supercomputer” persuading Andrews to drive his state off a cliff? God save Victoria. It’s in the hands of man who now seems deranged — like a World War 1 general who’s already sent so many soldiers to pointless deaths, but still orders “one last push” into the machine guns to win the war before Christmas. Christmas? Don’t set the table in Victoria.

City’s liberation tied to caseload clearances

Full text: Melburnians will have been living under stay-at-home restrictions for more than 3½ months by the time the Andrews government ­allows them to leave their homes for purposes other than work, exercise, medical care or exercise on October 26.
And they will be able to do so on that date only if the state manages to reach a threshold of an average of fewer than five cases a day for 14 days, and a total of fewer than five cases with an unknown source over this entire period.
Since the pandemic began in Victoria, contact tracers have been unable to establish a source of infection for 4365 of the state’s total 19,538 cases. All but 301 of these unknown source cases have been confirmed since July 1.
Victoria’s current 14-day daily average number of cases reached 101 on Sunday with 63 new cases, down from a peak of 505 less than a month ago on August 8.
University of Melbourne modelling commissioned by the Andrews government’s health department and released on Sunday to coincide with Premier Daniel Andrews’s announcement of his roadmap for easing restrictions projected a 14-day average of 63 cases a day would not be reached until September 17.
The modellers also concluded there would be a 60 per cent chance of a lockdown having to be reimposed before Christmas if restrictions were eased too early.
One of the report’s authors, University of Melbourne professor of epidemiology Tony Blakely, said the modelling was based on Victoria’s contact tracing performance over the past few months, which has seen some close contacts never followed up and others contacted more than a fortnight after they were exposed to the virus.
In one case, a woman’s family was phoned a week after her death, and more than a month after she contracted coronavirus.
Victoria’s stage-four restrictions, previously set to expire on September 13, require Melburnians to stay home unless they have a work permit, are seeking medical care or are shopping or exercising for less than an hour each within 5km of their houses.
An 8pm to 5am curfew applies.
From September 14, these restrictions will be slightly modified to push the curfew back an hour to 9pm and allow groups of two or a household to meet outdoors for a maximum of two hours, without being required to exercise, and ­single people to nominate one person who may visit them.
If the 14-day daily average number of COVID-19 cases has fallen to between 30 and 50 in metropolitan Melbourne by September 28, restrictions will be eased slightly to increase public outdoor gatherings to up to five people from a maximum of two households and allow childcare to resume and Prep to Grade 2 and VCE students to return to the classroom; stay-at-home restrictions will otherwise continue to apply until at least October 26.
Most parents of school-age children who were hoping for a reprieve from home schooling are out of luck, with students in Years 3 to 10 set for a “potential staged return” to the classroom “based on public health advice” from Nov­ember 23, and only if Victoria has no new coronavirus cases for 14 days.
Outdoor gatherings of up to 50 people and indoor gatherings of up to 20 will also not be permitted until this stage — 11 weeks away. Restaurants and cafes in metropolitan Melbourne will remain takeaway-only until at least October 26.

COVID border wars trigger tourist trap

Full text: Nation to lose billions ONGOING interstate border restrictions will wipe $33 billion in tourism dollars from the economy over the next year if the blockades remain.
The warning comes as NSW Premier Gladys Berejiklian yesterday called for more “compassion” in the approach to interstate travel, amid her “frustration” with Queensland’s hard border.
The closure threatens to leave NSW towns without doctors.
And in a move to ensure farmers have access to the workers they need, the nation’s premiers will be asked to agree to a code of conduct for agricultural workers at National Cabinet tomorrow. The code would allow vital farm workers freedom to travel across state lines.
Ms Berejiklian held talks on the matter with Queensland Premier Annastacia Palaszczuk late yesterday. It is understood Ms Palaszczuk told the premier she would consider allowing health workers free movement across the border.
It comes as yesterday NSW Health Minister Brad Hazzard unleashed on Queensland. Mr Hazzard said Ms Palaszczuk (pictured) needed to be more “pragmatic and compassionate” with restrictions.
“Lives are being put at risk by the decisions that the premier is making in Queensland,” he said.
Michele Coker, a senior doctor who has worked at Ocean Shores Medical Centre near Byron Bay since 1986, said five doctors at the practice had been stuck in Queensland where they live and were unable to return to work.
“We have five who live on the other side of the border … who have been refused exemptions to come to work,” she said. “They are doing some telehealth consults … but obviously there is a limit to what you can do over the phone, most of the work is pretty hands-on.” Dr Coker said it was offensive AFL teams were allowed to come into Queensland but not doctors into NSW.
New modelling has revealed ongoing border closures will wipe more than $30 billion from the tourism dollar in the next year.
In a best-case scenario with all borders open, Australia’s domestic tourism industry will be worth $83.8 billion in 2020-21 — about $54.7 billion less than 2019 — according to new modelling by Tourism Research Australia. The warning came as the federal government prepares to urge the states to sign a protocol allowing agricultural workers free movement. The move — spearheaded by NSW Agriculture Minister Adam Marshall after The Daily Telegraph’s Bush Summit — has received pushback from states with their borders closed.

Full text: Infectious disease experts are imploring Victorian health authorities to release a suburb-by-suburb breakdown of infections in council areas deemed COVID-19 hotspots.
This comes as a man aged in his 80s died of COVID-19 and the state recorded 20 new cases in 24 hours, marking its eighth day in a row of double-digit rises.
The man's death is the first coronavirus fatality in Victoria in more than a month and the 20th in the state so far from COVID-19.
University of Sydney infectious diseases expert Robert Booy said yesterday that Victoria was on the "knife's edge" of a second, potentially more deadly wave of the virus.
"What is happening in Victoria is a real concern and second wave is a real possibility if we don't turn things around now," he said.
"This is a bug that is going to continue to cause trouble. When we start getting transmission rates indicating there is a community problem, we need to pay attention."
More than a million people live in the local government areas of Hume, Brimbank, Cardinia, Casey, Moreland and Darebin, which have been declared high-risk areas.
Victorians have been urged to limit travel to those municipalities.
There are large family clusters of up to 14 people infected in the suburbs of Keilor Downs in Brimbank, Coburg in Moreland and Hallam in Casey, resulting in emergency testing sites being set up in those areas.
"Places like Cardinia, Hume or Brimbank are huge areas and the risk probably isn't the same in all the suburbs, so it would be helpful for residents to have clear information," said Professor Allen Cheng, an epidemiologist and infectious disease doctor with Alfred Health.
Yesterday Victorian Health Minister Jenny Mikakos pledged to provide a suburb-by-suburb breakdown by the end of the day of infection rates, but by the evening this was yet to be released.
A Department of Health and Human Services spokesman defended the delay and said data was collected according to municipalities, rather than suburbs, and the state's coronavirus detectives were still breaking down the information.
"It is a complex and lengthy process," he said.
State Opposition Leader Michael O'Brien said the government must be more precise about which residents were most at risk, as there was confusion in the broader community about exactly where the hotspots were.
"I'm calling on [Premier] Daniel Andrews to stop using local government areas as the test on whether an area is a COVID hotspot. Please use towns, or postcodes or suburbs," he said.
Experts have also warned of a dangerous level of complacency, which has led to some of those infected flouting rules and passing the virus to a rising number of people.
Ms Mikakos indicated the reproduction rate, a number aimed at calculating the rate of virus transmission based on modelling, had more than doubled from below one to 2.5 in the past week.
This means those infected with the virus are now each passing it on to an average of 2.5 people. The government has previously said the rate should always be below one.
"Once people carrying the virus stop taking precautions, then it goes back towards the maximum transmission rate," University of Melbourne epidemiologist Professor John Mathews said.
Professor Cheng stressed that new cases emerging in hotspots were to be expected, but a rise in community infections across the state, where the source could not be traced, was troubling.
The source of eight cases reported in the past day remains under investigation.
There have been 241 confirmed cases of coronavirus in Victoria that have been acquired through unknown transmission.
Burnet Institute epidemiologist Professor Michael Toole, who backed a suburb breakdown, said public health advice to marginalised communities in at-risk suburbs must be ramped up.
Community leaders and church leaders were paramount in reaching their communities, Professor Toole said.
Among the new cases are another three linked to a family cluster in Keilor Downs in Melbourne's north-west, bringing that total to 15.
A separate cluster of cases involving a family in Hallam in the south-eastern suburbs is connected with an outbreak among contractors at the Stamford Plaza quarantine hotel in the Melbourne CBD.
Three staff members from Hampstead Dental in Maidstone in Melbourne's west have also tested positive for the coronavirus.
Another of the new cases involves a close social contact connected with a case at St Monica's College at Epping in Melbourne's north, bringing that outbreak to two.

Full text: A top statistician has blasted “doomsday” COVID-19 forecasts that pressured governments to lock down their economies for months as a “failure”, and said ­predictions hospitals would be overwhelmed with patients were “entirely misinforming”.
Sally Cripps, a professor of statistics at the University of Sydney, has weighed into the debate over coronavirus modelling that has contributed to the sharpest economic downturn in a century, in ­research written with Stanford ­epidemiologist John Ioannidis.
“Despite involving many excellent modellers, best intentions and highly sophisticated tools, forecasting efforts have largely failed,” they wrote in a draft analysis published earlier this month.
“Implausible, exaggerated fore­casts should be abandoned — otherwise they may cause more harm than the virus itself.” The unemployment rate jumped to 7.1 per cent in May, a 19-year high, as lockdowns imposed by state governments in March to avoid predictions of tens of thousands of deaths from COVID-19 hammered the labour market. So far, 102 people have died from, or with, COVID-19 in Australia.
Even with strict, mandatory ­social-distancing measures, the Doherty Institute modelling that informed the national cabinet’s decisions suggested about 5000 intensive care beds would be required, when fewer than 100 have been used.
“Most hospitals maintained largely empty wards, waiting for tsunamis that never came,” the ­authors wrote, pointing to hugely pessimistic forecasts for New York, one of the cities worst hit by the coronavirus.
In late March, Columbia University projected 136,000 beds would be required; the maximum used was less than 12,000, and at the peak of the virus’s impact a sixth of hospital beds were free.
Massachusetts General Hospital predicted 23,000 deaths within months of the US state of Georgia reopening, yet the actual number was 896, the authors said.
They argued the most widely reported models “lacked transparency”, used poor quality data and focused on deaths rather than the concept of “quality adjusted life years”, which factors in the age of those affected.
“The Spanish flu (with a death toll more than 50 million globally) killed young people with an ­average age of 28, and its burden in terms of number of quality ­adjusted person years lost was about 1000-fold higher than COVID-19,” they said.
“Isolating the infectious impact from all other health, economy and social impacts is dangerously narrow-minded,” they argued, pointing to the likelihood of “starvation and lack of control for other infectious diseases like tuber­culosis and malaria”.
Modelling for swine flu predicted 3000 to 65,000 deaths in the UK, yet 457 died. “It is surprising that epidemic forecasting has retained much credibility among decision-­makers, given its dubious track ­record,” the authors wrote.

Full text: Social distancing is holding new COVID-19 infection levels low enough to eliminate the virus from mainland Australia, new federal government modelling shows.
While the expert team behind the modelling has not estimated a date by which the virus could be defeated, they project it could be months away, rather than weeks.
Yet loosening social distancing restrictions will inevitably lead to it returning and cases rising, researchers say, which means Australians would need to maintain such measures to keep the virus at bay rather than return to life as normal.
The model suggests every 10 people infected currently spread the virus to an average of five more people. At that level, the virus would be unable to circulate and would die out within Australia.
"Our epidemic is in decline," said Professor Jodie McVernon, director of Doherty Epidemiology, which led the team that built the model for the federal government. "But it does not let us be complacent. If we were to release those measures now ... those 10 cases today would produce 25 new cases over the course of their infection, not five."
The number of new cases of COVID-19 diagnosed per day peaked at 460 on March 28 and has since fallen steeply. Thirty-eight new cases were diagnosed nationally on Wednesday.
The model is not considered accurate enough, however, to project when the virus would be eliminated in the community.
"And this virus has a habit of surprising us," said Professor James McCaw, an infectious diseases epidemiologist and member of the modelling team.
Modelling of statistics in Tasmania suggests it has not reduced infection rates enough to eventually eliminate the virus.
However, due to the small number of cases in Tasmania, this estimate has a high degree of uncertainty.
The modelling is being used to guide the government's response to the pandemic.
It focuses on Australia's R0, or reproduction number - a measure of the average number of people an infected person infects.
If that number drops below one, the virus will eventually drop out of circulation in the community. It is currently close to 0.5.
However, if social distancing measures are loosened, the number will rise.
"It's the allure of life as normal," Professor McVernon said.
"Because we're all susceptible to this, the virus will come back from somewhere.
"We cannot return to life as normal. We need to get that in our consciousness."
It is still not known how many people are infected without showing symptoms. International estimates are as high as 60 per cent.
"It definitely makes you very cautious about relaxing measures," Professor McCaw said.
Professor McCaw earlier described the model's findings - based on three separate models, all which came to agreement - as very robust.

Morrison's redemption is nigh

Author: HARTCHER, PETER

Full text: It was only four weeks ago that Australia's borders were open, the Chief Medical Officer was endorsing handshakes and outings to the movies, and Scott Morrison was preparing to go to the footy. It was another world and the virus loved it. The number of new infections was doubling every three days.
In the new world of state-sponsored protective custody, the number of new infections is inching up at a rate that would take 56 days to double. And the rate appears to be slowing yet further as the days pass.
We've spread out and cleaned up so successfully that the virus is running out of new bodies to infect. Has the Australian outbreak peaked? "It could be that it has," says the Nobel prize-winning immunologist Professor Peter Doherty. "We need to wait another week or two to see if we have underestimated the amount of community transmission."
Hot spots, yet undetected, could emerge, and need careful containment. "I don't know if you can put a ring of steel around Toorak and prevent people leaving," he quips about the disease vectors otherwise known as the Aspen ski set.
More seriously, Doherty suggests sampling sewage around the country, a method that has been used in the past to detect localised pockets of other infectious diseases, as one practical possibility. But, pending that, "It's wonderful that we have held this back and not a lot of people are dying."
That's no consolation for the 53 people who had died by yesterday afternoon, nor for their families and loved ones, of course. And more Australians will die before this epidemic ends.
But if Australia had remained in the carefree world of COVID denialism, we'd be well on our way to as many as 150,000 dead, based on the modelling conclusions released by Deputy Chief Medical Officer Paul Kelly in mid-March. As Queensland's Premier Annastacia Palaszczuk disclosed this week, the initial modelling for her state had predicted up to 30,000 dead in Queensland alone.
A few weeks ago, the experts were urging that Australia emulate Singapore, Taiwan or South Korea with their dramatic restrictions. The situation has been transformed.
"At the moment," the patron of the Doherty Institute at the University of Melbourne tells me, "we are right in the front rank, with New Zealand. It's pretty impressive. In some ways, that makes it even more difficult - how the hell do we ever get out of it? That's the bigger question."
This is a problem, but it is a problem of success. It could be worse. Look around the world.
Doherty literally wrote the book on plagues - Pandemics: What Everyone Needs to Know. But the last chapter is titled "Protecting Humanity from and during Pandemics". There is no chapter on "How to Exit a Pandemic". He has a couple of ideas.
But it's really a problem for the politicians: "I'm glad we're just a lab. We don't make policy. Our politicians have done somewhat better than I'd expected," he acknowledges, with just the faintest air of surprise at his own conclusion. "I guess it was a chance for rehabilitation for Scott Morrison," after his bushfire bungling. "I think he's broadly done the right thing. He listened to what people said and came up with reasonable compromises."
Credit where it's due. It's a Morrison motif to be slow and reluctant to act on emerging crises, hoping they will somehow pass him by. But when he did engage on the corona crisis, he mobilised Australia effectively. Has it been perfect? No. But no country has a perfect record in responding to a virulent new plague. Even countries that were held up as models: Singapore is fighting off a secondary flare-up right now, for instance.
And China, of course, is a self-parody of authoritarian impulses - vengeful censorship followed by crushing repression followed by gushing self-congratulation. But it worked, didn't it? Wuhan has been opened up, just this week, after successfully eradicating the virus, we're told.
I'd just point out that China's seat of government doesn't believe it - the city of Beijing is allowing entry of a maximum of 1000 people from Wuhan per day, and only after they've been tested for the virus within the seven days preceding entry. If the Chinese capital doesn't believe its own propaganda, why should anyone else?
And Australia's one-time models, Britain and America, have performed dreadfully. The defining difference? Where Boris Johnson and Donald Trump continued to behave as if the pandemic were merely a new vehicle for old politics, Morrison has set politics aside. To his very great credit.
"There are no blue teams or red teams," he said last week. "There are no more unions or bosses. There are just Australians now, that's all that matters."
And, by and large, he has acted accordingly. It was entirely his initiative to propose bringing the state and territory leaders together to form a so-called national cabinet, an unprecedented act of national co-ordination embracing governments Labor and Liberal.
The Prime Minister hasn't sought to dominate. The two biggest states, NSW and Victoria, pushed him hard to impose more controls on people's movements and he yielded to their demands. And he's accommodated different leaders and their own state priorities, while creating the opportunity for uniformity wherever possible. Some of the smaller states have closed their borders to the rest of the country, while NSW and Victoria have not, for instance. Yet the 1.5 metre social-distancing rule is observed everywhere.
Morrison chose not to include federal Opposition Leader Anthony Albanese in the national cabinet. And it's fair enough to restrict it to leaders of executive governments only. But Morrison has been prepared to consult the federal Labor leader on some of the big measures that needed to go through the Parliament. This has led to some intelligent improvements, and could have led to more. Labor pushed for weeks for the government to offer the wage subsidy that it eventually passed this week, for example.
And, again to his credit, Morrison agreed to a Labor proposal for a new scrutiny mechanism. Because Parliament has been suspended until August, Labor wanted a special Senate select committee to examine the government's epidemic responses. That committee was created this week. It will meet virtually while Parliament does not. The government will have a minority on the committee. It is to be chaired by Labor's Katy Gallagher.
Politics has not been cancelled. It continues, but it is now conducted civilly, co-operatively and with low intensity. For instance, Labor continues to propose that the government extend its wage subsidy to more casual workers. It's just that, when Morrison refused, Labor didn't try to block the bill in the Senate.
Politics continues, but with the emphasis on problem-solving rather than posturing. The noisy parlour games that so nauseated most voters for the past decade have been cancelled due to COVID-19.
Morrison's example of unifying leadership and the urgent, new emphasis on problem solving has allowed tremendous progress in record time. Just a few examples.
The unions and employers co-operated in rewriting the nation's industrial awards to increase flexibility. The private hospitals agreed to be included in the national pandemic response. The banks agreed to defer mortgage repayments for troubled borrowers. Manufacturing firms led by ResMed stepped forward to refashion production lines to make ventilators as a matter of urgency. The federal government agreed to make childcare free and subsidise the wages of some 6 million workers by $1500 a fortnight.
Most importantly, the overwhelming majority of the Australian people has responded to the crisis by accepting harsh, temporary limits to our freedoms. Would the people have surrendered rights and freedoms so readily if we'd seen our political leaders locked in their customary combat and petty vanities? I very much doubt it. The appearance and reality of national unity and urgent purpose has been important. Leaders leading - who knew it could be done?
Against his own instincts, Morrison has found a real purpose for his prime ministership. And he is delivering. The premiers and territory chief ministers, and the federal Labor leader Anthony Albanese, all get to share the credit for this successful national mobilisation. But ultimately it is Morrison who created the possibility for it, and continues to lead it.
In the Easter spirit of renewal, this deadly crisis has given Morrison the opportunity for redemption with a disenchanted people and he has seized it. Australia is succeeding. The Prime Minister's political resurrection is at hand.

One very real result: "Walk down our hospital wards and walk down the hospital wards of other countries and see the difference," says the president of the Australian Medical Association and GP Tony Bartone. "We have enormous idle capacity, overcapacity of ICU beds, ventilator beds, waiting and ready for a potential tide of COVID patients. That's a sign that we are ready. We aren't out of the woods yet but we are ready and compare that to the unfortunate situation elsewhere in the world."
Yesterday, 79 people in Australia were hospitalised in ICU beds and 38 were on ventilators. At the outset of the crisis, Australia had 2200 ventilator ICU beds. That's now doubled, according to Health Minister Greg Hunt, and on Thursday the Morrison government announced a $31 million contract for the local manufacture of another 2000 ventilators by July.
Morrison has looked ahead, too. By creating the National COVID-19 Co-ordination Committee under the chairmanship of former Fortescue Minerals chief Nev Power, Morrison has created a mechanism to bring the public and private sectors together to preserve jobs and maximise economic activity. The crisis has exposed Australia's economic vulnerabilities, including its missing manufacturing capabilities. The former head of Dow Chemical, Andrew Liveris, who's to work with the committee, told The Australian Financial Review this week: "Australia drank the free-trade juice and decided that off-shoring was OK. Well, that era is gone."
Against his own instincts, Morrison has found a real purpose for his prime ministership. The premiers and territory chief ministers, and Albanese, all get to share credit for this successful national mobilisation. But ultimately it is Morrison who created the possibility for it and continues to lead it.
In the Easter spirit of renewal, this deadly crisis has given Morrison the opportunity for redemption with a disenchanted people and he has seized it. Australia is succeeding.
The Prime Minister's political resurrection is at hand.

Full text: It is wrong to reduce the debate to a crude calculation - how many lives to sacrifice for the economy's sake.
Australia now has the foundations to withstand a long shock to its health and economy, but the road out of the crisis is easier to describe than navigate. Parliament has set a legislated deadline in the fight against the coronavirus by approving a six-month sunset clause for the new $130 billion JobKeeper wage subsidy.
The boost to confidence is significant when the economic support is combined with the sharp fall in new infections. But this virus sets its own timetable. While the politicians offer reassurance, the scientists urge vigilance. And it is worth heeding the science. The medical experts who advise the government expect this threat to continue in waves for years.
Even if we eradicate the disease in Australia, says James McCaw of the Doherty Institute and the University of Melbourne, the virus will spread around the world and easily return.
"That epidemic in some places may also go locally extinct after a small or a large wave," he says. "But it's almost implausible to imagine this virus going extinct globally, which means that it will be here to stay. It will become a part of our everyday life and the transition to it not being a huge driver of complete societal change is a very difficult thing to work through."
Complete societal change. Good luck putting a six-month deadline on that.
McCaw is a mathematical biologist. He and colleague Jodie McVernon, an epidemiologist, led the scientific work that underpinned government modelling released this week. The public modelling was underwhelming because it was based on overseas data from weeks ago, but this highlights the way huge decisions had to be made in rapid succession with limited data in recent weeks.
There are good questions about the work so far. Why is there no public modelling using local case numbers? When can we know whether closing a bar is more effective than shutting a school? The answers will take weeks.
The truth is the country's top scientists are working under immense pressure to focus a microscope on a moving target. Their advice this week, in a teleconference held after Scott Morrison released the modelling, was to be wary of assumptions about what happens next.
Morrison rejects a herd-immunity strategy - that the country could be resistant once infection reached perhaps 60 per cent of the population. And Health Minister Greg Hunt aims to keep it well below 2.9 million (the implied figure in the most benign scenario).
But they also know suppressing the virus for too long will drag out the economic damage. A point comes where too many restrictions work against the country as a whole, and calculations are made about the cost of saving lives.
"There is a real risk the societal cure we choose may do more harm," wrote Tony Blakely, a University of Melbourne professor of epidemiology (but not one of the Doherty Institute team) for The Conversation. "Lockdowns, for example, cause drops in GDP and increases in unemployment. That feeds back on to changes in suicide and heart disease. We need to quantify that, and weigh it up."
This will be the next phase in the debate. With more modelling about the shutdowns, rather than the virus alone, the argument will shift to easing the constraints. Inside the Morrison government, one worry is that the economic damage could kill more people than the virus. The solution is to relax the restrictions in stages and in different locations. But states and territories will make their own decisions.
It is tempting but misguided to debate a simple calculation - how many lives are worth sacrificing at the altar of the economy? - but the fact is most of the cost cannot be avoided. The world economy is in shock. Australia cannot stop the slump. Even so, nobody should be naive about the decisions political leaders must make. They reject herd immunity but don't promise eradication; they aim to manage deaths without overloading hospitals.
If the scientists are right, the recovery will not run as the politicians wish. While the Parliament's new law stops the wage subsidies on the last Sunday in September, the virus is a law unto itself. Even if the government halts the JobKeeper payment of $1500 a fortnight, can it really halve the JobSeeker payment of $1100 a fortnight - that is, return to the old Newstart rate - six months from now?
It seems unlikely. It would require Morrison to put jobless Australians back on the old subsistence rate when independent economist Saul Eslake forecasts the ranks of the unemployed will double to almost 1.4 million.
It will be Fortress Australia all this year and beyond.
McVernon and McCaw are trying to prepare Australians for a lasting change. McCaw cites the Spanish influenza of a century ago. It arrived in three waves over nine months but did not stop there. "For the next five or six years there were elevated levels of disease activity from that same virus as it ... became a part of our ecosystem," he says. "And then it was there for decades afterwards."
It is an ugly ecosystem. It is also
the future.

Warnings Easter could undo hard work

Full text: EXIT STRATEGY
Scott Morrison has warned that support measures for businesses and workers “cannot go on forever­”, with the national cabinet expected to consider a staggered reopening of the economy once the community spread of COVID-19 is contained.
The Prime Minister warned on Tuesday that Australians must “keep the tension in the cord” and stay at home over Easter to avoid fresh coronavirus outbreaks, as health authorities expressed concern over local transmission.
After releasing three scenarios based on Doherty Institute modelling, Mr Morrison said there was potential to begin a scaling-down of tough social and health measures­ through “trial-type relief­ of restrictions”.
With health experts suggesting Australia may have hit its peak infection­ rate, Mr Morrison said it was crucial to “hold the course”.
“It is providing us with much-needed time. We have so far avoided the horror scenarios that we have seen overseas. We cannot be complacent, we must keep the tension­ in the cord,” he said.
“This Easter weekend will be incredibly important. Stay at home. Failure to do so this weekend would completely undo everything we have achieved so far together, and potentially worse.
“We have already seen, in other countries, major festivals or events or holiday periods have been the spark for significant outbreaks.” The modelling, based on international data, did not include Aust­ralian-based projections for deaths and cases, with the overall number of infections and fatalities considered statistically low. Domestic data sets will be released within weeks as health officials track evidence of community transmission of the virus, with more than 600 cases locally acquired­ or under investigation.
Chief Medical Officer Brendan Murphy said the data showed that social and health restrictions were “working” but “we cannot be complacent”.
“If we in any way lose that rigour that the Australian community has embraced, particularly over Easter, it could all come undone,” Professor Murphy said.
“We’ve seen what this virus can do in a cruise ship, at a wedding. It can spread to 30, 50, several hundred people very quickly. We are flattening the curve. Complacency is our biggest risk.” Mr Morrison said “no one point of data” would determine when and where strict social-isolation measures would be eased, and that it would likely be a staggered exit strategy. “You will have some juris­dictions, some states and territories, that might be in a position to move (on easing restrictions) when others are not,” he said.
“And then we will learn through the experience of those states. We may see a number of trial-type relief of restrictions at some point in the future, and that will mean that in states like NSW and Victoria and southeast Queensland that are more impacted, that they will be able to take (their own) easing of restrictions with a bit more confidence.” Mr Morrison said support measures “cannot go on forever” and the national cabinet had to consider the ability to run the economy when devising approaches to managing the disease.
“The states and territories and I are very conscious that the path out of this is not just avoiding the peak (in new infections) but getting­ back to some sense of normality­,” he said.
Professor Murphy said there was “no clear path” through the epidemic, and that the chief medical officers would advise the nationa­l cabinet on a “range of alternati­ve scenarios”.
He said unlike the case of pandemi­c influenza, where the strategy was to control and contain the virus until a vaccine came along, “we don’t know if and when a vaccine will come for this virus”.
Professor Murphy said the Australian-based COVID-19 mod­el­ling, expected to be finalised within two weeks, would focus on local transmission of the virus.
“Our modellers have got this data and they are now doing real predictions of what might happen in different scenarios in different states,” he said.
“In the unmitigated scenario where you let the virus spread and do nothing … this is a horrendous scenario. It’s not real, it doesn’t reflect­ the current state in Aust­ralia, but you would see an ICU daily demand for new ICU beds of 35,000-plus.
“We have focal outbreaks. The one that worries us most of all is the community transmission in Sydney. Our current case rate is very, very low. Every death is a tragedy but our death rate is one of the lowest in the world so far.” The government modelling shows that an uncontrolled COVID-19 pandemic would overwhelm Australia’s health system for “many weeks”. Stricter measures would see up to 12 per cent of people infected and only 5 per cent requiring medical care.

Domestic data sets will be released within weeks as health officials track evidence of community transmission of the virus, with more than 600 cases locally acquired­ or under investigation.
Chief Medical Officer Brendan Murphy said the data showed that social and health restrictions were “working” but “we cannot be complacent”.
“If we in any way lose that rigour that the Australian community has embraced, particularly over Easter, it could all come undone,” Professor Murphy said.
“We’ve seen what this virus can do in a cruise ship, at a wedding. It can spread to 30, 50, several hundred people very quickly. We are flattening the curve. Complacency is our biggest risk.” Mr Morrison said “no one point of data” would determine when and where strict social-isolation measures would be eased, and that it would likely be a staggered exit strategy. “You will have some juris­dictions, some states and territories, that might be in a position to move (on easing restrictions) when others are not,” he said.
“And then we will learn through the experience of those states. We may see a number of trial-type relief of restrictions at some point in the future, and that will mean that in states like NSW and Victoria and southeast Queensland that are more impacted, that they will be able to take (their own) easing of restrictions with a bit more confidence.” Mr Morrison said support measures “cannot go on forever” and the national cabinet had to consider the ability to run the economy when devising approaches to managing the disease.
“The states and territories and I are very conscious that the path out of this is not just avoiding the peak (in new infections) but getting­ back to some sense of normality­,” he said.
Professor Murphy said there was “no clear path” through the epidemic, and that the chief medical officers would advise the nationa­l cabinet on a “range of alternati­ve scenarios”.
He said unlike the case of pandemi­c influenza, where the strategy was to control and contain the virus until a vaccine came along, “we don’t know if and when a vaccine will come for this virus”.
Professor Murphy said the Australian-based COVID-19 mod­el­ling, expected to be finalised within two weeks, would focus on local transmission of the virus.
“Our modellers have got this data and they are now doing real predictions of what might happen in different scenarios in different states,” he said.
“In the unmitigated scenario where you let the virus spread and do nothing … this is a horrendous scenario. It’s not real, it doesn’t reflect­ the current state in Aust­ralia, but you would see an ICU daily demand for new ICU beds of 35,000-plus.
“We have focal outbreaks. The one that worries us most of all is the community transmission in Sydney. Our current case rate is very, very low. Every death is a tragedy but our death rate is one of the lowest in the world so far.” The government modelling shows that an uncontrolled COVID-19 pandemic would overwhelm Australia’s health system for “many weeks”. Stricter measures would see up to 12 per cent of people infected and only 5 per cent requiring medical care.

Full text: "I don't want a parent to have to choose between feeding their kids and having their kids looked after or having their education being provided," Prime Minister Scott Morrison said ("Childcare now free for all workers", April 3). At least not until we "snap back" to the good old days when normal Coalition policy will resume and you are reminded to choose your parents more wisely. Late-stage capitalism isn't dead yet, comrades; it's merely hibernating.
Michael Thompson, North Bexley
There is much about the newly announced childcare package that is hard to understand. For those who still have jobs, the reason children are being pulled out of childcare is surely based on health rather than financial concerns. How does making it free change that? And those of us who sadly are out of work don't have the pressing need for childcare.
Children will miss the benefits of quality early learning, but that is happening right across the education spectrum.
Elyse Sainty, North Sydney
Release the modelling
When governments refuse to share information with the public, we cannot help but wonder what is being covered up ("'A matter of trust': Experts demand to see modelling", April 3). Surely there is no "commercial-in-confidence" argument against releasing the modelling. The freedom of information act requires an overriding public interest against disclosure; in the case of COVID-19, there is surely an overriding public interest for it. Release the modelling, PM.
Michael Davis, Balmain East
With the greatest of respect to those promoting the release of government modelling, since not everyone would understand the complexity of this information, perhaps it's better to leave it in the hands of those who are trained to understand it?
Randi Svensen, Wyong
Crave new world
Debt, post-virus, will be huge, but it should be seen as an opportunity to create a fairer society. The Jobseeker payments and free childcare should be retained ("Debt burden will hurt but spending is essential", April 3). To rein in debt, all the ways the better-off avoid their fair share of revenue, including trusts, franking credits and negative gearing, should be eliminated. Tax evasion should be severely penalised. Graduated land taxes should be introduced. All this would result in a fair go for all.
Andrew Macintosh, Cromer
Invisible enemies
It's been so refreshing to see Australian governments work collaboratively with a deep sense of purpose ("Recovery offers chance to drive down emissions", April 3). I hope all governments apply the same commitment and urgency to flattening the carbon emissions curve. The science tells us we are in serious trouble. COVID-19 has cast a light on inequalities and dangers. Let's transform our systems and flatten the emissions curve.
Christine Hannan, Gladesville
Time for a bush dance
Thank you, John Barilaro, for convincing Gladys Berejiklian that NSW does not end at Parramatta, Hornsby and Sutherland ("Win for Barilaro", April 3)
Robyn Lewis, Raglan
Barilaro justifies his new department as a "voice in government for people in the bush". However, all regions already have their own MPs to be their voice in government. In fact, the Nationals, with 9.6 per cent of the vote, are over-represented, with 14 per cent of the seats.
Peter Newberry, Randwick
More to the argument
Your article attracted a frenzy of malicious slander and an avalanche of unfounded and unfair attacks ( "Unswerving leadership", March 30). The report took a couple of lines about China and Chinese leadership out of my 1500-word article, which some may not agree with. I respect that right. Those two lines, however, did not capture the intent of my article. The intent was to point out the failures of the Morrison government in mishandling a sequence of crises.
First the drought, then the bushfires and now the coronavirus epidemic. To the horror of many, the federal and state governments allowed passengers to disembark the Ruby Princess without going through the most basic of quarantine measures. How was that possible? In the middle of a global crisis they fail to take the most basic of precautions.
This is the greatest act of incompetence ever committed. Quarantine is the sole responsibility of the Commonwealth, Minister Dutton and his Border Force. He
is accountable.Shaoquett Moselmane, member of the NSW Legislative Council
DIY protection
I am at a loss as to why we are being repeatedly advised to wear a mask only once we know we have the virus ("WHO reviews mask evidence", April 3). I realise there is a shortage, but the public should be innovative and make masks to wear themselves. Any barrier must be better than none.
Elizabeth Kroon, Randwick
The mums are all right
Disappointing to see, based on one anecdote, criticism of decisions to send children to school, apparently by "stay-at-home mums" (Letters, April 3). None of us know the circumstances of each household and the reasons for children attending. I would suggest there are many: large family in a tiny living space, babies and toddlers present, history of mental illness, domestic violence, single mothers working from home, caring for a disabled child, spouse or elderly parents - the list is endless. Can we all try to be less judgmental and kinder to each other at this difficult time.
Kerrie Shearston, Engadine
78 is the new 30
What's all this rubbish about over 70 year olds (Letters, April 3). I am 78 and regularly jog along the beach and climb steep hills. Other days (when I'm not doing yoga or learning French) I have a brisk walk for an hour.
I think the PM is getting us mixed up with the over-90s.
Christine Bridle, Dee Why
I am 81 and walk my energetic border collie each day for an hour. I would like to ask the PM to join us to see if he could keep up.
Robyn Hansen, Pennant Hills
The only exercise I enjoy is a walk in the bush. I am 80, live alone, access my garage from inside the house and drive to a point two kilometres away from any residence. I go for a walk, see nobody, hug a tree or smell a flower (hopefully unhugged or unsniffed by anyone with COVID-19) and return to my car, drive home, and use the internal access to my house. Am I being irresponsible?
Tony Dawson, Port Macquarie
I am also wearing a visible track in my back garden. I'm running 75 laps of my 70 metre course to give me a little over 5km. It feels like being a hamster on a wheel. I reverse direction every 10 laps to get a different view. Could be worse, I'm not stuck in a hotel room for 14 days.

Too slow of the mark?

Full text: Experts fear Australia has acted too cautiously to avert a horror scenario, but authorities say the country is in a better place than many. Deborah Snow reports.
In early December two leading Australian academics flew to Washington for a war-gaming exercise they'd designed, which they dubbed Exercise Pacific Eclipse. The timing was uncanny.
What they were about to simulate was what events might look like, nationally and globally, if a vicious pandemic broke out. Little did they know their timing would coincide with what was most likely the beginning of the COVID-19 breakout in China.
The event was high octane, supported by the US military's Indo-Pacific command and Arizona State University, with more than 200 participants, including senior government representatives from Australia, Britain, the United States and Canada.
The designers - Professor Raina MacIntyre, who heads biosecurity at the Kirby Institute in Sydney, and Associate Professor David Heslop, from the University of NSW - found "cascading failures" piling on top of each other as the multi-day exercise wore on and simulated supply chains broken down, with health and logistics systems overwhelmed.
"The exercise showed that societies are more fragile than perhaps we were expecting," says Heslop, from the university's school of public health and community medicine. "What you ended up with were strategic dilemmas all the time about where and how to allocate resources ... and how best to use very limited stockpiles."
Not far removed, in fact, from what is happening now in Spain, Italy and New York.
Heslop fears Australia has acted too cautiously and too slowly to avert some of those scenarios playing out here. "I feel we will look back in 20 years and recognise that we were unable to respond in a way which is rapid and most effective for this crisis," he says.
"I think we will look back and be critical of the way this has been handled. In coming months we will be looking for the answers as to how we got here because the impact is probably not yet in the national consciousness about what is going to unfold. That is best described as the most significant and profound national crisis - from a social, moral and medical perspective - that the nation has ever faced."
Yesterday, emerging from the latest national cabinet meeting with state and territory leaders, Prime Minister Scott Morrison remained relatively upbeat in the face of the pandemic, announcing tougher enforced quarantine for overseas arrivals and declaring "here in Australia it's a vital time, but we are getting on top of this".
"I would rather be in Australia now [doing what we are doing] than in any other country in the world today," he said.
The nation's health authorities continue to reassure the country that it is in a far better place than Italy, Spain or the US in terms of testing rates, death and intensive care rates and the extent of community spread.
Yet MacIntyre remains alarmed by Canberra's dogged determination to proceed by way of incremental steps - what officials call "scaleable, proportionate and sustainable" measures. "The window to have acted decisively has grown a lot smaller," she says. "Because we have only been testing people with symptoms, we remain on a similar trajectory to the United States and Italy."
NSW alone was heading towards 1500 cases yesterday, a threat exacerbated by the disgorging of thousands of untested passengers from the Ruby Princess cruise ship in Sydney the week before last (a blunder that has led to energetic finger-pointing between NSW Health and the Australian Border Force).
MacIntyre labels it a "debacle". "It means there will be people without symptoms who are transmitting it; it's going to be spreading silently throughout our community", she says. "You may not see a hit on the health system for four to six weeks, through a couple of incubation cycles. But that has compounded everything."
She takes little comfort from the fact that, so far, there are low numbers of COVID-19 patients in intensive care here. She and others expect that to change markedly in coming weeks, perhaps as soon as late April or early May, a fear underscored by an article in the Medical Journal of Australia on Thursday that said Australian hospitals do not now have the capacity to accommodate what they foresee might be the demand on intensive care beds.
Heslop feels significant numbers of Australian lives, "many thousands, into the tens of thousands" are at stake.
With medics and nurses fearful of shortages of personal protective equipment, MacIntyre alerted health authorities last June to the fact that 30 million respirators, or P2 masks (that filter out airborne particles), would be needed if there was a serious epidemic lasting six months in Sydney. It is understood this was nowhere near the amount the nation had stockpiled.
A Sydney University virologist, Associate Professor Tim Newsome, also doubts history will judge the country to have acted fast enough. "Will we look back and say we did enough? Our trajectory is looking disastrous at the moment."
He adds the proviso that "every country is different. Singapore is a city state, China has measures which it can deploy as an authoritarian government. But the social measures we've adopted up until this week have not, in European countries, led to a significant drop; they've had to go much stricter."
Chris Richardson, a director of Deloitte Access Economics, lays out stark numbers. "We have never before dealt with a problem that gets four times bigger every week," he says. "People don't understand the immensity of that. After five weeks the problem is already 1000 times bigger. After 10 weeks it's a million times bigger. When you have a geometric crisis, a decision taken today is four times more effective, four times more valuable, than the exact same decision taken a week later."
He does not envy our political leaders their agonising dilemma. "Every day you buy is a stunningly valuable commodity in terms of lives saved. But don't forget how awful the trade-off is - the knock-on of jobs lost, mental health, domestic violence. There are no good answers; every answer is terrible."
He says the case for more emphatic social and workplace restrictions remains open, but "the faster the acceleration in case numbers, the greater the weight of economic argument swinging towards that".
The walking-the-wire act the government is trying to pull off appeared to be under growing strain at several points this week.
Morrison has called it a "twin crisis: a crisis on a health front which is also causing a crisis in the economy. And both of them can be equally as deadly". Finance Minister Mathias Cormann says the government is trying to keep the economy in the "best least bad shape possible through this period".
The outcome on Tuesday night was a somewhat surreal media conference in which Morrison and Chief Health Officer Brendan Murphy laid out a long list of new measures - a laundry list, as some described it - designed to keep Australians at a distance from one another, while seeking to keep faint signs of life pulsing through the economy.
But the anomalies were puzzling. Five at a wedding, 10 at a funeral, no gatherings outdoors but 10 in a boot camp was OK. A whole raft of small businesses providing personal services shut down but not hairdressers, who could tend to their clients for 30 minutes and no more (a stricture relaxed a day later).
Murphy declared the intent was to "put restrictive measures in place without destroying life as we know it". But even while shopping centres and many non-essential retailers were allowed to stay open, customer traffic was falling off a cliff.
On top of the strictures placed on clubs, pubs, restaurants, cafes and events, Tuesday's proclamation tipped tens of thousands more into the ranks of the jobless with big-name retail brands including Just Jeans, Portmans, Athlete's Foot, Skechers, General Pants and others pulling down the shutters.
For many businesses it's become death by a thousand cuts, and there is a growing view, espoused by the likes of the Grattan Institute's incoming director Danielle Wood, that the economy might be better off with a New Zealand- or British-style full shutdown (barring essential services) for a defined period.
"There were a lot of people [economists included] early on dismissing the scale of this," Wood says. "They did not understand the health shock, what the exponential curve was going to mean for cases and hospital admissions."
But she believes a short sharp shock now would be a better way to go. "I think it's the uncertainty that is killing business right now," she says. "What we really need to do from an economic perspective is make sure that what is a temporary hit to income does not become a permanent hit to the productive capacity of the economy.
"That's an easier problem to address when you know that [a shutdown] is for a fixed, between six and eight weeks, period ... But if you want to talk about this rolling on for six months or more because you are just going for a halfway-house approach, I think that will see a lot of businesses go to the wall."
The founder and chief executive of hairdressing chain Just Cuts, Denis McFadden, put it bluntly on Thursday night: "We need the government, now, to shut us down!"
But Morrison again yesterday made clear that keeping people in jobs remains a top priority for himself and other leaders. In the "absence of a compelling health reason", he said, "I will fight for every job I can because I know that that job means something very important to that person and their family".
Inside the national cabinet of state and territory leaders that the Prime Minister presides over, tensions over strategy have at times broken into the open. The two biggest states, with by far the greater burden of cases, have been increasingly restive about the incrementalism of the social distancing measures adopted to date.
Victoria's Chief Medical Officer has openly signalled his wish for tougher action. NSW has signalled the time might come when it wants to do the same, though so far Premier Gladys Berejiklian has not revealed what the trigger for that might be, apart from saying it will depend on the rise in community transmission of the disease and how hospitals are coping. Yesterday NSW Labor leader Jodi McKay called on Berejiklian to press for a full lockdown at national cabinet or go it alone.
In Melbourne, the head of the prestigious Burnet Institute, Professor Brendan Crabb, broke his silence to tell the Herald: "I would urge speed, and the clarity that would bring to the messaging".
Referencing the horrors unfolding in Italy, where the death toll is now running at close to 10 per cent, he said: "you can't say we are on track to be Italy, but we don't know that we are not, either. My answer is to do everything you can, now, to buy yourself some time".
Measures more akin to the lockdowns in New Zealand and Europe would, he argues, buy precious time: time that could be spent drumming up more supplies of personal protective equipment, hundreds more vital ventilators, time for reserve health workforces to be trained up into intensive care roles, and time for the expanded testing regime announced on Thursday to get a better handle on the silent spread of the virus through community transmission.
The government rightly underscores that most cases are still coming in from overseas, whether through infected travellers or their direct contacts. But the proportion of cases with no clear origin of infection is growing. That is the ticking time bomb that has public health experts so concerned.
Our death rate is thus far mercifully low, at 0.37, or 13 deaths so far from about 3000 cases.
But for how long? It was chilling to hear New York Governor Andrew Cuomo say this week that he'd pleaded for 30,000 ventilators from federal authorities yet only 4000 were on the way. "You pick the 26,000 people who are going to die," he said, in a voice breaking with anger and frustration.
In Australia, cuts to elective surgery are a small taste of the ethical dilemmas likely to confront the health system in a few weeks' time. More than 1000 Australians, for instance, will now need to spend months more on dialysis, their hopes for kidney transplants on indefinite hold.
They're the kind of choices that no wants to make, and which drive the urgency of those who don't want governments to wait another day, let alone a week, a fortnight, or a month, to slam the brakes on the virus with every ounce of collective will.
A group of experts convened by the Group of Eight prestige Australian universities at the request of Chief Medical Officer Brendan Murphy a fortnight ago was asked to give the government its view of the severity of social distancing measures that should be adopted. The overwhelming majority in the group urged a strategy of "go now, go hard and go smart".
The "doubling time [of case detection] is approximately 1.6 days in Australia compared to 6 days in February" they wrote on March 22. "[This] is an indicator that the window for proactive intervention is very small. At this rate Australia could theoretically expect ... over 50,000 cases by Easter."
But "go now, go hard" did not find favour in Canberra. As Deputy Chief Medical Officer Paul Kelly later explained, what was at issue was "essentially two schools of thought". One was go hard, go fast, while the other was what he called a "scalable proportional response". And, he added, "I'm a scalable, proportional responder".
There are still many voices in the academic community who support the government's more phased approach, prominent among them the Australian National University's infectious diseases expert Peter Collignon.
There are others who confess, in private, to increasing unease about taking a contrary position publicly.
Yet most are agreed on one thing: there must be full transparency about the science and the evidence going forward to the Australian Health Protection Principal Committee (AHPPC), the peak body of government medical advisers.
Late this week the Australian Academy of Science said making this data open to all the nation's many experts, as had occurred in Britain and New Zealand, was critically important.
The academy's chief executive, Anna-Maria Arabia, says she has been fielding calls from her members across the country. They were, she says, "the most distinguished scientists in the nation, who want to and can be doing more but they don't have any insight into what is informing and underpinning the government's decisions and modelling".
Much of that confidential modelling is being provided to the AHPPC by the Doherty Institute in Melbourne, but its director, Sharon Lewin, says the decision to publish it has to be one for the Commonwealth, as the contractor that commissioned the work. A Department of Health spokesperson said "we are not releasing any specific modelling at this time".
Chris Richardson has no doubt what's at stake for the country's leaders. "The decisions being made at the moment run the risk of saving, or losing, more lives in Australia than did the big battles in the world wars. And history will most likely throw stones, rather than remember the sheer speed of this crisis."

NSW alone was heading towards 1500 cases yesterday, a threat exacerbated by the disgorging of thousands of untested passengers from the Ruby Princess cruise ship in Sydney the week before last.
MacIntyre labels it a debacle. "It means there will be people without symptoms who are transmitting it. It's going to be spreading silently throughout our community," she warns. "You may not see a hit on the health system for four to six weeks, through a couple of incubation cycles. But that has compounded everything."
So she takes little comfort from the fact that so far, there are low numbers of COVID-19 patients in intensive care here. She and others expect that to change markedly in coming weeks, perhaps as soon as late April or early May, a fear underscored by an article in the Medical Journal of Australia on Thursday warning Australian hospitals do not have the capacity to accommodate what they foresee might be the demand on intensive care beds.
Heslop feels that significant numbers of Australian lives - "many thousands, into the tens of thousands" - are now at stake.
With medics and nurses fearful of shortages of personal protective equipment, MacIntyre alerted health authorities last June to the fact that 30 million respirators, or P2 masks (which filter out airborne particles) would be needed if there was a serious epidemic lasting six months in Sydney. It is understood this was nowhere near the amount the nation had stockpiled.
Sydney University virologist associate professor Tim Newsome also doubts history will judge the country to have acted fast enough. "Will we look back and say we did enough? Our trajectory is looking disastrous."
He adds the proviso that "every country is different. Singapore is a city state, China has measures which it can deploy as an authoritarian government. But the social measures we've adopted up until this week have not, in European countries, led to a significant drop; they've had to go much stricter."
Chris Richardson, a director of Deloitte Access Economics, lays out stark numbers. "We have never before dealt with a problem that gets four times bigger every week," he says. "People don't understand the immensity of that. After five weeks, the problem is already 1000 times bigger. After 10 weeks, it's a million times bigger. When you have a geometric crisis, a decision taken today is four times more effective, four times more valuable, than the exact same decision taken a week later."
He does not envy our political leaders. "Every day you buy is a stunningly valuable commodity in terms of lives saved. But don't forget how awful the trade-off is, the knock-on of jobs lost, mental health, domestic violence. There are no good answers, every answer is terrible."
The high-wire act the government is trying to pull off has appeared to be under growing strain this week.
Morrison has declared it a "twin crisis, a crisis on a health front which is also causing a crisis in the economy".
The outcome on Tuesday was a somewhat surreal press conference in which Morrison and Chief Health Officer Brendan Murphy laid out a long list of new measures designed to keep Australians at a distance from one another, while seeking to keep faint signs of life pulsing through the economy.
But the anomalies were puzzling. Five at a wedding, 10 at a funeral, no gatherings outdoors but 10 in a boot camp was OK. A raft of small businesses providing personal services shut down but not hairdressers, who could tend to their clients for 30 minutes and no more (a stricture relaxed a day later).
Murphy declared the intent was to "put restrictive measures in place without destroying life as we know it". But while shopping centres and many retailers were allowed to stay open, customer traffic was falling off a cliff.
On top of the strictures placed on pubs, restaurants, cafes and events, Tuesday's proclamation tipped tens of thousands more into the ranks of jobless.
There is a growing view, espoused by the likes of the Grattan Institute's incoming director, Danielle Wood, that the economy might be better off with a New Zealand or British-style full shutdown (barring essential services) for a defined period. "There were a lot of people [economists included] early on dismissing the scale of this. They did not understand the health shock, what the exponential curve was going to mean for cases and hospital admissions."
But Wood believes a short sharp shock now would be a better way to go. "I think it's the uncertainty that is killing business right now," she says. "What we really need to do from an economic perspective is make sure that what is a temporary hit to income does not become a permanent hit to the productive capacity of the economy.
"That's an easier problem to address when you know that [a shutdown] is for a fixed, between six and eight weeks, period ... But if you want to talk about this rolling on for six months or more because you are just going for a halfway-house approach, I think that will see a lot of businesses go to the wall."
Founder and CEO of hairdressing chain Just Cuts, Denis McFadden, put it bluntly on Thursday night: "We need the government, now, to shut us down!"
But yesterday, Morrison again made clear that keeping people in jobs is a priority. In the "absence of a compelling health reason", he said, "I will fight for every job I can because I know that that job means something very important to that person and their family."
Inside the national cabinet, tensions have at times broken into the open. The two biggest states, with the greatest burden of cases, have been increasingly restive about the incrementalism of the social-distancing measures.
Victoria's Chief Medical Officer has openly flagged his wish for tougher action. NSW has signalled the time might come when it wants to do the same, though so far Premier Gladys Berejiklian has not revealed what the trigger might be, apart from saying it would depend on the rise in community transmission of the disease and how hospitals were coping. Yesterday, NSW Labor leader Jodi McKay called on Berejiklian to press for a full lockdown or go it alone.
In Melbourne, the head of the Burnet Institute, Professor Brendan Crabb, told The Age that "I would urge speed, and the clarity that would bring to the messaging". Referencing the horrors unfolding in Italy, where the death toll is close to 10 per cent, he said: "You can't say we are on track to be Italy, but we don't know that we are not, either. My answer is to do everything you can now to buy yourself some time."
Measures more akin to the lockdowns in New Zealand and Europe would, he argues, buy precious time: time that could be spent drumming up supplies of personal protective equipment and ventilators, for reserve health workforces to be trained up into intensive care roles and for the expanded testing regime announced on Thursday to get a better handle on the spread of the virus.
The government rightly underscores that most cases are still coming in from overseas. But the proportion of cases with no clear origin is growing. That is the ticking time bomb that has public health experts so concerned.
Our death rate is thus far mercifully low, at 0.37, or 13 deaths so far from about 3000 cases.
But for how long? It was chilling to hear New York Governor Andrew Cuomo saying this week that he'd pleaded for 30,000 ventilators from federal authorities yet only 4000 were on the way. "You pick the 26,000 people who are going to die," he said, in a voice breaking with anger and frustration.
In Australia, cuts to elective surgery are a small taste of the dilemmas likely to confront the health system in a few weeks. More than 1000 Australians, for instance, will now need to spend months more on dialysis, their hopes for kidney transplants on hold.
A group of experts convened by the Group of Eight prestige Australian universities at the request of Murphy a fortnight ago were asked to give the government their view of the severity of social-distancing measures that should be adopted. The overwhelming majority urged a strategy of "go now, go hard and go smart".
The "doubling time [of case detection] is approximately 1.6 days in Australia compared to six days in February", they wrote on March 22. "[This] is an indicator that the window for proactive intervention is very small. At this rate, Australia could theoretically expect ... over 50,000 cases by Easter."
But "go now, go hard" did not find favour in Canberra. As Deputy Chief Medical Officer Paul Kelly later explained, what was at issue was "essentially two schools of thought". One was go hard, go fast, while the other was what he called a scalable proportional response. "I'm a scalable, proportional responder," he added.
There are still many voices in the academic community who support the government's more phased approach, prominent among them Australian National University infectious diseases expert Peter Collignon.
There are others who confess, in private, to increasing unease about taking a contrary position publicly.
Yet most are agreed on one thing: there must be full transparency about the science and the evidence going forward to the Australian Health Protection Principal Committee, the peak body of government medical advisers.
Late this week, the Australian Academy of Science said making this data open to all the nation's many experts, as had occurred in Britain and New Zealand, was critical.
Chief executive Anna-Maria Arabia says she has been fielding calls from her members across the country. They were, she says, "the most distinguished scientists in the nation, who want to and can be doing more but they don't have any insight into what is informing and underpinning the government's decisions and modelling".
Much of that confidential modelling is being provided to the AHPPC by the Doherty Institute in Melbourne but its director, Sharon Lewin, says the decision to release it is one for the Commonwealth which commissioned the work. A Department of Health spokesperson said: "We are not releasing any specific modelling at this time."
Chris Richardson has no doubt what's at stake for the country's leaders. "The decisions being made at the moment run the risk of saving, or losing, more lives in Australia than did the big battles in the world wars. And history will most likely throw stones, rather than remembering the sheer speed of this crisis," he said.
