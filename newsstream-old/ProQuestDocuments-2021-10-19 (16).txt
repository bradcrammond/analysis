Full text: THE Territory’s top doctor has said borders will not open until everyone in the Territory is protected.
In an emotional press conference on Monday, chief health officer Hugh Heggie pleaded with remote communities to get vaccinated.
“Our 80 per cent is about everybody. I can’t mandate individuals to get vaccinated but I just encourage people to because the consequences are lives lost,” Dr Heggie said.
While swallowing his tears Dr Heggie said it would be “our old people” who would be lost to Covid-19.
The plea comes after the Queensland government announced it would open its border to NSW and Victoria in the coming weeks but Indigenous leaders in the Territory have warned authorities that a similar move could be dire for remote communities.
In response, Dr Heggie said the Northern Territory would not open its border until the entire community was protected and that included remote Aboriginal communities where vaccination rates remain low.
“These are our most vulnerable people because there is a lot of vaccination resistance, serious resistance,” he said.
Dr Heggie was clear that despite the government signing on to a national plan, the Territory would not open its borders before the community was properly protected.
“The Doherty modelling has been adjusted to include our younger population, which means we are less likely to be eligible to open our borders,” he said.
Dr Heggie warned the Territory had enjoyed a largely Covid-free life to date but the risk of opening the border too early would cause serious harm to the oldest living cultures on earth. “People who aren’t vaccinated won’t be permitted to travel on to Aboriginal lands, or even live on ­Aboriginal lands,” he said.

Early shot at extra freedom in balance

Full text: EXTRA freedoms could come as soon as next week with Premier Dominic Perrottet not ruling out bringing forward the easing of restrictions if NSW passes the 80 per cent vaccination threshold on Monday.
NSW is currently projected to have 80 per cent of over-16 residents double-dosed as early as Sunday.
If the target is met before the end of the weekend, NSW residents will wait as little as 24 hours to get their reward, which includes being able to welcome 20 people in the home, the ­return of community sport for vaccinated people, and regional travel.
The double-dose vaccination rate on Tuesday reached 75.2 per cent. Across NSW, 90.8 per cent of over 16s have had at least one Covid vaccine dose. Under the current road map, if the 80 per cent double dose target is hit on Monday, October 18, those freedoms would be delayed a week.
However, Mr Perrottet has not ruled out easing ­restrictions earlier than planned if the figure is hit on Monday or Tuesday.
“We will continue to ­consider the wider health impacts across all of NSW of reopening at 80 per cent,” he said.
But provisions allowing regional travel under the next tranche of freedoms could be a stumbling block.
It’s understood the speed of vaccination in Greater Sydney compared to slower rates in some areas of ­regional NSW will be considered in cabinet discussions about reopening.
Infectious diseases expert Paul Griffin said a one week gap between freedoms at 70 and 80 per cent was not too hasty. “What we’ve seen is a Freedom Day unlike what the UK saw, (in Australia) it has been a gradual increase, particularly focusing on more freedoms for vaccin­ated people,” he said.
“I wouldn’t be surprised if we didn’t see a huge spike in cases that people are concerned about.
“I’m hopeful there will be some learned behaviours where people get tested, wear their mask and wash their hands.” Case numbers continued to dwindle with 360 new infections from almost 89,000 tests reported on Tuesday. On current modelling, NSW will hit a 90 per cent double dose rate on October 26, indicating that the immunisation rate could be very close to 100 per cent by the time the state opens for all residents on December 1. When restrictions are eased at the 80 per cent threshold, masks will not be required in the office, drinking while standing will be allowed, and a 20-person cap on hospitality bookings may be removed. Vaccinated people will be allowed to travel anywhere in the state.

Hope at last after ‘pretty dark time’

Full text: For months it remained a goal ­almost too distant to consider, too fanciful to savour. But the excitement built in Sydney on Sunday, so much so that a handful of pubs vowed to open at midnight to ring in their freedom with a cele­bratory tipple.
Gyms limbered up to once again pipe dance music through their studios. Salon owners polished their shiny surfaces, and across the city thousands of retailers were being brought out of ­stasis, eager to reawaken.
Nearly four months since the city’s longest and harshest lockdown was imposed, Monday’s wind-back of government decrees marked the first of a three-phase ending to the restrictions ushered in with the outbreak of the Delta variant.
From Monday, people who can demonstrate immunity will be able to once again share meals in cafes, return to cinemas and welcome up to 10 guests into their home. Weddings and funerals will return with density limits of 100 people, while socialising in groups of up to 30 will be allowable outdoors.
Monica Schnieper, owner of Pelle Designer Footwear and Accessories, in Sydney’s inner-city Paddington, said the lockdown had nearly ended her business of 25 years, but described a palpable excitement having returned to the suburb in recent days.
“For the last week, people have been walking past and looking in the shop window, knocking on the door, eager to come in,” Ms ­Schnieper said.
“There’s a lot of excitement on the street, which fills me with hope after a pretty dark time.” To accommodate window-shoppers, Ms Schnieper placed two chairs on the footpath outside her store to give prospective customers a chance to try on shoes.
“I made a couple of important sales that way,” she added. Monday’s easing of restrictions similarly ends a requirement for mask-wearing outdoors - except for hospitality staff - while also jettisoning the mobility limits that confined residents to within a 5km radius of their homes.
Forecasts of driving rain did not appear to dampen spirits. The Glenmore Hotel in The Rocks is preparing to seat 400 guests on its first day of opening, its rooftop booked out with 100 people.
“We’re expecting big things,” said Lincoln Baker, the venue’s manager. Covid-19 case numbers are predicted to climb substantially off the back of the increased mobility, but officials remain committed to easing restrictions further once 80 per cent of the state is vaccinated, and again at 90 per cent.
As of Sunday, some 73.5 per cent of NSW residents had received both doses of a vaccine, with 90.3 per cent having received one dose, according to federal data.
NSW Premier Dominic Perrottet said Monday’s reopening was a “first step” towards mending the state’s battered economy, but he acknowledged these steps would test his government’s ­decision-making and become a subject of scrutiny across the country.
He spent part of his press briefing on Sunday wiping beer off his face after tapping a keg at a Marsden Park brewery in the city’s northwest that partially exploded.
He urged NSW residents to treat each other with “kindness and respect” during the transition to a vaccine-mandated economy.
“As we reopen after more than 100 days, we ask everyone to treat staff with kindness and respect when they ask you to check in or see your vaccination certificate,” Mr Perrottet said.
Modelling by the Burnet Institute released by the NSW government in September predicted a caseload peak of up to 2000 infections a day and intensive care units overrun in the state’s public hospitals.
Contingency plans were established to prepare for these scenarios but as of Sunday the forecasts did not appear to have played out, with cases continuing to decline alongside patients requiring ICU.
NSW Health said 477 fresh cases of the virus were recorded on Saturday, with 177 people being treated in intensive care.
Both are substantially lower than the numbers recorded across the past four weeks.
In Sydney’s inner-west Balmain, shop owner Peta Palomino, who runs clothing store Blokes Balmain, said local businesses were banking on a rapid return of customers. “I had planned to reopen on Tuesday, but customers have been calling asking when they can come in again, so I’ve decided to open up a day earlier,” she said, adding that some had resorted to unusual measures to purchase clothes in the meantime.
“I recently had a case where a long-term customer came to the shop front desperate for new shorts. He decided he would try them on over his trousers in the street. His wife was very amused and he bought three pairs.” Nearby, Joanne Farah’s toy shop The Little Treasure Chest was forced to close and hand-­deliver parcels to customers to reduce costs. The widowed mother of three said she had balanced homeschooling with the demands of the business, but it had struggled to shift to online sales.
“Business has been lost to bigger online companies during lockdown, so I’m hoping as soon as we open up, people come back and pick up their toys,” Ms Farah said.
Among attractions scheduled to return is Taronga Zoo, which will welcome its first guests from Friday, and whose staff have been working through the lockdown to maintain the health and wellbeing of the animals.
Brad Mackenzie, supervisor of the Marine Mammal Unit, said the zoo’s seals were among those that continued performing during this period for this purpose. “They actually didn’t stop training. Training for us and the seals is an important part of their mental and physical health,” he said

Full text: State stuck in the slow lane MASS vaccination and reopening is a race and, unacceptably, it is one Victoria is losing badly.
While New South Wales was given a major boost with extra vaccination supplies during the height of its outbreak, Victoria has now seen a surge in supplies and must continue to close the gap in reaching our 70 and 80 per cent jab targets as quickly as possible.
Victorians are doing their part, coming forward in terrific numbers to embrace vaccinations and the recent (albeit belated) decision to cut the Pfizer two-dose cycle will hasten our pace. In addition, the aggressive mandate now imposed for all authorised workers to get their first jab by October 15 will significantly bolster momentum.
Having this week crossed the 50 per cent double-dose threshold, the quicker more people get vaccinated the quicker Victoria’s alarming numbers of daily Covid cases begin to head in the right direction to lower levels. There is evidence, based on greater Sydney’s outbreak trajectory that once more than 50 per cent had been fully vaccinated, the infection curve will also bend markedly here.
But the vaccination rate, while vitally important, is only part of the story why Victoria is trailing in the race behind NSW. As the two biggest and comparatively similar states, there should be no reason each has vastly different road maps to reopening. In NSW, even more so now under yesterday’s decisions by newly-appointed Premier Dominic Perrottet, the rewards for hitting the 70 per cent fully vaccinated target across the over-16 and adult population is a universe from what Victorians are being told to accept.
Premier Daniel Andrews has for almost 20 months refused to release the primary health advice on which lockdowns and restrictions are based.
Other than the Burnet Institute modelling for reopening, Victorians are told to simply toe the line, abide by a laundry list of restrictions, stay at home, don’t travel further than 15km and lump it.
In NSW, kindergarten, year 1 and year 12 students return to face-to-face learning on October 18, with all other years returning one week later on October 25. In Victoria, while some VCE and a small number of other students return on October 6, prep, years 1 and 2 will spend only part weeks at school from October 18 and, even at 70 per cent vaccinated (forecast for October 26), all school students will only return to face-to-face learning “at least part-time”.
Masks are still required indoors in NSW at 70 per cent vaccination rates, but indoors and outdoors in this state at the same level. Even more starkly, in NSW at 70 per cent, 10 people can visit a home while none are allowed here. At 70 per cent, NSW hospitality opens to capped density limits indoors but none indoors here.
At the same vax level, 30 fully vaccinated people can gather outdoors in NSW, and just 10 here.
And at 80 per cent double-dose, NSW removes marks for office workers indoors while the Victorian road map doesn’t even consider it.
So while the race to vaccinate will play out in coming weeks — as NSW exits lockdown next Monday with Victoria almost three weeks later — the race to some normality has already been lost. Victorians will be looking north of the Murray next week and asking why life is so very different.
The difference is one state government, that in NSW, chooses to reward those in the community who are fully vaccinated with higher freedoms returned faster. It is a government confident in re-opening.
The difference is the Andrews government continues an overcautious approach not seen in any developed nation anywhere — precisely the reason why Victoria has a slow-lane road map, the world’s longest lockdown and a community crushed like few others.
Soccer’s culture of abuse IN the cloistered, high-pressure environment of professional and competitive sport, those in positions of power can sometimes exploit and injure and, somehow, expect impunity.
This week, the Herald Sun lifted the lid on shocking allegations that a decade of toxic abuse festered within Australian women's soccer.
Former Matilda Renaye Iserief has now added a series of fresh complaints that bullying, abuse, body shaming and intimidation was ignored by football authorities.
Iserief joined Australian Olympian Lisa De Vanna in alleging football’s peak body, Football Federation Australia (now Football Australia) had failed to investigate a series of incidents that left some players with eating disorders and others self harming. Football Australia has now announced an independent process to review the allegations and code culture.
It is unacceptable that over a 10 year period Iserief sent letters to FFA raising concerns and allegations of improper conduct by some high performance coaches without any action being taken. Soccer is not alone in seeing instances where coaching staff, who can make or break careers, engage in destructive, predatory abuse. Sadly, FA is not the only organisation with a track record of failing to act. It must do so now, with authority and transparency.

Full text: The word “Bam” is ­rarely deployed by state Premiers, but Dominic Perrottet was justified in its use on yesterday. “Bam. We’ve hit 70 per cent of over-16s double vaccinated in NSW,” the new Premier announced online.
“This is great news and big step closer to a full reopening and a proper summer.” It definitely is good news – so much so that reopening should not now be needlessly delayed, not even until Monday.
After all, just last month then-Treasurer Perrottet revealed that chief health officer Dr Kerry Chant was perfectly content to commence reopening NSW as soon as 70 per cent vaccination were reached.
“She’s very happy at 70 per cent,” Perrottet said, “and ­obviously we will have further restrictions released at the 80 per cent mark.” So why the delay? Why wait until Monday for certain restrictions to be lifted when we’ve already had our “bam” moment?
According to newly sworn in Deputy Premier Paul Toole, a delay until Monday is necessary because various businesses are not ready for a more rapid ­return to commercial activity.
“They’ve got to ensure that they’ve actually got the supplies, they’ve got the produce,” the Deputy Premier said.
But many businesses are able to reopen at a moment’s notice. There seems little reason to hold them back simply because other businesses may take a few days to get back up to speed.
Back in August, the Doherty Institute, whose modelling informs the government’s tactics, also cited 70 per cent as a safe point for reopening.
“There is light at the end of the tunnel,” the Institute reported. “Once we achieve 70-80 per cent vaccination we will see less transmission of Covid-19 and fewer people with severe illness, and therefore fewer hospitalisations and deaths.” Let’s get moving, then, and quit our dependence on arbitrarily-selected, bureaucracy-enforced timelines.
As well, there are practical benefits to reopening now ­rather than next week. As Professor Peter Collingnon points out, restoring freedoms now will prevent people from congregating in large numbers on Monday and Tuesday night. “Visiting your family on a Sunday afternoon in the backyard is much safer than visiting them on Monday night inside,” he said. There you have it. Bam.

'Research completely misrepresented to support a point'

Full text: TREATMENT OF ABORIGINES MICHAEL Mansell (The Examiner, September 27) completely misrepresents my research in my books on the Tasmanian Aborigines published in 1995 and 2012.
I am dismayed that he has taken very small and highly selective quotes out of context to support his claim that I had either deliberately ignored or underplayed the high levels of extreme violence experienced by Tasmanian Aboriginal women and girls at the hands of sealing men on the Bass Strait Islands.
It is pointless to compare the levels of extreme violence experienced by Tasmanian Aboriginal women and girls at the hands of sealers and settlers in Tasmania between 1800 and 1840. What I can say is that on mainland Tasmania and Flinders Island genocidal policies were put in place by the settlers to destroy the Tasmanian Aboriginal people and these policies succeeded.
In the sealing community, however, Tasmanian Aboriginal women and girls survived in sufficient numbers to enable the emergence of the modern Tasmanian Aboriginal community today.
Twenty years ago Keith Windschuttle used highly selective quotes from my 1995 book to claim that I deliberately overplayed the levels of settler violence towards the Tasmanian Aboriginal people in the Black War.
It is disappointing that Mr Mansell uses the same tactic to claim that I deliberately underplayed sealer violence. I expected better from the man whose career as a leader of the modern Tasmanian Aboriginal community I championed in both my books.
Lyndall Ryan, The Hill. OPENING TASMANIA'S BORDERS HAVING read Tasmanian Premier Peter Gutwein's press statement on Wednesday about not reopening the border until the vaccination rate reaches 90 per cent, I can see that his decision is not political but is based on scientific modelling by the Doherty Institute.
This modelling shows that opening earlier would put the safety and health of Tasmanians at risk as well as cause undue pressure on Tasmania's health care system. Mr Gutwein has done a first-class job keeping the virus out of the state. My father, who lives in Launceston, will be turning 100 next month.
As much as I would like to be with him to celebrate the day, I can see that the health and safety of all Tasmanians come first.
When it is safe to do so which will probably be in January next year, even though I am double vaccinated, I will be able to travel from Wagga Wagga in NSW to celebrate with my father.
Michael Bayles, Wagga Wagga. SUPERMARKET PRODUCT BRANDS TO stop confusion and to add honesty to the branding of products; all generic, supermarket house-brand products should have a reasonably bold statement on them stating that "this product is packed for whoever the supermarket name is". Customers would then know, no matter what the fancy label says, that it is another generic house brand product, and the decision to buy can be rationalised against all other brands.
This will also limit price gouging of one generic product against the next which has a more colourful label, but the same ingredients.
John Whinnen, Swansea. FESTIVALE NUMBERS PROBLEM IT makes absolute sense to not have Festivale until the entire state has been vaccinated. One only needs to take note of that which has taken place on the mainland. It is also hoped that no infections have been caused by the latest football event held in a state which luckily, has been COVID-19 free.
Don Davey, Launceston. NATIONAL VACCINE HESITANCY A SAFER and more democratic approach to addressing vaccine hesitancy, and therefore increasing voluntary vaccine uptake, lies in better education, addressing specific and legitimate concerns that people may hold, and promoting genuine informed consent.
It does not lie in censoring differing opinions or removing rights and civil liberties that are fundamental in a democratic nation.
It certainly does not lie in the use of highly coercive, undemocratic and unethical mandates such as no jab, - no job.
Rod Force, Sandy Bay.

Barr calls out 'vicious' debate over reopening

Full text: Chief Minister Andrew Barr has called the public debate on reopening locked down Australian states the nastiest of his career, as health experts praised the territory's response to the latest outbreak.
The ACT recorded 31 new cases in the 24 hours to 8pm Wednesday and 17 of the cases have been linked to previous cases.
Six cases were in quarantine for their entire infectious period and at least 17 cases were in the community for part of their infectious period.
Ten patients with COVID-19 were in Canberra's hospitals and three were in intensive care on ventilation. Another patient entered ICU after the 8pm cutoff time.
Health experts say the ACT remains on the right track despite persistent double digit case numbers.
Melbourne University biostatistics professor James McCaw leads one of seven academic groups supporting the Doherty Institute's modelling plan for safe reopening.
"[I] would state that the ACT has managed the outbreak very well, with stable case numbers for over a month," he told The Canberra Times.
"The recent increases in daily reported cases are of course a concern, but do not necessarily indicate a further deterioration. Vaccination coverage in the ACT is strong and increasing rapidly which will further support control over the coming weeks."
On Thursday, Mr Barr told reporters the nation had torn itself apart over whether to open at 70 per cent or 80 per cent vaccination rates.
"We've got media outlets running agendas, it's been a vicious public debate. Awful things have been said about public health officials about politicians. It's been the nastiest public debate I've experienced in my career in politics, worse than marriage equality, worse than voluntary assisted dying."
Coordinator-general of Office for Mental Health and Wellbeing Dr Elizabeth Moore said psychological distress had increased in the ACT, especially in young people and people aged 35-40 years.
She said people should make time for self care including physical exercise, managing their sleep patterns and staying connected.

Budget $80bn better than tip

Publication info: The Cairns Post ; Cairns, Qld. [Cairns, Qld]. 01 Oct 2021: 10.

Full text: TREASURER Josh Frydenberg on Thursday handed down the final budget outcome, which was $80bn better than expected.
Mr Frydenberg said the budget deficit was $134.2bn in the 2020-21 financial year, a $27bn improvement on the most recent forecast given in May and $79.5bn better than flagged in October.
He conceded, however, that the final budget outcome did not take into account the impact the Delta variant has had on the economy.
“We recognise that since this final budget outcome, the economy has been hit by the Delta variant,” he said.
“But with the vaccination rates fast approaching the 70 and 80 per cent targets, restrictions will be eased, and what these numbers confirm is that when restrictions are eased, the Australian economy bounces back.” Finance Minister Simon Birmingham acknowledged there would be some pressure on next year’s federal budget.
“These results underscore the reality that the best way for us to continue to secure stronger results for the budget bottom line is to continue to focus on having a stronger economy,” he said.
“These unexpected and unplanned additional (lockdown) payments, obviously, will place some pressure on the current budget.” Mr Frydenberg credited the improvement to more people being in work and off government support.
“Since May of last year, more than 1 million new jobs have been created, and the unemployment rate has fallen below 5 per cent for the first time in a decade,” Mr Frydenberg said.
Net federal debt was $592.2bn – about 28.6 per cent of Australia’s gross domestic product – which was $25.3bn lower than forecast in May.
It comes as the government announced it had reached agreements with NSW, Victoria and the ACT to taper support for businesses in each jurisdiction as vaccination rates approached 80 per cent.
“It is consistent with the announcement that we made yesterday with respect to the Covid-19 Disaster Payment and aligned with the support measures that the government has put in place with the national plan that was agreed at national cabinet,” the Treasurer said.
Asked if the government should be ceasing support as case numbers increased, Mr Frydenberg reiterated that restrictions must be lifted in accordance with the national plan.
“Doherty modelling has said that there will need to be cases and indeed, there will continue tragically to be some deaths even as vaccination rates increased from 70 to 80 per cent,” he said. “If it is not 80 per cent double dose vaccination rate, we bring to an end the Covid Disaster Payment and business support payment, when is it?”

Full text: TREASURER Josh Frydenberg on Thursday handed down the final budget outcome, which was $80bn better than expected.
Mr Frydenberg said the budget deficit was $134.2bn in the 2020-21 financial year, a $27bn improvement on the most recent forecast given in May and $79.5bn better than flagged in October.
He conceded, however, that the final budget outcome did not take into account the impact the Delta variant has had on the economy.
“We recognise that since this final budget outcome, the economy has been hit by the Delta variant,” he said.
“But with the vaccination rates fast approaching the 70 and 80 per cent targets, restrictions will be eased, and what these numbers confirm is that when restrictions are eased, the Australian economy bounces back.” Finance Minister Simon Birmingham acknowledged there would be some pressure on next year’s federal budget.
“These results underscore the reality that the best way for us to continue to secure stronger results for the budget bottom line is to continue to focus on having a stronger economy,” he said.
“These unexpected and unplanned additional (lockdown) payments, obviously, will place some pressure on the current budget.” Mr Frydenberg credited the improvement to more people being in work and off government support.
“Since May of last year, more than 1 million new jobs have been created, and the unemployment rate has fallen below 5 per cent for the first time in a decade,” Mr Frydenberg said.
Net federal debt was $592.2bn – about 28.6 per cent of Australia’s gross domestic product – which was $25.3bn lower than forecast in May.
It comes as the government announced it had reached agreements with NSW, Victoria and the ACT to taper support for businesses in each jurisdiction as vaccination rates approached 80 per cent.
“It is consistent with the announcement that we made yesterday with respect to the Covid-19 Disaster Payment and aligned with the support measures that the government has put in place with the national plan that was agreed at national cabinet,” the Treasurer said.
Asked if the government should be ceasing support as case numbers increased, Mr Frydenberg reiterated that restrictions must be lifted in accordance with the national plan.
“Doherty modelling has said that there will need to be cases and indeed, there will continue tragically to be some deaths even as vaccination rates increased from 70 to 80 per cent,” he said. “If it is not 80 per cent double dose vaccination rate, we bring to an end the Covid Disaster Payment and business support payment, when is it?”

Full text: Mr Frydenberg on Thursday handed down the government’s final budget outcome, telling reporters the budget deficit was $134.2bn in the 2020-21 financial year.
The figure is a $27bn improvement on the most recent forecast given in May and $79.5bn better than flagged in October, but Mr Frydenberg conceded the final budget outcome did not take into account the impact the Delta variant has had on the economy.
“We recognise that since this final budget outcome, the economy has been hit by the Delta variant,” he said.
“But with the vaccination rates fast approaching the 70 and 80 per cent targets, restrictions will be eased, and what these numbers confirm is that when restrictions are eased, the Australian economy bounces back.”

“These results underscore the reality that the best way for us to continue to secure stronger results for the budget bottom line is to continue to focus on having a stronger economy,” he said.
“These unexpected and unplanned additional (lockdown) payments, obviously, will place some pressure on the current budget.”
Mr Frydenberg credited the improvement in the bottom line to more people being in work and off government support.
“Since May of last year, more than one million new jobs have been created, and the unemployment rate has fallen below 5 per cent for the first time in a decade.”
Net federal debt was $592.2bn - about 28.6 per cent of Australia’s gross domestic product - which was $25.3bn lower than forecast in May.
It comes as the government announced it had reached agreements with NSW, Victoria and the ACT to taper support for businesses in each jurisdiction as vaccination rates approached 80 per cent.

“Doherty modelling has said that there will need to be cases and indeed, there will continue tragically to be some deaths even as vaccination rates increased from 70 to 80 per cent,” he said.
“But at that time, lockdowns become unlikely and in the event that they are put in place, they are very temporary and very targeted.
“If it is not 80 per cent double dose vaccination rate, we bring to an end the Covid Disaster Payment and business support payment, when is it?
“When is it that the government can stop spending $1.5bn per week on these emergency support measures and when is it that people can get their lives back and the lockdowns can be lifted?”

No fines for businesses letting in unvaxxed customers

Full text: BUSINESSES are unlikely to face fines if they let unvaccin­ated people inside their venues, the NSW Health Minister says.
Under the reopening road map, people will need to demonstrate their vaccination status to enter venues such as restaurants and pubs.
But hospitality operators are unlikely to face fines if a patron lies about their vaccination status to gain entry. “The venue is unlikely at this point to be fined, it’s not on the agenda at this point,” Health Minister Brad Hazzard said.
“At this stage that’s not part of the public health orders.” Police Commissioner Mick Fuller earlier said that officers won’t be actively checking vaccination status at venues.
“We will not be walking through restaurants and cafes and pubs checking if people are double vaccinated,” he told 2GB.  Mr Hazzard said police will have “no choice but to enforce” vaccination rules for patrons.
NSW reported 863 new cases on Tuesday, fewer than Victoria’s 867. Seven more people died in NSW, including two people who contracted the virus in hospital.
There were 1155 people in hospital with Covid on Tuesday, including 213 in intensive care. Hospitalisation rates are slightly lower than predicted in modelling commissioned by the state government, with authorities hopeful that there won’t be as much pressure on the system next month as was predicted.
The state surpassed Italy on first-dose vaccination rates for over 16s on Tuesday, with 86.2 per cent of people having ­received at least one dose.
The amount of people 16 and over fully vaccinated grew to 61.7 per cent. Mr Hazzard’s message to businesses that they are unlikely to be fined for letting in unvaccinated patrons seemed at odds with statements from Premier Gladys Berejiklian, who said on Monday that business owners would face similar compliance requirements as they did before the Delta lockdown. Currently, businesses are ­required to take “reasonable steps” to ensure people have checked in using QR codes.

Full text: WHEN I was young, I’d race home from school to watch The Three ­Stooges. Now I tune into the six o’clock news to watch the Anna, Yvette and Steven Show.
I don’t know who is writing their material, but post-Covid, a career scripting comedy in Hollywood beckons.
My favourite Stooge is Steven who had them rolling in the aisles when he announced that Scott Morrison “gave Delta to Sydney and now they’re trying to gift it to us”.
“I’ve been out a lot in Queensland and talking to Queenslanders, and what they tell me is that Delta is the gift they do not want from Scott ­Morrison,” he said.
Just why the PM gave the virus to the unsuspecting people of Sydney, where his family lives, is unclear as are his motives in trying to gift it to Queenslanders. Perhaps all will be ­revealed in an upcoming episode.
Steven might turn in some knee-slapping performances, but Anna has been giving him a run for his money, treating us to a hilarious performance in what is now known as The Gonna Episode.
“Where are you gonna go? Are you gonna go to India?“ she asked a perplexed media throng when ­questioned on the issue of Queenslanders travelling overseas, saying she couldn’t understand why anyone would want to do so. To escape The Three Stooges, maybe?
Viewers were left wondering just what particular Indian experience the Premier had endured that had caused her to suggest that it would be madness to entertain it as a destination. A dodgy curry, perhaps.
India, then, is out, which is a shame as the Taj Mahal alone is worth the trip, but what of those Queenslanders wanting to travel to the UK, Europe, the US and Canada where vaccinated and tested Aussies are now welcome? No comment on that one.
Then we had The Free Footy Episode. While Scott Morrison was allegedly trying to give away Delta with no takers, Yvette showed him what freebies were all about by offering free footy tickets to those being vaccinated.
The Three Stooges were great cream pie throwers and at this point, a metaphorical pie got Yvette right between the eyes when it was pointed out the such an inducement was illegal.
“It seems to be the better we do, the more we get criticised,” she moaned, “better” being one of the slowest vaccination rollouts in the country. Just why Health Minister D’Ath did not bother to check with the Therapeutic Goods Administration before hatching this bizarre scheme was not revealed.
Enter Stooge Steven, whipping out a pie and tossing it in the general direction of Canberra while declaring that the free footy ban was all part of a Scott Morrison conspiracy aimed at undermining the best efforts of him and his fellow Stooges. “It seems to me the Prime Minister’s office’s campaign against Queensland and Queenslanders got truly bizarre yesterday, it jumped the shark,” he said.
Those unfamiliar with this piscatorial reference should note that it relates to television script writing and is when writers resort to desperate measures to maintain viewer interest.
It comes as no surprise that the Deputy Premier is familiar with it for when it comes to desperate measures, The Three Stooges have been jumping tanks full of Great Whites since the pandemic began.
Those unvaccinated persons who missed out on the free footy tickets will, we can presume, now remain unvaccinated and wait until the next government stunt – free beer, free cooked chooks, boxed editions of every episode of The Three Stooges autographed by Anna, Yvette and Steven. Watch this space.
Anna was the next Stooge to cop the cream pie treatment, this one hurled by the ABC when it fact-checked her claim that Doherty Institute modelling predicted that: “Even with 70 per cent of the population vaccinated, 80 people will die each day from Covid once the outbreak reaches six months after it started. That is 2240 who will die each month.” Ms Palaszczuk’s claim, the ABC said, was misleading. It was an extreme outcome with low probability with the death toll figures unlikely even in extreme conditions, it said.
That any responsible person would deliberately misrepresent statistics in a way that was likely to alarm the population beggars belief.
Jumping the shark, anyone?
A friend announced last week that he and his wife had been granted an exemption to travel overseas. “What reason did you give?” I asked. “I said I had lost all faith in the political process in Australia and wanted to leave,” he said. As I watch The Three Stooges, I know how he felt.

Full text: Stop twisting freedom plan THE need for a national road map out of lockdowns and beyond the stifling pandemic restrictions speaks for itself.
Australia must race towards reopening with a unity of vision and clear vaccination targets to trigger relaxation of restrictions, to hand back greater normality for lives and livelihoods and to reopen domestic borders.
Way back at the start of July, national cabinet announced work to formulate a four-phase national plan to move beyond blunt lockdowns when vaccination targets were achieved. That plan was agreed to by the leaders of all states and territories a month later and officially outlined by Prime Minister Scott Morrison.
At last, after 18 months of states going their own way responding to the pandemic in a fractured federation, a uniform plan was cemented.
Essentially, the national plan set 70 and then 80 per cent vaccination targets in all states and territories to reopen the languishing business sector, tourism and travel and to hand back lives and autonomy to people. At the time, this cohesive plan was greeted with optimism.
Yet the past two months has seen various premiers tear away at the agreement, constantly moving the goalposts on how states would reopen to others, dependent on Covid infection rates.
Yesterday, NSW Premier Gladys Berejiklian invented a 90 per cent vaccination target for full easing of restrictions, particularly the elimination of constraints on unvaccinated people, nightclubs reopened and indoor masks abandoned. While a range of NSW municiplaities have reached 85 per cent first-dose levels, and there may be some confidence of getting to 90, ad-libbing on the national contract severely undermines it.
Queensland Premier Annastacia Palaszczuk and West Australian Premier Mark McGowan have also been guilty of stepping away, both threatening to remain hermit states with hard borders if other jurisdictions meet vaccine goals but continue to pose infection risks.
The simple fact is Covid Delta is now endemic in Australia and was always going to be so. Reducing spread by various levels of lockdown, incrementally eased at the earliest opportunity while accelerating vaccination rates is the only way forward.
For WA and Qld, pretending an invisible virus can be kept out of their states indefinitely may win votes but is demonstrably wrong and irresponsible. By pulling up the drawbridge, both states are lagging in vaccination rates because their communities have been given false hope that border closure equates to immunity.
The national plan, fully agreed to on August 6 and based on Doherty Institute modelling, committed all states and territories to “Phase B” restriction settings once 70 per cent of the Australian population 16 years and older was fully vaccinated and “Phase C” once the 80 per cent threshold was met.
Phase B sets out minimising cases through “ongoing low-level restrictions and effective track and trace,” calls for easing of “restrictions on vaccinated residents” and says “lockdowns less likely but possible.” Phase C, at 80 per cent, requires “minimum ongoing baseline restrictions ... without lockdowns,” relieves “vaccinated residents from all domestic restrictions” and insists lockdowns can only be applied in a “highly targeted format”. The final step, Phase D, opens international borders and looks to “live with Covid … consistent with influenza or other infectious diseases” through the use of booster vaccines if deemed necessary. Nowhere in the national plan is the 90 per cent rate that Berejiklian announced yesterday.
Obviously, the higher the percentage of Australians vaccinated the better and, indeed, the nation will have over coming months enough doses to vaccinate every willing recipient.
NSW received an additional 340,000 doses of Pfizer to combat its major outbreak from July and has been granted an advantage in rollout speed and coverage courtesy of it being swamped with virus.
That does not give Berejiklian the prerogative to unilaterally bolt on extra vaccination targets — particularly given most other developed nations reopened at 70 per cent vaccination rates.
Since February 2020, throughout this national emergency, states have fallen back on insular squabbling precisely at a time when unified resolve and leadership was required. Whether that be Premier Daniel Andrews’s belated acceptance of the reality of Delta, hubris in inflicting protracted lockdowns in the pursuit of zero cases or the isolationism of Qld and WA, it is time all premiers and chief ministers re-read the national plan agreement they signed up to. Almost 26 million Australians have been asked to suffer the loss of daily liberties and control over personal lives — families have been separated and milestone celebrations forgone. Businesses, particularly in hospitality, retail, tourism and entertainment have been pulverised and many destroyed. The trauma has been especially magnified in Victoria, as Melbourne looks next week to become the most locked-down city in the world. Yet while most Australians continue to suffer, particularly in Melbourne and Sydney, our state leaders tinker, undermine and constantly add new hurdles to the one clear way we have to regain some sense of normality.

Full text: Annastacia Palaszczuk will keep Queensland’s border closed to NSW and Victoria until authorities in those states lift most of their Covid-19 health restrictions.
Christmas reunion plans were plunged into doubt last week when the Queensland Premier said lifting border restrictions even when 80 per cent of Australians were fully vaccinated would be a “backward” step.
State and territory leaders have already abandoned a national cabinet agreement made in July to exempt fully vaccinated Australians “from all domestic restrictions” once 80 per cent of the population older than 16 was double-dosed.
Senior Palaszczuk government officials have toldThe Australian the border would stay shut until interstate health officials decided it was safe to mirror Queensland’s relative freedoms. There was “no way” Ms Palaszczuk would reopen to states that were still subjected to tough restrictions, one said.
“Why would we reopen to states that still plan on having pretty strict restrictions even once they reach 80 per cent?” they said. “Obviously their chief health officers do not think it is safe for a lot of people to gather even at that higher vaccination rate.” Under NSW and Victoria’s road maps, 10 people will be ­allowed in private homes once 80 per cent of the eligible population is double-dosed.
In Queensland, where only 45 per cent of the eligible population is vaccinated, 100 people can congregate in homes, masks are not required outdoors, dancing is allowed in nightclubs and venues can operate at one person per 2sq m.
NSW looks to hit 90 per cent fully vaccinated by December 1, which is when nightclubs will reopen and limits on private gatherings will be scrapped.
Ms Palaszczuk said Queenslanders were “enjoying doing normal things” and the pressure on businesses was caused by lockdowns in NSW and Victoria.
She has repeatedly refused to reveal whether she would alter restrictions once her state reached the 80 per cent inoculation target, insisting she needed to look at updated Doherty Institute modelling. “Hopefully we’ll get that on Friday at national cabinet and the Prime Minister will release all of that publicly so everyone can see it,” Ms Palaszczuk said.
Interim modelling to be released on Friday will discuss reopening the international border and how easing domestic restrictions would affect groups such as Indigenous Australians and school students.
Queensland’s chief health officer, Jeannette Young, told tourism operators on Monday to prepare for borders to be opened by Christmas, but she said deciding when to do so was “not a straightforward process”. “You can’t just pick something and say it leads to something else, you’ve got to look at all of the ­issues,” she said. “The more people who are vaccinated, the more likely we can remove those last ­restrictions.” In addition to vaccine rates, Dr Young would also consider deaths, hospitalisations, the number of people in ICU and what restrictions were imposed by other chief health officers.
Deputy Premier Steven Miles said most Queenslanders were happy with current restrictions when they considered “the risk of having to go back to that kind of lockdown compared with the fantastic lifestyle we are experiencing here”.
“No one has ever suggested that the border should be closed at Christmas, but what we have said is that it should be opened at the right time and that we don’t yet have the information that tells us what that right time is,“ he said.
“Christmas is still 90 days away, a lot can change in that ­period of time.”

Delta delay ‘to set economic recovery back by six months’

Author: Commins, Patrick

Full text: With NSW, Victorian and ACT authorities focused on the health implications of their recently announced road maps out of severe restrictions, KPMG chief economist Brendan Rynne said policymakers needed to understand what was at stake for workers and businesses from lingering stay-at-home orders.
“The conversations our leaders are having with the population around the different paths of reopening are predominantly focusing on the health consequences of these different transition paths,” Dr Rynne said. “What we are highlighting is there are economic consequences as well, and the trade-offs need to be understood.”
The KPMG analysis gauged the potential economic impact of health authorities’ decisions under three scenarios: a fast reopening once vaccination rates reach 70 per cent; a slower scenario where lockdowns lift only incrementally from 80 per cent inoculation levels; and a base case, broadly following the Doherty thresholds.
Dr Rynne said reopening plans announced in NSW on Monday approximated something a little faster than the base case, and the Victorian road map a little slower. “If a fast 70 per cent vaccination threshold was adopted as the trigger point for wholesale withdrawal of lockdown restrictions, then we would expect economic activity to bounce back in a similar manner to what occurred after the first lockdown in the middle of 2020.”
In contrast, waiting until vaccination rates reached 80 per cent before beginning to slowly ease Delta restrictions would delay the post-lockdown economic bounce from the December quarter to the June quarter of next year, with “the economy treading water” for six months.
He estimated that real GDP was set to contract by 2.6 per cent in the September quarter – well below the 4 per cent decline anticipated by leading bank economists.
Under the base case, the easing of restrictions would drive a 3 per cent rebound in GDP over the final three months of this year against the fast reopening scenario, which suggests the bounce in output would be 3.9 per cent.
If reopening was delayed and staggered, the economy would grow by 1.6 per cent in the fourth quarter, and by 1.2 per cent over the following three months, putting off a more substantial rebound of 2.7 per cent until the June quarter of 2022.
Dr Rynne said a further risk in a delayed reopening scenario – not captured in his modelling – was for a higher number of business failures. “I think there is a very much a sense that small businesses are holding on – and they are just holding on,” he said.
The modelling revealed the key consequence of a delayed reopening would be higher unemployment than otherwise.
Dr Rynne forecast the unemployment rate would lift from what economists have said was an artificially low 4.5 per cent in Aug­ust, to 5.6 per cent in coming months. Under a faster reopening, the key jobless measure would be below 5 per cent by the March quarter of next year, versus languishing at close to 5.5 per cent under the slowest scenario. In the base case, unemployment would be 5.1 per cent by early next year.
By the middle of 2022, under a slow reopening, unemployment would be stuck around 5.2 per cent – still above pre-Covid levels of 5.1 – versus 4.7 per cent in the fast scenario and 4.9 per cent in the base case.

Full text: VICTORIANS caught at coronavirus ­exposure sites could avoid staying home for two weeks, with isolation rules to be overhauled as vaccination targets are reached and the state reopens.
State and federal authorities are considering relaxing isolation requirements for those who are fully vaccinated, while targeting contact tracing resources at controlling outbreaks in high-risk areas. The Doherty Institute, which is modelling the impact of new containment models, has backed the shift and told the national cabinet to move away from the existing “zero tolerance” approach.

Reward for a jab done … one day

Full text: THE state government has launched a new advertising ­assault telling Queenslanders to get vaccinated so they can travel again, but still can’t say what the pass mark will be for opening the borders.
The campaign launched on Saturday urges Queenslanders to get the jab “for the love of family, friends and time ­together, of brunches and long lunches and travel and adventure” in a desperate push to reach a target of at least 80 per cent fully vaccinated.
But the Palaszczuk government is still facing widespread criticism over its reluctance to confirm whether Queenslanders will be able to travel ­interstate for Christmas – ­regardless of vaccination rates.
Deputy Premier Steven Miles said Queenslanders were enjoying far more freedom than many of their southern counterparts, like Delta-ravaged NSW and Victoria, and did not believe they wanted to “let Covid in for Christmas”.
“A lot of this discussion about the Queensland border is pretty academic, because the kind of the people that you’re saying should be allowed across our border are currently locked down in their homes by their own state governments,” Mr Miles said yesterday.
The government has said it would wait until this week’s national cabinet meeting on Friday for updated modelling from the Doherty Institute before it made any decisions around whether Queensland’s borders would be open in time for the festive period.
Speaking on breakfast television on Sunday, Prime Minister Scott Morrison said it was within the control of state leaders to decide whether families could be reunited for Christmas.
“I think that puts the big challenge on the premiers … there comes a time when you’ve got to honour the arrangement you’ve made with the Australian people, and that is when you get to 80 per cent vaccination, it’s very clear that you can start opening up,” he said.
When asked when Queenslanders could expect an answer on what percentage of the population would need to be fully vaccinated before borders would open, Mr Miles accused the PM of attempting to “distract” from his own problems.
“Frankly, I think the Prime Minister should be more focused on the health and wellbeing of people in NSW and Victoria, and on international affairs than what might happen in Queensland in a few months’ time,” he said.
“This bloke should focus on his job. You know, diplomacy is his job. International trade is his job. Vaccination should be his job, but we’re doing it. Quarantine should have been his job, but we’re doing it” Queensland recorded no new cases of Covid on Sunday.
Chief health officer Jeannette Young again assured Queenslanders that all three vaccines – Pfizer, Moderna and AstraZeneca – were safe to use and in plentiful supply. She pleaded with the vaccine hesitant to seek health ­advice from professionals.

Full text: Doctors say Victoria's intensive care units would be forced to ration specialist staff and have them treat many more patients to cope if hundreds of seriously ill people hit hospitals by mid-December as predicted.
The forecast came as Premier Daniel Andrews walked back a pledge to establish 4000 extra ICU beds, saying a scenario where thousands of beds were required at the Melbourne Convention and Exhibition Centre was "not what success looks like".
Burnet Institute modelling estimates that by mid-December there could be between 462 and 953 coronavirus patients needing intensive care, probably exceeding the system's capacity.
Intensive care leaders said caring for 700 patients at once would be "incredibly hard".

Full text: QUEENSLAND may not reopen to the rest of Australia until it gets to a 90 per cent vaccination rate.
Despite NSW and Victoria outlining a road map to opening up based on an 80 per cent double vaccination rate, Queensland is yet to commit to any blueprint going forward.
The state’s population is on track to hit the 80 per cent ­double jab mark no later than December 7, giving hope for a more normal Christmas period. But now some Labor insiders are claiming that a 90 per cent threshold is being weighed up.
Chief health officer Dr ­Jeannette Young last week publicly said that she would like to see 90 per cent of Queenslanders vaccinated.
Tasmania’s director of public health has publicly indicated he would like a 90 per cent vaccination rate in his state before its borders were fully opened the rest of the country.
Premier Annastacia Palaszczuk said it was too early to speculate on the 90 per cent target. “We are waiting on ­updates – Doherty Institute modelling – in two weeks before we can make those decisions,” Ms Palaszczuk said.
As well as Dr Young’s caution, politics is driving a shift in thinking to a higher threshold – with Labor polling finding that Queenslanders do not want the borders opened if it means a mass Delta variant outbreak, such as has happened in NSW and Victoria.
The polling makes two key findings. The first is that Queenslanders are angry at the so-called exemptions unit, which is regarded as “heartless’’, for refusing to allow Queenslanders back into the state, but it gives special treatment to the wives and girlfriends of footballers.
However, the key finding is that Queenslanders love their liberty and freedoms, and the fact coronavirus is under control and that is a key driver in the government’s thinking. Tourism leaders are incensed at the prospect of Queensland being closed for the Christmas-New Year ­holidays.

Full text: QUEENSLAND may not reopen to the rest of Australia until it gets to a 90 per cent vaccination rate.
Despite NSW and Victoria outlining a road map to opening up based on an 80 per cent double vaccination rate, Queensland is yet to commit to any blueprint going forward.
The state’s population is on track to hit the 80 per cent ­double jab mark no later than December 7, giving hope for a more normal Christmas period. But now some Labor insiders are claiming that a 90 per cent threshold is being weighed up.
Chief health officer Dr ­Jeannette Young last week publicly said that she would like to see 90 per cent of Queenslanders vaccinated.
Tasmania’s director of public health has publicly indicated he would like a 90 per cent vaccination rate in his state before its borders were fully opened the rest of the country.
Premier Annastacia Palaszczuk said it was too early to speculate on the 90 per cent target. “We are waiting on ­updates – Doherty Institute modelling – in two weeks before we can make those decisions,” Ms Palaszczuk said.
As well as Dr Young’s caution, politics is driving a shift in thinking to a higher threshold – with Labor polling finding that Queenslanders do not want the borders opened if it means a mass Delta variant outbreak, such as has happened in NSW and Victoria.
The polling makes two key findings. The first is that Queenslanders are angry at the so-called exemptions unit, which is regarded as “heartless’’, for refusing to allow Queenslanders back into the state, but it gives special treatment to the wives and girlfriends of footballers.
However, the key finding is that Queenslanders love their liberty and freedoms, and the fact coronavirus is under control and that is a key driver in the government’s thinking. Tourism leaders are incensed at the prospect of Queensland being closed for the Christmas-New Year ­holidays.

Full text: South-west hospitality owners have expressed disbelief and frustration at the minimal changes announced in the state roadmap on Sunday.
The state government gave very little relief to regional Victoria in the plan, despite many areas having had no new cases of COVID-19 for more than a year.
Under the first stage of the roadmap - when the state hits 80 per cent first dose vaccine coverage for those over 16 - hospitality venues will be able to increase outdoor patronage from 20 people to 30, but the indoor cap of 10 will remain the same.
Further relaxations aren't scheduled until the state passes 70 per cent fully vaccinated, which is over five weeks away according to government modelling from the Burnet Institute.
Timboon's Railway View Hotel owner Karen Flett said there wasn't much she could say about the announcement.
"There's not much in there at all for us, is there?"
She said the lack of changes was disheartening, but there was no choice except to "keep on keeping on".
"It's not fair on anyone; on the patrons, or on the businesses," she said.
Diana McLean, owner of the Junction Hotel in Allansford, said nothing would change for them after the announcement.
"We're just continuing with our takeaways... and trying to alleviate as many costs as we can," she said.
More significant changes are scheduled for October 26, when hospitality in regional Victoria could have 30 patrons indoors and 100 outside. All patrons would have to be fully vaccinated.

States told to keep 'medium' restrictions

Publication info: Sydney Morning Herald ; Sydney, N.S.W. [Sydney, N.S.W]. 18 Sep 2021: 11.

Full text: State and territory leaders have been told restrictions including stay-at-home orders and a ban on any travel should remain in areas of concern where thousands of cases are reported each day even when 70 per cent of the eligible population is vaccinated.
Concerns were raised in yesterday's national cabinet meeting about whether the health systems in NSW and Victoria could cope with the ongoing outbreaks. The bulk of the country's more than 1800 cases yesterday were in those states, and there have been 12,519 cases reported over the past week.
So far 45.4 per cent of the eligible population aged 16 and over is fully vaccinated and 70.5 per cent of that population has had one dose, passing a "significant and important" national milestone, Health Minister Greg Hunt said.
"My hope is that everybody, everybody who has not yet taken the vaccine will come forward over the coming days and weeks, and there's sufficient vaccine for every Australian before the end of October, if not significantly earlier," he said.
Under the national plan, restrictions can begin to be eased once 70 per cent of the eligible population is fully vaccinated, and more freedoms will be introduced once 80 per cent have received their second dose.
But a sensitivity analysis of the modelling that informed the plan, conducted by the Doherty Institute and presented to state and territory leaders yesterday, found that if daily case numbers were in the thousands it would be prudent to keep "medium" public health safety measures in place in locations of concern until that 80 per cent target is reached.
The Doherty Institute defines medium public health measures as the measures that were in effect in Sydney on July 1 this year, which include no interstate travel, stay at home except for essential purposes, work from home if possible, but some limited seating for hospitality venues.
The analysis also showed, however, that the original plan to begin transitioning at 70 per cent fully vaccinated remained broadly robust even if an outbreak started with thousands of cases.
Given the pace of the vaccination rollout, the federal government estimates it will take two weeks for the double-dosed vaccination rate to climb from 70 per cent to 80 per cent.
As most of the country begins to look towards opening up, all state and territory leaders agreed to integrate vaccination certificates with check-in apps so greater freedoms can be considered for the fully vaccinated.
More states have also begun trials of home quarantine as Prime Minister Scott Morrison said the hotel quarantine system had a "use-by date", and national cabinet discussed making vaccinations mandatory for all healthcare workers across the country.
GPs in every state and territory bar NSW, Victoria and the ACT can book over-60s for Pfizer vaccines, and President of the Royal Australian College of General Practitioners Dr Karen Price said the federal government should make that a national guideline.
"That would be really smart," she said, but emphasised it was important Pfizer bookings for over-60s were not prioritised over other vulnerable groups. "What I hope it means is there's a turning of the tide in terms of supply."
The supply of mRNA vaccines is rapidly increasing. This month's doses have been doubled from initial forecasts to roughly 11 million doses of both the Pfizer and Moderna vaccines.
Across the country, about 470,000 people aged 60 and up are yet to have a first dose.
A spokesman from Operation COVID Shield said the national policy - which states AstraZeneca is the preferred vaccine for people aged 60 and over, and Pfizer should be used in people aged under 60 - hasn't changed, but as long as primary care providers were not turning down priority patients (including 12- to 15-year-olds and pregnant women) they could match state guidelines on vaccinations.

Doctors in Queensland, Western Australia, the Northern Territory, South Australia and Tasmania will soon be able to administer Pfizer to patients aged 60 and over after those states changed their eligibility criteria. Across the country, roughly 470,000 people aged 60 and up are yet to have a first dose.

After Queensland announced it would open up Pfizer doses in its state-run hubs for over-60s, the state's Health Minister Yvette D'Ath said the government wanted to make sure people had choices.
"The Morrison government promised people over 60 that later in the year they would be given a choice of vaccines," she told reporters yesterday. With Matt Dennien

Full text: PREMIERS Daniel Andrews and Gladys Berejiklian have teamed up in national cabinet to pour cold water on the plan by their Queensland counterpart Annastacia Palaszczuk to give Pfizer vaccines to the over-60s.
Instead the pair argued they would wait at least ­another fortnight while other priority groups were given Pfizer.
The refusal is in contrast to Queensland’s plan to make Pfizer available immediately to people over 60, a move that has been criticised because it may see AstraZeneca vaccines go to waste.
Friday afternoon’s national cabinet meeting ticked off on a national code on boarding school students that will allow them and their parents and carers – as well as boarding school staff – to travel across borders between school and home.
Regional Education Minister Bridget McKenzie called on all jurisdictions to quickly ­implement the plan to help 23,000 students and their families travel during the school holidays.
“While border closures and intrastate travel restrictions have helped contain the spread of Covid-19, it has unintentionally left some boarding students isolated and unable to receive the support and care of family, causing additional stress and anxiety,” she said.
“Today’s decision is a win for commonsense.” National cabinet also received an update from Professor Jodie McVernon, of the Doherty Institute, and top bureaucrat Phil Gaetjens on ­reopening modelling. It confirmed Doherty’s analysis that the Delta variant could be managed when ­between 70 and 80 per cent of the population aged over 16 had been fully vaccinated.

Full text: Donato calls for restrictions to go at 80 per cent vaccinations
All COVID restrictions should be lifted when 80 per cent of the local population is double vaccinated.
That's the view of the member for Orange Phil Donato who has called on the state government to provide a more-detailed roadmap for the future once people are vaccinated.
Mr Donato said the restrictions should be lifted across the state once 80 per cent of NSW residents were double-dosed.
But he said if a local government area reached that level before other areas, residents should then be allowed full freedom from restrictions.
And he said the government should not be able to reintroduce health restrictions once the 80 per cent target was reached.
"The government says they 'intend to open up further freedoms' when hit 80 per cent double-dose vaccinations, flagging there will be ongoing health order restrictions beyond that point," he said.
"Freedom doesn't come with terms and conditions or strings attached. We don't want them to keep moving the goalposts."
Mr Donato said the government also needed to clarify what restrictions would be lifted when 70 per cent vaccinations were reached.
"We now know (the premier's) 70 per cent goal is no real freedom at all, with many restrictions remaining," he said.
Mr Donato said community sport would still not be allowed and businesses would face social distancing restrictions limiting how many people they could have at their venues depending on the floor size.
He said an Orange hairdresser had told him they would not re-open with those limits in place.
Mr Donato said he did not support a COVID passport, which keeps restrictions in place for the unjabbed.
He said it was up to people to decide whether to get vaccinated and those that didn't get vaccinated ran the risk of getting sick or dying.
"I'm not a supporter of vaccine passports," he said. "The reality of policing it is going to be very difficult."
Mr Donato said the state government should follow the Doherty Institute's modelling which showed the rate of COVID transmission fell when the 80 per cent target was reached.
"Given this is the accepted measure, 80 per cent vaccination is the official high target and therefore the point at which society should resume normality, free of health order restrictions," he said.
"I'm calling on the Premier to make a commitment to the community of NSW that she lifts all health order restrictions and return our freedoms, unconditionally, upon reaching the goal of 80 per cent double-dose vaccination of the adult population."
He said the uncertainty of the current situation was impacting businesses, costing people their jobs and putting people under stress leading to mental health problems.
Mr Donato also called on the government to re-open state parliament which is currently closed due to the pandemic.
He said parliament provided opportunities for state members to put the government under scrutiny.

Full text: Life at 70 per cent and 80 per cent double-dose vaccination will be a lot different than it is now. Every day, we're inching closer to those important targets and to a more normal way of life.
Under the Reopening NSW roadmap announced last week, many restrictions to gathering, movement, retail and hospitality will be eased for fully vaccinated people (as well as those
with medical exemptions) when our state hits 70 per cent adult coverage.
It means we'll be able to gather with our families and friends. We'll be able to dine out or enjoy a beer at the pub. We'll be able to exercise at gyms, get a haircut, attend church services, enjoy a bit of retail therapy, or take a weekend trip away. There's light at the end of the tunnel.
If you haven't received your first vaccine dose, I strongly encourage you to book an appointment as soon as you can. This is largely a pandemic of the unvaccinated.
Vaccination protects you from severe disease, hospitalisation and death; the vast majority of deaths and ICU admissions in the current outbreak have been unvaccinated. Vaccination also protects the people around you by limiting the possibility for onward virus transmission.
For the time being, to open up for unvaccinated people would overwhelm our health system and produce many thousands of deaths. This point is underscored by recent modelling by the Burnet Institute, which shows that the current lockdown measures in New South Wales, combined with targeted vaccination, may have prevented more than 580,000 cases and 5,800 deaths.
The roadmap is subject to further fine-tuning and to health advice if circumstances change drastically or if cases within a designated area remain too high. But clearly, the higher our vaccination rates, the stronger our collective armour as we adjust to living with COVID.
It's no surprise that Sutherland Shire residents have been rolling up their sleeves and doing their share of heavy lifting. Ours is the third most vaccinated statistical area in NSW. Let's keep getting those rates as high as we possibly can, so we can get back to doing all the things we love.
In the meantime, please look out for each other and stay safe.

Full text: Lockdown has been horrible, but there is hope on the horizon.
The NSW Government has announced that restrictions will ease for vaccinated people once our State reaches the 70 per cent double dose threshold.
When we emerge from lockdown, our collective goal must be to keep our hard-fought freedoms.
So, it is vital that we have all the protections in place before we emerge, to keep our community safe when we do. We must minimise the risk of an uncontrolled COVID-19 outbreak in Port Stephens - which could see the reintroduction of harsh lockdown rules.
And here lies the challenge.
When restrictions ease, Port Stephens will be hit by a tsunami of Sydneysiders and other travellers longing for our beautiful beaches, Summer sun and fresh air.
For local businesses and workers, visitors will be very welcome. But the complexity that lies ahead is mind boggling. Can they serve unvaccinated customers? Can they operate with unvaccinated staff? Are they obliged to enforce vaccination rules, and if so, how? Will they continue receiving financial support if their wages or profits are impacted by the rules?
Our community requires clear answers from the Government to ensure our collective relief after escaping lockdown isn't replaced with anxiety.
I've asked the NSW Government to work with our community to create a strong plan with clear rules to ensure we stay safe and our freedoms remain. Our community deserves to have predictable problems resolved prior to opening up, rather than waiting for a crisis to unfold.
I have sought a proactive expansion of local healthcare services so they don't become overwhelmed if cases climb.
Importantly, the Doherty Modelling Report has shown that further lockdowns can be avoided if our contact tracing system is strong.
Too often in Port Stephens, we have seen significant delays in exposure sites being published by Health authorities, despite their best efforts. These delays will have serious consequences once restrictions have eased, so I have requested the Government strengthen the capacity of our local contact tracing team.
But the first and best line of defence remains vaccination, especially for our tourism and hospitality workers who will become another frontline workforce - face to face with visitors from across the State.
Frustratingly, the Morrison Government's failed vaccine rollout could quickly become a handbrake on our personal freedom, with many locals still unable to access the vaccines they need.
However, I'm hopeful that the much-promised vaccine supply will appear soon and everyone will get their opportunity to protect themselves, their loved ones and our community.
So, in the coming weeks, it's critical that we keep working together as a community to get ourselves safely out of lockdown and, importantly, staying there. Let's hope the government plays its part as well.
Kate Washington MP is the Member for Port Stephens and the Shadow Minister for Family and Community Services.

Full text: Catch NSW on the vaccine gap PREMIER Daniel Andrews needs to adopt the New South Wales reopening model for when a 70 per cent double-dose vaccine target is reached.
While states and territories will hit their national road map trigger points on various dates, Australia needs to have a unified view on what reopening means.
As the most populous states and those carrying the biggest Covid burden, Victoria and NSW need to be on the same page for managing the pandemic and rebooting their respective economies as the nation’s engine rooms.
Keeping on the same page means Victoria must use the next fortnight’s vaccination blitz across Melbourne’s northern and western suburb hot spots to close the gap on Sydney’s lead in vaccination rates.
On the current trajectory, NSW will hit its 70 per cent double-dose vaccination coverage a full two weeks before Victoria.
The major reason for higher rates north of the Murray had been the bolstered Pfizer stocks sent in to combat their rocketing west and southwestern Sydney outbreaks and the push-factor high levels of transmission had on people coming forward for their vaccinations.
This week and next, Victoria will see a major boost in access to the national Pfizer stocks and the later arrival of Moderna will help protect the state’s adolescent population.
While areas of Sydney yesterday relaxed some outdoor, picnic and exercise restrictions for fully vaccinated people (who are required to have proof of vaccination with them), the first significant changes to reopening will occur when 70 per cent are fully vaccinated — a level forecast to be reached in just over a month’s time on October 17.
NSW Premier Gladys Berejiklian has committed to a capped reopening of hospitality, retail, return to work, gyms, outdoor events, social gathering and family reunions and an end to stay-at-home rules from that trigger point for people who have received both doses of the vaccine.
Face-to-face learning in schools in NSW is scheduled to restart on October 25 — while our Premier is yet to clarify what happens in education here.
Premier Berejiklian reiterated yesterday the coming freedoms would be for those fully vaccinated — and those unvaccinated could not expect the same opportunities.
The same messages about freedoms won through vaccinations have been given in this state.
Premier Andrews said Victoria’s road map would be informed by modelling now being finalised by the Burnet Institute and a clear plan will be announced in a week, including full clarity on returning to school.
In coming days, the Premier has also committed to setting out clear rules for vaccinating sectors of the workforce, and requirements for teachers are expected to be included.
But the Premier should also commit to a strategy where, under the soon-to-be-established significant federal expansion of GP and pharmacy vaccination sites, Victoria catches up to NSW on vaccination rates.
If lost ground is not recovered, NSW will also meet its 80 per cent fully vaccinated trigger point under the national cabinet reopening plan on October 31, almost three weeks before Victoria hits the milestone, on or about November 19.
More than 500,000 Victorians were vaccinated last week, meaning we will soon reach the 70 per cent first-dose target, so our travel from home distances will be increased to 10km, we get an extra hour of outdoor exercise and further childminding provisions for essential workers.
But these tweaks are minor at best and Mr Andrews needs to expand relaxation in other areas for those vaccinated now.
Golden Aussie triumph INSPIRATIONAL Melburnian Dylan Alcott has now achieved sporting history with a “Golden Slam” win after being crowned in the US Open.
The only other tennis great to achieve the singles feat — victory at all four Grand Slams plus Olympic gold — was Steffi Graf in 1988.
Novak Djokovic was looking to emulate that record for a calendar year’s competition but lost in his Olympic semi-final bid.
Now it is Alcott who has the rare acclaim after winning the US Open quad singles title to achieve the first men’s Golden Slam in tennis history.
Despite his utter dominance in the sport with 15 grand slams, the emotions and the significance of the moment was clear at Louis Armstrong Stadium in Flushing Meadows.
Cheers were also sent across the Pacific for Samantha Stosur, who with China’s Zhang Shuai, won the US Open women’s doubles title on Sunday and captured her fourth career grand slam doubles title.
Then there was the top podium finish in Monza as Aussie ace Daniel Ricciardo won the Italian Grand Prix with a sensational performance.
It was the eighth victory of Ricciardo’s F1 career but the first since Monaco in 2018 and was McLaren’s first race win since 2012. These Australians have proven once more why we are such a proud and passionate sporting nation.

Full text: FROM FRONT PAGE Mr Donato said the state government should follow the Doherty Institute's modelling which showed the rate of COVID transmission fell when the 80 per cent target was reached.
"Given this is the accepted measure, 80 per cent vaccination is the official high target and therefore the point at which society should resume normality, free of health order restrictions," he said.

Mr Donato also called on the government to re-open state parliament which is currently closed due to the pandemic.
He said parliament provided opportunities for state members to put the government under scrutiny and be held accountable.
And he has questioned why Premier Gladys Berejiklian has called off her daily 11am COVID update press conferences.

Full text: We have become the most divided country in the world The news from the UK (“Britain carefree as Covid rates rise”, 8/9) shows the way for Australia. Despite having an 80 per cent full and 90 per cent part adult vaccination rate, there are still about 40,000 new cases a day. But, and this is the point, the hospital system is not overwhelmed and the average death rate is fewer than 100 per day, almost entirely unvaccinated and far fewer than the usual causes of death.
The effectiveness of the now-cancelled masks and social distancing is called into question, as are the inaccurate modelling predictions of doom. This Delta variant is more infectious but less deadly and we can safely open up as vaccination rates rise.
Dr Graham Pinn, Maroochydore, Qld
The management of the pandemic in Australia can be described only as dysfunctional and chaotic. We have some premiers still clinging to the delusional aspiration of the elimination of the virus. We have others hiding behind “the best medical advice” to justify lockdowns and draconian restrictions on freedom when between the states and territories the “best” advice is inconsistent if not contradictory.
We don’t know if the magical vaccination threshold is 70, 80, 90 or 100 per cent. We don’t know what vaccines are said to be safe at what age. We don’t know how long the vaccines remain effective.
No one dares to question the epidemiological credentials of the so-called experts. In South Australia our expert has a background as a paediatrician. There is simply no consensus as to the way out of the pandemic.
All of this with a national population that is less than that of many cities around the world.
It all goes to show how divided and over-governed we are. Any remaining suggestion that “we are all in this together” is nonsense. We are the laughing stock of the rest of the world.
Geoff Forbes, Kensington Gardens, SA
I am one Aussie with grateful thanks for a PM who works day and night in torrid circumstances. He must endure the petty slings and arrows of those on the left, those who don’t like to be personally inconvenienced and the plain stupid. After all that he does internationally, strategically, locally, under constant fire with the demands of leadership, surely he is entitled to include a visit to his distant children and aged parents with two necessary work appearances in NSW on Father’s Day.
If we keep up this juvenile narcissism towards our leaders, we will never get a normal decent family man to enter politics.
Judy Crooke, Claremont, WA
The recent hysterical outbursts from certain premiers over vaccine allocation must surely rank as one of the uglier and more unedifying examples of populist base politics witnessed in recent times, and that’s saying something. People in western and southwestern Sydney are dying. Outside the southeast corner of NSW, Victoria and the ACT, the country is virtually Covid free and nobody is dying. To vaccinate people in Rockhampton or Albany at the expense of vaccines reaching those in Campsie and Yagoona is nothing short of criminal.
Shayne Thompson, Queens Park, NSW
As Janet Albrechtsen says, serious mental health tragedies are unfolding due to Covid restrictions (“Come to the party, Santa Claus, and reopen the border”, 8/9). Spare a thought for women who have just had their first baby (particularly in Victoria) and are sent home from hospital after only a few hours to a partner with no experience with a newborn, and no relative permitted to cross borders or other visitors allowed. No one to share the joy or to help. Should we be surprised at the increase in postnatal depression that will surely ensue?
Roseanne Schneider, Toowoomba, Qld
Never in living memory have we been such a divided country. The only time we become parochial about our states is when there are football grand finals or State of Origin matches. Any other time when there has been natural disasters such as bushfires, floods or cyclones we rally to support each other and that is the thing I love about Australia.
It is unbelievable that during the worst pandemic the world has experienced in 100 years we are now the most divided country in the world. Glenys Clift, Toowoomba, Qld

Full text: MORE than 5800 people would have died from Covid-19 by the end of the year if the NSW government did not implement any restrictions or ramp up vaccinations in 12 Sydney hotspots.
New modelling from the Burnet Institute revealed that without any restrictions or the additional Pfizer doses, there would have been almost 590,000 total infections and 5808 deaths. It is projected that the original vaccine rollout and restrictions combined helped save 4830 lives while the addition of 530,000 Pfizer doses saved a further 254 lives.

Vaccine supply set for major shot in the arm

Publication info: Newcastle Herald ; Newcastle, N.S.W. [Newcastle, N.S.W]. 08 Sep 2021: 9.

Full text: Australia's vaccine supply issues are over and the success of the nation's rollout now hinges on public uptake, the man tasked with leading it says.
COVID-19 Taskforce Commander Lieutenant-General John Frewen has also told Australian Community Media the publisher of the Newcastle Herald, that vaccination rates among Indigenous Australians must be accelerated to avoid leaving them exposed once restrictions begin to ease.
The early stages of Australia's rollout were wracked by an undersupply of Pfizer, a problem compounded by the Australian Technical Advisory Group on Immunisation advising against the use of AstraZeneca in people under 60.
But with an imminent influx of mRNA vaccines, General Frewen said Australia was on track to ramp up its rollout in September, a month earlier than initially expected.
"This takes us beyond the phase in the vaccine [rollout] where we were really mRNA supply constrained. The vaccines are coming, the distribution networks are in place and expanding. It all comes down now to public willingness to come forward," he said.
"Sentiment remains strong and high, which is pleasing. But I'm not counting any chickens until we've got everybody through the door. We've still got a ways to go to get us to 70 per cent, and international experience tells us you've got work hard between 70 per cent and 80 per cent."
The federal government last week confirmed it had agreed a vaccine swap with the UK for four million Pfizer doses, the first batch arriving on Sunday. Australia would return the doses by December, General Frewen predicted.
It followed a similar agreement with Singapore for 500,000 doses, and the federal government purchasing an additional one million from Poland. General Frewen said the deals, coupled with the imminent availability of the Moderna jab, would allow the country's remaining GPs to administer mRNA vaccines.
"[That] is going to help us ramp up through September in ways that we didn't think would be possible until October," he said.
"We've got every opportunity, provided people keep stepping forward. So I really encourage everybody who hasn't made a booking to get in and make one now."
The nation's reopening plan, based on modelling by the Doherty Institute, saw Australia begin to reopen once 70 per cent of each state and territory was fully-vaccinated. That did not include 12- to 15-year-olds, who were all eligible to make a booking from Monday.
Nor did it include a minimum threshold for Indigenous and Torres Strait Islander Australians, raising the prospect of Australia opening up while they remained vulnerable.
Just over 40 per cent of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Australians aged 16 and over had received a first dose by Monday, well below the broader population of 63 per cent. Just 23 per cent were fully vaccinated, compared to 38 per cent nationally.
General Frewen conceded vaccination among First Nations peoples had fallen behind early in the rollout and, although it had doubled in the last month, the rate was still only keeping pace with the rest of Australia.
"So we've got to accelerate it to catch it up, because we don't want them to be behind when the rest of the nation gets to 70 and 80 per cent," he said.
"We're going to accelerate where we can over the next month by focusing on some of those communities that are most behind right now."
General Frewen would not predict when the Indigenous population would hit 70 per cent, warning vaccine hesitancy would prove the "ultimate variable".
He warned a relatively COVID-free existence in most remote communities, some of which had vaccination rates under 10 per cent, had caused complacency over the vaccine.
But the virus' spread through regional NSW, including the first deaths among Indigenous Australians, had prompted a shift in the region.
Work was being done with local leaders and trusted community identities to counter disinformation, he said.
"[They are] stressing not only that the vaccines are safe and important, but there is a real urgency to this," he said.
"Western NSW has given us a good reminder that COVID can rip into these communities really quickly, so we're better to get in and get ahead of the curve."

It’s a jabs rate race to stall inevitable

Full text: Queensland is racing against the clock to boost lagging vaccination rates as it teeters on the edge of another lockdown, with Annastacia Palaszczuk warning that Covid would spread through the state “sometime in the near ­future”.
The Queensland Premier held off on locking down the state at the weekend but remains “concerned” about a group of people exposed to the Delta variant at a nail salon in Logan, south of Brisbane, last week.
Contact tracers are still “struggling” to track down the group who visited the salon at the same time as a Covid-infected truck driver.
“It is imperative you get vaccinated because this virus will pop up in the near future,” Ms Palas­zczuk said.
“I cannot stress to you enough … if you’re sitting at home and you’re thinking, well, I might just wait, don’t wait.
“Every single person that gets vaccinated is protecting us from having a huge outbreak.” As of Saturday, 34 per cent of eligible Queenslanders were double-dosed compared with 45 per cent in Tasmania and the ACT.
In NSW, 40 per cent of the eligible population is fully vaccinated, as the state added another 1485 cases to its Covid tally on Sunday and three deaths.
Seventy per cent of the eligible population has received one dose of the vaccine, which Gladys Bere­jiklian said was “pleasing”.
The NSW Premier blasted other state leaders who had not committed to reopening state borders even when Australia reached its 80 per cent vaccination target.
“Once we hit 80 per cent double dose, all internal borders in Australia should not exist and by that stage NSW would welcome home thousands of Australians every week,” Ms Bere­jiklian said.
“We certainly will not have to have a statewide lockdown ever again when we hit the 80 per cent double-dose vaccination rate, which is what we’re looking forward to.
She warned other state leaders that a major outbreak was imminent, urging them to stick to the national plan.
“NSW has had to confront some issues because a major outbreak happened here first but other states will have to go through this,” she said.
“Victoria is going through it. If you follow the rate of cases at the time we had ours, you will see the pattern.” Ms Palaszczuk said she was “trying so hard” to move the state’s border checkpoint further south to allow families to reunite, and was continuing discussions with her NSW counterpart.
Separated families gathered along the Queensland-NSW ­border on Father’s Day to share hugs and kisses, despite stay-at-home orders for all NSW ­residents.
Crowds of up to 200 gathered along barricades and Acting Chief Superintendent Rhys Wildman said police took a “compassionate” approach by handing out several hundred masks rather than fines.
In Victoria, another 183 infections were reported as Premier Daniel Andrews said it was ­“highly likely” a wide range of public events would be open only to vaccinated people once 80 per cent of Victorians had had two doses.
“We are going to move from a situation where to protect the health system we have everybody locked down … to a situation where to protect the health system we are going to lock out ­people who are not vaccinated and can be,” he said.
“If you’re making the choice not to get vaccinated, then you are making the wrong choice.” Mr Andrews said people concerned about the impact of corona­virus on children once Australia reopened should be aware that those aged under 12 were considered in the Doherty Institute modelling that formed the basis for national cabinet’s recommendation of achieving 70 per cent and 80 per cent vaccination thresholds.

Hunt backs jabs for over-12s despite doubts

Full text: Federal Health Minister Greg Hunt has reassured Australian parents the government's decision to vaccinate 12- to 15-year-olds is based on the best health advice and will get kids back to school sooner, after a British expert group recommended against vaccinating healthy adolescents.
A week after Australia approved vaccination of children as young as 12, the UK's Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation said the benefits of doing so were only "marginally greater than the potential known harms".
"It is not within the JCVI's remit to consider the wider societal impacts of vaccination, including educational benefits," the body noted in a decision that shocked experts and which is at odds with moves by Australia, the US, Canada, Israel and many European countries to vaccinate children aged 12 and over.
UK Health Minister Sajid Javid and his counterparts in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland had written to the chief medical officers asking for further advice, "including on educational impacts", and the decision could be reversed in a matter of days or weeks.
The UK decision came as Australia's equivalent body, the Therapeutic Goods Administration (TGA), yesterday approved the use of Moderna's vaccine for use by children as young as 12.
It is the second vaccine after Pfizer to be approved by the TGA and the final hurdle - approval by the Australian Technical Advisory Group on Immunisation - is expected to be cleared later this week.
Mr Hunt said the rollout of Moderna and Pfizer for 12 to 15-year-olds would "offer them the best protection possible and help get them back into classrooms safely, as soon as possible". The Doherty Institute modelled how to begin reopening Australia, while maintaining non-lockdown health measures such as masks, when 70 and then 80 per cent of over 16s were vaccinated.
"Vaccinating 12 to 15-year-olds is over and above what was presumed in the Doherty modelling," Mr Hunt noted. "This is an important next step, vaccinations for all 12- to 15-year-olds will open on September 13."
TGA head Professor John Skerritt said the approval of the Moderna vaccine for children aged 12 and older was based on "evidence of strong ability for these vaccines to raise just as good if not stronger immunological responses as it does in young adults and older groups".
Professor Skerritt pointed out the UK government had ordered a review of the JCVI decision and "we may hear a different decision coming from the UK in the coming week".
University of Sydney infectious diseases paediatrician Professor Robert Booy said the UK was still recommending vaccination for the five to 10 per cent of children in the UK who had underlying condition or increased risk including "Down's syndrome, cerebral palsy and immune deficiency".
Nigel Curtis, an infectious disease physician at the Murdoch Children's Research Institute, said the JCVI's advice underscored the "complexity of the decisions" about vaccination.
"The risk of disease and death from COVID-19 is very low in children, and is still lower in adolescents than adults. But any harms from the vaccine are also very low," he said.
"The JCVI looked only at the relative harms to the individual, whereas other countries such as Australia has included considerations such as benefits of keeping schools open and the fact that Australian teenagers have not been exposed in large numbers." with Reuters

Full text: STEVEN Miles doesn’t want Queenslanders to “fall for Scott Morrison’s marketing tactics” around opening up Australia.
He says the Doherty modelling is “much more complex than a number and a simple three-word slogan”.
I wonder if he had those pearls of wisdom for his own leader, who this week led Queensland through a mire of confusing messaging, scary warnings of impending death and imagery of sick kids, all the while trumpeting her own three-word slogan of “keeping Queenslanders safe”.
Because it wasn't exactly a week of informed and constructive public debate down on George St either.
It might have been different if Palaszczuk had just stood up on Tuesday and apologised for the fact football WAGs were allowed to fly into the state over locked-out Queenslanders – something she ended up doing anyway, just four days late.
Instead, the Premier let her chief health officer wear the fault and left her to defend her own Twitter death warnings at a long press conference she didn’t attend herself.
Because Twitter is definitely the best place for public debate, not a press conference. Right?
Oh, the hypocrisy.
Palaszczuk was much more measured yesterday, using the press conference to try to reset after the horror week and call for a more nuanced debate on living with Covid. That’s not only best for public policy, but best for her after she was left so isolated this week by medical experts and federal Labor colleagues, and so politically outplayed by Canberra.

Full text: STEVEN Miles doesn’t want Queenslanders to “fall for Scott Morrison’s marketing tactics” around opening up Australia.
He says the Doherty modelling is “much more complex than a number and a simple three-word slogan”.
I wonder if he had those pearls of wisdom for his own leader, who this week led Queensland through a mire of confusing messaging, scary warnings of impending death and imagery of sick kids, all the while trumpeting her own three-word slogan of “keeping Queenslanders safe”.
Because it wasn't exactly a week of informed and constructive public debate down on George St either.
It might have been different if Palaszczuk had just stood up on Tuesday and apologised for the fact football WAGs were allowed to fly into the state over locked-out Queenslanders – something she ended up doing anyway, just four days late.
Instead, the Premier let her chief health officer wear the fault and left her to defend her own Twitter death warnings at a long press conference she didn’t attend herself.
Because Twitter is definitely the best place for public debate, not a press conference. Right?
Oh, the hypocrisy.
Palaszczuk was much more measured yesterday, using the press conference to try to reset after the horror week and call for a more nuanced debate on living with Covid. That’s not only best for public policy, but best for her after she was left so isolated this week by medical experts and federal Labor colleagues, and so politically outplayed by Canberra.

Full text: With other state leaders now walking away from the national cabinet plan framed around the Doherty modelling, the SA Premier said a consensus approach was crucial and that the scientific advice should unite the nation.
“We do have expert advice from Doherty, they pull it together from other experts right around the country,” Mr Marshall said.
“It’s a consensus model and it’s one that we in South Australian 100 per cent signed up to. We have listened to the experts, the evidence, the science, since day one here in SA. I think it’s put us in really good stead.”
But Mr Marshall said the country was now coming to a point where higher vaccination rates meant statewide lockdowns and whole-of-state border closures should no longer be used.
“If you are not going to have lockdowns you have to have higher vaccination rates and that’s what we are committed to in SA,” he said.
“When we get to 80 per cent which I hope is going to be in the coming months we will not be having statewide lockdowns. That’s the most punishing thing when you have got to put people in their own state into seven-day lockdowns. That will become a thing of the past.”
Mr Marshall reassured South Australians that he did not want to see any more lockdowns once the vaccination rate reached 80 per cent.
“It doesn’t mean that when we get a positive case we will just say ‘oh well, let that go through’,” he said.
“We will still do what we call test, trace, isolate and quarantine, so if you are infected we will look at those close contacts and put them into isolation.
“We don’t want it going through our state, but we do know that the transmission potential massively reduces once we get to 80 per cent of the adult population having this double dose of the vaccine.”
Despite having supported the imposition of tough border closures by his Covid team headed by Police Commissioner Grant Stevens, Mr Marshall said he did not want statewide border closures to continue.
He said the caveat to the removal of statewide lockdowns was that some interstate local government areas could still be precluded from travel at times when outbreaks occurred.
However, he said this could be managed in future with a more targeted approach than the blunt force of statewide travel bans.
“We will move to a more nuanced approach where instead of looking out a whole state we will say this LGA has got a breakout or a cluster,” he said.
“When people are putting in an application to come in, we will say these LGAs are excluded. But I think we will be moving away from whole of state lockdowns. The problem with the situation as it is at the moment is you really only know the actual situation of what’s going on in a state 14 days after it’s occurred. So you have to extrapolate because this is just such a transmissible version of the disease. But as the vaccination rate goes up, it’s not as transmissible. It reduces from eight times down to one or one and a half times.”
While refusing to take potshots at other state leaders, the SA Premier said the divergent approaches being taken in WA and Queensland made for “an interesting situation”, and joked that South Australia still remained part of the Federation.
“We are still signed up to the Federation, it’s a good system,” he said.
“It comes under a bit of stress every now and again but if you look at the systems of government around the world ours stands up pretty well to most.”

Premier’s alarm for children criticised

Full text: PREMIER Annastacia Palaszczuk has been accused of “scaremongering” by political foes and lacking common sense by “appalled” top doctors, as she seized on children’s welfare as the reason she still can’t lay out a plan for reopening the state.
Ms Palaszczuk appealed to parents, grandparents, aunts and uncles on Wednesday as she declared the fate of children was “the most serious issue that our country will face” and opening up would be exposing the most vulnerable.
After committing to a national cabinet plan to relax restrictions last month, the Premier said she now needed extra Doherty Institute modelling to show how children would fare before she could tell Queenslanders what life would look like when vaccination rates reached 80 per cent.
“Unless there is an answer on how these young people are going to be vaccinated, you are putting the most vulnerable population at risk,” she said.
“So anyone who has grandchildren, or young children, or nephews or nieces know how that plays on people’s minds.” But the comments were questioned by health experts, who said keeping borders shut to protect children was “not sensible”.
Veteran paediatrician and vaccine expert Professor Robert Booy, who is also a member of the national Immunisation Coalition, said: “I have been a paediatrician and have worked in the promotion of vaccinations for decades.
“If I thought young children needed urgent vaccination, I would say so. “Keeping borders shut because of the children is not a sensible measure.” An alert was issued for southern parts of the state after a truck driver with Covid travelled over the border.

Full text: From Page 1 Mr Morrison's position on Tuesday more closely aligns with the national roadmap as it is written, which acknowledges that at least some basic restrictions and public health measures would be required even with 80 per cent of the adult population vaccinated.
Lockdowns would be "less likely but possible" at 70 per cent, and would still be an option - even if only in highly targeted circumstances - at 80 per cent.
"The public health social measures, they will continue," he said.
"There is not a time that we are contemplating where we move into Phase B and Phase C [of the plan] that they are not part of our management of our Covid response."
Mr Morrison conducted a local radio blitz in Covid-free states such as SA, Tasmania and WA on Tuesday, in an attempt to explain the national plan to populations wary about reopening their borders.
Sydney's ever-worsening Delta outbreak has caused widespread anxiety about the national reopening plan, and raised questions about whether key assumptions in the Doherty Institute modelling which underpins the roadmap can still be trusted.
Mr Morrison on Tuesday wouldn't be drawn on whether states should be shutting state borders once the vaccination targets were met, but conceded it was ultimately a matter for them.
However, he noted that health and economic advice had warned that imposing lockdowns at 80 per cent vaccine coverage would do "more harm than good".
Mr Barr this week said that reopening at 70 per cent vaccination coverage was "not safe" and discussion around easing restrictions should focus on the 80 per cent mark.
The ACT has set higher vaccination targets than the rest of the country, with Mr Barr hopeful 90 per cent of all Canberrans will be vaccinated by Christmas.
The lingering tension over the national strategy to reopen the country played out as the federal government announced it had struck a "dose swap" deal with Singapore.
Under the deal, Australia will receive 500,000 Pfizer doses from Singapore in September, before sending the same amount back to the south-east Asian city-state in December.
Mr Morrison said the additional doses would be distributed on a per capita basis to GP clinics and state vaccination hubs around the country, rather than channeled into areas facing Covid outbreaks.

Full text: VICTORIA’s crippling sixth lockdown will be extended with no end date in sight, forcing industry leaders to demand the Premier detail a “realistic” road map that offers “hope” instead of more despair for the state.
Daniel Andrews on Sunday said lockdown wouldn’t end on Thursday and refused to say how low case numbers would need to be to begin easing restrictions, sparking fears stay-at-home orders could drag until mid-November, when Victoria is due to reach 80 per cent vaccination.
Melbourne has now spent 211 days in hard lockdown and the week-long “circuit breaker” is now in its 26th day.
With 92 new Covid cases recorded on Sunday, Mr Andrews said: “We still have too many cases that are in the community for too long for us to be able to open up.
“We acted early but I’m not here to tell people this is easy, it’s not, it’s bloody hard.” But the Opposition said the state was being held “hostage” to a zero-case strategy, and the mental health harm caused by lockdown was now at alarming levels.
Victorian Chamber of Commerce and Industry chief executive Paul Guerra said businesses were in crisis and a road map out of lockdown that was “realistic and full of hope” was essential.
He said this could include reopening municipalities that were Covid-free, 24-hour vaccination hubs and kids back at school when vaccination rates hit 60 per cent.
“This lockdown is six and out for many, but for those that make it through, we need a plan,” Mr Guerra said.
“The state needs to articulate a reopening plan based on national cabinet’s road map and Doherty Institute modelling.” Mr Guerra said the path out needed to be detailed and even more ambitious than the state’s road map to recovery after the second wave.
“We are on track to have 70 per cent of people with their first jab in mid-October,” Mr Guerra said. “Why don’t we be bold and declare that from Caulfield Cup day and beyond crowds at race days can be at 50 per cent.” The Herald Sun believes that Mr Andrews expressed strong support for the national reopening plan during a phone call with Prime Minister Scott Morrison on Saturday.
Mr Andrews said he would make an announcement this week on any changes to restrictions, after receiving advice from the chief health officer.
But when asked how low cases would need to be to ease the current rules, he would only say “as low as we can get them”.
Unlike NSW, the Premier has not announced a plan for returning children to school.
State Opposition Leader Michael O’Brien said it was not feasible for the Premier to keep chasing zero cases.
“It is basically holding the whole of Victoria hostage to something which is practically unachievable, and is doing more damage in the meantime,” Mr O’Brien said.
“The amount of mental health harm, the amount of suicide attempts and certainly the number of suicides is going up because of these lockdowns.” Another $700m a week will be wiped from the balance sheet, as the engine room of the state’s economy struggles to stay afloat.
“Small businesses are just hanging on right now, they need hope,” federal Treasurer Josh Frydenberg said.
“They need to know that the plan agreed at national cabinet will be implemented, so they can plan for their futures.” Mr Frydenberg said he had a good working relationship with his Victorian counterpart, and together they had provided more than $2bn in economic support this lockdown. However, a school holiday cash splash that tourism operators rely on remains in jeopardy.
If Greater Melbourne and NSW remain in lockdown, a whopping $1.9bn is estimated to be lost over the fortnight from September 18.
Victorian Tourism Industry Council chief executive Felicia Mariani said a road map and a significant step-change to business support measures was required, if they were to survive this latest setback.
“These current grant programs, however, are sadly not going to save businesses from closures that now seem imminent,” Ms Mariani said.
“Businesses in the visitor economy right across the state are struggling under the weight of this latest lockdown and hope is waning that they will ever recover from mounting losses.” Father of three Chris Papas said families needed certainty about when students could return to the classroom.
“If the kids aren’t back by the end of term four it is going to be disastrous for their mental health, surely there are some measures the government can put in place,” he said.
Jodie Smith was forced to cancel her wedding this month, after the state was plunged into its sixth lockdown, and said they hadn’t rebooked as it was too hard to set a date.
“It would be nice to have certainty when we can look to plan a wedding date and a clear plan when we are going to have functions,” she said. “It has been pretty heartbreaking to plan everything and just undo it all at the last minute.” jade.gailberger@news.com.au EDITORIAL, OPINION: PAGES 22-23

Full text: Locking down without a plan AS Melbourne today enters a 26th day of what was supposed to be a week-long circuit-breaker lockdown and our 211th day of stay-at-home orders, Victorians are demanding a clear plan out of this crushing Covid stalemate.
More than 6.6 million Victorians have done the hard yards over the past 18 months of pandemic pandemonium but even now, after all the costs and lost time, there is no clear vision forward other than blunt lockdowns and a distant vaccine horizon.
Tens of thousands of businesses have been hammered, many ruined, families have been separated, education for an entire generation has been disrupted and mental health issues are at record levels.
Melburnians have now endured a cumulative lockdown second in length only the Argentine capital Buenos Aires, in a country which relaxed a range of restrictions this month even though it has almost 7000 cases and 170 deaths each day.
Yesterday, Victoria recorded a worrying increase in community-acquired daily cases to 92 and New South Wales had an alarming new-record of 1218 cases, but the wide disparity in infection statistics was not the only difference between the two states.
As Victorian Premier Daniel Andrews faced the cameras to confirm Melbourne’s scheduled end to lockdown this Thursday would be again extended, NSW Premier Gladys Berejiklian said her state, now at the halfway mark to 70 per cent of all adults fully vaccinated, would “show the way” on how to live with Covid.
While Victoria must ensure it does not follow NSW into its exponential growth in cases — that has put 813 people currently in hospital, including 126 in intensive care — there is at least some plan north of the Murray for selected reopening and targeted relaxation.
The NSW plan to give back some freedoms is centred on rewarding double-vaccinated people, a policy that needs to be adopted here.
While the countrywide vision for reopening agreed to at national cabinet, based on Doherty Institute modelling, maps out a longer-term way forward, there has to be scope for returning some liberties and livelihoods before the target 70 and then 80 per cent full vaccination triggers that are still months away.
As the Sydney outbreak bled into regional NSW and community infections continued to spiral, the focus there has been on vaccination rates rather than just daily infection tallies.
Certainly, the federal acceleration of vaccine stocks into NSW helped them reach almost 835,000 doses last week, but Victoria must increase its supplies of AstraZeneca and now push for further shipments of Pfizer to meet our Delta challenge.
On the current trajectory, NSW is expected to reach 70 per cent full vaccination of eligible adults by as early as the first week of October, weeks before Victoria hits the same mark.
We have got to do better and simply blaming supplies solves nothing — we need to increase AstraZeneca messaging, more localised, pop-up clinics and a more proactive educational push through GPs and pharmacies is needed, particularly in Melbourne’s north and western suburbs that are carrying about 500 of the 773 current community cases.
Up to five people will be allowed to gather outdoors for recreation outside greater Sydney hotspot municipalities from mid-September and an hour of recreation on top of the hour of exercise within suburbs of concern for those who have been vaccinated.
Proof of vaccination on the digital myGov website will be required to be shown as part of the health order requirements.
And in a staggered approach, NSW students will return to face-to-face learning in schools beginning from October 25.
Premier Andrews yesterday said Victorians could still wrench back Delta case numbers by strictly adhering to stay-at-home restrictions and getting tested at the earliest sign of symptoms.
There was still a chance we could wrest back control in coming weeks, he insisted.
But there must be a more nuanced approach to offer reason for optimism and not just endless compliance.
Balancing what is being demanded of Victorians with relaxation of restrictions wherever and whenever possible must form part of the plan, together with catching up on strong but sub-optimal vaccination rates.
Much of regional Victoria could be released from many restrictions even now. And there is still a complete absence of a clear timeline for wider returns to in-class schooling in this state, community sport and re-engagement in workplaces.
Certainly, large swaths of greater Melbourne and some regional areas, particularly Shepparton, remain on a knife’s edge in seeking to contain local infections.
But that does not excuse the Andrews government for its failure to set out a clear, achievable way forward and to specify what reduced case numbers will allow us to move beyond captivity and constraint.
Clear vision is, after all, what defines leadership. Instead, in the days leading up to this Thursday when lockdown was supposed to end, Victorians will be told to hunker down longer and hope some freedoms will be restored, sometime.

Full text: VICTORIA’s crippling sixth lockdown will be extended with no end date in sight, forcing industry leaders to demand the Premier detail a “realistic” road map that offers “hope” ­instead of more despair for the state.
Daniel Andrews on Sunday said lockdown wouldn’t end as planned on Thursday and refused to say how low case numbers would need to be to begin easing restrictions, sparking fears stay-at-home orders could drag on until mid-November, when Victoria is due to reach 80 per cent full vaccination.
Melbourne has now spent 211 days in hard lockdown and the August week-long “circuit breaker” is now in its 26th day.
With 92 new Covid cases recorded on Sunday, Mr Andrews said: “We still have too many cases that are in the community for too long for us to be able to open up.
“We acted early but I’m not here to tell people this is easy, it’s not, it’s bloody hard.” But the Opposition said the state was being held “hostage” to a zero-case strategy, and the mental health harm caused by lockdown was now at alarming levels.
Victorian Chamber of Commerce and Industry chief executive Paul Guerra said businesses were in crisis and a road map out of lockdown that was “realistic and full of hope” was essential.
He said this could include reopening municipalities that were Covid-free, 24-hour vaccination hubs and kids back at school when vaccination rates hit 60 per cent.
“This lockdown is six and out for many, but for those that make it through, we need a plan,” Mr Guerra said.
“The state needs to articulate a reopening plan based on national cabinet’s road map and Doherty Institute modelling.” Mr Guerra said the path out needed to be detailed and even more ambitious than the state’s road map to recovery after the second wave.
“We are on track to have 70 per cent of people with their first jab in mid-October,” Mr Guerra said. “Why don’t we be bold and declare that from Caulfield Cup day and beyond crowds at race days can be at 50 per cent.” The Herald Sun believes that Mr Andrews expressed strong support for the national reopening plan during a phone call with Prime Minister Scott Morrison on Saturday.
Mr Andrews said he would make an announcement this week on any changes to restrictions, after receiving advice from the chief health officer.
But when asked how low cases would need to be to ease the current rules, he would only say “as low as we can get them”.
Unlike NSW, the Premier has not announced a plan for returning children to school.
State Opposition Leader Michael O’Brien said it was not feasible for the Premier to keep chasing zero cases.
“It is basically holding the whole of Victoria hostage to something which is practically unachievable, and is doing more damage in the meantime,” Mr O’Brien said.
“The amount of mental health harm, the amount of suicide attempts and certainly the number of suicides is going up because of these lockdowns.” Federal Treasurer Josh Frydenberg previously said another $700m a week will be wiped from the balance sheet, as the engine room of the state’s economy struggles to stay afloat.
“Small businesses are just hanging on right now, they need hope,” he said on Sunday.
“They need to know that the plan agreed at national cabinet will be implemented, so they can plan.” Mr Frydenberg said he had a good working relationship with his Victorian counterpart, and together they had provided more than $2bn in economic support this lockdown. However, a school holiday cash splash that tourism operators rely on remains in jeopardy.
If Greater Melbourne and NSW remain in lockdown, a whopping $1.9bn is estimated to be lost over the fortnight from September 18.
Victorian Tourism Industry Council chief executive Felicia Mariani said a road map and a significant step-change to business support measures was required, if they were to survive this latest setback.
“These current grant programs, however, are sadly not going to save businesses from closures that now seem imminent,” Ms Mariani said.
“Businesses in the visitor economy right across the state are struggling under the weight of this latest lockdown and hope is waning that they will ever recover from mounting losses.” Father of three Chris Papas said families needed certainty about when students could return to the classroom.
“If the kids aren’t back by the end of term four it is going to be disastrous for their mental health, surely there are some measures the government can put in place,” he said.
Jodie Smith was forced to cancel her wedding this month, after the state was plunged into its sixth lockdown, and said they hadn’t rebooked as it was too hard to set a date.
“It would be nice to have certainty when we can look to plan a wedding date and a clear plan when we are going to have functions,” she said. “It has been pretty heartbreaking to plan everything and just undo it all at the last minute.” jade.gailberger@news.com.au EDITORIAL, OPINION: PAGES 22-23

Wellcamp quarantine facility 'a game of politics'

Full text: The agreement between the Queensland government and Wagner Corporation to build a regional quarantine facility adjacent to Wellcamp Airport was dubbed 'a very important milestone' by Deputy Premier Steven Miles, but the community, local and federal governments aren't happy.
The announcement on Thursday morning came as a surprise to Toowoomba Regional Council Mayor Paul Antonio, who was not invited to the press conference at Wellcamp.
"I'm surprised that we haven't been on this journey, I'm surprised that we hadn't been told earlier," Cr Antonio said in his own press conference on Thursday afternoon.
"But in saying that, a decision has been made by the state government, they are legislatively able to make that kind of decision and I guess now the first thing I would ask is the state government visits Toowoomba as soon as they possibly can to give myself and my colleagues and this community an update."
Read more: Wellcamp quarantine facility to open this year Cr Antonio found out about the press conference by way of a phone call from one of the economic development groups in Toowoomba, asking if he had been invited to what was unfolding at Wellcamp.
"I happen to know a lot of things about the future of Toowoomba, some very exciting prospects that are coming our way, industry that's coming our way, and I naturally assumed that's what [the announcement] was," he said.
"I did ring the local federal member and he gave me the heads up, and then of course when I got back to my office my staff had been watching the TV, watching the announcement.
"It was very, very clear that we had been bypassed in the conversation and now we are having a quarantine facility being built here."
In response to the announcement, Cr Antonio said he clearly understands the concerns of many people in the Toowoomba area.
"You've only got to switch the TV on - today there's in excess of 1000 COVID infections in New South Wales, so COVID has the capacity to spread very quickly and I think anyone in Toowoomba who hears this news, naturally, would have some concerns about that," he said.
"The other thing I suggest to you is it will bring some economic benefit to Toowoomba and there will be some people who are certainly looking forward to that, but in saying all that, I think it is disappointing to me that we weren't brought on this journey.
"I would have been really pleased to share that, go on the journey and understand exactly what the state government had in mind.
"As a long-term, long-serving local government person, there's been a real lack of respect to this community and to myself personally, for me not knowing."
The mayor did however concede that a purpose-built facility was better than hotel quarantine.
"I think it's far better to have a hub similar to Howard Springs, and I think there's been no outbreaks from Howard Springs, and that sounds good to me," he said.
"That's better than having a CBD hub in Brisbane in a hotel facility that's not set up for it."
Ultimately, Cr Antonio says the Toowoomba community needs to be heard.
"I hope the state government is prepared to listen to some of the concerns of Toowoomba," he said.
"I would suggest also to [the community] that it's too late, this will happen.
"And it may be a good thing for the economy in Toowoomba. Let's hope there's no outbreaks, let's hope there's no problems with it, and let's hope that it's done well."
The Howard Springs model Mr Miles said the design and operation of the facility would be very closely modelled on the 'very successful' Howard Springs facility in the Northern Territory.
"It will be purpose built based on the learnings from that facility, therefore the infection control can keep our staff, the other people in the facility as well as the local community safe," he said.
"In fact, much much safer than non-purpose-built hotel quarantine accommodation where we currently have people.
"There will be a mix of single, double and family accommodation in cabin style with balconies, and importantly no hallways adjoining rooms which we have seen as vectors in hotel quarantine for the virus."
Mr Miles said they would continue to work through the details of the health and policing model that would be implemented at Wellcamp.
"COVID positive patients that require hospital care will be treated in one of the five COVID hospitals that we currently use, that we currently transfer people to," he said.
"By funding this facility ourselves and building this facility ourselves, we can ensure that it replaces current hotel quarantine usage that will allow us to take travellers that are within the cap and put them into this facility, reducing the need for hotel quarantine."
A game of politics In January, Queensland Country Life exclusively revealed Wagner Corporation and the Queensland government were in talks to build a quarantine hub.
The state government put the proposal to the federal government in a bid to have the project funded at the federal level, and from there 'a game of politics' ensued.
Prime Minister Scott Morrison eventually put the kibosh on the idea over allegations that the proposal for the facility lacked important 'detail' surrounding medical services and cost, and instead committed funding to a facility at Pinkenba.
Cr Antonio believes "there's a fair game of politics being played here", while Mr Miles has fired a shot at the federal government by saying "the work has started now, it's time for the politics to end".
Health Minister Yvette D'Ath also put the spotlight on the federal government.
"If this had been built months ago when we asked the Commonwealth to partner with us and the Wagners, we potentially may not have had to make the very difficult decision that we made yesterday to pause people domestically coming into hotel quarantine for a couple weeks," she said.
"But now we can move forward and we have this great facility that already construction is underway."
Ms D'Ath pointed to modelling from the Doherty Institute which 'has been talked about a lot' recently.
"Their own report says we will need to keep some public health measures in place - test, trace, isolate, quarantine - so even with high vaccination rates, we must continue these public health measures which means we will continue to need quarantine facilities and we need to make sure they're purpose built and they're keeping our community safe."
The lack of love between the state and federal leaders was clear throughout the press conference, but came to a precipice when one reporter asked Premier Annastacia Palaszczuk if the Prime Minister knew about the announcement.
"I'm quite sure he does now," the Premier responded.
Shortly after, the Prime Minister was asked about the announcement in his own press conference.
His response to the news that the Premier would fund the facility because his government wouldn't: "Well, she's been at liberty to do that for months."
"We've made it very clear that that facility did not seek to meet the national guidelines. And that's why we're going... forward together at Pinkenba," Mr Morrison said.
"But the Queensland government was always in a position to go ahead with that facility, if that's what they wish to do and to have people quarantine there rather than in hotel facilities.
"That is entirely a matter for the Queensland government, and they've made that decision.
"They could have done that months ago if that's what they wished to do. But good for them, and I wish them every success."

Stick to plan to reopen, Frydenberg tells states

Full text: Treasurer Josh Frydenberg has ratcheted up the pressure on state premiers to stick to the national plan to reopen once vaccination rates reach 70 and 80 per cent, warning the economy will suffer if they stray from the agreement.
In a coded warning to the resources states of Queensland and Western Australia - both of which have doggedly pursued COVID-zero policies and lag the rest of the country in vaccination rates - Mr Frydenberg also warned of a "ridiculous" scenario where it might be possible for many Australians to fly to Singapore or Canada, but not Perth or Cairns.
Amid ongoing lockdowns in Victoria, NSW and the ACT, Mr Frydenberg said economic growth would be "almost certainly negative in the September quarter, with a contraction of at least 2 per cent [but] I am hopeful and confident the economy can come back in the December quarter if, as expected, restrictions ease".
Economists are divided as to whether Wednesday's national accounts figures will show a quarter of negative growth in the three months to June 30. Two consecutive quarters of negative growth will signify the country is once again in a technical recession.
Mr Frydenberg warned that if premiers and chief ministers did not stick to the plan to reopen, then the hit to the economy and jobs would be high, with businesses closing and debt increasing.
But in the clearest signal yet that WA was prepared to walk away from the national reopening plan, Premier Mark McGowan said "we will need higher vaccination levels" and flagged waiting "a few more months" to reach them. However, Mr Frydenberg said: "Whatever the final number is on Wednesday, it does not change the fact that our economy faces some difficult days ahead. This is another reason why we must stick to our plan and open up at 70 and 80 per cent. If not now, when?"
AMP chief Economist Shane Oliver has forecast negative growth of 0.1 per cent for the June quarter, while Commonwealth Bank head of Australian economics Gareth Aird has forecast modest growth of 0.4 per cent. If the June quarter is negative, then Australia will almost certainly be in its second recession in as many years.
"Learning to live with the virus is our only hope. To delay and deny that fact is not only wrong but incredibly unrealistic," Mr Frydenberg said. "It's in no one's interests for states to be on different tracks when it comes to opening up. It would be ridiculous in the extreme to be able to travel to Canada but not Cairns, or Singapore but not Perth.
"The world is opening up, Australia will open up. Let's just make sure it's all states together, not just some. Opening up as one country and in accordance with the plan will not only give people hope but provide a springboard for our economic recovery."
Trade Minister Dan Tehan also stressed all states must stick to the plan agreed by national cabinet as he confirmed a travel bubble with Singapore would commence as soon as 80 per cent of Australians were fully vaccinated.
At a meeting on Friday, trade ministers agreed to finalise rules for the bubble by the end of the year so that when Australia hit its target, "Singapore will be ready to go", Mr Tehan said.
Last week, The Sunday Age revealed that according to updated Doherty Institute modelling, NSW would still be able to begin opening up once the vaccination targets were met - even if there were hundreds of new daily cases in the community, rather than the initially modelled 30.
That prompted some states, including WA and Queensland, to express concern about opening up and allowing COVID into the community.
At press conference yesterday, Mr McGowan gave the clearest signal yet he could delay opening up to the rest of the country until higher vaccination rates were reached. "We want to just remain COVID-free for as long as we can. Our vaccination levels at 70 per cent for instance, still means that 30 per cent of the adult population are unvaccinated. And then when you add kids on, that's about another 20 per cent," he said.
"So were we to deliberately import the virus at that point in time, hundreds of people would die, it would result in huge economic dislocation and for what? If we wait a few more months, we get our vaccination levels up to a higher level, we can avoid all of that."
Each week of lockdown in NSW and Victoria costs the economy an estimated $2 billion in lost output, while fiscal support from the federal government is worth hundreds of millions more per week. Mr Frydenberg has previously signalled that, for states that refuse to open up in line with the national plan, that financial support could be withdrawn.
Mr Oliver, the AMP economist who forecast negative growth in June and September, said that "in a purely economic sense, a recession doesn't mean much" but it could impact confidence, which in turn impacted the speed of
the recovery.
Mr Aird, the Commonwealth Bank economist, said that whether Australia officially entered recession later this year or not, "a huge number of people are stood down, the economy is going through a huge shock".
"Try telling someone in Victoria or NSW we aren't in recession ... however, we are almost certain to rebound in quarter four as things open up," he said.
Mr Frydenberg, who was last year a vocal critic of Victorian Premier Daniel Andrews' extended second wave lockdown, defended himself from criticism that he had not spoken out against NSW Premier Gladys Berejiklian's lockdown in the same way.
"My concern has always been first and foremost for the Victorian people, that is why I spoke up vigorously in their defence last year and that is why from day one of this pandemic I have ensured Victoria has received an unprecedented amount of economic support," said the MP for Kooyong in Melbourne's east.
"I have a good working relationship with my Victorian counterpart, Tim Pallas, and in the latest Victorians lockdown alone we have joined together to provide more than $2 billion in economic support."
Relations between the federal Liberal government and the state Labor government have eased somewhat. Mr Andrews recently noted the "federal Treasurer has taken a different tone and a different approach this year and I think Victorians are grateful for that".

Full text: THE Premier has locked out rate-paying citizens. Many are stuck in limbo for work or on a break around the country, not allowed to return home.
The state government is using just 22 hotels for quarantine. It’s ludicrous considering the occupancy rate in Gold Coast hotels is at a desperate low. This move spreads separation and fear and pits Queenslanders against the rest of the country.
What we need is safety and hope. It’s time Australians joined many other countries and learned to live with Covid.
Lockdowns are not sustainable. The emotional distress and economic damage to our communities, especially at the border, is too great a burden. We want and need our lives and freedoms back.
Delta zero is unrealistic. Elimination has never been the strategy. Even through strict lockdowns in NSW, community transmission continues. Importantly, the report on Friday from NSW outlined that 103 of 117 people in ICU are unvaccinated.
Underpinned by Doherty Institute modelling, the road to safety and hope has been created through the National Plan. The Premier has agreed to it in principle, at national cabinet.
The first phase is well underway with vaccinations accelerating. One million doses have been administered in just three days, outperforming the US and the UK, per capita.
The second phase is where hope grows. At 70 per cent of 16+ double jabbed, perhaps November, certainly December, easing of restrictions will allow domestic travel to resume for our tourism industry, local businesses and those families who rely on it. Part of that transition phase will be travel incentives for those who are vaccinated or the choice to quarantine for those who are not.
Phase three sees vaccination rates at 80 per cent. Here, we’ll be able to live with the virus in our community. The new reality where international travel can resume will allow a restart for the international education sector on the Gold Coast. Arrival caps and testing will be in place.
In phase four, Covid-19 will be managed as an infectious disease like any other. Annual vaccination boosters will be necessary, as they are now with flu.
Australians have proven throughout history that we are brave and resilient enough to endure whatever crises we face as a nation. Queenslanders and Gold Coasters are no exception.
The most pressing question must be asked: Will the Premier keep her word? Can she find the stuff to lay down the political weapon of border closures that has served her popularity so well?
If she resists, the public will rightly ask why travel and Tweed residents are still being denied when we have done what we’ve been asked.
If we don’t follow the plan to end restrictions at 70 and 80 per cent to reunite Australians, and reclaim our way of life, when can we Premier? Federal Member for Moncrieff

Wellcamp quarantine facility 'a game of politics'

Full text: The agreement between the Queensland government and Wagner Corporation to build a regional quarantine facility adjacent to Wellcamp Airport was dubbed 'a very important milestone' by Deputy Premier Steven Miles, but the community, local and federal governments aren't happy.
The announcement on Thursday morning came as a surprise to Toowoomba Regional Council Mayor Paul Antonio, who was not invited to the press conference at Wellcamp.
"I'm surprised that we haven't been on this journey, I'm surprised that we hadn't been told earlier," Cr Antonio said in his own press conference on Thursday afternoon.
"But in saying that, a decision has been made by the state government, they are legislatively able to make that kind of decision and I guess now the first thing I would ask is the state government visits Toowoomba as soon as they possibly can to give myself and my colleagues and this community an update."
Read more: Wellcamp quarantine facility to open this year Cr Antonio found out about the press conference by way of a phone call from one of the economic development groups in Toowoomba, asking if he had been invited to what was unfolding at Wellcamp.
"I happen to know a lot of things about the future of Toowoomba, some very exciting prospects that are coming our way, industry that's coming our way, and I naturally assumed that's what [the announcement] was," he said.
"I did ring the local federal member and he gave me the heads up, and then of course when I got back to my office my staff had been watching the TV, watching the announcement.
"It was very, very clear that we had been bypassed in the conversation and now we are having a quarantine facility being built here."
In response to the announcement, Cr Antonio said he clearly understands the concerns of many people in the Toowoomba area.
"You've only got to switch the TV on - today there's in excess of 1000 COVID infections in New South Wales, so COVID has the capacity to spread very quickly and I think anyone in Toowoomba who hears this news, naturally, would have some concerns about that," he said.
"The other thing I suggest to you is it will bring some economic benefit to Toowoomba and there will be some people who are certainly looking forward to that, but in saying all that, I think it is disappointing to me that we weren't brought on this journey.
"I would have been really pleased to share that, go on the journey and understand exactly what the state government had in mind.
"As a long-term, long-serving local government person, there's been a real lack of respect to this community and to myself personally, for me not knowing."
The mayor did however concede that a purpose-built facility was better than hotel quarantine.
"I think it's far better to have a hub similar to Howard Springs, and I think there's been no outbreaks from Howard Springs, and that sounds good to me," he said.
"That's better than having a CBD hub in Brisbane in a hotel facility that's not set up for it."
Ultimately, Cr Antonio says the Toowoomba community needs to be heard.
"I hope the state government is prepared to listen to some of the concerns of Toowoomba," he said.
"I would suggest also to [the community] that it's too late, this will happen.
"And it may be a good thing for the economy in Toowoomba. Let's hope there's no outbreaks, let's hope there's no problems with it, and let's hope that it's done well."
The Howard Springs model Mr Miles said the design and operation of the facility would be very closely modelled on the 'very successful' Howard Springs facility in the Northern Territory.
"It will be purpose built based on the learnings from that facility, therefore the infection control can keep our staff, the other people in the facility as well as the local community safe," he said.
"In fact, much much safer than non-purpose-built hotel quarantine accommodation where we currently have people.
"There will be a mix of single, double and family accommodation in cabin style with balconies, and importantly no hallways adjoining rooms which we have seen as vectors in hotel quarantine for the virus."
Mr Miles said they would continue to work through the details of the health and policing model that would be implemented at Wellcamp.
"COVID positive patients that require hospital care will be treated in one of the five COVID hospitals that we currently use, that we currently transfer people to," he said.
"By funding this facility ourselves and building this facility ourselves, we can ensure that it replaces current hotel quarantine usage that will allow us to take travellers that are within the cap and put them into this facility, reducing the need for hotel quarantine."
A game of politics In January, Queensland Country Life exclusively revealed Wagner Corporation and the Queensland government were in talks to build a quarantine hub.
The state government put the proposal to the federal government in a bid to have the project funded at the federal level, and from there 'a game of politics' ensued.
Prime Minister Scott Morrison eventually put the kibosh on the idea over allegations that the proposal for the facility lacked important 'detail' surrounding medical services and cost, and instead committed funding to a facility at Pinkenba.
Cr Antonio believes "there's a fair game of politics being played here", while Mr Miles has fired a shot at the federal government by saying "the work has started now, it's time for the politics to end".
Health Minister Yvette D'Ath also put the spotlight on the federal government.
"If this had been built months ago when we asked the Commonwealth to partner with us and the Wagners, we potentially may not have had to make the very difficult decision that we made yesterday to pause people domestically coming into hotel quarantine for a couple weeks," she said.
"But now we can move forward and we have this great facility that already construction is underway."
Ms D'Ath pointed to modelling from the Doherty Institute which 'has been talked about a lot' recently.
"Their own report says we will need to keep some public health measures in place - test, trace, isolate, quarantine - so even with high vaccination rates, we must continue these public health measures which means we will continue to need quarantine facilities and we need to make sure they're purpose built and they're keeping our community safe."
The lack of love between the state and federal leaders was clear throughout the press conference, but came to a precipice when one reporter asked Premier Annastacia Palaszczuk if the Prime Minister knew about the announcement.
"I'm quite sure he does now," the Premier responded.
Shortly after, the Prime Minister was asked about the announcement in his own press conference.
His response to the news that the Premier would fund the facility because his government wouldn't: "Well, she's been at liberty to do that for months."
"We've made it very clear that that facility did not seek to meet the national guidelines. And that's why we're going... forward together at Pinkenba," Mr Morrison said.
"But the Queensland government was always in a position to go ahead with that facility, if that's what they wish to do and to have people quarantine there rather than in hotel facilities.
"That is entirely a matter for the Queensland government, and they've made that decision.
"They could have done that months ago if that's what they wished to do. But good for them, and I wish them every success."

Younger teens to join the vaccination race

Full text: A plan to vaccinate children aged 12 to 15 is set to be unveiled on Friday, as the national cabinet plots the next steps in the plan to end lockdowns and heavy coronavirus restrictions.
Prime Minister Scott Morrison on Thursday confirmed that 1.2 million Australian children would be added to the rollout, pending final advice from its expert vaccines panel ATAGI.
The head of the vaccine rollout, Lieutenant-General John Frewen, briefed cabinet's national security committee on the plan on Thursday.
It will be put to state and territory leaders for approval at Friday's national cabinet meeting.
Leaders will also discuss what exemptions vaccinated people might be granted once Australia hits the 70 per cent and 80 per cent vaccination targets agreed to under the national roadmap.
Mr Morrison has this week stepped up pressure on the states to hold true to the plan, amid growing doubts over whether the Doherty Institute modelling which underpins the roadmap can still be relied upon given the worsening Delta outbreaks in Sydney and Melbourne.
The Prime Minister said on Thursday morning that with some 1.8 million doses now being administered across Australia each week, the addition of children aged 12 to 15 was "well within the capability of the vaccination program".
A rollout record 335,420 doses were administered in the most recent 24-hour period, with more than 32 per of over-16s now fully vaccinated.
The ATAGI panel has already approved the Pfizer vaccine for at-risk 12- to 15-year-olds, but has yet to make a final call on its use for other adolescents.
While the cohort is set to become eligible for the jab, it will not be included in the 70 per cent and 80 per cent community-wide targets, which need to be hit before restrictions start to ease under the national reopening plan.
ACT Chief Minister Andrew Barr has been pushing for 12- to 15-year-olds to be added to the national rollout, as Delta outbreaks in Canberra, Sydney and Melbourne all strike proportionately high numbers of younger, mostly unvaccinated, people.
Mr Barr confirmed on Thursday that the ACT would deviate from the national strategy and include 12- to 15-year-olds in its own vaccination targets.
Labor's Mark Butler said with countries such as the US and Canada vaccinating 12- to 15-year-olds as far back as May, Mr Morrison needed to explain why his government had dragged its feet in protecting younger Australians.

Mr Barr confirmed on Thursday that the ACT would deviate from the national strategy and include 12- to 15-year-olds in its own vaccination targets.
Labor's Mark Butler said with countries such as the US and Canada vaccinating 12- to 15-year-olds as far back as May, Mr Morrison needed to explain why his government had dragged its feet in protecting a cohort which had been on the the "front line" of Australia's "third wave".
"We deserve - parents deserve - a clear commitment from Scott Morrison about the rate of vaccination for Australia's high school students as we move to the next phases of the national plan," he said.
Greens health spokeswoman Rachel Siewert said it was "sickening" that children weren't included in the vaccination targets.

Greens health spokeswoman Rachel Siewert said it was "sickening" that children weren't included in the vaccination targets.

Full text: A plan to vaccinate children aged 12 to 15 is set to be unveiled on Friday, as the national cabinet plots the next steps in the plan to end lockdowns and heavy coronavirus restrictions.
Prime Minister Scott Morrison on Thursday confirmed that 1.2 million Australian children would be added to the rollout, pending final advice from its expert vaccines panel ATAGI.
The head of the vaccine rollout, Lieutenant-General John Frewen, briefed cabinet's national security committee on the plan on Thursday.
It will be put to state and territory leaders for approval at Friday's national cabinet meeting.
Leaders will also discuss what exemptions vaccinated people might be granted once Australia hits the 70 per cent and 80 per cent vaccination targets agreed to under the national roadmap.
Mr Morrison has this week stepped up pressure on the states to hold true to the plan, amid growing doubts over whether the Doherty Institute modelling which underpins the roadmap can still be relied upon given the worsening Delta outbreaks in Sydney and Melbourne.
The Prime Minister said on Thursday morning that with some 1.8 million doses now being administered across Australia each week, the addition of children aged 12 to 15 was "well within the capability of the vaccination program".
A rollout record 335,420 doses were administered in the most recent 24-hour period, with more than 32 per of over-16s now fully vaccinated.
The ATAGI panel has already approved the Pfizer vaccine for at-risk 12- to 15-year-olds, but has yet to make a final call on its use for other adolescents.
While the cohort is set to become eligible for the jab, it will not be included in the 70 per cent and 80 per cent community-wide targets, which need to be hit before restrictions start to ease under the national reopening plan. ACT Chief Minister Andrew Barr has been pushing for 12- to 15-year-olds to be added to the national rollout, as Delta outbreaks in Canberra, Sydney and Melbourne all strike proportionately high numbers of younger, mostly unvaccinated, people. About 38 per cent of the cases in Canberra's outbreak are people aged under 17.
Mr Barr confirmed on Thursday that the ACT would deviate from the national strategy and include 12- to 15-year-olds in its own vaccination targets.
Labor's Mark Butler said with countries such as the US and Canada vaccinating 12- to 15-year-olds as far back as May, Mr Morrison needed to explain why his government had dragged its feet in protecting a cohort which had been on the the "front line" of Australia's "third wave".
"We deserve - parents deserve - a clear commitment from Scott Morrison about the rate of vaccination for Australia's high school students as we move to the next phases of the national plan," he said.

Infection case spike hits record territory

Full text: The ACT has recorded its biggest spike in Covid-19 cases since the territory’s Delta outbreak began nearly two weeks ago, with total infections rising by 30 to 167.
Chief Minister Andrew Barr on Tuesday said four people were in hospital and one of them, a 40-year-old woman, was in intensive care.
Only 13 of the 30 new cases were in quarantine for their entire infectious period, while 11 were infectious in the community. Six cases remain under investigation, with more than 400 exposure sites across the ACT.
ACT chief health officer Kerryn Coleman said while the high number of cases might have come as a shock to many Canberrans, it was not necessarily surprising to health authorities.
She said it was a reminder of how fast the Delta strain of the virus could move through the community. “Specifically of these new cases today, I can confirm that out of the 30, 25 can be linked to known cases or ongoing clusters,” Dr Coleman said.
“We know that 21 of the 25 are actually household contacts, and the remaining four come from ­existing clusters.” She said the woman in intensive care had not been vaccinated and urged those living in the ACT to book an appointment to get immunised.
Mr Barr echoed the call. “The more Canberrans who are vaccinated, the better protected our community will be from the virus and from the decisions of other governments that are beyond the control of the ACT government,” he said.
“Vaccination remains absolutely critical in stopping the spread of the virus and protecting our community.” He reiterated his desire for the territory to achieve a higher vaccination rate than the 70 to 80 per cent figure flagged by Doherty Institute modelling as a threshold to start easing restrictions.
More than 60 per cent of Canberra adults have now had at least one jab. Mr Barr said it was too early to speculate on how long the lockdown – which is scheduled to end on September 2 – would last.

Full text: From page 1 In her personal opinion, children should have the vaccine.
Professor MacIntyre said all virus modelling systems, whether it be the ANU report or Grattan Institute or Doherty Institute, worked on assumptions and this was not always clear.
"If only 70 to 80 per cent of eligible people are vaccinated, that number translates to 60 to 64 per cent of the whole population. That matters," she said. "...That's not enough against Delta without some restrictions.
"We learnt that lesson from the UK, US and Israel which, although all countries had high vaccination rates, lifted restrictions in May this year and had massive COVID outbreaks. They've had to bring back non-pharmaceutical measures, like mask mandates. We won't be able to lift all restrictions."
Ballarat has 35.4 per cent of residents aged 15-plus fully vaccinated with access only starting to open up to under-40s. This is higher than the Australian jab rate of 30.9 per cent.
Committee for Ballarat chief Michael Poulton welcomed the opening-up of jabs to younger people but urged those who already had bookings to keep them, rather than join the queue.
Mr Poulton hoped young people would help drive the city's general jab rates higher by setting an example.
"It's terrific young people have been given the opportunity and it's terrific to have so much enthusiasm from younger generations in getting the vaccine," Mr Poulton said. "...If a 16-year-old has a conversation about getting a vaccination, it might make a collaborative opportunity to book in the whole family."

Political push heating up, but is it what voters want?

Full text: Politicians will have a temperature sensor put to their foreheads today when they turn up to federal Parliament to begin two weeks of debate with tempers flaring over the pandemic.
It is safe to expect some heat readings to be off the charts.
The Parliament is split, like the community, over the best way out of lockdowns that have sent employers into hibernation, put the economy into reverse and forced millions into their homes.
But there may be no better time for Parliament to meet.
The very fact of the sitting is a message in itself. Rather than try to suspend Parliament, the government kept to the timetable even though it meant putting MPs from all sides in isolation.
It is even more important when questions about the pandemic are being restricted to daily press conferences featuring premiers, chief health officers and journalists who are routinely scolded for challenging claims. The usual forums for debate have fallen silent: the Victorian Parliament is suspended and the NSW Parliament is not sitting.
That creates an opportunity for federal Labor leader Anthony Albanese to subject Prime Minister Scott Morrison to scrutiny over the risk of relaxing lockdown rules when vaccination rates hit 70 and 80 per cent. Morrison insists he is right on the national cabinet plan but is not releasing the latest advice from the Doherty Institute on its modelling. But the time for secrets is over.
With voters anxious ahead of an election, Morrison is wary of being direct. Asked a question, he can be a little like the Leyland brothers - travelling all over the countryside before he gets to the point.
The spear thrower for the government is Treasurer Josh Frydenberg, who has been speaking plainly in the past few days about what "living with the virus" means.
"What we have to do is be honest with the public that by living with COVID there'll be cases, by living with COVID there'll be people in hospital, and living with COVID there'll be deaths," Frydenberg says.
"But at the same time getting high levels of vaccination reduces the likelihood that lockdowns will be required and reduces the likelihood that people who get vaccinated will get sick."
Morrison kept that up yesterday by saying case numbers should not be the main measure of the pandemic and it was time to focus on serious illness and hospitalisation, which are lower thanks to vaccinations.
It is a difficult conversation at a time of real strain on the nation. With so much of the country shut, the Parliament may even serve a useful purpose. If the politicians can get past the temperature test.

It is safe to expect some heat readings to be off the charts.
The Parliament is split, like the community, over the best way out of lockdowns that have sent employers into hibernation, put the economy into reverse and forced millions into their homes.
But there may be no better time for Parliament to meet. Australians have low expectations for their politicians but the sitting comes at a critical point in the argument about when to ease the lockdown rules.
The very fact of the sitting is a message in itself. Rather than try to suspend Parliament, the government kept to the timetable even though it meant putting MPs from all sides in isolation for two weeks before the sitting.
To do otherwise, and give up, would have fatally undermined the message that the country has to "live with the virus" and get on with things.
It is even more important when questions about the pandemic are being restricted to daily press conferences featuring premiers, chief health officers and journalists who are routinely scolded for stepping out of line. The usual forums for debate have fallen silent: the Victorian Parliament is suspended and the NSW Parliament is not sitting, although some committees continue.
That creates an opportunity for federal Labor leader Anthony Albanese to subject Prime Minister Scott Morrison to scrutiny over the risk of relaxing lockdown rules when vaccination rates hit 70 and 80 per cent.
Morrison insists he is right on the national cabinet plan but is not releasing the latest advice from the Doherty Institute on its modelling. But the time for keeping secrets is over. Every assessment needs to be made public.
Other voices in the government are making a strong case that it is time to level with voters. Some Liberals want to stiffen the Prime Minister's spine and make sure the premiers and chief ministers do not force a federal retreat. With voters anxious ahead of an election, Morrison is wary of being direct.

Full text: Oh, for leaders with vision ALL Victorians, along with our fellow Australians, are entitled to feel confused and miserable.
We can’t know what next week holds, much less next month or next year. Some countries have plans for the uncertainty of Covid. Unlike Australia, such countries boast a unity of purpose and transparency of approach that seeks to protect the vulnerable while also avoiding the growing emotional and economic costs of lockdowns.
Take Israel, a world leader in the fight, where the people are receiving booster shots and lockdowns are now considered “a last resort”.
Prime Minister Naftali Bennett has outlined the actions of his government, and the responsibility of his citizens, in the pursuit of “safe shores” (see opposite page).
He has explained the challenges, and the necessary responses, with candour and singular intent. He offers evidence for his conclusions. Better yet, he gives his people hope.
“It would be easy to declare a lockdown and give money to closed businesses and the workers sitting at home,” he said. “But the policy of lockdowns has a terrible price … “Let’s think about the number of motor vehicle accidents. It would be possible to reduce to zero the number of fatalities from traffic accidents by banning travel on Israel’s highways. But we all understand that we have to live and allow traffic in Israel. Thus it is with the Delta strain. Daily routine is part of life and we must find a responsible balance.” Mr Bennett puts a price on lockdowns. The children who might miss out on lifesaving operations. The MRI machines that would go unfinanced. The pensioners who could not be paid. And the staggering debt that will seep through generations.
“We are the only country in which vaccines are available for everyone and the only one in which there is a third dose, a booster,” he said. “This is not a given and it is possible thanks for our hard work.” Contrast his thinking with Australia, where our two biggest cities face indefinite lockdowns, and a federal government has been exposed, again and again, for reacting to crises as they happen, as opposed to anticipating challenges with long-term thinking.
Mixed messages dominate. According to NSW Premier Gladys Berejiklian, parts of Sydney can re-emerge when vaccination rates hit 70 per cent and Sydneysiders produce vaccination certificates.
On the other side of the country, West Australian Premier Mark McGowan will not guarantee a future free of lockdowns, even if the magic target of 80 per cent vaccinations is reached.
Here in Victoria, questions mount. Premier Dan Andrews called Friday “a bad day”. When was the last good day?
What will happen when vaccination rates hit 70 per cent, projected to be in November?
When will kids be able to go to school? When will the vaccinated be allowed to rediscover the many lost pleasures once taken for granted? And when will the damned curfew end?
For a brief time, the nation seemed to co-operate after the release of the Doherty plan, which spoke of a “national transition” to a “national Covid response” away from lockdowns.
The modelling was based on 70 and 80 per cent vaccination rates. University of Melbourne professor of mathematical biology James McCaw, who contributed to the study, said the road map was based on managing virus spread in the community.
“Effective management of circulating virus without lockdowns requires high vaccine coverage and it requires there not to be a lot of cases in the community,” he said.
Herein lies an obvious problem. In Melbourne, as well as Sydney, lockdowns have not stemmed exponential rises in case numbers. Knee-jerk responses dominate the projected courses. In Victoria, we lack any horizon of optimism.
In an open letter published on Friday, News Corp Australasia’s executive chairman Michael Miller called on all leaders to “champion the vaccination rollout and participate in it every way we can” to get the country “back to full operations”.
“We have to urgently rediscover our Australian sense of purpose and unity and show the world what a fully vaccinated, fully functioning nation can achieve,” Mr Miller said.
“People who have already endured so much disruption and upheaval do not deserve to be kept in a state of isolation and uncertainty without a clear path forward.” He warned the country was “falling behind”.
“I’m asking state and national leaders to agree on, and be fully committed to, national targets and a national timetable for when we can achieve a vaccination level that will allow all Australians to plan for life in a new normal state of affairs,” he said.
Other countries have such charters. They show that a shared promise of something better can be pursued in the Covid chaos.
Australia is far bigger than self-interested fiefdoms. Its leaders have steered courses through world wars so the country prospered in the aftermaths. They held the nation together with more than empty invocations of trust. When will our leaders get their act together, not only for its fatigued and confused people, but also for the generations ahead who will pay for the acute lack of vision in this time of crisis?

Full text: EXCLUSIVE VICTORIAN doctors are ­ad­min­istering less than half as many vaccine doses as their NSW counterparts every day, leaving our state lagging in the race to meet targets to reopen.
Based on current averages, 70 per cent of Victorian adults will be fully vaccinated against Covid-19 by November 21 – five days after the nation reaches that critical mark to limit lockdowns and ease ­restrictions on the vaccinated.
Victoria is on pace to hit the 80 per cent target by December 13 – three weeks after NSW and also slower than Tasmania, the ACT and the Northern Territory. Under the national cabinet’s plan, states can progress through the reopening phases once the vaccine targets have been met both nationally and in their own jurisdictions.
In NSW, the vaccination rate has drastically increased amid its worsening outbreak. Over the past week, NSW GPs delivered 398,940 doses compared to 172,405 doses by Victorian GPs.
The performance of state-run vaccination facilities across the two biggest states has been more comparable, with the jab rate in Victoria’s mass hubs now being lifted by the rush of people under 40 getting the ­Astra­Zeneca vaccine.
The Herald Sun can reveal that since Scott Morrison open­ed the door at the end of June for under-40s to access AstraZeneca, 31,510 young Victorians have received a first dose and 12,635 have had both.
Premier Daniel Andrews said on Tuesday that Victorians aged 18-39 were making an appointment every seven seconds for the jab.
A total of 2366 first doses of AstraZeneca were administered in that age group on Monday, which Health Minister Martin Foley said was a three-fold increase on the previous Monday. More than 13,000 young Victorians have also booked in to be vaccinated since the state government at the weekend ­allow­ed hubs to start giving Astra­Zeneca to under 40s.
But Wyndham Council on Tuesday night urgently called on the state government to provide a local seven-day-a-week vaccination hub for 18-39 year-olds. Mayor Adele Hegedich said the LGA’s young people had been ignored.
“Fifty-six per cent of Wyndham’s 280,000 residents are under 35 and, as the recent outbreak has demonstrated, they desperately need access to vaccinations,” she said.
“Currently, the closest state-run vaccination hub is in Sunshine or Geelong.” In more concerning developments last night, the Caroline Springs Square Shopping Centre was deemed a Tier 1 exposure site from August 2 to August 5 for all staff.
Australian Medical Association state president Roderick McRae warned some GPs were feeling “jaded and fatigued”, and more had doses that were about to expire than problems obtaining more supplies. “Many GPs, and probably more their staff, have been abused by frustrated and angry people,” he said.
“They have had plenty of people cancel, particularly second AstraZeneca (doses).” Dr McRae said he expected the rollout would accelerate as ­eligibility was expanded. “One of the key mechanisms of us all getting out of these recurrent lockdowns is to have a high per­cent­age of [us] vaccinated.” University of South Australia biostatistics expert Professor Adrian Esterman said increasing supplies of Pfizer, coupled with the arrival of the Moderna vaccine next month, meant all jurisdictions would be able to significantly ramp up rollouts.
“The key there is not to rely on GPs but rely on pharmacists and vaccine hubs, which I’m sure the Victorian government will do,” he said. Victorians in their 30s are expected to get access to Pfizer and Moderna within weeks, in line with modelling from the Doherty Institute that showed younger adults were the most likely to spread the virus. Mr Foley said it was clear there was a “strong emphasis” among young people to get vaccinated.
“Clearly, young people have assessed their personal situation in a strong and informed manner and many are determining that there are significant risks in remaining unvac­cinated during the Delta out­break, and during lockdown, and they’ve made a ­decision where their interests and the community’s interest lies,” he said.
“They’re doing it for themselves, for their family and for their local community and cultural organisations ”.

Full text: CHIEF Minister Michael Gunner’s decision to break ranks with his fellow state and territory leaders and go out on his own in terms of when to end lockdowns in the Territory is clearly driven by concern for our most vulnerable.
“If remote communities require a higher rate of vaccination, that impacts my policy decisions going forward,” he said.
“I need really high vaccination rates here, probably higher than the Doherty Institute is flagging in their modelling.” It’s hard to argue with that assessment, the Territory’s many remote Indigenous communities are uniquely vulnerable to the ravages of Covid-19 and if the insidious disease were to find a foothold in any of them it could be disastrous on a grand scale.
So it makes sense that the 70 per cent vaccination target set for the rest of the nation might not be appropriate for the NT.
But all that said, it’s not good enough to have no plan at all. While most Territorians will readily accept the need to protect the most vulnerable in our community is rightly Mr Gunner’s foremost consideration, some vision for the future is also required.
If 70 per cent is too low then fine. If the figure is more than 80 per cent then so be it. But whatever it is, we need to work it out sooner rather than later so we can all get back to normal.

Cabinet refuses to back bosses ordering workers to get jab

Full text: WE can’t end lockdowns without vaccination but National Cabinet has decided not to set rules about who can be ordered to get the jab.
Now Scott Morrison has warned bosses wanting to force their workers to get the jab must comply with federal discrimination legislation.
National Cabinet on Friday considered advice from the federal Solicitor-General Stephen Donaghue cautioning that under current federal legislation employers will need to tread carefully about how they ­instruct employees about vaccination or they could easily find themselves in court.
And it stepped back from making any changes to the rules that would make it clear to Australians in what circumstances employers can order their staff to take the jab.
This is despite major firms in the US and UK ordering staff to get the jab. The PM said the question of what bosses were allowed to do would turn on the question of reasonableness.
He said that “ultimately employers need to consider these matters and make their own decisions, remembering we do not have a mandatory vaccination policy in this country. We do not have that. We’re not proposing to have that. That is not changing. An employer may make a reasonable directive to staff” but any employer making such a ­direction “will have to stay consistent with the law”.
So far the only workers required to get vaccinated for their jobs have been done so under states’ public health orders.
In other developments Nat­ional Cabinet has now “fully agreed” to live with the virus once 70 per cent of the population is vaccinated. Under the Doherty Institute’s modelling, lockdowns should be abandoned when the country reaches 80 per cent vaccination.
But despite “extensive discussions”, Cabinet stepped back from allowing more extensive use of rapid antigen testing, which would allow employers to test staff each day for Covid. The PM said their use would be more appropriate after the current suppression phase.

Full text: ANALYSIS THE Delta variant moves rapidly – and so does the political response. It was barely a month ago that Premier Daniel Andrews, in his first week back at work after his injury, signed up to the national cabinet’s plan to “transition” the nation’s approach to Covid-19.
In black and white, the leaders declared lockdowns were “to be used only as a last resort”.
Victoria is now locked down for the second time since then. We will wake on Friday to kids missing school, shop owners shutting their doors, florists throwing out flowers, lovers cancelling weddings.
And instead of criticism from Canberra, the Premier’s hard-and-fast approach is fully backed by Scott Morrison — because it’s now the national cabinet’s preferred response. Last Friday, they changed their minds and agreed that until at least 70 per cent of the adult population was fully vaccinated, state leaders should pull the trigger on “early, stringent and short lockdowns if outbreaks occur”.
Announcing Victoria’s sixth lockdown on Thursday evening — barely 32 hours after celebrating a zero-case day — Andrews said with a handful of mystery cases, he simply had “no alternative”.
“We only get one chance to go fast,” he said, warning that the state could otherwise be locked down until Christmas without the snap shutdown.
Front of mind for Andrews, the Prime Minister and their national cabinet colleagues is the Sydney experience, where Gladys Berejiklian held out on harsh restrictions and inadvertently fuelled a public health bushfire that seems likely to run for weeks – if not months – to come. In the face of the Delta variant, snap lockdowns are now backed by the Doherty Institute as the right health response and the federal Treasury as the right economic response – endorsements Andrews was quick to cite on Thursday.
That will be cold comfort for Victorians, who have now spent more than six months in lockdown in the 500 days since Australia was first frozen to “flatten the curve”.
In the darkest days of last year’s deadly second wave, Andrews maintained the state would gain from that pain.
“We won’t spend 2021 bouncing in and out of lockdowns,” he promised. And yet here we are.
The Doherty Institute’s modelling makes it clear that we have little chance of controlling the Delta variant and preventing widespread loss of life until far more Australians are vaccinated.
That means our sixth lockdown is unlikely to be our last. It must also mean that the federal government throws absolutely everything into fast-tracking the delivery of every single dose it can get its hands on.
Victorians are a remarkably resilient bunch but there is only so much they can take. They have done everything governments have asked them to do – it’s well past time their sacrifices were repaid with vaccines for all. tom.minear@news.com.au

Full text: Australia could reach 80 per cent vaccination rates and be free of the threat of lockdowns by ­November if it matches the world-leading pace set by Canada, economists say.
Scott Morrison this week said reaching the 70 per cent threshold by the end of the year was ­“absolutely achievable” if “we all turn up to the task and we have a gold medal run till Christmas”.
Jarden chief economist Carlos Cacho said that the pace of vaccination would ramp up in October with the arrival of more Pfizer doses. With the pace of the rollout no longer limited by supply from that point, Mr Cacho then looked at the experience of other advanced economies to project when Australia might reach thresholds laid out by the ­Doherty Institute.
That epidemiological modelling identified a national vaccination rate of 70 per cent of the adult population (aged 16 and over) as the point at which the country could begin to manage Covid-19 outbreaks without ­resorting to lockdowns, or Phase B of the government’s transition plan. At 80 per cent, in Phase C, hardline health measures ­become even less likely and fully vaccinated Australians would be able to escape remaining ­restrictions.
Mr Cacho said he expected the national 70 per cent threshold to be achieved by November or December, and the 80 per cent threshold by January or February next year.
“While it is possible that the recent surge in vaccinations can be maintained and see Sydney reach the 70 per cent threshold by early to mid-September, we think a more likely outcome is some moderation after reaching 50-60 per cent and achieving the 70 per cent threshold in late September to early October, with lockdowns potentially remaining in place until then,” he said.
Deutsche Bank chief economist Phil Odonaghoe, who compared vaccination rollouts across eight OECD countries, said that “while vaccine supplies and strategies vary significantly across the group, a hopeful sign is that even the slowest in the group to reach the threshold, Hungary, did so on a timeline that could see Australia reach its (70 per cent) target in early November”.
“If Australia can match the ­average rollout speed of our group of eight, (Iceland, Chile, ­Israel, Canada, Spain, Belgium, the UK and Hungary) the first threshold could be reached on October 8,” he said.
Even at the current trajectory – and without any acceleration – seven in 10 Australians would be fully inoculated by December, Mr Odonaghoe said. NAB economist Taylor ­Nugent said “a plausible acceleration in the rollout based on international experience suggests we could get to 70 per cent by late October and 80 per cent by mid-November”.

Opening up tougher than locking us down

Full text: AUSTRALIA right now is a nation of house cats. We are skittish and jumpy and even though the front door is about to open, we still don’t know whether we really want to go outside or not. The dilemma was captured in two spectacles this past week.
First, there was Scott Morrison standing out front of the Lodge last Friday night in full ­nation-building mode, setting what might generously be called ambitious vaccination targets of 70 and 80 per cent, with a road map to get us out of this endless rinse and repeat cycle of lockdowns. This when Israel, which leads the world in jabbing its citizens, has ­barely cleared 62 per cent double dosed – and with a big head start too.
Then, on Monday, Queensland chief health officer Jeannette Young used the second press conference of lockdown to pull the handbrake on the Prime Minister’s moon shot vaccination program: “I said I didn’t want 18-year-olds to have AstraZeneca and I still don’t. Even now.” Young would go on to soften her stance just a bit but, in the process, she revealed the biggest problem with the government’s road map.
Far beyond asking us to hit marks no other nation has been able to achieve, or being way too vague about dates or when we will stop letting health bureaucrats decide what “low-level restrictions” we still have to live with, the real problem is it relies on the goodwill of states such as Queensland, Victoria, and Western Australia to stick with the program.
Hence the problem.
Obviously we cannot stay locked up forever. But it is a huge challenge for the PM, whose only ­really reliable ally in the push to ­reopen Australia is Gladys Berejiklian – and even they have been at loggerheads over just how Sydney’s present lockdown is going to end.
Given Treasury’s new quick-smart disaster relief payments scheme which takes the financial pressure off, and the fact Morrison’s election hopes ride on him coming through as “Mr 80 per cent”, it’s not hard to imagine Labor premiers working to derail reopening just as they have done so much to derail national cabinet.
But in opening up the country again, psychology will play as much a part as politics.
Australia’s Covid experience has been different to most other nations. Because we have had barely any deaths compared to other nations since the start of the pandemic, we also now have far less tolerance for any deaths at all as we see the pandemic out. And, despite all the businesses smashed, psyches wrecked and opportunities and time gone forever, there are plenty of people who for a variety of reasons like lockdown.
But nothing is forever and rapidly rising vaccination rates will quickly undermine Fortress Australia’s ­foundations. As the number of Australians with both jabs approaches 50 per cent, calls will rise for more exemptions from border closures and other restrictions.
One good way to manage this would be to seek modelling on more than just the costs of lockdowns, as was presented to back up the Doherty Institute’s targets on Tuesday.
Putting the cost of minimising Covid against the cost of keeping international and domestic borders closed, personal uncertainty, mental health damage, lost classroom time, and so much else, would provide the evidence needed to lower targets, or reframe them again towards protecting the vulnerable. More talk about how we deal with risk in a free society would also help. For the past 18 months, the tension between saving lives and living life has always been resolved by coming down on the side of safety. But if we enshrine the “right” not to be infected with Covid as the starting point for all our thinking, we will trample a lot of other freedoms as well.

Road map a welcome dose of hope

Full text: Finally - we have a plan. On Friday afternoon national cabinet agreed to a four-stage "transition" to a post-vaccinated Australia, a welcome dose of hope amid the stubborn Sydney outbreak and Saturday's shock lockdown in Queensland.
Spelling out immunisation targets and the rewards that will follow from success, including the resumption of overseas travel, the plan offers - at long last - a road map to normal life.
It is also a reality check, recognising that until we reach vaccination goals (of, first, 70 per cent total immunisation, then 80 per cent, derived from modelling by the Doherty Institute and advice from Treasury), "early, stringent and short" lockdowns will remain part of the states' arsenal to combat COVID outbreaks alongside contact tracing, testing and isolation.
This acknowledgement will, hopefully, ameliorate the tedious and destructive debate about appropriate action - to lock down or not - each time a spike in cases occurs. What the plan does not spell out, though, is how Australia will actually get to the required immunisation thresholds.
While vaccination rates have accelerated promisingly in recent weeks, Australia, at about 14 per cent fully vaccinated, is still a long way short of the 70 per cent Prime Minister Scott Morrison said he hoped to achieve by the end of the year.
We do not need to revisit the failures of the vaccine rollout here. Signs are good that supply is no longer an issue, notwithstanding continuing confusion over the AstraZeneca offering.
It is also encouraging that, as we reported yesterday, major employers such as Woolworths, Wesfarmers and Coles are actively recommending their staff get the jab, with some offering incentives such as special paid vaccine leave to attend appointments.
It is also positive that organisers of major sporting events such as the Ashes and the Australian Open tennis are looking for models - such as Wimbledon's "passport" ticket system - that could work here.
Mr Morrison is right when he says vaccination should be a community effort. "It's not something that any one government, any one vaccination clinic, any one Australian can achieve on their own," he said.
Governments do have an executive role, though, when a community is endangered, when they must weigh up the greater good of vaccination programs against the rights of individuals to not be vaccinated.
In Australia, we generally accept that vaccination is a greater good. Take the Victorian precedent of no-jab, no-play rules around preschool attendance: we believe it is reasonable children be vaccinated before they attend preschool.
Mr Morrison may have intimated a similar proposal is under consideration for the COVID vaccine rollout on Friday when he said "there will be special rules" for people who are vaccinated. His remark echoes a proposal in the road map for "incentives and other measures" to encourage vaccine uptake.
While the detail is vague to say the least, we can look overseas to see what those measures might look like.
In Britain, where the immunisation rate is now above 50 per cent, Prime Minister Boris Johnson is making full vaccination the condition of entry to nightclubs and other venues with large crowds by the end of September.
Israel's "green pass" system allows access to gyms, hotels, theatres and bars for the fully vaccinated. France, Greece and Italy all have similar "passport" requirements or are in the process of introducing them for entry to cinemas, museums, restaurants and the like.
We can imagine all too well why our government is as yet just hinting at similar measures, with all their attendant complexities, from non-compliance to legal challenges to protests from anti-vaxxers, not to mention the inevitable technical glitches. Nevertheless, until the vaccination rate accelerates greatly, we believe such a scheme is worthy of serious consideration.

The 16.8m shots to freedom

Full text: Scott Morrison has set a goal to fully vaccinate a further 10.7 million Australians by the end of the year under a national reopening plan that will reduce restrictions for inoculated residents, ­resume some international travel and make lockdowns less likely.
Following a marathon national cabinet meeting on Friday, the Prime Minister unveiled a new four-phase national plan that sets a vaccine coverage target of 70 per cent before the country can move out of the current suppression phase.
With more than 3.7 million people already fully vaccinated, a further 10.7 million will have to ­receive both jabs to reach the ­target of 70 per cent of all Australians eligible for the vaccine, or 14.4 million people.
A further 16.8 million vaccine doses will be required to hit the 70 per cent target.
The reopening blueprint, based on health and economic modelling provided by the Doherty ­Institute and Treasury, outlines four stages ending in a post-­vaccination phase where Australians live with Covid-19 in a similar way to influenza.
The Weekend Australian ­understands there will be enough supply to jab all eligible Australians twice before the end of the year and the federal government is increasingly confident it can hit 80 per cent coverage by December, advancing the country to the third phase of the plan.
Under phase three, there will be targeted lockdowns in exceptional scenarios, restrictions on vaccinated Australians will be ­lifted, new travel bubbles opened and caps increased for student, economic and humanitarian visa holders.
In the fourth phase, uncapped international travel will resume with quarantine reserved for high-risk travellers and vaccine boosters provided as necessary.
Mr Morrison, who said that within days vaccinated people would have a digital wallet recording their inoculations, said travellers coming into the country would need to be vaccinated with a dose “recognised in Australia”.
“By the time we get to that stage, digital vaccination certificates for many nations will ­already be in place,” he said. ­“Indeed for Australia it will be in place.” On the back of another day of record vaccinations that pushed national vaccine coverage to 18.24 per cent, Mr Morrison said he was confident the nation could hit 70 per cent by December.
“I believe we can get this done but it’s not something that any one government, any one vaccination clinic, any one Australian can achieve on their own – it’s done as a team effort,” he said.
Industry groups questioned the reality of hitting a 70 per cent vaccine rate by December and warned that until the next phases of the national plan were unlocked, business would need to “brace itself for disruption for at least the next six months”.
The in-principle agreement struck by federal, state and territory leaders on Friday does not include specific timelines and will require Australia-wide average vaccination rates to reach 70 and 80 per cent before any one jurisdiction can move to the next step.
Mr Morrison said the national plan would “chart the way back” out of the suppression phase, currently dominated by the extended lockdown in NSW and avoiding outbreaks of the more contagious Delta strain.
“Under this plan, no state or territory is required to increase the restrictions beyond where they are right now. They are a matter for them to set based on the balance of risk that they see in their state or territory,” Mr Morrison said. “There is no state or jurisdiction in the country that wants to apply a lockdown or hold Australians back should it not be necessary. What the modelling … showed us was that when you get to that 70 per cent level you have achieved a level of coverage which enables you to then ease into that process.” He said the national plan was “not about freedom days”.
“We have made our own Australian way through this,” he said. “Sure, we’ve acted with a lot of caution. That’s why there are 30,000 Australians today who are still alive because of that and the decisions that we’ve taken.
“We don’t go from shut one day, open the next. That is a very dangerous path. What we need to do is take steps towards that – sensible, cautious steps. We get to 70 per cent. So let’s get there and then we get to 80 per cent and we make that work and then we get to the next level.” West Australian Premier Mark McGowan said the 70 per cent target was “fairly modest”, flagging the more significant change would come with the third phase, which requires an 80 per cent threshold. “In any event, the exact criteria within each of the phases isn’t resolved as yet,” he said. “Some are agreed but not all, and a range of states and territories will work on that over the coming weeks to nail that down. We do need a road map, we need to understand what the plan is.” Queensland Premier Annastacia Palaszczuk said the in-­principle agreement was to achieve 70 and 80 per cent vaccine coverage before states could move to “more limited lockdowns … when needed”. “In the meantime with the threat of variants like Delta we still maintain a strategy of hard and fast lockdowns because they are so fast moving,” she said.
Australian Industry Group chief executive Innes Willox said business needed to brace itself for disruption for at least the next six months while lockdowns were a component of “formal national policy”. “We need a formal end point for this disruption no matter the take-up rate,” he said. “Once everyone eligible has been ­offered a vaccine we need to move to the next phase and not be held hostage to vaccine hesitancy and opposition.
“Our economic recovery depends on all our leaders sticking by their agreements, something they have found impossible to abide by to this point.” With more than one billion doses of AstraZeneca now supplied globally, Mr Morrison urged Australians to book an appointment for the jab as the domestic take-up of the vaccine increased. “If you want to get vaccinated, the AZ vaccine is there for you. It is a highly effective vaccine,” he said.

The in-principle agreement struck by federal, state and territory leaders on Friday does not include specific timelines and will require Australia-wide average vaccination rates to reach 70 and 80 per cent before any one jurisdiction can move to the next step.
Mr Morrison said the national plan would “chart the way back” out of the suppression phase, currently dominated by the extended lockdown in NSW and avoiding outbreaks of the more contagious Delta strain.
“Under this plan, no state or territory is required to increase the restrictions beyond where they are right now. They are a matter for them to set based on the balance of risk that they see in their state or territory,” Mr Morrison said. “There is no state or jurisdiction in the country that wants to apply a lockdown or hold Australians back should it not be necessary. What the modelling … showed us was that when you get to that 70 per cent level you have achieved a level of coverage which enables you to then ease into that process.” He said the national plan was “not about freedom days”.
“We have made our own Australian way through this,” he said. “Sure, we’ve acted with a lot of caution. That’s why there are 30,000 Australians today who are still alive because of that and the decisions that we’ve taken.
“We don’t go from shut one day, open the next. That is a very dangerous path. What we need to do is take steps towards that – sensible, cautious steps. We get to 70 per cent. So let’s get there and then we get to 80 per cent and we make that work and then we get to the next level.” West Australian Premier Mark McGowan said the 70 per cent target was “fairly modest”, flagging the more significant change would come with the third phase, which requires an 80 per cent threshold. “In any event, the exact criteria within each of the phases isn’t resolved as yet,” he said. “Some are agreed but not all, and a range of states and territories will work on that over the coming weeks to nail that down. We do need a road map, we need to understand what the plan is.” Queensland Premier Annastacia Palaszczuk said the in-­principle agreement was to achieve 70 and 80 per cent vaccine coverage before states could move to “more limited lockdowns … when needed”. “In the meantime with the threat of variants like Delta we still maintain a strategy of hard and fast lockdowns because they are so fast moving,” she said.
Australian Industry Group chief executive Innes Willox said business needed to brace itself for disruption for at least the next six months while lockdowns were a component of “formal national policy”. “We need a formal end point for this disruption no matter the take-up rate,” he said. “Once everyone eligible has been ­offered a vaccine we need to move to the next phase and not be held hostage to vaccine hesitancy and opposition.
“Our economic recovery depends on all our leaders sticking by their agreements, something they have found impossible to abide by to this point.” With more than one billion doses of AstraZeneca now supplied globally, Mr Morrison urged Australians to book an appointment for the jab as the domestic take-up of the vaccine increased. “If you want to get vaccinated, the AZ vaccine is there for you. It is a highly effective vaccine,” he said.

Full text: Morrison’s move on vaccines is the start of the endgame – but it all hinges on the premiers At last there is a pathway, a plan, maybe even a light at the end of the tunnel. Scott Morrison called it an agreement “in principle”. Facing a deepening Delta-induced crisis in NSW, the national cabinet agreed late on Friday on a strategy to take Australia out of the pandemic.
It hinges entirely on vaccination. It will be a lengthy journey into 2022. Lockdowns will be permitted far into next year on a receding basis. But the heart of this national plan is its deeply ambitious vaccination thresholds – a 70 per cent national average to take the first step and move to phase two, and an exceedingly ambitious threshold of 80 per cent to move to stage three in this four-stage plan.
On current data it seems only the UK and Israel are near these targets. Morrison made clear there is a double test at each threshold – the national average must meet the target, as well as the individual jurisdiction making the move.
Morrison refused to speculate on the timetable for these achievements but said he had “hope” to make the initial transition by the end of the year.
That’s the goal. It will be put up in lights around Australia – 70 per cent with two jabs. Say it loud, say it clear. It is the goal the country needs to rally around as the nation’s vaccination target to be reached as soon as possible. That means before the close of 2021.
Morrison spoke on Friday evening after a long meeting of national cabinet. What matters next are the reactions of the premiers. Are they on board? Is this a fair dinkum pathway? Or will the premiers continue to bet each way and, ­devoid of conviction, continue to do whatever they want.
The truth is there is a lot for the premiers in this pathway – the journey is immediately ambitious in the short term to reach 70 per cent vaccination, but phase two doesn’t put much limit on the discretion of the premiers. The big transition is going from stage two to stage three with its 80 per cent vaccination threshold.
The political reality is that the pathway will still be unfolding at the time of the next federal election. It will be either in phase two or phase three.
This pathway will demand a world-best effort from Australia. There will be no place for vaccination hesitancy. It will require the entire nation to be working together, state and federal, Coalition and Labor. With each phase, the ­restrictions are eased but it is only at stage three that vaccinated people are released from restrictions.
As each phase is progressed, the restrictions on overseas travel movement are also eased.
Given the feral mood of the ­nation, the pathway is sure to face intense criticism. This is where a genuine commitment from the premiers is vital. “Every single jab is important,” Morrison said. It is a major understatement. But the pathway offers a potential political escape for the Prime Minister from the world of pain he now endures.
What can go wrong for Morrison? The list is long. But the opportunity exists for a more cohesive national effort to reach these goals.
He made it clear that everything depends on the consensus around this decision sticking in the future. What are the prospects of this, after the appalling blame games of the past month?
NSW must have been a catalyst for this outcome. Facing a nine-week extended lockdown, NSW still cannot outrun the beast of Delta. The fear is manifest – that NSW Premier Gladys Berejiklian cannot contain the outbreak, with the prospect of growing public damage, polarised politics and an economy going backwards. Despite better numbers on Friday, the pressure remains immense on ­Berejiklian and chief health officer Kerry Chant as the two instruments they deploy – lockdowns and vaccination – struggle to do the job. Morrison has backed Berejiklian, saying the lockdown is the “only way through”, while boosting federal financial support to NSW to $750m a week.
The truth is Morrison’s standing is eroded every day the lockdown lasts, and that may be a long time. Rarely in history has a federal government pledged such open-ended financial support amid such rising hostility. The mood in NSW is a mixture of resignation, frustration and anger.
Yet the pincer-like trap is closing on Berejiklian and Morrison. If Covid cases keep rising, defying the contact tracers, at what point might NSW decide vaccination coverage is sufficient to permit an easing of restrictions?
The iron law governing the NSW lockdown is what Morrison calls the two-month delay in the vaccine rollout. It’s true, as Health Minister Greg Hunt says daily, the rollout gains momentum, with ­national numbers showing just under 40 per cent of eligible adults having their first jab, and 18 per cent having both jabs. But it is far from enough.
Labor leader Anthony Albanese will seek over the next month to destroy Morrison’s reputation and render him unelectable.
Berejiklian’s plea on vaccines reached a new intensity on Friday. “Our biggest weapon is vaccination,” she declared. With NSW having given 3.6 million jabs, that is a third of the way towards its target of 10 million. She renewed her plea for more vaccines, sure to be rejected by other premiers. But she has drawn the defining political nexus: more jabs mean more freedom.
This is the Berejiklian gospel. It is now reflecting in the national pathway. But the pressure on Morrison remains constant. Much of the public blames the federal government for the lockdown, attributing it to the slow vaccine rollout, a perception valid at the margins but still misleading. A high vaccination rate would not have stopped the NSW lockdown but it would have mitigated its severity.
The Delta variant has transformed the internal politics – Berejiklian, the “gold standard” from 2020, is tarnished because she failed to respond to Delta, while Victoria’s Dan Andrews, the failure from 2020, now struts the stage triumphant, presenting as the champion with his model of tough, hard lockdown.
Morrison and Josh Frydenberg have played their well-worn role. Hostage to lockdowns, they boosted their support yet again so NSW will receive more than $1bn a week in total from both governments. The PM and the Treasurer, having lifted support numbers to JobKeeper levels, have probably defeated the demand for JobKeeper’s return, a flawed demand since their new arrangements are faster and more flexible anyway.
Berejiklian’s rhetoric betrays her alarm at the prospect of a prolonged lockdown. “Things are likely to get worse before they get better,” she said after Thursday’s leap in cases. Yet the other premiers cling to their vaccines, fearing the spread of the NSW outbreak on their turf. The risk is where NSW goes, the nation might go. Berejiklian has become the target of patronising aggression from Andrews and West Australian Premier Mark McGowan, revealing their pent-up resentment of the status she once enjoyed.
With the federation fractured, Morrison, the premiers and national cabinet approached their moment of truth on Friday in deciding how Australia regathers and overcomes this crisis. Having taken these decisions in principle, they have an obligation to navigate through the federation strains, putting the national interest first.
Their decision relied upon Doherty Institute modelling on the vaccination thresholds deemed necessary to move Australia through four phases, including the transition beyond lockdowns. Morrison also factored economic assessments from Treasury into the mix, so it became a joint health-economic equation.
This pathway will make or break Morrison’s authority. While his political situation is still recoverable, much depends upon his ability to guide the national strategy. Morrison’s problem, of course, is that the premiers have the power and they control the politics.
For the premiers, the embrace of post-lockdown scenarios means surrendering the power and popularity they have enjoyed based upon the “I’ve kept you safe” mantra. Stepping back from their parochial fixations will be a big event. As for Morrison, he is plagued daily by his critical mistake in vaccine administration and rollout. Beyond that, however, Morrison has been trapped by constitutional and political realities – this is a public health emergency, and that means the premiers are in control.
The worst misreading of the crisis has come from the populist right lobby and its media backers who discount the Covid threat, demand that Morrison defy the premiers and, incredibly, even oppose the current NSW lockdowns. Reflecting upon the realities here, former prime minister John Howard told Inquirer: “The commonwealth cannot make public health orders for the states. The impression is that the premiers have taken up new powers. But that is not the case. The situation has always been that if something was required in public health, it had to be done by the states.
“On this issue the states have the constitutional power. This power has been there all the time. The point is it was dormant and just wasn’t needed to be exercised. Apart from information campaigns such as anti-smoking and for HIV-AIDS, this is the first ­nationwide public health issue in many decades, perhaps since the Spanish Flu.” Morrison’s task now is to achieve co-ordination through national cabinet and prosecute the national pathway. Two lessons from NSW are now apparent: Delta is different and requires an immediate, short-term tough lockdown to contain any outbreak; and the damage done by prolonged lockdown is unsustainable and needed to be replaced by the nationwide pathway strategy.
Latest data shows that fewer than 80 per cent of people older than 80 have had one vaccine dose. So even at this stage, one fifth of the most vulnerable cohort has not scored a first jab. What is happening here? Looking at the 70-74 age group, 23 per cent have not got a first dose, and in the 65-69 age group this omission reaches 32 per cent.
When it comes to the metric of two jabs, 60 per cent of the over-70s aren’t there yet. Morrison and Berejiklian urge people to get AstraZeneca. Pfizer supplies, now a million a week, will ramp up more in September. The government’s concern at present is not with anti-vaxxer ideologues but with people merely biding their time, just being reluctant. The country cannot afford to indulge such delays any more than it can tolerate the reckless demonstrations seen in Sydney last weekend.
The police and the army are enforcing compliance. The public health emergency, jobs and livelihoods cannot be sacrificed to people who decline to accept their community obligation.
New vaccine-based political conflicts are sure to emerge. Morrison said this week he opposes compulsory vaccination (apart from aged-care workers) because “it’s the wrong decision for Australia”. He fears it would be counter-productive and warns that businesses must be careful that any mandating for employees is consistent with existing law. But the public interest from vaccination cannot be denied.
Morrison backed the principle that different restrictions will apply depending upon whether or not people are vaccinated. The unvaccinated pose “a danger to themselves and others”. Morrison doesn’t like the term “vaccine passports” but differentiation defined by vaccination is necessary and inevitable. The only issue is how far it goes.
Interviewed by 3AW’s Neil Mitchell, the PM said: “I know ­national cabinet has its critics. I mean, what’s the alternative? Premiers and chief ministers and the Prime Minister don’t meet? I tell you, it would be a failure if it didn’t meet.” What has national cabinet achieved? Morrison said: “We’ve saved 30,000 lives and got a million people back into work.” And now it has agreed a pathway.
The NSW situation has created a feral mood, rampant in the media and sections of the public. This won’t dissipate any time soon. More relevant, however, is that most people are following the health orders and doing the right thing. On Friday in NSW, there were 170 new Covid cases compared with the 239 peak on Thursday. There are 187 people in hospital, 58 in intensive case, 24 on ventilators, and 13 deaths so far in this outbreak. That’s grave but context is vital. Australia has avoided anything like the death toll seen in other developed nations. Our performance remains among the world’s best. People who think Britain has done brilliantly need to assess the facts. Its death toll is more than 129,000 compared with Australia’s at a touch over 920.

Full text: Australia has been warned 80 per cent of all 25.7 million residents being fully-vaccinated is the "only way" to see life return to normal.
National Cabinet will discuss the vaccine threshold needed to begin Australia's reopening today, though a concrete target was not expected until after multiple talks between state and territory leaders.
It comes after Prime Minister Scott Morrison revealed the federal government had received modelling from the Doherty Institute, tasked with adding detail to its four-step reopening plan.
But the Grattan Institute has demanded the federal government make lockdowns and border closures a thing of the past by pledging to hit an "ambitious target" 80 per cent target by March.
Australians had supported a hardline approach which had averted disaster but, after months punctured by state lockdowns, were increasingly "tired and frustrated" with disruptions to their lives, it warned.
"Australians shouldn't and won't accept high death tolls or indefinite restrictions. Achieving very high vaccination coverage is the only way to avoid these outcomes," its report read.
"We cannot abandon our zero COVID strategy too early and risk the calamity we have so far avoided.
"But on the other hand, we cannot remain walled inside Fortress Australia indefinitely, cut off from the rest of the world and periodically cut off from one another."

Full text: AUSTRALIANS will have an internationally recognised vaccine certificate by October, but it will be up to individual states to decide if the document is required for certain activities within the country.
Prime Minister Scott Morrison is in ongoing discussions with other world leaders as they develop a system to easily identify and formally recognise the vaccination status of any person. The federal government has already developed a ­tamper-proof digital vaccine certificate which is automatically generated when an Australian receives their second jab.
The document is connected to a person’s MyGov account, and will be continually updated with information from the Australian Immunisation Register, potentially including if and when booster shots are introduced.
The government expects the passport will be able to be accessed easily through digital apps such as the Apple Wallet within weeks. The document could be used by states as the basis for health orders requiring ­vaccination in certain settings.
Mr Morrison said he believed Australia had the supply, depending on “external shocks”, to offer everyone a vaccine who wants it by the end of 2021, and suggested a certificate allowing people to do certain activities could encourage people to take up the jab.
National cabinet has tasked the Peter Doherty Institute for Infection and Immunity with modelling the different levels of risk from Covid-19, including specifically the Delta variant, depending on the level of vaccination achieved in Australia. These firm targets are also expected to incentivise Australians to get vaccinated by giving them something to aim for.

Full text: STATE and federal leaders have agreed that more people need to be vaccinated at weekends as the number of pharmacies offering jabs is set to more than triple by the end of the month.
Speaking after the national cabinet met on Friday afternoon, Prime Minister Scott Morrison said that while Thursday had been a record day with 175,000 vaccinations nationwide, the number lagged at weekends.
Last Saturday just 83,000 shots were administered, with 50,000 on Sunday. “On the weekend jabs go right down as you don’t have as many GPs, offices and clinics open,” Mr Morrison said.
“The state clinics are open in many places, but the states and the commonwealth are looking for ways to increase availability and points of presence for people to get their vaccines on the weekends.” Mr Morrison said that in just three days this week 500,000 doses of vaccine had been administered across the country.
The government expects the number of pharmacies ­giving jabs will jump from 65 to 350 by early August.
The PM said the increase in the rollout points was dependent on the increase in vaccine supplies.
The number of Pfizer jabs arriving in Australia is set to reach one million a week from the middle of next week.
“There is no point having more points of presence with a static amount of supply – that just increases the logistical difficulty. So as the supply ­increases, we can have more pharmacists come online,” Mr Morrison said.
Victoria’s Covid commander Jeroen Weimar said the state had more than 12,000 first-dose Pfizer appointments available over the next 10 days at 78 clinics. There are 27,000 spots available for those eligible for second Pfizer doses.
“If you are eligible for Pfizer, I urge you to make an ­appointment,” he said. NSW’s outbreak surpassed 1000 cases with another 97 confirmed on Friday, three-quarters of them in Sydney’s southwest.
Mr Morrison praised residents of that region. “Can I particularly thank the multicultural community leaders in southwestern Sydney, you’ve done a sterling job working with your communities, religious and faith leaders and so many others. The compliance in southwestern Sydney has really turned around,” he said.
A senior government source the commonwealth was analysing which clinics were doing the biggest jab numbers at weekends with an eye to ­encouraging more GPs, pharmacists and state clinics to emulate them.
The source said the expectation was that GP clinics and state clinics would need to stay open longer on Saturdays and Sundays to bring the weekend jab total closer to the weekday numbers.
Vaccination tsar Lieutenant General JJ Frewen addressed the meeting on the state of the rollout and the planning under way to expand vaccination sites for aged-care workers and the wider community through pharmacies.
The national cabinet was also briefed on the progress of the four-step plan to reopening and the progress of the Covid-19 risk analysis and ­response task force report, as well as the Doherty Institute’s modelling on safe vaccination levels needed before the country can fully unlock. james.campbell@news.com.au

A senior government source said the commonwealth was analysing which clinics were doing the biggest jab numbers at weekends with an eye to ­encouraging more GPs, pharmacists and state clinics to emulate them.
The source said the expectation was that GP clinics and state clinics would need to stay open longer on Saturdays and Sundays to bring the weekend jab total closer to the weekday numbers. Lieutenant General JJ Frewen addressed the meeting on the state of the rollout and plans to expand vaccination sites for aged-care workers and the wider community through pharmacies. The national cabinet was also briefed on the progress of the four-step plan to reopening and the progress of the Covid-19 risk analysis and ­response task force report, as well as the Doherty Institute’s modelling on safe vaccination levels needed before the country can fully unlock.

Full text: EXCLUSIVE EVERYONE coming to Australia from countries other than New Zealand could be made to have a second COVID-19 test eight hours ­before flying.
The move comes after the emergency measures put in place for Indian repatriation flights were found to have massively cut the number of positive cases in the nation’s hotel quarantine system.
This has been identified as a way of boosting the number of people able to return home to Australia.
Travellers booked on repatriation flights from India earlier this month were given an antigen test before they were allowed to board in addition to an earlier PCR test of the kind used in Australia.
The testing resulted in 46 people who turned up positive being barred from flying.
Speaking to the Sunday Herald Sun, federal Health Minister Greg Hunt said the introduction of the second test had seen the rate of infected arrivals at Howard Springs in the Northern Territory drop from 13 per cent to 1 per cent.
“The reason you have hotel quarantine is because people incubate and the best tests in the world can’t immediately determine them, but at this stage we’ve gone from a 13 per cent positivity to a 1 per cent positivity,” he said.
“It means that this combination of high-quality PCR and the rapid antigen (testing) is now a model, is now an option, which we’re modelling for helping to progressively open the borders.” Mr Hunt said Professor Jodie McVernon was leading a program at the Doherty Institute to provide national cabinet with a range of options.

Cutting the number of the infected people in quarantine in Australia will increase the number the government can get back into the country, Mr Hunt said.
“Howard Springs has not run out of bed capacity (but) it reached the maximum safe capacity for the NT health system to be treating positive cases when it had the surge in cases from India,” he said.
On the vaccine rollout, Mr Hunt said there would be 40 million Pfizer shots available by the end of the year.
“We’ve got very significant quantities of Pfizer coming in … we’ve ordered 40 million doses which are all expected to be delivered heavily back-ended towards the last quarter,” he said.
But he reiterated calls for everyone to get vaccinated as soon as possible. “The medical advice is very clear, everybody who is eligible – all those over 50 and all those in 1a and 1b – should not wait and should be vaccinated as soon as possible, particularly with winter coming,” he said.
“If you are in a vulnerable group and catch COVID, you could die. “Vaccination will help protect you and everybody else in Australia.”

Experts warn on 'tough' case targets

Full text: Victoria may not be able to reach some of the "hard targets" set to trigger the reopening of the state by Christmas, a leading epidemiologist has warned.
The state government has unveiled a number of steps that will see most of the toughest restrictions end on November 23, but only if no new coronavirus cases are recorded in the preceding two weeks.
Questioned on the achievability of that goal, Victoria's Chief Health Officer Brett Sutton said yesterday officials were likely to continue on the path to reopening, even if a handful of cases continued to be detected.
"Whenever you see jurisdictions that are in the ones and twos that have days of zeros and they've got international travel closed off, then they almost invariably get to the point of zero transmission," he said. "So, if we're there, it'll be pretty clear that we can take the next step.
"If we have very low numbers and they are stubborn and persistent and we cannot get rid of it otherwise, but we can keep them under control, then we'll carry on with that strategy."
But Professor Jodie McVernon, the director of epidemiology at Melbourne's Doherty Institute, warned requiring zero cases for a fortnight would be difficult to achieve and was heartened by the notion that it did not appear to be a hard target.
"If they were, I would be very concerned that we might never reach them," Professor McVernon said, pointing to New Zealand, where there has been a resurgence in cases but at low levels.
Step three, scheduled for October 26, would allow outdoor gatherings of up to 10 people, but will require an average of fewer than five new daily cases over two weeks, a goal Professor McVernon said could also be difficult to reach, despite yesterday's promising daily total of 41 new cases. She said it would be a different scenario if there were five mystery cases versus five quarantined cases linked to a known case of a healthcare worker, for example.
"I think getting down to an average of five cases over 14 days, I think that is a very stringent target," Professor McVernon said.
"I would really be expecting that we will have a much more nuanced discussion about it and those numbers are a goal."
Deakin University epidemiology chair Catherine Bennett said a single outbreak in the two weeks before the end of October could make the target unattainable, but noted health authorities would be able to factor any isolated occurrences into their decision making.
An analysis by The Age found Victoria's 14-day average for new coronavirus cases had dipped below five just once following the first lockdown in March. On a single day in May - May 2 - there had been an average of four cases per day over the previous two weeks.
Yesterday, the 14-day average dropped below 100 for the first time in almost two months. The last time the state's 14-day average was in double digits was on July 9, the day when the stage three lockdown came into effect for a second time in Melbourne and Mitchell shire.
It is currently sitting at 96. It has to fall to between 30 and 50 by September 28 for Victoria to move to the second step of reopening.
Stephen Duckett, director of the health program at Grattan Institute, said the trends in Victoria's daily case numbers were promising.
"Today the number of cases was in that 30-50 range, so if the same thing happens over the next fortnight then we are certainly on track to move to the second step," he said. "By and large the modelling shows the decline is going really well."
Dr Duckett was less confident about case numbers getting under five by the end of October.
"Getting to five is going to be a tough call," he said.
Step one will come into effect on September 13.

Full text: Electric car spendathon as energy costs soar in coal-free grid THE NSW government has quietly released a plan to turn one third of all new cars in its fleet electric while sitting on another report that warns the cost of energy to charge them is about to skyrocket.
As Treasurer Dominic Perrottet fights to freeze public sector wages and $800 million ANZ redevelopment plans are shelved, Energy Minister Matt Kean (pictured) is spending up to pursue a green agenda.
Mr Kean has ordered by 2023 that 30 per cent of all new vehicles in the government fleet, about 900 new cars, will have to be electric or hybrid with 10 per cent fully electric.
He also wants to make the city’s 8000 buses electric.
But a separate report – released under the cover of COVID-19 last week after sitting on the shelf since December 2018 – warns that energy prices will jump by 15 per cent when coal fired power stations are decommissioned.
“This is just nuts. We have a plan to turn one third of the government’s fleet of cars electric without covering off the basics of ensuring a reliable, cheap source of electricity to power them,” Shooters and Fishers party leader Robert Borsak said.
Mr Kean’s hard line “Net Zero” environment policy, which dictates no carbon emissions in NSW by 2050, will also see new National Construction Code and NSW Building Sustainability Index (BASIX) codes “to ensure new buildings are electric vehicle-ready”.
Mr Kean would not detail how much it will cost to ­implement all the changes, but a departmental spokesman said the money will come from a $2 billion environment deal struck with the federal government this year, of which NSW is contributing $1.1 billion.
He said it would cost $6 million to meet the 10 per cent government fleet target for fully electric cars but this would be partially offset by lower fuel costs.
One Nation MP Mark Latham said insisting on buildings having new charging stations “will be a huge white elephant”. “It’s going to do a lot of harm to the housing industry, bringing in these BASIX regulations, it’s going to add to the cost of housing,” he said.
However a report, commissioned by NSW Coal Innovation while Don Harwin was energy minister, was left on the shelf for almost a year and a half. The Wholesale Electricity Pricing Modelling Report appears to contradict the government’s electricity strategy that puts more emphasis on renewables such as solar and wind.
Energy experts Frontier Economics prepared the report and warned “our modelling forecasts material wholesale price increases in NSW following the retirement of Liddell Power Station and then Vales Point Power Station.” The report stressed the benefits of having a diverse mix of technologies including gas and coal to provide reliable and affordable electricity. It warned the average $1627 electricity bill could jump by 15 per cent if there is a greater emphasis on renewables.
Mr Kean said the report was a matter for the Resources Minister. “My focus is on ensuring that we keep the lights on and deliver cheaper electricity prices now and into the future, “ he said. An Industry Department spokesman said NSW had a technology-neutral approach to power generation.

Full text: Electric car spendathon as energy costs soar in coal-free grid THE NSW government has quietly released a plan to turn one third of all new cars in its fleet electric while sitting on another report that warns the cost of energy to charge them is about to skyrocket.
As Treasurer Dominic Perrottet fights to freeze public sector wages and $800 million ANZ redevelopment plans are shelved, Energy Minister Matt Kean (pictured) is spending up to pursue a green agenda.
Mr Kean has ordered by 2023 that 30 per cent of all new vehicles in the government fleet, about 900 new cars, will have to be electric or hybrid with 10 per cent fully electric.
He also wants to make the city’s 8000 buses electric.
But a separate report – released under the cover of COVID-19 last week after sitting on the shelf since December 2018 – warns that energy prices will jump by 15 per cent when coal fired power stations are decommissioned.
“This is just nuts. We have a plan to turn one third of the government’s fleet of cars electric without covering off the basics of ensuring a reliable, cheap source of electricity to power them,” Shooters and Fishers party leader Robert Borsak said.
Mr Kean’s hard line “Net Zero” environment policy, which dictates no carbon emissions in NSW by 2050, will also see new National Construction Code and NSW Building Sustainability Index (BASIX) codes “to ensure new buildings are electric vehicle-ready”.
Mr Kean would not detail how much it will cost to ­implement all the changes, but a departmental spokesman said the money will come from a $2 billion environment deal struck with the federal government this year, of which NSW is contributing $1.1 billion.
He said it would cost $6 million to meet the 10 per cent government fleet target for fully electric cars but this would be partially offset by lower fuel costs.
One Nation MP Mark Latham said insisting on buildings having new charging stations “will be a huge white elephant”. “It’s going to do a lot of harm to the housing industry, bringing in these BASIX regulations, it’s going to add to the cost of housing,” he said.
However a report, commissioned by NSW Coal Innovation while Don Harwin was energy minister, was left on the shelf for almost a year and a half. The Wholesale Electricity Pricing Modelling Report appears to contradict the government’s electricity strategy that puts more emphasis on renewables such as solar and wind.
Energy experts Frontier Economics prepared the report and warned “our modelling forecasts material wholesale price increases in NSW following the retirement of Liddell Power Station and then Vales Point Power Station.” The report stressed the benefits of having a diverse mix of technologies including gas and coal to provide reliable and affordable electricity. It warned the average $1627 electricity bill could jump by 15 per cent if there is a greater emphasis on renewables.
Mr Kean said the report was a matter for the Resources Minister. “My focus is on ensuring that we keep the lights on and deliver cheaper electricity prices now and into the future, “ he said. An Industry Department spokesman said NSW had a technology-neutral approach to power generation.

Creating jobs out of $3b pay pain

Full text: Nurses, cops in freeze A $3 BILLION public sector wage freeze will instead be spent to create up to 20,000 new jobs, but the NSW government faces a war over the move which will hold back a 2.5 per cent pay rise for nurses, police and teachers.
The government is willing to take the matter to the ­Industrial Relations Commission if parliament’s upper house blocks the wage freeze.
Premier Gladys Berejiklian declared that the freeze was designed to save jobs, not money, saying: “If we don’t take this decision today, the decisions we need to take down the track will be even more difficult.” The government will argue that “every spare dollar” from the wage freeze will be used to generate employment, with Treasurer Dominic Perrottet saying: “Ultimately the biggest bang for our buck is to spend it creating jobs, not on pay rises.” The Daily Telegraph can reveal government modelling shows that between 15,000 and 20,000 jobs will be created if the government invests the $3 billion wage bill into labour-intensive infrastructure projects with strong stimulus effects.
The government is currently investigating accelerating spending to drive employment and the economy in areas such as social housing, school and police station upgrades, and improvements to other outdated infrastructure.
Mr Perrottet and Unions NSW secretary Mark Morey — who has vowed to fight to get public servants a pay rise — are separately lobbying the upper house crossbench on the wage freeze bid. Labor, the Greens, One Nation and the Animal Justice Party have indicated they will block the freeze, paving the way for a public fight for the government.
The 12-month freeze equates to, on average, $1800 for nurses and more than $2000 for teachers and police.
It can also be revealed the government closely examined a proposal to carve out frontline workers from the move.
The Daily Telegraph has been told this proposal was put to unions but it became impossible to draw a line and so the government reached the decision to freeze all pays.
Unions NSW secretary Mr Morey told The Daily Telegraph there are multiple wage cases and awards hearings for nurses, police and the public service association in June, which will make the wages fight highly public.
“These are people who have been going to work through COVID and what are we saying to them — that the government doesn’t value them,” he said.
The government’s decision was reached after a marathon four-hour cabinet meeting on Monday. A Daily Telegraph online poll of 4000 readers last night found 70 per cent did not support a pay freeze. editorial page 22

Lives versus the economy is a statistical calculation

Full text: What's the value of a life? That's the unpalatable question confronting the federal and state governments as they contemplate how and when to start thawing an economy frozen by their responses to the coronavirus.
There's little doubt the draconian measures they have taken have saved lives. The modelling released by the Doherty Institute earlier this month showed that, had governments done nothing, almost 90 per cent of the population would have been infected and, with a mortality rate of around 1 per cent, the casualty list would have been unthinkable.
With the data showing that the epidemic is being contained, indeed suppressed, however, the equation now confronting governments is becoming more complicated and uncomfortable.
The cost of containment has been extraordinary. It's not just the $230 billion the federal Government has committed to spending and the tens of billions state governments are outlaying to mitigate the economic impacts of the virus, but also the damage done to lives and businesses by the shutting down of so much of the economy.
As they edge closer to the start of a cautious re-opening of the economy, the nature of the trade-off they'll have to contemplate is stark: it's the lives lost to the virus that might be avoided if the lockdown is maintained versus the activity and the businesses and livelihoods salvaged if the economy is re-opened.
It isn't, of course, as simple as lives lost via the infection versus the economy.
The experience of our last recession, in the early 1990s, says that recessions destroy businesses and damage individuals, with some never recovering. Many small (and some not so small) businesses and owners who have seen their life's work and aspirations wiped out by the lockdown will not re-emerge from this experience. Some lives will be permanently impacted and damaged, even lost.
The longer it takes to re-boot the economy the more lasting that damage will be.
The International Monetary Fund's projection of a 6.7 per cent hit to GDP this year followed by a 6.1 per cent recovery in 2021 doesn't convey the extent of the distress and damage the lockdown is generating. For a point of comparison, in the 1990-91 recession GDP fell by 1.7 per cent.
The Federal Government's strategy has been one of mitigation, trying to preserve the core of the economy so that there is something from which to rebound.
It's not stimulus in the conventional sense and most of the big spending programs are fairly short term, designed to fall away as economic growth picks up. There will, however, be an ongoing legacy of higher government spending, reduced government revenues and increased government debt from the epidemic that could take decades to redress.
While it might appear somewhat cold-blooded and even amoral, there is a timeline with a cross-over point where the value of the lives that might be lost through an early exit from the lockdown will be regarded as less significant than the value of the lives and livelihoods lost, and the social trauma and mental health problems experienced, if the lockdown isn't lifted.
The trade-off can be finessed by staging the exit from the lockdown, keeping those most at risk - the elderly and those with underlying conditions unrelated to the virus - quarantined. Maintaining social distancing measures for some time will also impact the outcomes.
The concept of putting a monetary value on lives isn't a novel one. There's a lot of academic literature exploring the statistical value of lives.
The concept of a statistical value of life, or VSL, is used to produce a form of cost-benefit analysis of measures taken to reduce the risks of physical harm - the cost of mandating seat belts, for instance, against the value of the lives saved.
That can be measured in terms of the probable years of life to be lived by the person saved and by the value of each year of that life.
There are various approaches towards estimating that value. One is what someone would be prepared to pay to reduce their risk of dying, another is the foregone earnings and other economic contributions of the life not saved. The VSL would obviously diminish with age.
In Australia, the Office of Best Practice Regulation within the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet has estimated the value of a statistical life at $4.9 million (based on that of a relatively young adult with at last 40 years of life ahead) and the value of a statistical life year at $213,000.
Australia's real GDP last year was about $1.9 trillion and, had it lived up to International Monetary Fund projections, it would have been about $1.94 trillion this year. Instead the IMF is now saying it will be about $1.74 trillion this year and, if it does rebound 6.1 per cent, about $1.8 trillion in 2021.
So, even with the massive spending unleashed by the federal and state governments, we've probably lost several hundred billions of dollars of economic activity this year and the economy will still be performing well below its 2019 level in 2021. The outcome, obviously, would have been far worse without the spending.
Had governments done nothing in response to the coronavirus we could have lost tens of thousands, if not hundreds of thousands of lives. Former Reserve Bank board member and international authority on the economic effects of epidemics, Warwick McKibbin, had estimated that between 20,000 and 96,000 Australians could have died without a meaningful public policy response.
While many, probably most, of them would be in the older generations, the economic and social costs would have been horrendous. There are, for instance, about four million Australians in the 65-plus age bracket who could, on average, expect to live another two decades in the absence of the virus.
While research on the impact of age on the VSL and the statistical value of life years is inconclusive - some government agency apply a "seniors' discount" - the potential lost value of those lives and the health costs of trying to save them justify the unprecedented measures that have been taken.
With the virus seemingly under control, however, there is an inflection point where the costs of keeping the economy in lockdown will rapidly surpass the cost - albeit real, not statistical - of the lives lost if it is re-opened.
That moment may not yet have arrived, and it will have to be carefully staged when it does, but it is now at least within sight and nearing quite quickly as the evidence that the virus is being contained mounts up daily.
