Full text: Hospitalisations in NSW may not rise to a peak predicted in modelling given how successfully the state brought its Covid-19 case numbers down before restrictions were eased.
But as case numbers rise, there is likely to be a corresponding rise in hospitalisations despite the high level of vaccine coverage.
That’s the assessment of biostatistician and epidemiologist Adrian Esterman who successfully predicted the rise in case numbers throughout the Delta wave of infections in NSW and Victoria.
NSW’s total number of cases is closely related to the number of hospitalisations, unlike in Victoria where hospitalisations have remained lower compared to the number of cases.
“What we’re seeing in NSW is that the number of hospitalisations pretty much parallels the number of cases, unlike in Victoria where there is a clear decoupling of cases and hospitalisations,” Professor Esterman said.
“So if cases start to go up in NSW there’s a good chance that hospitalisations will also go up. But as time goes on, because we’re getting such high rates of vaccination, then you’re probably going to see a more of a decoupling of cases and hospitalisations in NSW as well.” Professor Esterman said the closer connection between hospitalisations and case numbers in NSW may be to do with the age range of those being infected. For instance, if more older people are being infected in NSW than Victoria, the hospitalisation rate will be higher.
There were 769 Covid-19 cases admitted to hospital in NSW on Monday, with 153 people in intensive care. The number of people in intensive care has decreased steadily from September 21 when 244 people were in ICU.
The number of hospitalisations is currently significantly less than the peak predicted in modelling. NSW government modelling indicated that there would be 3434 hospitalisations by late October and 560 people with Covid-19 in ICU. Burnet Institute modelling predicted peak hospital demand of between 2286 and 4016 cases.
The rate of increase in hospitalisations as cases start to rise in NSW is likely to be moderated by high vaccination coverage, with more than 90 per cent of people having had a first dose in NSW and 74 per cent fully vaccinated. And because case numbers were reduced to below 500 by the end of lockdown, the rise in cases will be slower with easing restrictions. Because cases rise exponentially, the fact NSW is coming off a lower base of 496 cases rather than 1500 means cases will not rise as high now that lockdown has ended.
“The bigger the number of cases you have, the greater the increases you get,” Professor Esterman said.
“So if you’re starting off at a lower base, then the rate of increase would also would also definitely be lower.” But Professor Esterman said it was extremely difficult to predict what would happen with NSW case numbers now that lockdown had ended.
“We see countries like Norway which a week ago relaxed all restrictions and their case numbers have halved versus the Netherlands which relaxed restrictions and case numbers tripled,” he said. “Someone would have to be really brave to say that there would be X number of hospitalisation on a given date.” But there is good evidence to show hospitalisations can remain low even with high case numbers in countries with high vaccine coverage such as the United Kingdom, which has about 40,000 cases recorded a day but only around 800 a day hospitalised with Covid-19.

Full text: And Queenslanders have been told they will need to wait for the international travel trial outcomes from NSW, though experts insist there is no reason why the Sunshine State cannot commit to reopening now.
When asked yesterday if the state would reopen at 80 per cent, Annastacia Palaszczuk’s office said the Premier was still waiting for “completed advice” from the Doherty Institute.
But that advice is done, with a Federal Government spokesman saying NSW, the ACT, NT and Victoria had released road maps.
“It is a matter for Queensland to articulate why they cannot make decisions based on the advice already provided to … other states,” he said.
Infectious diseases expert Associate Professor Paul Griffin said other states were implementing the same advice Queensland had.
“I don’t think we need to reinvent the wheel here in terms of questioning that ­advice too much,” he said.
Just days after Ms Palaszczuk contentiously asked why people would want to travel to India or Tokyo, Health Minister Yvette D’Ath yesterday questioned why anyone would want to travel to Bali, which has had an average of 1900 cases daily for the past week.
“I have said continuously around the 80 per cent threshold that the Doherty Institute modelling is not just about percentage,” she said.
“It’s also whether, as a state, what’s the number of outbreaks you’ve got?
“Whether you are able to test, whether you are able to contract trace, whether you are able to isolate the virus and manage those things.
“I saw the reference to Bali … where people will be able to travel to Bali and back but may not be able to travel to Queensland.
“Can I say I don’t know if anyone wants to be travelling to Bali right now when they recorded 1693 cases two days ago, and the seven-day average for Bali … it’s over 1900 cases a day.”
It is understood the Doherty Institute explained its update on the impact of Covid-19 spread if seven-day home quarantine was adopted during Friday’s National Cabinet meeting.
The Federal Government spokesman said Doherty would continue to advise ­national cabinet in addition to the modelling that was ­finalised and adopted by all jurisdictions in September.
NED-4150-Pathway-out-of-pandemic
“Governments should hold up their end of the deal made with Australians, that if they get vaccinated they would be able to enjoy greater freedoms and eased restrictions,” he said.
Ass Prof Griffin said if Queensland delayed a decision there could be a “big lag” before it could be implemented.
“We do risk being significantly behind other states (in border reopenings),” he said.
Ms D’Ath said the Government was not “closed off” to the idea of resuming international travel, but the Commonwealth had to do more planning around what countries Australia opened up to.
Ms D’Ath said the 80 per cent vaccination rate figure was “one element” of the Doherty modelling.
“That 20 per cent, if we’re looking at percentage and percentage alone, in every jurisdiction it is saying that that 20 per cent – that could be our remote indigenous communities, it could be our low socioeconomic, it could be our multicultural communities that have a lower percentage of protection in their vaccination rates, that we’re OK for them to have outbreaks,” she said.
“So we’ve got to look at all of it.”

Full text: New Covid-19 modelling suggested that New Zealand could see up to 7000 Covid-19 deaths a year, even with a high proportion of the
population jabbed. Explainer editor Keith Lynch digs beneath the surface of those extremely worrying - and controversial - numbers.
This was a particularly unusual 1pm press conference, one that prompted significant backlash.
The day was Thursday, September 23, and it started typically enough. After Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern's introduction, director- general of health Ashley Bloomfield announced more than a dozen Covid cases in Auckland.
Ardern embarked on a preamble before introducing Professor Shaun Hendy to talk about the Te Punaha Matatini group's latest Covid-19 modelling.
Interestingly, she specifically called out Rodney Jones, who has also advised the Government throughout the pandemic. That night he would go on record criticising Hendy's work.
Ardern also made the point that the model had not been peer-reviewed and does not "represent an inevitable outcome for New Zealand".
Hendy then spoke, via video call on a big monitor positioned between Ardern and Bloomfield on the podium. He was in Auckland. He started by acknowledging there are significant uncertainties, that these models could change if new information came to light.
He spoke first of how vaccinating more than 90 per cent of the population could reduce "the health burden [of Covid] to something that's less than that of seasonal influenza".
He then cited one scenario: "For example, if we only get to 80 per cent of those over 5, then we could still experience 60,000 hospitalisations from Covid-19 in a one-year period, and 7000 fatalities. Our healthcare system couldn't cope with this level of illness. We would need to continue to use lockdowns."
The modelling contained a wide range of scenarios. A press release accompanying the model, issued by Ardern's office, specifically cited the "7000 deaths and 60,000 hospitalisations" scenario.
Ardern thanked Hendy. She spoke of variation in the models and that she expected them to change. She spoke about lockdowns and talked of taking level 4 "out of the toolbox" at very high levels of vaccination.
That afternoon, Jones criticised Hendy's numbers in a range of media appearances. His key point was that, in countries such as Ireland and Singapore, which have a vaccination rate of roughly 75 per cent (which is comparable to 80 per cent of those over 5), the death toll does not line up with 7000 in a single year.
Unsurprisingly - in this highly charged political environment - Jones and Hendy sustained a barrage of personal criticism.
This was highly unfair to both men. Both have advised the Government during the pandemic, both were acknowledged for their work on Covid in the New Year honours. Both were part of Sir David Skegg's group that provided the Government with advice on border reopening. They are both trying to do their bit to save Aotearoa from the worst of this pandemic.
While Covid-19 modelling may appear academic to some, it really does matter. Will, for example, Ardern and her Cabinet make life-and-death decisions based on this modelling or what they're seeing overseas, or a combination of both? Another example: multiple commentators have already looked at the National Party's new Covid plan through the lens of the Te Punaha Matatini modelling.
One thing Professor Michael Baker told me as I was researching this piece was that it would be much better if New Zealand had a range of Covid-19 models, done independently of each other. That should be standard practice and would provide better feedback loops and quality assurance.
What goes into a model?
Te Punaha Matatini modelling is not a prediction or guarantee of what's to come. These models offer a range of scenarios based on some underlying assumptions. Think of them more like guardrails that can help guide very important decisions.
There is probably a disconnect between the public's expectation and what the models can actually provide.
Of course, models are sometimes wrong. Some predicted more than 100,000 Covid cases daily after the UK lifted Covid restrictions. Based on the data available at the time, this was not an outlandish prediction. But it hasn't happened. Not yet at least.
Covid-19 is relatively new, as are the vaccines. We are very much still learning about the behaviour and intersection of both and the modelling projections are improving all the time.
There is a range of assumptions or inputs powering the Te Punaha Matatini model. The "7000 deaths" is only one modelled scenario. There's another in there, for example, that projects 260 deaths. These inputs aren't just plucked out of the air. They're based on peer-reviewed research and real world data.
Let's run through them (this is very much a condensed version of what's in the document):
The R number - the average number of people to whom one infected person will pass on the virus - is 6 without anything to slow Delta down.
Basic public health measures, like masks, and a test-trace-isolate- quarantine (TTIQ) system. These slow down the virus' spread a little.
Uniform vaccine coverage across eligible age groups.
How good the vaccine is. The inputs used assume the vaccine's effectiveness does not wane.
A single case coming in over the border every day.
The number of people hospitalised (and for how long) and how many people will die.
The "7000 deaths" number, or more specifically 6838, is based on the "central" assumption - that the vaccine is 94 per cent effective at protecting against severe disease. That is based on UK data from this year.
On this point Hendy told Stuff that the "low-effectiveness" scenario is very much the worst-case scenario - for example, a variant emerges that escapes the vaccine.
The central and high effectiveness estimates are closer to the current reality. But while the model assumes no waning immunity, Hendy says that he and his team are still wary of it, particularly in older people who - remember - were vaccinated earlier in New Zealand's rollout.
"So I would argue that a plan based on central effectiveness is probably the right thing to do at the moment, given we are trying to look at the year ahead," he says.
"Having said that, our conclusions are very sensitive to assumptions we make here, and we still don't have good data on what proportion of people who have breakthrough infections, despite the vaccine, will go on to infect others."
The Te Punaha Matatini team also used a study from March 2020 to create the inputs informing how deadly Covid is. This early Covid study estimated an infection fatality rate (IFR) of 0.66 per cent. It also found that the risk increased significantly with age.
Scientists use two measures to determine how deadly a disease is. The first is the case fatality rate (CFR), or the proportion of deaths among confirmed cases. The second is the IFR, or the proportion of deaths among all cases, detected or not. It's harder to work out this second measure because in countries that have seen a lot of Covid, there will be many people who suffered mild (or no) symptoms and never got tested.
An Australian epidemiologist told me they probably would not have used the March 2020 paper as an input given it's so dated. That's not to say it's a dud. It's hard to pin down a single IFR on Covid. The thing we know for sure is that the risk of death rises exponentially with age.
Hendy says yes, the March 2020 paper is relatively old but it still holds up and is broadly consistent with recent reviews.
OK, let's get back to the numbers. You can see the "7000 deaths" model in the graphic above, alongside a bunch of others. You'll note it assumes baseline public health measures and limited tracing and quarantine of cases.
There is other modelling that seeks to project what would happen if there were full tracing and quarantine of cases. This is not realistic, as the system would quickly be overwhelmed.
One of the other criticisms of the model was that this simply would not be allowed to happen - public health measures would quickly be beefed up to be more than "baseline".
This, however, is a partly a critique of communications, not the underlying maths.
But why then did Hendy pick out the 7000 number?
"It's always a judgment call as to what to choose to highlight or not when summarising a complex report like that," he says. "But the two examples that I used were both plausible, were based on our intermediate assumptions, and were neither our worst-case scenarios nor our best-case scenarios."
What (several) experts make of it
Stuff contacted a number of overseas experts to get their perspective on the modelling.
Paul Hunter, professor of medicine at the University of East Anglia, who has written about New Zealand's strategy, had two distinct criticisms. I'll run through them one by one, followed by a response from Hendy.
Remember the assumption that vaccine coverage is uniform across age groups? Hunter says this is very unlikely to be the case, as older people are much more likely to be vaccinated.
"By and large in the UK we have 82 per cent of our 16+ double-vaccinated. But in the over-70s - the age group by far the most likely to die - we still have about 95 per cent uptake.
"So with similar vaccination rates to the UK I am really struggling to see how you would get anywhere close to 7000 deaths in New Zealand."
Right now, more than 80 per cent of people in the 65+ age category are fully vaccinated, according to the Ministry of Health.
Hendy says this is a fair point and something on which he and his team will do further work as the vaccine rollout nears completion. "However it is not as significant as suggested."
Why's that? Well, he argues if you vaccinate a lot of young adults you can bring the R number down. Young people are simply more mobile and more likely to spread the disease.
"If - at the same total population coverage - you shift vaccines from young adults to older people, then [the] R number increases, meaning that you will have more cases, and potentially more deaths, despite having a higher coverage in older people."
On the assumption of uniform coverage across age groups, Australia- based epidemiologist Tony Blakely told Stuff it was necessary to use age distributions. Older people are simply more likely to be vaccinated - they're more vulnerable, and both New Zealand and Australia have vaccinated them first.
"Therefore, at 80 per cent of the eligible population vaccinated you might expect something like 90 per cent+ of 60+-year-olds vaccinated, and less than 80 per cent of younger adults - still giving 80 per cent overall.
"This seemingly minor change has massive impacts, perhaps more than halving the expected deaths and hospitalisations, given that older people are far more vulnerable."
Blakely explains: "If we do not use this 'tilted' age distribution of vaccine coverage, health impacts are far worse."
Hunter's second opinion is slightly different. He believes the assumption of "no waning immunity" essentially invalidates the work.
His point is blunt and pessimistic. Covid-19 is not going away and "we are going to get repeat infections for most of our lives, probably every three to six years" no matter what vaccination level we reach.
"The fact remains that, even if you achieve 90 per cent coverage of every man, woman and child and then open society, you will still get exponential growth of the epidemic with many people getting sick enough to require hospitalisation. That is unavoidable.
"Non-pharmaceutical interventions such as lockdowns certainly reduce transmission but in effect they only delay the inevitable, never prevent it. New Zealand has done really well to date with control of the outbreak, but that means you still have some pain to come."
A few things here. These criticisms may seem at odds with each other. It appears Hunter is essentially saying that it's hard to see how 7000 people will die in a year and large-scale Covid outbreaks are unavoidable, and deaths and hospitalisations inevitable.
But his key point is that New Zealand isn't just going to experience a one-year outbreak, which is what has been modelled for. In the long term, even if the country gets to 90 per cent- plus vaccination rates, Covid will still hit hard.
Firstly, Hendy says yes, we still need more information on waning immunity. But introducing that into the mix could make his modelling even more pessimistic.
Secondly, he insists New Zealand is in a much different spot to Europe. We haven't had widespread Covid, so we still need to model an outbreak. We need to understand the consequences of opening up. He also says the UK did similar modelling before it opened up.
Finally, on Hunter's point on the inevitability of exponential growth, he says: "I agree with the general thrust of this, but the modelling does suggest that we can minimise future pain, especially if we can manage cases within our healthcare capacity, while using vaccine boosters and perhaps even more advanced vaccines."
I also spoke to another leading UK disease modeller to get his perspective. He did not want to be named, and also wanted to be clear he did not want his comments to be seen as a criticism of New Zealand's policy, which he admires.
He was simply happy to offer a general perspective on what would happen, based on what he has seen in the UK, if Covid-19 hit a relatively wealthy country of five million.
Firstly, he says if a population of 5m had allowed Covid-19 to spread unchecked last year, about 40,000 people would have died. This would assume 80 per cent of the population catching the virus and 1 per cent of those dying.
Obviously, this would vary depending on the profile of the 5m people you are talking about, he says. For example, New Zealand's sizeable number of Maori and Pacific people, who are more at risk from the virus, is a factor.
"In the UK we have seen very high coverage in older people (who are at greatest risk of death), and [vaccine] efficacy that is very high," he says.
So if this imaginary country of 5m had 100 per cent vaccination coverage in people older than 60, you might expect to prevent about 95 per cent of deaths - the total deaths would be 2000.
"This would not mean that hospitals would not be full - the vaccine is less efficacious against hospitalisation than death," he says.
These are fairly rudimentary, back- of-an-envelope calculations, but "you'll be surprised by how good it is".
Hendy's key point when we look overseas is that countries like Ireland and the UK have "banked immunity" - that is lots of people caught Covid and have some sort of immunity, so it's less likely to spread (Hunter also pointed this out).
We're better off looking at Singapore and Australia, Hendy says. "The advantage that Europe has over us at the moment is that a large proportion of its young adults will have some immunity from infection, which means that, all things being equal, their R will be lower than ours. So a New Zealand that had a similar vaccination profile to Ireland, say, would fare much worse because New Zealand would have a high R, meaning there would be more total infections."
Yes, he acknowledges that if New Zealand gets to 100 per cent coverage of over-60s then it would reduce our estimates of fatalities somewhat. But he says if we applied the current UK vaccination rates to New Zealand, he and his colleagues would still estimate about 5000 deaths.
What about Australia then?
Blakely, who is one of the leads of the latest University of Melbourne Covid modelling work on Victoria, a state of close to 7m people, says he has no major issue with the Te Punaha Matatini modelling.
He says it's simple, akin to working out just how dry a forest is before a bushfire. "It's useful for seeing how flammable a situation is."
He does believe, though, that his modelling offers a much more sophisticated glimpse of what could lie ahead. Rather than modelling what would happen if Covid essentially spread unchallenged, Blakely says his modelling seeks to reflect what would actually happen - that is, how politicians and public health authorities would react.
It also supports other Australian work that proposes keeping "light" public health restrictions in place at all times.
This would reduce the risk of lockdowns, but Blakely says even at 90 per cent coverage some public health restrictions will be necessary.
The University of Melbourne report notes: "As 2022 progresses, and we move into 2023, we can probably ease these minimal restrictions as immunity from natural infection creeps up and we revaccinate the whole population with better vaccines that (hopefully) reduce transmission risk more than current versions."
It outlines two scenarios. The first is called the Default Scenario and involves 80 per cent vaccination in adults only in a state the size of Victoria. The forecast then is 320 infections daily on average, 4000 hospitalisations, 860 patients in ICU and 1000 deaths.
But here's the kicker: it also accounts for the necessity of lockdown. In this particular case Victoria would need to spend 58 per cent of the year in lockdown.
(The authors say, by the way, that the model could be applied to New Zealand, given the demographic similarities.)
Then there's the Upgraded Scenario, which means 80 per cent of adults and children vaccinated and always-on public health measures. It projects 64 infections a day; 960 hospitalisations, 200 ICU admissions and 250 deaths over a year; and 14 per cent of time in lockdown.
The report notes authorities would need to work out what the public health measures involve; at a minimum it'd be mask use, working from home when you can, limits on gatherings. They're probably relatively close to level 2.
There are clearly a range of caveats, but extrapolated for a population the size of New Zealand, that's 17,850 infections a year (49 a day); 736 hospitalised; 191 deaths. Oh, and 51 days in lockdown.
There's one particular caveat that stands out.
The Australian model accounts for both the AstraZeneca and Pfizer vaccines, which are used there. It views the Pfizer vaccine as being more effective at stopping transmission and serious illness.
It notes that if everyone gets the Pfizer jab - which is the case in New Zealand - the risk of lockdown reduces dramatically, infections drop off and there's a significant reduction in the number of people expected to die.

Interestingly, she specifically called out Rodney Jones, who has also advised the Government throughout the pandemic. That night he would go on record criticising Hendy's work.
Ardern also made the point that the model had not been peer-reviewed and does not "represent an inevitable outcome for New Zealand".
Hendy then spoke, via video call on a big monitor positioned between Ardern and Bloomfield on the podium. He was in Auckland. He started by acknowledging there are significant uncertainties, that these models could change if new information came to light.
He spoke first of how vaccinating more than 90 per cent of the population could reduce "the health burden [of Covid] to something that's less than that of seasonal influenza".
He then cited one scenario: "For example, if we only get to 80 per cent of those over 5, then we could still experience 60,000 hospitalisations from Covid-19 in a one-year period, and 7000 fatalities. Our healthcare system couldn't cope with this level of illness. We would need to continue to use lockdowns."
The modelling contained a wide range of scenarios. A press release accompanying the model, issued by Ardern's office, specifically cited the "7000 deaths and 60,000 hospitalisations" scenario.
Ardern thanked Hendy. She spoke of variation in the models and that she expected them to change. She spoke about lockdowns and talked of taking level 4 "out of the toolbox" at very high levels of vaccination.
That afternoon, Jones criticised Hendy's numbers in a range of media appearances. His key point was that, in countries such as Ireland and Singapore, which have a vaccination rate of roughly 75 per cent (which is comparable to 80 per cent of those over 5), the death toll does not line up with 7000 in a single year.
Unsurprisingly - in this highly charged political environment - Jones and Hendy sustained a barrage of personal criticism.
This was highly unfair to both men. Both have advised the Government during the pandemic, both were acknowledged for their work on Covid in the New Year honours. Both were part of Sir David Skegg's group that provided the Government with advice on border reopening. They are both trying to do their bit to save Aotearoa from the worst of this pandemic.
While Covid-19 modelling may appear academic to some, it really does matter. Will, for example, Ardern and her Cabinet make life-and-death decisions based on this modelling or what they're seeing overseas, or a combination of both? Another example: multiple commentators have already looked at the National Party's new Covid plan through the lens of the Te Punaha Matatini modelling.
One thing Professor Michael Baker told me as I was researching this piece was that it would be much better if New Zealand had a range of Covid-19 models, done independently of each other. That should be standard practice and would provide better feedback loops and quality assurance.
What goes into a model?
Te Punaha Matatini modelling is not a prediction or guarantee of what's to come. These models offer a range of scenarios based on some underlying assumptions. Think of them more like guardrails that can help guide very important decisions.
There is probably a disconnect between the public's expectation and what the models can actually provide.
Of course, models are sometimes wrong. Some predicted more than 100,000 Covid cases daily after the UK lifted Covid restrictions. Based on the data available at the time, this was not an outlandish prediction. But it hasn't happened. Not yet at least.
Covid-19 is relatively new, as are the vaccines. We are very much still learning about the behaviour and intersection of both and the modelling projections are improving all the time.
There is a range of assumptions or inputs powering the Te Punaha Matatini model. The "7000 deaths" is only one modelled scenario. There's another in there, for example, that projects 260 deaths. These inputs aren't just plucked out of the air. They're based on peer-reviewed research and real world data.
Let's run through them (this is very much a condensed version of what's in the document):
The R number - the average number of people to whom one infected person will pass on the virus - is 6 without anything to slow Delta down.
Basic public health measures, like masks, and a test-trace-isolate- quarantine (TTIQ) system. These slow down the virus' spread a little.
Uniform vaccine coverage across eligible age groups.
How good the vaccine is. The inputs used assume the vaccine's effectiveness does not wane.
A single case coming in over the border every day.
The number of people hospitalised (and for how long) and how many people will die.
The "7000 deaths" number, or more specifically 6838, is based on the "central" assumption - that the vaccine is 94 per cent effective at protecting against severe disease. That is based on UK data from this year.
On this point Hendy told Stuff that the "low-effectiveness" scenario is very much the worst-case scenario - for example, a variant emerges that escapes the vaccine.
The central and high effectiveness estimates are closer to the current reality. But while the model assumes no waning immunity, Hendy says that he and his team are still wary of it, particularly in older people who - remember - were vaccinated earlier in New Zealand's rollout.
"So I would argue that a plan based on central effectiveness is probably the right thing to do at the moment, given we are trying to look at the year ahead," he says.
"Having said that, our conclusions are very sensitive to assumptions we make here, and we still don't have good data on what proportion of people who have breakthrough infections, despite the vaccine, will go on to infect others."
The Te Punaha Matatini team also used a study from March 2020 to create the inputs informing how deadly Covid is. This early Covid study estimated an infection fatality rate (IFR) of 0.66 per cent. It also found that the risk increased significantly with age.
Scientists use two measures to determine how deadly a disease is. The first is the case fatality rate (CFR), or the proportion of deaths among confirmed cases. The second is the IFR, or the proportion of deaths among all cases, detected or not. It's harder to work out this second measure because in countries that have seen a lot of Covid, there will be many people who suffered mild (or no) symptoms and never got tested.
An Australian epidemiologist told me they probably would not have used the March 2020 paper as an input given it's so dated. That's not to say it's a dud. It's hard to pin down a single IFR on Covid. The thing we know for sure is that the risk of death rises exponentially with age.
Hendy says yes, the March 2020 paper is relatively old but it still holds up and is broadly consistent with recent reviews.
OK, let's get back to the numbers. You can see the "7000 deaths" model in the graphic above, alongside a bunch of others. You'll note it assumes baseline public health measures and limited tracing and quarantine of cases.
There is other modelling that seeks to project what would happen if there were full tracing and quarantine of cases. This is not realistic, as the system would quickly be overwhelmed.
One of the other criticisms of the model was that this simply would not be allowed to happen - public health measures would quickly be beefed up to be more than "baseline".
This, however, is a partly a critique of communications, not the underlying maths.
But why then did Hendy pick out the 7000 number?
"It's always a judgment call as to what to choose to highlight or not when summarising a complex report like that," he says. "But the two examples that I used were both plausible, were based on our intermediate assumptions, and were neither our worst-case scenarios nor our best-case scenarios."
What (several) experts make of it
Stuff contacted a number of overseas experts to get their perspective on the modelling.
Paul Hunter, professor of medicine at the University of East Anglia, who has written about New Zealand's strategy, had two distinct criticisms. I'll run through them one by one, followed by a response from Hendy.
Remember the assumption that vaccine coverage is uniform across age groups? Hunter says this is very unlikely to be the case, as older people are much more likely to be vaccinated.
"By and large in the UK we have 82 per cent of our 16+ double-vaccinated. But in the over-70s - the age group by far the most likely to die - we still have about 95 per cent uptake.
"So with similar vaccination rates to the UK I am really struggling to see how you would get anywhere close to 7000 deaths in New Zealand."
Right now, more than 80 per cent of people in the 65+ age category are fully vaccinated, according to the Ministry of Health.
Hendy says this is a fair point and something on which he and his team will do further work as the vaccine rollout nears completion. "However it is not as significant as suggested."
Why's that? Well, he argues if you vaccinate a lot of young adults you can bring the R number down. Young people are simply more mobile and more likely to spread the disease.
"If - at the same total population coverage - you shift vaccines from young adults to older people, then [the] R number increases, meaning that you will have more cases, and potentially more deaths, despite having a higher coverage in older people."
On the assumption of uniform coverage across age groups, Australia- based epidemiologist Tony Blakely told Stuff it was necessary to use age distributions. Older people are simply more likely to be vaccinated - they're more vulnerable, and both New Zealand and Australia have vaccinated them first.
"Therefore, at 80 per cent of the eligible population vaccinated you might expect something like 90 per cent+ of 60+-year-olds vaccinated, and less than 80 per cent of younger adults - still giving 80 per cent overall.
"This seemingly minor change has massive impacts, perhaps more than halving the expected deaths and hospitalisations, given that older people are far more vulnerable."
Blakely explains: "If we do not use this 'tilted' age distribution of vaccine coverage, health impacts are far worse."
Hunter's second opinion is slightly different. He believes the assumption of "no waning immunity" essentially invalidates the work.
His point is blunt and pessimistic. Covid-19 is not going away and "we are going to get repeat infections for most of our lives, probably every three to six years" no matter what vaccination level we reach.
"The fact remains that, even if you achieve 90 per cent coverage of every man, woman and child and then open society, you will still get exponential growth of the epidemic with many people getting sick enough to require hospitalisation. That is unavoidable.
"Non-pharmaceutical interventions such as lockdowns certainly reduce transmission but in effect they only delay the inevitable, never prevent it. New Zealand has done really well to date with control of the outbreak, but that means you still have some pain to come."
A few things here. These criticisms may seem at odds with each other. It appears Hunter is essentially saying that it's hard to see how 7000 people will die in a year and large-scale Covid outbreaks are unavoidable, and deaths and hospitalisations inevitable.
But his key point is that New Zealand isn't just going to experience a one-year outbreak, which is what has been modelled for. In the long term, even if the country gets to 90 per cent- plus vaccination rates, Covid will still hit hard.
Firstly, Hendy says yes, we still need more information on waning immunity. But introducing that into the mix could make his modelling even more pessimistic.
Secondly, he insists New Zealand is in a much different spot to Europe. We haven't had widespread Covid, so we still need to model an outbreak. We need to understand the consequences of opening up. He also says the UK did similar modelling before it opened up.
Finally, on Hunter's point on the inevitability of exponential growth, he says: "I agree with the general thrust of this, but the modelling does suggest that we can minimise future pain, especially if we can manage cases within our healthcare capacity, while using vaccine boosters and perhaps even more advanced vaccines."
I also spoke to another leading UK disease modeller to get his perspective. He did not want to be named, and also wanted to be clear he did not want his comments to be seen as a criticism of New Zealand's policy, which he admires.
He was simply happy to offer a general perspective on what would happen, based on what he has seen in the UK, if Covid-19 hit a relatively wealthy country of five million.
Firstly, he says if a population of 5m had allowed Covid-19 to spread unchecked last year, about 40,000 people would have died. This would assume 80 per cent of the population catching the virus and 1 per cent of those dying.
Obviously, this would vary depending on the profile of the 5m people you are talking about, he says. For example, New Zealand's sizeable number of Maori and Pacific people, who are more at risk from the virus, is a factor.
"In the UK we have seen very high coverage in older people (who are at greatest risk of death), and [vaccine] efficacy that is very high," he says.
So if this imaginary country of 5m had 100 per cent vaccination coverage in people older than 60, you might expect to prevent about 95 per cent of deaths - the total deaths would be 2000.
"This would not mean that hospitals would not be full - the vaccine is less efficacious against hospitalisation than death," he says.
These are fairly rudimentary, back- of-an-envelope calculations, but "you'll be surprised by how good it is".
Hendy's key point when we look overseas is that countries like Ireland and the UK have "banked immunity" - that is lots of people caught Covid and have some sort of immunity, so it's less likely to spread (Hunter also pointed this out).
We're better off looking at Singapore and Australia, Hendy says. "The advantage that Europe has over us at the moment is that a large proportion of its young adults will have some immunity from infection, which means that, all things being equal, their R will be lower than ours. So a New Zealand that had a similar vaccination profile to Ireland, say, would fare much worse because New Zealand would have a high R, meaning there would be more total infections."
Yes, he acknowledges that if New Zealand gets to 100 per cent coverage of over-60s then it would reduce our estimates of fatalities somewhat. But he says if we applied the current UK vaccination rates to New Zealand, he and his colleagues would still estimate about 5000 deaths.
What about Australia then?
Blakely, who is one of the leads of the latest University of Melbourne Covid modelling work on Victoria, a state of close to 7m people, says he has no major issue with the Te Punaha Matatini modelling.
He says it's simple, akin to working out just how dry a forest is before a bushfire. "It's useful for seeing how flammable a situation is."
He does believe, though, that his modelling offers a much more sophisticated glimpse of what could lie ahead. Rather than modelling what would happen if Covid essentially spread unchallenged, Blakely says his modelling seeks to reflect what would actually happen - that is, how politicians and public health authorities would react.
It also supports other Australian work that proposes keeping "light" public health restrictions in place at all times.
This would reduce the risk of lockdowns, but Blakely says even at 90 per cent coverage some public health restrictions will be necessary.
The University of Melbourne report notes: "As 2022 progresses, and we move into 2023, we can probably ease these minimal restrictions as immunity from natural infection creeps up and we revaccinate the whole population with better vaccines that (hopefully) reduce transmission risk more than current versions."
It outlines two scenarios. The first is called the Default Scenario and involves 80 per cent vaccination in adults only in a state the size of Victoria. The forecast then is 320 infections daily on average, 4000 hospitalisations, 860 patients in ICU and 1000 deaths.
But here's the kicker: it also accounts for the necessity of lockdown. In this particular case Victoria would need to spend 58 per cent of the year in lockdown.
(The authors say, by the way, that the model could be applied to New Zealand, given the demographic similarities.)
Then there's the Upgraded Scenario, which means 80 per cent of adults and children vaccinated and always-on public health measures. It projects 64 infections a day; 960 hospitalisations, 200 ICU admissions and 250 deaths over a year; and 14 per cent of time in lockdown.
The report notes authorities would need to work out what the public health measures involve; at a minimum it'd be mask use, working from home when you can, limits on gatherings. They're probably relatively close to level 2.
There are clearly a range of caveats, but extrapolated for a population the size of New Zealand, that's 17,850 infections a year (49 a day); 736 hospitalised; 191 deaths. Oh, and 51 days in lockdown.
There's one particular caveat that stands out. The Australian model accounts for both the AstraZeneca and Pfizer vaccines, which are used there. It views the Pfizer vaccine as being more effective at stopping transmission and serious illness.
It notes that if everyone gets the Pfizer jab - which is the case in New Zealand - the risk of lockdown reduces dramatically, infections drop off and there's a significant reduction in the number of people expected to die.

Full text: New Covid-19 modelling suggested that New Zealand could see up to 7000 Covid-19 deaths a year, even with a high proportion of the
population jabbed. Explainer editor Keith Lynch digs beneath the surface of those extremely worrying - and controversial - numbers.
This was a particularly unusual 1pm press conference, one that prompted significant backlash.
The day was Thursday, September 23, and it started typically enough. After Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern's introduction, director- general of health Ashley Bloomfield announced more than a dozen Covid cases in Auckland.

We're better off looking at Singapore and Australia, Hendy says. "The advantage that Europe has over us at the moment is that a large proportion of its young adults will have some immunity from infection, which means that, all things being equal, their R will be lower than ours. So a New Zealand that had a similar vaccination profile to Ireland, say, would fare much worse because New Zealand would have a high R, meaning there would be more total infections."
Yes, he acknowledges that if New Zealand gets to 100 per cent coverage of over-60s then it would reduce our estimates of fatalities somewhat. But he says if we applied the current UK vaccination rates to New Zealand, he and his colleagues would still estimate about 5000 deaths.
What about Australia then?
Blakely, who is one of the leads of the latest University of Melbourne Covid modelling work on Victoria, a state of close to 7m people, says he has no major issue with the Te Punaha Matatini modelling.
He says it's simple, akin to working out just how dry a forest is before a bushfire. "It's useful for seeing how flammable a situation is."
He does believe, though, that his modelling offers a much more sophisticated glimpse of what could lie ahead. Rather than modelling what would happen if Covid essentially spread unchallenged, Blakely says his modelling seeks to reflect what would actually happen - that is, how politicians and public health authorities would react.
It also supports other Australian work that proposes keeping "light" public health restrictions in place at all times.
This would reduce the risk of lockdowns, but Blakely says even at 90 per cent coverage some public health restrictions will be necessary.
The University of Melbourne report notes: "As 2022 progresses, and we move into 2023, we can probably ease these minimal restrictions as immunity from natural infection creeps up and we revaccinate the whole population with better vaccines that (hopefully) reduce transmission risk more than current versions."
It outlines two scenarios. The first is called the Default Scenario and involves 80 per cent vaccination in adults only in a state the size of Victoria. The forecast then is 320 infections daily on average, 4000 hospitalisations, 860 patients in ICU and 1000 deaths.
But here's the kicker: it also accounts for the necessity of lockdown. In this particular case Victoria would need to spend 58 per cent of the year in lockdown.
(The authors say, by the way, that the model could be applied to New Zealand, given the demographic similarities.)
Then there's the Upgraded Scenario, which means 80 per cent of adults and children vaccinated and always-on public health measures. It projects 64 infections a day; 960 hospitalisations, 200 ICU admissions and 250 deaths over a year; and 14 per cent of time in lockdown.
The report notes authorities would need to work out what the public health measures involve; at a minimum it'd be mask use, working from home when you can, limits on gatherings. They're probably relatively close to level 2.
There are clearly a range of caveats, but extrapolated for a population the size of New Zealand, that's 17,850 infections a year (49 a day); 736 hospitalised; 191 deaths. Oh, and 51 days in lockdown.
There's one particular caveat that stands out. The Australian model accounts for both the AstraZeneca and Pfizer vaccines, which are used there. It views the Pfizer vaccine as being more effective at stopping transmission and serious illness.
It notes that if everyone gets the Pfizer jab - which is the case in New Zealand - the risk of lockdown reduces dramatically, infections drop off and there's a significant reduction in the number of people expected to die.

Early this morning – as usual – four daily newspapers landed heavily on Jackie’s kennel. Earlier than usual, because today’s the day that the Australian Financial Review Magazine carries its annual “Power” issue.
Jackie’s (male) co-owner picked up the papers from near Jackie’s kennel at around 5am. Opening up the AFR Magazine, there was the news that four state premiers –
Daniel Andrews (Victoria), Gladys Berejiklian (NSW), Mark McGowan (Western Australia) and Annastacia Palaszczuk (QLD) have been voted by a panel as The Most Powerful People in Australia.
That was around the time before the local cock crowed. By 1pm, Premier Berejiklian had been effectively forced to resign due to a forthcoming public inquiry into her conduct by the Independent Commission Against Corruption. This completes ICAC’s trio. ICAC’s perceptions of corruption have led to the resignation of three of the best premiers NSW has ever had – Nick Greiner, Barry O’Farrell and now Gladys Berejiklian. All were Liberal Party premiers. And all have presented as honest and not corrupt.
This shows the problem with the AFR’s Power issue. If Premier Berejiklian was really powerful, she could not have been removed by ICAC or any other organisation. Ms Berejiklian exercised legitimate authority – not untrammelled power. It’s much the same with the remaining premiers.
It would seem that the Power list was decided – and the photographs taken – some time before Prime Minister Scott Morrison was involved in the formation of the Australia-United Kingdom-United States (AUKUS) agreement. This is one of the most significant foreign policy initiatives that any Australian prime minister has been involved in. Sure some premiers delight in closing borders and locking down citizens. But Australia’s most significant political leader over the past year has been Prime Minister Morrison. Followed by (the soon to be former) Premier of NSW who sought to exercise as little power as possible during the COVID-19 pandemic and was involved in setting Australia on the road to social and economic recovery.
To use some pandemic jargon – the AFR Magazine Power Issue is in need of a re-set.
• DAVID SPEERS LETS SALLY MCMANUS GET AWAY WITH UNDOCUMENTED ASSERTION
David (“Interruptus”) Speers interrupted his Insiders guest Barnaby Joyce on 17 occasions last Sunday. But when presenting Q&A last night, Speersy went light on interruptions. Perhaps too light because he let ACTU secretary Sally McManus get away with making allegations seemingly designed to fudge the role of CFMEU trade unionists in the violent demonstrations in Melbourne last week against compulsory COVID-19 vaccinations for workers on various work sites. Let’s go to the transcript:
David Speers: So that mandate did, did fire up those protesters?
Sally McManus: Yes, absolutely, it did. But, there was a whole lead up to this. Like, for months and months and months, where on social media and elsewhere – and let’s face it, Craig Kelly, um, Clive Palmer, the Murdoch Press, um, Christiansen (George) are all saying that this [compulsory vaccinations] is, like, an impingement on your freedom. And so – and you can see it happening on social media every day, where people were being told that. So, by the time that mandate happened, people already had strong views about this. And so, I think that that was a volatile conflict-based environment that should have been avoided. Having said that, that was stoked, stoked and fed by those very people; the far right and those anti-vaxxers, so –
David Speers: What, and those union members and other members just were suckered into it, were they?
Sally McManus: Well, you think about it, like, the majority of construction workers and union members weren’t at that process, like, there’s, like – most construction workers are getting vaccinated and are pretty upset that they’re not working at the moment –
Talk about denial. Comrade Speers let Comrade McManus off the hook. There is not a skerrick of evidence that the Murdoch Press fired up anti-vaccine demonstrations in Melbourne last week. No evidence at all. Sally McManus did not provide any evidence. And the (normally) interventionist presenter David Speers did not ask for any evidence. Q+A – where leftist panellists make the accusations.
CAN YOU BEAR IT?
• SARAH FERGUSON TALKS ABOUT A “TONY” ON RADIO NATIONAL BREAKFAST ASSUMING THAT LISTENERS KNOW WHO “TONY” IS
As avid readers are only too well aware, Media Watch Dog just loves it when journalists interview journalists about journalism. And so it came to pass yesterday when ABC Radio National Breakfast presenter Hamish Macdonald interviewed ABC star Sarah Ferguson about her Foreign Correspondent story which aired last night concerning space travel. It was titled “Elon Musk and his mission to Mars”.
Your man Macdonald commenced the discussion by suggesting that “this looks like quite a jaunt you’ve been on”. Wherever could he have got the idea from? An ABC journo on a jaunt – who would have imagined it? To which Comrade Ferguson responded: “It is a jaunt” and commenced talking about the subject she knows best. Namely – herself. And yes, space which “blows” Comrade Ferguson’s mind. But “not quite literally, sadly”. Let’s go to the transcript:
Hamish Macdonald: Do you really want to go to space? Is that the final frontier for this intrepid reporter?
Sarah Ferguson: There’s no question. In fact, I’ll just mention Tony – which I don’t do very often. But someone asked me a question when I was filming about going to Mars. He asked me: “Would you go to Mars”. And I said, “Yes, of course”. We didn’t put it in the episode and Tony said: “You really want to go to Mars”? You realise it’s, you know, two years. If you go to Mars it’s at least two years – get there and by the time you get to do something and get back again.” So it didn’t end up in the episode because it seemed like I was being a little selfish, perhaps. But the answer is still yes.
Hamish Macdonald: Somewhere there’s an ABC News executive assigning you to Mars in a few years’ time.
Sarah Ferguson: If only, if only.
Now if someone had arrived in Australia from a trip to, say, Mars or even London – he or she would have no idea what Ms Ferguson was talking about. Who is this “Tony” who is so well known that he doesn’t require a surname? Tony Blair perhaps? Or Tony Abbott? Or maybe such one-time NASA astronaut Tony Antonelli?
It turns out it is none of the above. Sarah Ferguson was talking about her husband – former ABC TV Q&A presenter and current ABC reporter – Tony Jones. Life at the ABC is so incestuous that Comrade Ferguson simply assumed that listeners would know that the Tony who advises Ms Ferguson about the timing of space travel times to and from Mars is none other than her husband Tony Jones. Who happens to have joined Mrs Jones on their current taxpayer-funded jaunt to Washington DC. This follows Comrade Ferguson’s recent travels to Washington DC and Moscow and then New York and Dublin for stories – which revealed nothing of any significance.
For the record, MWD reckons that it would be a you-beaut idea if Comrade Ferguson went to Mars and took Comrade Jones with her. Provided no live TV crosses to Earth are possible. And provided the couple did not get overtime for spending their weekends in space. At least such travel would stop Ms Ferguson talking on the taxpayer funded broadcaster about herself and all her jaunts. Otherwise there will be more of the same. Can You Bear It?
• FRAN KELLY TALKS TO THE UK’s WOMAN IN CANBERRA
Could it be an example of the ABC – as in Australian Broadcaster Colonised? How else to explain the latest case of Victoria Treadell, British High Commissioner in Australia going on the ABC and lecturing Australians about climate change, global emissions and all that.
It’s impossible to imagine the BBC in London inviting George Brandis, Australia’s High Commissioner to the United Kingdom, on to a breakfast program to lecture Boris Johnson’s Conservative government about something or other. However, due to a throwback to colonial times, Fran Kelly appears only too keen to provide airtime for High Commissioner Treadell to give us Aussie mere mortals a lecture or two about something or other.
In an interview which went on for an excruciating 13 minutes and 20 seconds on Wednesday, HC Treadell initially (i) declared that Britain would “be disappointed” if Scott Morrison did not attend the forthcoming COP26 meeting in Glasgow, (ii) said that the Johnson government would like Australia to commit to net zero emissions by 2050, (iii) supported the views on emissions of NSW minister for energy Matt Kean and (iv) said that Australia should reset its current target of reducing emissions by between 26 to 28 per cent as of 2035.
Just after saying that she “didn’t want to get into domestic politics”, the UK High Commissioner did precisely this by drawing attention to what the British government wants the Australian government to do. Then discussion turned to the AUKUS arrangement and so on.
Fran (“I’m an activist”) Kelly said nothing as the High Commissioner lectured Australians about climate change. Comrade Kelly did not demur when Ms Treadell said that Britain will reduce its own emissions by 69 per cent by 2030 and 78 per cent by 2035. As if saying so is doing.
What’s more, Comrade Kelly did not ask the High Commissioner even one question about the fact that Britain is currently facing an energy crisis – since a cold winter led to lower than usual gas supplies, and a summer in which the wind did not blow has led to a lowering of energy supply from renewables. In short, Britain currently has a power shortage along with rising energy prices.
It was just like the colonial days of old. The Brits giving Australians a lecture – and Comrade Kelly was doffing her cap. What’s more Comrade Kelly did not interrupt her British overlord – which is not how she treats Coalition ministers in Australia. Can You Bear it?
• DAN ILIC LAUGHS AT HIS OWN JOKES – WHO ELSE WOULD?
Did anyone catch Dan Ilic on The World Today this week? – in the story reported by Katherine Gregory? For those not familiar, Dan Ilic is a self-described “investigative humourist”. If you ever tune in to ABC Comedy you will be familiar with this brand of comedy. Self-identifying as an “investigative humourist” means you can excuse both being not particularly funny or reaching the standard of a traditional investigative journalist. A win-win situation, to be sure – for an investigative humourist like Comrade Ilic.
Your man Ilic is currently running a crowd-funding campaign to pay for billboards critical of the Morrison government to be displayed in Glasgow at the time of the COP26 UN Climate Change Conference. His campaign is going well so far, and he has now expanded the scope of the project to include other methods of attacking the Morrison government.
Dan Ilic was extremely amused by his own campaign when he spoke about it on The World Today – cackling at his own jokes throughout the interview. Let’s go to the transcript:
Dan Ilic: We started off with a classic idea of trying to promote Australia. So subverting that – what would Scomo do if he was in our position? Well, he’d advertise Australia. So we thought, why not do ads for Australia? So we’ve got one that says: “Cuddle a koala, before we make them extinct”. (Giggling) Then the next billboard says: “Australia, net zero emissions by 2300”.
Katherine Gregory: So why do it this way? Well, firstly, he says it’s to make the people who always attend these conferences laugh. Within two hours of posting the call-out on Monday, Dan Ilic got the $12,000 he needed. It’s now up to $60,000.
Dan Ilic: These people are tired (Giggling). They are upset about Australia. In this climate conference, you will talk to people from all over the world about how annoyed they are with Australia’s lack of action on climate (Giggling). Secondarily, to have someone take a photo of it and to embarrass Scott Morrison….So I’ve kind of had to change the scope of this campaign. It looks like we could be close to projecting that billboard on to the SEC Armadillo, which is the conference centre where COP is being held (Giggling).
Dan Ilic certainly finds himself very funny – so at least someone does. MWD can’t see these mocking billboards having much impact on the COP conference, Australia’s policies on climate action or the climate in general. So far, all Dan Ilic’s crowd-funding campaign is doing is promoting Dan Ilic – it seems this is a cause some climate-concerned citizens are happy to hand over their cash to.
After raising enough for the billboards, Ilic has announced on IndieGogo (a crowd funding website) the “next phase” of the campaign – titled JokeKeeper. Get it? According to the website, this is a “A $1,000,000 fund to pay comedians, satirists, filmmakers, producers and data scientists to create a season of digital sh**stirring from November up until the election.” We can hardly wait. In the meantime, Can You Bear It?
• FOX SPORTS’ GERARD WHATELEY’S BIBLICAL EXPERIENCE AS MELBOURNE DEFEATED THE WESTERN BULLDOGS
Jackie’s (male) co-owner Hendo attended the 1964 Victorian Football League Grand-Final when Melbourne defeated Collingwood – and can remember the occasion well. It was a fine Melbourne spring day, of the secular genre – Melbourne won narrowly when its back-pocket Neil Crompton kicked a goal towards the end of the fourth quarter – and the crowd accepted the results. Sure it was the Jewish Sabbath with the Christian Sabbath soon to follow. But that was about it. God was not evident within the Melbourne Cricket Ground.
Not so last Saturday when the Melbourne Demons (also called Dees) defeated the Western Bulldogs (nee Footscray) in Perth in the Australian Football League Grand Final. It seems that this was a Divine occasion with a capital “D”. According to Melbourne-based sports journalist Gerard Whateley, that is.
Some of us thought that Melbourne won because it scored 16 out of the last 17 goals. But to your man Whateley, there was a spiritual edge to this victory. Here’s what he told viewers of 360 on Foxtel’s Fox Sports channel on Monday night about how it came about that Melbourne won its first premiership in 57 years:
Gerard Whateley: There was something spiritual about it. So the footy scientists will delve deep and you’ll see a lot of that over the summer. There was a spiritual aspect to it. To break a curse like that, there’s something Biblical….
At this stage, the Reverend Whateley was rescued by Jason Dunstall, he of the extremely non-spiritual Bounce program. Just as well. To your man Whateley, the Melbourne Demons v Western Bulldogs result was a bit like Moses coming down from the Mountain with tablets on which was written Melbourne’s game-plan which happened to have been devised by a Divine force.
Turn it up. It was just a football game. To old timers (like Hendo), it seems that the Reverend Whateley was somewhat dazed and needed access to Smelling Salts treatment circa 1950 to get a grip. Whateley banging on about spiritual matters and The Bible is enough to drive the believers out of churches, synagogues and mosques – or to turn off 350. Can You Bear It?
• NINE COLUMNIST JANE CARO SNEERS AT THE HOI POLLOI (AGAIN)
While on the topic of last Saturday’s Grand Final when the Dees (the Melbourne Demons) defeated the Bulldogs (i.e. the Western Bulldogs or Footscray), how about MWD fave Jane Caro’s Epistle to the hoi polloi tweeted on Saturday 25 September at – wait for it – 8.11pm? Here’s what Nine’s Sunday Life columnist had to say
That’s pretty clear, then. The leftist luvvie Caro, who had a gas-guzzling four-wheel drive to move from her home in Sydney to her farm somewhere else, doesn’t think much of mere mortals who follow Australian Rules Football – or, presumably, any other sport. Hence her tweet to “Dear most Aussies”. It would seem that the leftist comrade believes that “most Australians” are ready to read her tweets after 8pm on a Saturday night – including the inebriated and the stoned. Turn it up. There followed the following exchange:
Go on. Here Jane Caro – whose excuse for telling NSW voters that they were hopeless “truculent turds” when the Coalition defeated Labor in the March 2019 NSW State election was that she was pissed – is now boasting of having read all of Charles Dickens plus all of Jane Austen plus all of Elizabeth Gaskell. As if anyone gives a toss.
Now Jackie’s (male) co-owner has not read all the works of this trio – and, consequently does not know what he is missing. Such is life. But at least Hendo does not tweet on a Saturday night – it takes up too much drinking time. As to Comrade Caro’s intellectual snobbery – it raises this question: Can You Bear It?
MEDIA FOOL OF THE WEEK
GEORGE MEGALOGENIS’ CLAIM THAT THERE IS AN ANTI-SCOTT MORRISON “CONSENSUS” ON AUKUS FALLS OVER AT THE FIRST PAGE-TURN OF THE SMH
Media Watch Dog’s continuing advice to members of the Fourth Estate is to avoid Prophecy and Hyperbole. Alas, Nine columnist and author George Megalogenis failed on the latter front in his column in the Sydney Morning Herald last Saturday. Here’s how it commenced – under the heading “His sights on domestic politics, PM’s all at sea”.
It is hard to find anyone in Australia’s political and foreign policy establishments with a kind word to say about Scott Morrison’s handling of the French submarine fiasco. The consensus from both those who wish him well and his long-term critics is that the Prime Minister picked a needless fight with Paris, annoyed Jakarta, our most important neighbour, and even undermined Washington’s strategic interests in the region.
The reference was to the Morrison government’s decision to ditch the idea that Australia purchase conventional powered submarines from France and enter into an arrangement to obtain nuclear powered submarines from the United States or the United Kingdom. Hence the brand new AUKUS (Australia, United Kingdom, United States) agreement.
According to Comrade Megalogenis, it’s “hard to find anyone in Australia’s political and foreign establishment” who agrees with the decision. Moreover there is a “consensus” on this issue – from the Prime Minister’s supporters and opponents alike. This appeared on Page 30 of the SMH on 25 September 2021.
Yet turn to Page 32 and the SMH’s political editor Peter Hartcher had this to say – after commencing his column with lotsa sludge about an unnamed Chinese writer who once said that Australia was like a bat in an Aesop fable (yawn):
As a founding member of both AUKUS and the Quad, Australia is discrediting the prophets of permanent identity crisis and existential anguish. It turns out that Australia is not a lonely misfit. It is not eternally torn. It is forming new and stronger relationships with nations of the East and West, the Orient and the Occident. Neither confused nor embarrassed, Australia is finding its place…. Scott Morrison is the Prime Minister making these decisions and he gets full credit. Crucially, Labor has supported all the major decisions, making them national choices, not partisan posings.
How’s that for an alleged anti-Morrison “consensus”? Peter Hartcher had “a kind word to say about Scott Morrison”. And, according to an avid reader, so have the good people at the Lowy Institute and even at the United States Studies Centre – aka the US(eless) Studies Centre. By the way, the only sources quoted in your man Megalogenis’ critique of Prime Minister Morrison’s foreign policy and all that were “one senior Liberal” and “another source”. How authoritative can a Nine columnist get?
George Megalogenis: Media Fool of the Week.
ABC’S PAUL KENNEDY AGREES THAT HIS NEW BOOK IS “GREAT” ON ABC TV
As avid readers will recall, it is only a few weeks ago that ABC TV News Breakfast co-host Lisa Millar was flogging her book Daring to Fly on, yes, ABC TV News Breakfast. But that was then. This week, on Wednesday as Media Watch Dog recalls, it was Paul Kennedy’s turn to flog his latest book on the News Breakfast couch. Paul Kennedy used to present the sports segment until he was replaced by Tony (“Tax the rich”) Armstrong. Your man Kennedy now reports on sport for various ABC outlets.
Needless to say, PK was warmly welcomed back on the News Breakfast couch by presenters Michael Rowland and Lisa Millar. The former described Comrade Kennedy as “much loved” – he didn’t say by whom. Lisa Millar did likewise. Whereupon PK said: “I thought you got rid of me”. But, after that, it was plain sailing – especially when Comrade Millar described PK’s New Book Funkytown as “fantastic”.
So what’s it all about? MWD has not been able to obtain a copy of Funkytown – the reference is to the Melbourne south-east suburb of Frankston where the book is set. So MWD has to go on what Comrade Kennedy told viewers about his story. It goes something like this.
It’s 1993. PK is doing Year 12 at a local government school in or near outer suburban Frankston. He comes from what might be called a good home. But PK gets on the turps. He describes his (1993) self as “a jock”. You see, Young Kennedy “wanted to play AFL football” at the top level – but didn’t quite make it. So what happened to PK in Funkytown in 1993 as told in Funkytown? Well, not much, it seems.
PK had a mate called Adam. PK felt insecure and engaged in “a lot of bad choices including binge drinking”. His parents gave PK good advice – as in “don’t get too drunk”. But he did. PK apparently “almost got expelled from school”. But he didn’t, apparently. And – well let’s hear from the learned author’s mouth:
Lisa Millar: Close encounters with the police on a few occasions?
Paul Kennedy: Yes, yes and wound up in jail there, at the end, for a brief, um, time as well. Why, why did that – why did I make those choices? Because, um, there were no excuses for me. I came from a very peaceful, uh, virtually nondrinking household, my mum and dad gave us everything we could ever want, um,….
It’s not quite clear whether Comrade Kennedy was a guest of Elizabeth II in the clink – or just visiting a wayward friend in jail. In time, the teacher Mrs Mac gave the teenager a copy of Margaret Craven’s I Heard the Owl Call My Name. And, lo and behold, some years later PK got a gig at the taxpayer funded public broadcaster and he has lived happily ever after.
Michael Rowland then described Funkytown as “a great book”. [Is it as good as War and Peace? – MWD Editor.] Comrade Kennedy agreed – suggesting his very own tome is a must read for parents “particularly, um, women” bringing up male teenagers in Frankston circa 1993. Or something like that. Then PK congratulated Lisa on her book Daring to Fly. Which left viewers wondering – when’s Comrade Rowland’s book coming out?
By the way, News Breakfast devoted considerable time to Paul Kennedy’s Funkytown (Affirm Press) – which was described variously as “Fantastic” and “Great”. However, the program has shown no interest in Sharri Markson’s recently released What Really Happened in Wuhan (HarperCollins) which has attracted international attention.
Contrary to what Paul Barry declared on ABC TV’s Media Watch last year, Markson’s work is not part of a “conspiracy theory”. She merely raises the possibility that COVID-19 escaped from the Wuhan Institute of Virology. A subject which is being taken seriously by the intelligence agencies in President Biden’s administration. But to the powers that be at News Breakfast what Paul Kennedy got up to in Frankston some three decades ago is more interesting than what took place in Wuhan two years ago.
A NORMAN SWAN MOMENT
•ANOTHER FAILED (MAYBE) DR SWAN PREDICTION
On Monday 30 August 2021 the ABC’s resident COVID-19 expert Dr Norman Swan stopped by ABC TV’s News Breakfast to discuss the COVID situation in New South Wales. Here is how the segment began:
Michael Rowland: What’s your take on this situation? The Premier [Gladys Berejiklian], is being at least very upfront about what lies ahead for the state’s [NSW] health system.
Norman Swan: Yeah, cause unless the curve bends you could see 4,000 cases a day by the end of September, maybe sooner then that. Hopefully I’m wrong – the, the predictions are wrong about that. It’s hard to know, as vaccination rates go up, the hospitalisation rate will go down because you get a higher proportion of the population vaccinated. But it’s possibly between, around about 5 per cent of whatever number that is on a daily basis. With a delay of maybe 10, 12 days. Will end in hospital so if it’s 4,000 a day, it’s 400. And 1 in 50 of cases, not of those in hospital, but 1 in 50 could end up in ICU. So that ends up being a lot of people.
Norman (“Trust me, I’m Australia’s most trusted doctor”) Swan seems to have learnt some lessons from his previous failures in COVID prediction. He made sure to include the caveat “unless the curve bends” before claiming NSW COVID cases could reach 4,000 per day. He also corrected himself after accidentally saying “Hopefully I’m wrong”, making sure to let us know that it would be the predictions, not Dr Swan, which could be wrong.
Swan appears to have gotten the 4,000 number from modelling done by the Burnet Institute, but he chose to pass it on the News Breakfast audience as a likely outcome. As for his “unless the curve bends” hedge, that’s a little like a weatherman letting you know it will be a nice day “unless it rains”.
The good doctor also manages to once again flub primary school maths on hospitalisations. 5 per cent of 4,000 cases would be 200 hospitalisation, not 400.

NO TAKERS SO FAR ON SHANE WRIGHT’S CANDLE-STICKS SOLUTIONS TO THE ENERGY CRISIS
It is not so long ago since Shane Wright, senior economics correspondent for The Age and the Sydney Morning Herald, confidently declared on the Insiders program that “coal is like candlesticks”. Meaning that coal is as relevant today for producing energy as were candlesticks in the early 20th Century following the invention of electricity. Or something like that. He waxed lyrical about how the Candle Makers Union of old was wont to say 150 years ago: “These light bulbs, they’ll never catch on.”
Your man Wright was very confident about this gospel which he preached – apparently ignorant of the fact that such nations as China, India and Indonesia do not look like junking coal as an energy supplier anytime soon.
So far Shane (“Candlesticks”) Wright has yet to advise readers of the SMH and The Age of the increased demand for coal. As the Australian Financial Review Page One headline put it yesterday “Coal, gas exports boom”.
Strange, isn’t it, that nations in East Asia and Western Europe are seeking to overcome their immediate energy shortages by purchasing gas and, yes, coal. So far, no world leader has asked Nine’s comrade Wright for advice as to how to solve their energy problems by the use of candlesticks.
DOCUMENTATION
•RED FACES ALL ROUND IN THE “I STAND WITH DAN AND AGAINST GLADYS” MEDIA CLUB
Since the beginning of the Delta variant outbreak in Sydney in June, there has been no shortage of media figures seeking to portray the response by the New South Wales government as hopeless. By astonishing coincidence, these were often the same media figures who spent much of 2020 defending the Victorian government’s handling of COVID. In the last week, daily case numbers in Victoria have once against passed those in New South Wales. In the interest of posterity, some of the most embarrassing sprays from the “Dan’s our man” club are collected below:
Peter FitzSimons on the Victorian playbook
MWD is not aware of any update from The Ex-Bandannaed one on whether the Victorian playbook still works.
Julia Zemiro on replacing Gladys and Brad
When Victoria recorded 1438 cases on Thursday, Julia Zemiro did not call for Dan Andrews and Martin Foley to be “replaced”.
Lisa Wilkinson’s apology to Victoria on behalf of New South Wales
On 6 August 2021, at the beginning of the sixth Melbourne lockdown, Lisa Wilkinson appeared on The Project to grovel on behalf of NSW:
Lisa Wilkinson: I must say this afternoon when the news broke that you guys [Victorians] were going into lockdown from 8 O’clock, you there are a lot of us in Sydney who feel like we need to apologise to you guys. Because all of this comes from what happened six weeks or so ago with that Bondi cluster that happened. And the problem was the messaging from the very beginning - and look I don’t know, we’ve all become experts. But just watching this unfold, it really does feel like problem dates back to the original mixed messaging where the lockdown [in NSW] wasn’t hard enough. And people wanted a hard lockdown, we wanted to know what the rules were so we could follow them and get out of it quickly. But Victoria keeps proving every time that the minute you get an outbreak there, you stamp on it and you get back to normal again. It’s just a pity it’s happening to you guys for the sixth time now.
Perhaps another apology will be forthcoming from Mrs Bandanna soon – along with Mr Bandanna.
Lisa Wilkinson in a huff because Gladys dared mention an end to lockdown
Lisa Wilkinson was very upset that Gladys Berejiklian was mentioning light at the end of the tunnel with 681 cases. Now Dan Andrews is announcing a pathway out of lockdown with over 1,000 cases per day and still rising. Lisa Wilkinson does not seem nearly as bothered by this.
MWD thanks avid readers will value this documentation now – and into the future.

What happens if Victoria’s hospitals are overrun with Covid patients

Full text: Without vastly improved monitoring of emergency presentations and deaths, researchers warn the impact flowing through all areas of the health system – including intensive care – will be far greater than scenarios presented in modelling governments are basing their reopening road maps on.
In a new paper Melbourne emergency doctors and researchers from Monash University flag concerns a flood of cases following the end of lockdowns combined with staff shortages will see the ambulance and hospital emergency system quickly overrun.
Because the Doherty Institute modelling only focuses on ventilation in ICU and deaths in the next six months – but fails to account for a predicted demand on the emergency care system – the team led by Monash’s Dr Rob Mitchell believes the wider impact on other severe conditions has been overlooked.
“If the health system becomes overwhelmed, the number of preventable deaths may increase dramatically,” the authors wrote.
“Cancer deaths will go up. Cardiac arrest survival will go down. Patients requiring a high level of support for respiratory or cardiovascular disease will not receive treatment quickly.
“Cross infections will occur between patients because of inadequate clinical spaces, and overburdened staff may not have capacity to ensure optimal infection control.”
Senior intensive care physicians have also told the Herald Sun of concerns the wider impacts of allowing high numbers of critically ill Covid patients have not been fully appreciated.
Covid patients currently spend an average of 16 days in ICU, compared to just three days for those with other life-threatening conditions, such as recovering from cardiac or cancer surgery.
Therefore, if the hospital system reaches a critical mass of Covid patients the number left untreated or even dying from other serious conditions may multiply.
When Victoria’s Covid restrictions were eased in April-June 2021 hospital emergency departments were flooded with an extra 122,148 patients than they saw a year earlier.
In their analysis inEmergency Medicine Australasia, Dr Mitchell and colleagues Peter Cameron, Gerard O’Reilly and Biswadav Mitra said the reopening of Australia after reaching 70 and 80 per cent vaccination was likely to see a much greater surge in cases.
They warned that death rates must be monitored and interpreted closely so the health system can react to any trends.
They called for a national registry tracking emergency demand and outcomes to provide a real time indication of where pressure was building, and where help was needed – similar to surveillance that already occurs in ICU.
It was also critical to measure the delays to care in high-risk groups such as patients with stroke, trauma and coronary syndromes to determine if they were slipping though the cracks caused by Covid, the doctors wrote.
It comes as a survey of more than 1000 essential workers has revealed that 30 per cent of emergency services employees and 20 per cent in healthcare are considering changing their job because of the pandemic.
In Victoria, 79 per cent of all essential workers – including in health, emergency services and education – say they are finding it harder to cope with the pandemic this year than last. This is the highest number in Australia.
The survey was conducted by independent research company Insightfully in mid-September for Hiver, a new essential workers’ digital bank.
Carolyn Murphy, of Hiver, said: “The people who face-up to the very personal impacts of COVID-19 on a daily basis are telling us they are nearing breaking point.”
At Friday’s national cabinet meeting, the national medical expert panel will unveil its recommendation to make the Covid-19 jab mandatory for all healthcare workers.
Under Victorian rules, healthcare workers are already required to have had at least one dose by October 15, and to be fully vaccinated by December 15.

Full text: The Tasmanian government won’t consider fully opening borders until the state hits 90 per cent vaccination rate and 100 per cent of people having access to jabs.
Mr Gutwein also wants fresh modelling and to see the trend in case numbers in NSW and Victoria before making a decision.
On Wednesday, Mr Gutwein claimed Tasmania would suffer “upwards of” 14,900 cases, 590 hospital admissions, 97 ICU admissions and nearly 100 deaths over six months.
But the Doherty Institute modelling on which his assumption is based is a national outbreak which infects nearly 750,000 people within six months.
Australia has experienced 105,000 infections in the 18 months of the pandemic so far.
The Doherty Institute stressed “the deliberately artificial nature of our assumption that Australia’s population would experience a uniform national epidemic”.
The national plan agreed to by all states allows for the easing of state and national border restrictions once vaccination rates reach 80 per cent.
These include an exemption from domestic travel restrictions for vaccinated people and the gradual reopening of international travel with “safe countries”.
Minister for Senior Australians and Aged Care Services Richard Colbeck urged Mr Gutwein to stick to the plan.
“Under the consolidation phase of the National Plan, 80 per cent of adults aged 16 and over will be fully vaccinated,” he said.
“This will allow residents of all states and territories, including Tasmania, to live with the virus like any other infectious disease, while minimising serious illness and death.
“We know from extensive modelling and the experience of other nations, that high rates of vaccination offer a pathway to normality.
“As previously stated, I am confident any decisions made by Premier Gutwein will based on the ongoing advice of National Cabinet and the AHPPC and serve the best interests of all Tasmanians.”
Senator Eric Abetz said he was confident the Premier would make the right decision, as he had throughout the pandemic.
“We can’t force people to be vaccinated and we can’t live with lockdowns, border restrictions, mental health issues, huge government debt, and jobs losses forever,” he said.
“The rest of the world is moving forward with their lives and eventually we need to as well.”
Data from Tuesday shows Tasmania at 75.8 per cent first dose rates and 57.8 per cent fully vaccinated. The state is expected to reach 90 per cent by December 1.
More than 3000 doses are being administered daily and the rate is increasing.
Nationally 77.3 per cent of eligible people have had their first dose and 53.4 per cent have had their second dose.
An announcement on when the state will would relax border restrictions is expected to be made before Christmas.
Tasmania remains in a state of emergency.

Full text: Almost 100 Tasmanians would lose their lives to COVID-19 if the state opened its borders to the country at an 80 per cent vaccination rate.
This statistic is based on state-specific modelling, revealed on Wednesday, applied to the Doherty Institute report on border reopenings.
Premier Peter Gutwein said there would be 14,900 COVID cases in the state in the first six months should Tasmania open to states, including NSW and Victoria, at 80 per cent with baseline restrictions.
He said there would be 590 hospital admissions, 97 intensive care admissions, and almost 100 deaths.
"As we move to reopen our borders, the Delta [strain] will arrive," Mr Gutwein said.
"When Delta arrives, that will mean that some people will get sick, some people will get very sick, and unfortunately some people will die."
Health Department secretary Kathrine Morgan-Wicks said the state was still on track to reach a 90 per cent vaccination rate by December 1.
She said more than 331,000 Tasmanians had been administered their first dose of the COVID vaccine and more than 251,000 had been fully vaccinated.
Ms Morgan-Wicks said more than 25,000 people aged over 50 years old had not yet received a first dose of the vaccine.
She said those in the 12 to 15-year-age group were lagging behind the vaccination rate of that cohort in other states.
Mr Gutwein said borders were planned to be reopened by Christmas, however, that depended on circumstances around COVID-19 in other jurisdictions.

Victoria’s Covid Delta peak to hit higher number than NSW

Full text: There were 950 new cases reported in Victoria on Wednesday, the highest number for that state ever in the pandemic. The state reported seven deaths.
The results came from 61,322 tests.
As case numbers continue to climb in Victoria, the NSW outbreak appears to be on the decline.
But Deakin University Epidemiologist Catherine Bennett was hopeful the speed at which case numbers are increasing in Victoria will continue to slow.
The highest number of daily infections in NSW is so-far 1,603 – reported on September 11.
Victorian infections have surpassed NSW case numbers for two-days running, on Monday and Tuesday.
Despite Victorian Premier Daniel Andrews imposing some of the harshest lockdown measures in the country, the state is set to reach a rolling seven-day average of 1960 cases per day by October 25 — according to Burnet Institute modelling.
The modelling shows infections then beginning to decline.
Prof Bennett said the “rapid growth” in the early stages of the outbreak suggested “restrictions in place in Victoria weren’t working as well (as in NSW)”.
But she said the concentration of cases in western and southwestern Sydney benefited NSW, compared to Victoria where cases are more spread out.
“While there are strong restrictions in Western Sydney. I guess it’s harder to have good compliance at a whole city or state level,” she said.
Burnet Institute modelling prepared for the NSW government predicted cases in local government areas of concern would peak at a seven-day average of about 1,500 new infections a day, in mid-September.
Premier Gladys Berejiklian has been hesitant to declare that NSW has reached the peak of infections but analysts have projected cases will continue to fall.
University of Melbourne Research fellow Chris Billington has estimated NSW’s “R-effective” — the rate at which Covid spreads — is now at 0.85. The same researcher has estimated Victoria’s R-effective is 1.31, meaning cases will continue to increase.
The percentage of positive swabs in Victoria is significantly higher than in NSW.
The 950 cases reported by Victoria on Wednesday came from 61,300 tests – with 1.55 per cent of tests coming back positive.
The test positivity rate on Tuesday was 1.75 per cent, and 1.38 per cent.
Significantly more tests are being reported each day in NSW; on Tuesday, 0.65 per cent of tests came back positive. That figure was 0.84 per cent on Monday.
Prof Bennett said that the speed at which case numbers are increasing is slowing down, but the growth appears more dramatic due to the high number of infections.

Victoria's COVID cases surge past NSW's

Publication info: The Age ; Melbourne, Vic. [Melbourne, Vic]. 29 Sep 2021: 4.

Full text: Victoria has surpassed NSW for new COVID-19 cases for the first time since the most recent outbreaks of the Delta strain began.
Yesterday, Victoria recorded 867 new coronavirus cases - the highest number since the pandemic began last year. NSW had 863, although revised figures from both state governments reveal the outbreaks crossed paths on Monday, when NSW had 806 cases compared with Victoria's 845.
One epidemiologist in Victoria warned the state needed to drive up vaccination rates in the city's most vulnerable areas, even as the state reached its 80 per cent first-dose vaccination mark yesterday.
From today, having hit that target, Melburnians can once again go boating, play tennis or golf, travel 15 kilometres from home and masks can be removed at playgrounds to eat and drink.
Premier Daniel Andrews said this week he hoped cases would plateau when Victoria reached the 50 per cent double-dose mark, around when NSW's daily case numbers began subsiding. NSW reached 50 per cent double-dose vaccinated on September 17. Yesterday, 48.42 per cent of Victoria's population aged over 16 was fully vaccinated.
NSW Premier Gladys Berejiklian warned this week that case numbers would "go through the roof" when her state reopened next month as it reaches 70 per cent of the population over 16 double vaccinated.
The Andrews government is hoping a vaccination sprint will result in the state following a similar trajectory to NSW. "The best lived-experience we can point to is NSW," Health Minister Martin Foley said, pointing to "high-risk" communities in Sydney's west - similar socio-economic groups live in Melbourne's west and north.
"Those high-risk communities, once they got over 50 [per cent vaccinated] the curve started to bend. It's the same variant, it's the same vaccines, the communities are not dissimilar in a lot of ways," he said.
Victoria's road map out of lockdown relied heavily on modelling released by the Burnet Institute in September, which foreshadowed thousands of new COVID-19 cases each day by late October. But the state could potentially avoid projected daily average infection peaks between 1500 and 3000 cases, as vaccination rates in high-risk communities increase. The state's effective reproduction number (the measure of how many people each infected person passes the virus onto) has fallen from 1.5 at the time the Burnet Institute conducted its modelling to 1.2 in recent days.
If that rate continues to fall - thanks in part to increased vaccination and testing, people in the north and west of Melbourne changing their behaviour in response to the growing COVID-19 threat, and the shutdown of the high-risk construction sector - daily cases may not go as high as projected.
"A whole lot of work is being done to bring up those vaccination levels, and once you start to get control of the outbreak, the [reproduction rate] will naturally come down," said Professor Margaret Hellard, co-author of the Burnet modelling. "Similarly to what we're seeing in Sydney local government areas of concern, there were high caseloads, and a huge amount of work was done to increase vaccination, work with local communities so they understand restrictions. This then lowers the [reproduction rate]."
Catherine Bennett, Deakin University chair in epidemiology, said it could take a higher level of vaccination to turn Melbourne's outbreak around "because we have a different distribution of the virus in the community than Sydney. We don't have it as contained as they did at a similar point".
There had been a "concentrated effort to get the vaccinations rolling out in those hotspots in Sydney".
Asked if case numbers in Melbourne would now plateau, Professor Bennett warned that, while they would, the state could have high numbers in the weeks ahead before the levelling off. "We're still on an upward incline. So while it could turn around any time, at the moment we're tracking towards 1000 cases a day in the next few days."
The City of Latrobe entered a seven-day lockdown from 11.59pm last night with 18 active cases in the local government area .

Full text: Senator Hanson and her partner Tony Nyquist are notoriously private about their relationship of 13 years.
But the One Nation leader made a rare comment about Mr Nyquist, revealing she has been unable to see him for the past three months because of the NSW-Queensland border closure.
Mr Nyquist is currently in Port Stephens, more than 700km away from Senator Hanson who lives in Beaudesert, Queensland.
“He was visiting family in NSW and that was about … probably near three months ago, and he can't come home now,” Senator Hanson told NCA NewsWire.
“He can't come home. He’s not regarded as a Queenslander. He is registered in NSW, but still this (Queensland) is his home here as well.
“Of course I miss my partner of 13 years, of course I do.”
The outspoken senator also revealed she had been separated from her own daughter, who is based in Tasmania, for almost two years due to Covid-19 travel restrictions.
“I've only got one daughter, and I haven’t seen her. I have a very close bond with my daughter,” she said.
“I empathise with people, you know. I’m going through this too.”
The One Nation leader also has a newborn granddaughter that she has not be able to visit.
“I've got a three-week-old new granddaughter and I haven’t been able to see her. And I don’t know when I will be able to see her,” Senator Hanson said.
Senator Hanson, who has refused to get vaccinated against Covid-19, lashed the state premiers for shutting their borders in an attempt to limit the spread of coronavirus.
“All of this has been political, it's been a scare mongering. It is unwarranted unnecessary and destroying people’s lives and businesses,” Senator Hanson said.
“Parents are separated from their own children and this is happening because of Covid. Those that live in other states – people haven't seen their children for months.”
Senator Hanson said she was just one of many Australian who had been separated from their loved ones due to Covid-19 restrictions, calling on Prime Minister Scott Morrison to step in and put an end to the state-led public health orders.
“The Prime Minister has lost control of this country to the premiers,” she said.
“He’s going to have to take it to the High Court to make a ruling to stop the premiers from shutting the borders whenever it suits them.”
The Doherty modelling followed by the government outlines a 70-80 per cent full vaccination rate must be reached before it is safe to reopen the country.
But Senator Hanson claimed the restrictions were “unnecessary”, accusing the government of having no understanding of what Australian families were going through.
“Didn't they want the parliamentarians to go through an empathy course? I wish they’d done it because I’ll tell you what, they need it,” she said.

Mask restriction eased as Qld records zero new local Covid cases

Full text: Queenslanders will still have to wear face masks for at least another two weeks, but the new tweak means they can now be removed at venues once patrons sit down - even if they’re not eating.
Chief health officer Jeannette Young said the rule applied to all venues.
“Once you sit down, you can take your mask off,” she said on Friday.
“Doesn’t matter if you’re in a cinema, theatre, at school or work.
“But once you stand up, please put it on again because we don’t know who you’re coming into contact with.”
Deputy Premier Miles said easing of mask rules was a reflection of rising vaccination rates ahead of the weekend’s NRL final series and Brisbane Riverfire event.
There were 11,145 Covid tests in Queensland in the last 24 hour period and another 22,880 people jabbed, bringing the state’s total to 62.1 per cent with a first dose and 43.4 per cent fully vaccinated.
Mr Miles also faced a familiar line of questioning regarding state’s reopening plan and tough stance on borders.
He reiterated that the state would wait until it sees next week’s updated Doherty Institute modelling before making any decisions on how and when the state will open up to interstate and international visitors.
“There’s two different approaches: You’ve got some people out there saying, what they would like to happen, whereas we are outlining what we think is likely to happen,” Mr Miles said.
“The fact is, I do think that by Christmas, a number of the restrictions in New South Wales and Victoria will be eased. But all of those restrictions have already been eased here in Queensland.
“Delta is the gift Queensland does not want from Scott Morrison. He gave Delta to Sydney, and now they’re trying to regift it to us. Well, we don’t want that, we want to stay open, like we are now, and we’ll continue to make our decisions on that basis.”
Friday’s press conference came after Premier Annastacia Palaszczuk on Thursday refused to commit to a national plan to reopen once an 80 per cent full vaccination rate is reached.
The Queensland government’s strict border and reopening stance has drawn ire from the federal government and state opposition, and has frustrated tourism groups keen to welcome interstate and international visitors.
But state transport and main roads Minister Mark Bailey was another on Friday speaking out in support of his government’s record.
“Queenslanders are not confused. They are very clear,” he wrote on Twitter.
“They do not want to die from the Covid virus due to the snail paced rollout of the vaccine from our slow to act PM.
“They don’t want the massive outbreak in NSW to happen in Queensland.”

Pandemic election a tricky affair

Full text: Given that the coronavirus is immune to all modelling, several factors could infect the government's best-laid plans.
So, with Scott Morrison pulling the new AUKUS pact out of his hat, will we be off to a khaki election? It would hardly be the first election conservative governments have won by promising to save us from the threat to our north.
That's why I doubt it. For an issue to dominate an election campaign, it has to be in contention. National security is an issue that always favours the conservatives, so Labor won't be offering any objection to AUKUS or nuclear subs.
Similarly, an issue that should figure large in the campaign is whether the Coalition is too conflicted over climate change to be worthy of re-election. But that issue naturally favours Labor, so Morrison won't want to take up that fight.
Which leaves? The economy, stupid. Until the end of June, the economy was looking in great shape, better than it had been even before the pandemic. But the arrival of the Delta variant means that, right now, more than half the national economy is back in lockdown, and looking mighty sick.
Does it surprise you that Morrison's so keen to see the south-eastern mainland states out of lockdown and the others opening their borders, and is pressing the premiers accordingly? He desperately needs the economy back looking trim and terrific by March - May at the latest. Add to this the business community's pressure to get back to business - "don't bother me with all the COVID details" - and the public's impatience to get life back to normal. Sydneysiders have had enough of lockdowns; Melburnians have had more than enough - something even "Dictator" Dan Andrews can see.
So Gladys Berejiklian and Andrews have added their separate modelling by the Burnet Institute to Morrison's National Plan modelling by the Doherty Institute - not to mention the independent modelling by the Kirby Institute - and announced their "road maps" for opening up their economies progressively once vaccination rates have reached 70 per cent and 80 per cent of the eligible population, expected in mid-to-late October and early November.
NSW is projected to be only about a week ahead of Victoria, and the gap between 70 and 80 per cent only about two weeks.
Everyone's so pleased to be getting on with it that we risk losing sight of the high risks the two premiers are running. If all goes to plan, we'll be back to a new (still-masked) normal by early next year, and the economy will be humming in time for a March election.
But models, based on a host of unmentioned explicit and implicit assumptions, inevitably give politicians and punters a false sense of certainty. No model can accurately predict something as mercurial as human behaviour. And, as we've learnt, a new coronavirus knows nothing of models and is a law unto itself.
The risk Andrews and Berejiklian face is that so many unvaccinated people contract the virus that our hospital system is overwhelmed, with people dying because they were turned away, leading to a number of deaths the public finds unacceptable. Whether they press on or turn back, the premiers would be in deep trouble.
The first risk comes from an ambulance and hospital system that, 18 months after the crisis began, is already at full stretch. The premiers tell us our wonderful health workers are coping; the message from ambos, doctors and nurses on the ground says they're close to collapse. The next risk comes from the inconvenient truth that our vaccination targets of 70 and 80 per cent of people 16 and older turn out to be just 56 and 64 per cent of the full population. That's a huge proportion of unvaccinated friends and relations.
Remember, too, that these are statewide averages. They conceal less-vaccinated pockets of particularly vulnerable groups - people with disabilities, the Indigenous, for instance - and a city-country gap that leaves many rural towns hugely exposed, together with their limited hospital capacity.
Even the decision to move as soon as the 70 and 80 per cent targets are reached, rather than wait another fortnight for vaccines to become fully effective, carries a risk of higher infection.
Both the Burnet and revised Doherty modelling say starting to open up at 70 per cent rather than 80 per cent is likely to involve significantly higher infections, hospitalisations and deaths. Why take that risk just to avoid waiting another fortnight or so?
Morrison's national plan called for all states to open up together once all had reached the 70 and 80 per cent targets, but now NSW and Victoria are going first.
This increases the risk that, despite the other states' closed borders, the virus will spread to them - where the lesser threat of catching the virus has caused vaccination rates to be much lower.
The risk for Berejiklian and Andrews is that they could be moving the Delta outbreak from the city to the country. The risk for Morrison is that, by pressing those two to open up early, he could be moving the outbreak from one half of the economy to the other.

More data needed on kids’ Covid-19 jabs, say doctors

Full text: The invitation to the company from Health Minister Greg Hunt came after Pfizer announced that results of its initial clinical trials of its vaccine in children aged five to 11 had demonstrated safety and a strong antibody response.
Mr Hunt has encouraged Pfizer to submit its data to the TGA at the same time as initiating the approvals process with the US Food and Drug Administration.
But pediatrician Fiona Russell, a professor at the University of Melbourne, said Pfizer’s initial studies did not have enough participants to prove the vaccine was safe for children.
Teenagers and young people have been found to have a very rare side effect of myocarditis ­(inflammation of the heart), which has been found overseas to occur at the rate of around six cases in 100,000 children aged 12 to 15.
Pfizer’s clinical trials of its vaccine in the five to 11 age group ­enrolled 2300 participants.
“In a clinical trial of about 2300, that is really an insufficient size to be able to look at whether that rare side effect occurs or not,” Professor Russell said.
“Safety is really paramount because this is the age group that is least affected by Covid. It has the mildest of infections and very, very uncommonly has serious outcomes. So the risk-benefit analysis in this age group becomes even more challenging.
“It’s absolutely critical we have this safety data. We wouldn’t want to be vaccinating otherwise healthy children and making them sick from a rare side effect.”
Pfizer and BioNTech said on Monday a lower dose of their COVID-19 vaccine induced a robust immune response in 5 to 11 year olds, and they plan to ask for authorization to use the vaccine in children in that age range in the United States, Europe and elsewhere as soon as possible. This report produced by Jillian Kitchener.
There is a significant divergence of opinion in the medical community concerning the relative merits of vaccination children, and also among epide­miologists who are split on whether vaccinating children is a significant factor in curbing the spread of Covid-19.
The Doherty Institute has said that vaccinating children aged under 16 would have only a minimal impact on the spread of the virus, but modelling by the University of Melbourne has estimated that vaccinating children would halve the long-term spread of Covid-19.
Doherty modelling has predicted that anywhere from between 30 to 86 children could die of Covid-19 in the six months following restrictions being eased.
Pediatric intensivist Greg Kelly said that even though children are extremely unlikely to fall seriously ill from Covid-19, even a small risk of severe illness and death was enough to justify mass vaccination.
“In the whole of Australia each year, only about 30 kids die in road accidents, and about 30 kids die from drowning. But we have substantial public health and regulatory things around both of those things to keep numbers really low,” Dr Kelly said.
“The Doherty’s low estimate of the number of kids who may die of Covid is 30 in six months, which is double the number that die in road accidents each year.
“So yes we are talking about small percentages, but when we understand the number of kids who could get infected and when we realise how rare serious illness and death is in children overall, then those numbers are actually really important.”
Asha Bowen, the program head of vaccines and infectious diseases at the Telethon Kids Institute and head of the Perth Children’s Hospital’s department of infectious diseases, said it was much more common for adults to spread Covid-19 to children than the other way around.

Full text: Victorian Premier Daniel ­Andrews has left the door open to easing some restrictions sooner than his road map sets out, should the extremely pessimistic scenario depicted in the Burnet Institute modelling that informed the plan not eventuate.
The modelling estimates that Victoria will be grappling with ­between 1400 and 2900 Covid cases a day between October 19 and ­October 31, despite plans to remain in lockdown until October 26, and daily case numbers that have remained between last Wednesday’s 423 and Monday’s 567 over the past seven days.
The institute also predicts that 2202 people will have died from Covid in Victoria between July 1 and December 31.
Accounting for 12 deaths that have already occurred during the current outbreak, there would need to be an average of more than 21 deaths every day between now and the end of the year for the prediction to be realised.
Asked whether the modelling was realistic, Mr Andrews said while the modellers had done “an enormous amount of work”, their estimates were “a projection” and “not a fact”.
“We’re going to be doing everything we can to get that number down further,” the Premier said. “It could be that number or higher; if you look at the Burnet modelling, it projects a range.
“What I know for a fact is we can’t stay locked down forever ­because that comes at a cost all of its own.” The Premier’s road map has been attacked by a wide range of business groups, including the Victorian Chamber of Commerce and Industry .
The peak industry body described it as a “roadblock”, and Melbourne lord mayor Sally Capp, who asked the government to account for the fact that NSW traders are set to be granted “more generous freedoms” than their Victorian counterparts at the 70 and 80 per cent full vaccination stages.
Mr Andrews said Victoria may benefit from the fact that it is ­behind NSW in vaccinating its population, in that it will be able to learn from the experiences north of the Murray. “We will be able to watch and see what happens when they ­deliver the first move of their road map. I wish them well but ­hopefully … we can say, based on that, maybe we can bring this (road map) forward,” Mr Andrews said.
Victoria’s 567 new locally ­acquired cases on Monday represented the highest daily caseload since the state’s second wave peaked at 687 cases (revised down from 725 due to duplications) on August 4, 2020.
The death of a woman in her 70s from Moreland in Melbourne’s north took the state’s death toll for the current outbreak to 12 – adding to 820 Covid-­related deaths in 2020.
As of Monday, there were 209 people in Victorian hospitals with coronavirus, including 59 in intensive care, of whom 40 were on ventilators.
As of Sunday, 72.61 per cent of Victorians aged 16 and over had received at least a first dose of Covid vaccine, including 0.64 per cent of the age group who had their first dose on Sunday.
As for second doses, 44.1 per cent of 16+ Victorians are fully vaccinated, including 0.25 per cent who received their second jab on Sunday.
The Andrews government’s road map out of lockdown ­estimates Victoria will reach 80 per cent single-dose vaccination for those aged 16 and over next Sunday, with 70 per cent set to be double-dosed by ­October 26.
The 80 per cent double-dose threshold would be reached by November 5.

Full text: Modelling conducted for the Victorian government predicts its road map out of lockdown has a better than one-in-two chance of exceeding the state's hospital and ICU capacity, and will lead to the deaths of between 1455 and 3152 people.
Avoiding such a scenario, if possible, will require an enormous last effort from Victorians over the coming two months - redoubling efforts to stop the virus spreading even as the vaccination rate rises.
Had Victorian Premier Daniel Andrews chosen to maintain lockdown after 80 per cent vaccination coverage had been reached, it would cut the chances of overwhelming hospitals to one in four and projected deaths by between 786 and 1726, modelling by the Burnet Institute predicts.
The reopening road map, announced on Sunday, creates "significant additional risk", the modellers note. "The modelling clearly shows, for Victoria to open up and not put the health system under enormous pressure is extremely difficult," said Professor Margaret Hellard, co-author of the modelling.
"The hospital system is going to be put under stress. Our job as Victorians is to try to help cut that stress, by doing everything we can possible," she said. "We are requiring a final, last, one to two months of huge effort."
Burnet's modelling predicts a first peak in daily average infections of between 1400 and 2900 in the last two weeks of October. In a quarter of simulations, hospital capacity is exceeded despite Melbourne being in lockdown.
A second larger peak is forecast for mid-December, caused by increased virus transmission as restrictions ease, before case numbers fall away. Between July and December 2021, between 1455 and 3152 Victorians are projected to die of COVID-19 under the road map, including the 11 deaths in the current outbreak.
Two more-optimistic scenarios are modelled: one in which people who are fully vaccinated continue to get tested at high rates if they have any symptoms (the modelling notes this may be "difficult to achieve"), and one in which a 15 per cent reduction in non-household transmission can be achieved.
"That needs a major effort on Victorians' behalf. It needs them to wear masks. To not visit each other in homes over the next month," said Professor Hellard.
Even under those optimistic scenarios, there was an 18 to 29 per cent chance of hospital capacity being exceeded. These projections are very uncertain and subject to a lot of random chance as the epidemic is only in its early days. Importantly, Mr Andrews suggested the pace of reopening could change depending on the load on the healthcare system.
"[The modelling] makes assumptions, it assumes things that will happen and won't happen over a period of time," he said.
"I want to make it very clear to all Victorians, particularly to those working in our health system, as we deliver this road map, we will monitor every hour of every day, how many people are in hospital, how much pressure is there on our health system. Are we balancing that? Are we able to continue to provide the best care to everyone that needs it?"
Mr Andrews called the Burnet Institute's modelling "sobering reading". It was the cost of reopening, he said.
"We cannot permanently suppress this virus ... we have got to open the place up because remaining closed forever has its own cost.
"We are opening up, no doubt about that. There will be no turning back. We have to normalise this, we have to pass through this pandemic. We cannot have a perpetual suppression of this virus. There will be pain, it will be challenging."
The other option the Premier had was to remain in lockdown past the 80 per cent double-dose vaccination milestone, said Dr Michael Lydeamore, a Monash University researcher who has contributed to the Doherty Institute's reopening modelling.
That would keep numbers lower - although still with a significant risk of overwhelming the healthcare system.
"Public health is all about taking these trade-offs," he said. "We've been in lockdown now for two years, basically. That's OK for people like me. But think about six-year-old kids. They have missed two years of school. There comes a time when it's a risk you end up willing to take"
Both Dr Lydeamore and Associate Professor James Trauer, head of epidemiological modelling at Monash, said the plan was a sensible, cautious and evidence-based move toward reopening.
"Overall, it's a pretty good plan, and gets the balance about right," said Professor Trauer. "It lands a little toward the cautious side.
"It recognises the importance of airborne transmission as being really critical to the spread of COVID. Clearly, airborne transmission is critical to the transmission of Delta."

On a rollercoaster to Christmas

Full text: Predicting the future is risky, but at least there is now a road map to take Victoria towards it.
The long-awaited Victorian road map has been released.
It looks good. At first pass it is a sensible balance of cautious opening up and trying to keep within the principles of the national plan for reopening.
As emphasised by Premier Daniel Andrews yesterday, it is based on modelling. The virus does not listen to the modelling and behave as we forecast. Indeed, case numbers in Victoria may have just plateaued, whereas the Burnet modelling underlying the road map forecast that daily case numbers under our current public health and social measure settings (if continued indefinitely) would peak at 1400-2900 cases in the second half of October.
Some key features of the road map include an incremental opening up of schools. Most kids will only be back at school, and for only a few days a week, by the end of October when the 70 per cent double-dose vaccinated target is achieved. This will be very disappointing to many parents and children. However, the reality is that Delta spreads among kids - more so than did pre-Delta variants.
In my view we need a bit more flesh on the bones of what the Premier hinted at: "We will monitor every hour, every day the number of people in hospital." This was couched in terms of being able to support the health system and staff.
But there is a bigger feedback loop than this. A feedback loop that alters our opening up as the actual data comes in. And there is a ceiling or envelope we need to work within. That is a maximum tolerable daily number of cases that in turn corresponds to a maximum hospital and ICU bed occupancy we can manage. Just because a road map says "do X at 80 per cent double vaccinated" does not mean we do X if it looks like we will crash through this envelope and stretch the health services so much that case fatality for people with COVID-19 goes up and quality of care for people with non-COVID-19 conditions deteriorates.
What is the limit our health services can cope with? There is no magic number. Let's assume - learning from NSW - that 2000 daily cases is a maximum current limit, and corresponds about 1:1 to the number of hospital beds occupied on a given day. And that our maximum tolerable limit might be 2500 people in bed at any one point (which is also the threshold used in the Burnet modelling underpinning the plan). As more people get vaccinated, 2500 people in a hospital bed on any given day will correspond to something like 3000 to 4000 daily notified cases a couple of weeks before - as proportionately more infections occur in the vaccinated with consequently less severe disease.
Then the trick, the agile, real-time, week-to-week task of rolling out this road map, is to keep within that envelope of about 3000 to 4000 daily cases by the end of year (I will assume 3000 minimum to be safe), keeping the number of people in hospital at any one point under a 2500 ceiling.
If we think about hypothetical epidemic curves (for real modelled ones, go to the Burnet modelling) for each of the different settings we move to the settings we plan to adopt when we hit 80 per cent single vaccinated, 70 per cent double vaccinated, and 80 per cent double vaccinated. It will look like a series of humps, each new hump going up again due to further loosening of public health and social measures before bending back down again as the increasing vaccine coverage catches up. Stringing it together, it will look like a rollercoaster ride until Christmas.
What we are aiming to do is "ride the rollercoaster" to Christmas, keeping daily cases beneath 3000 a day (hopefully much less). It is a rollercoaster because we jump from one epidemic curve to another, each one with a peak further into the future that is a balance between looser public health and social measure settings and vaccine coverage that is chasing down each next curve.
There are many assumptions in drawing these curves. Predicting the future is inherently uncertain.
So we need to be agile. If at any point between now and Christmas it looks like we are at risk of tracking above the rollercoaster line, and crashing through our ceiling of tolerable hospital bed occupancy, we will either need to delay the next release of measures - or even retreat a little with, say, sending kids back home for a week or two.
On the other hand, maybe we will track beneath the rollercoaster curve, and have the luxury of deciding between opening up faster or banking the lower case numbers to save up for an ever better Christmas with interstate and international travel. (Personally, I would take the latter - but we have a few months for this debate, if we track well.)
I am sure that the Premier, the Minister of Health and the Chief Health Officer all have the above in the back of their minds. My purpose here is to expound this need for agile tweaking of the plan, and to get you ready for a rollercoaster. Just like you, I hope that this rollercoaster ride will occur at lower case numbers than our upper limit. Fasten your seatbelts, and let's roll.

Full text: The modelling estimates that Victoria will be grappling with ­between 1400 and 2900 Covid cases a day between October 19 and ­October 31, despite plans to remain in lockdown until October 26, and daily case numbers that have remained between last Wednesday’s 423 and Monday’s 567 over the past seven days.
The institute also predicts that 2202 people will have died from Covid in Victoria between July 1 and December 31.
Accounting for 12 deaths that have already occurred during the current outbreak, there would need to be an average of more than 21 deaths every day between now and the end of the year for the prediction to be realised.
Asked whether the modelling was realistic, Mr Andrews said while the modellers had done “an enormous amount of work”, their estimates were “a projection” and “not a fact”.

“What I know for a fact is we can’t stay locked down forever ­because that comes at a cost all of its own.”
Victoria Premier Daniel Andrews has hit out at critics of the state's roadmap saying – "if you pretend you've got an alternative plan, please provide me with the modelling that backs that up".It comes as people within the state's business community have said it is a “roadmap to nowhere” as multiple owners are frustrated over the plan, particularly in the hospitality industry.Lord Mayor of Melbourne, Sally Capp, expressed her frustration over the roadmap as some industries have been left off – including those from the arts industry."Everyone's got different views and they are perfectly entitled to their different views," Mr Andrews said at a media conference on Monday."But if you pretend that you've got an alternative plan … please provide me with the detailed modelling that backs that up."I don't think that is an unreasonable thing for me to say – this is the plan, we have released the modelling."
The Premier’s road map has been attacked by a wide range of business groups, including the Victorian Chamber of Commerce and Industry.
The peak industry body described it as a “roadblock”, and Melbourne lord mayor Sally Capp, who asked the government to account for the fact that NSW traders are set to be granted “more generous freedoms” than their Victorian counterparts at the 70 and 80 per cent full vaccination stages.

Victoria’s 567 new locally ­acquired cases on Monday represented the highest daily caseload since the state’s second wave peaked at 687 cases (revised down from 725 due to duplications) on August 4, 2020.
From May 25, 2021: New daily cases in Victoria
The death of a woman in her 70s from Moreland in Melbourne’s north took the state’s death toll for the current outbreak to 12 – adding to 820 Covid-­related deaths in 2020.

Prepare for worse as we reopen: premiers

Full text: Gladys Berejiklian has warned “we will be seeing things unfold before our eyes that we have not seen before in Australia because of the pandemic’’ as she urged people to prepare for a sharp rise in case numbers, hospitalisations and deaths as Covid-19 restrictions eased.
The NSW Premier and Victorian Premier Daniel Andrews on Sunday both declared their communities must prepare for difficiult weeks ahead as their economies reopened when vaccinations rates reached 70 and 80 per cent.
Mr Andrews insisted the state’s health system would face intense pressure but the state would be able to pass through the reopening spike to a position where it could live with the virus.
Ms Berejiklian on Sunday cited the Doherty Institute modelling underpinning national cabinet’s plan for reopening in saying Australia needed to prepare to see high case numbers when NSW reopens after reaching 80 per cent.
“Numbers might be higher than we have ever seen. In fact, the Doherty report predicts that the case numbers that we will see are likely to be the highest cases we have seen in Australia.” Mr Andrews unveiled a road map by which Melburnians will be locked down for at least another five weeks until 70 per cent of those 16 and over are fully ­vaccinated.
The most substantive relaxations – including the reopening of indoor dining and non-essential retail – are not expected to occur until the 80 per cent target is reached on about November 5.
Mr Andrews framed his road map — based on modelling from the Burnet Institute — as balancing the need to ensure the health system was not overwhelmed with the imperative to reopen.
He said Victoria would closely watch the reopening in NSW, which was a couple of weeks ahead of it in vaccination rates because it had received greater supplies, to adjust its modelling based on real world experience.
“If … we open steadily, gradually, but open, as we get to 70 and 80 per cent double dose, then our nurses, doctors, our ambos, they’ll come under intense pressure … it will be incredibly difficult in our health system, but we will be able to pass through a gateway, an important gateway. We will be able to normalise this,” Mr Andrews said on Sunday.
“We cannot perennially or permanently suppress this virus. Lockdowns have been about buying time to get to 70 and 80 per cent vaccination. We are fast ­approaching those milestones.
“At that point we have got to open the place up, because remaining closed forever has its own cost in every sense of that word.” Mr Andrews acknowledged the easing of restrictions would likely see thousands hospitalised and hundreds die, with the Burnet model predicting 2202 Covid deaths in Victoria between July 1 and December 31 (there have so far been 11 Covid deaths in Victoria this year), and a peak in December of 3150 hospitalisations and 4543 daily cases.
As of Saturday, 82.23 per cent of those aged 16 and over in NSW had received a first dose of Covid vaccine, and 52.65 per cent had received a second.
This compares with 71.97 per cent first dose and 43.85 per cent second dose in Victoria, and a ­national average of 71.67 per cent first dose and 46.67 per cent for the second.
New Covid infections in NSW dropped to 1083 – the lowest number since August – but the state also recorded its deadliest day in the pandemic with 13 deaths.
NSW Health’s Jeremy Mc­Anulty said the figures were “very encouraging” but urged caution.
“We don’t want to jump the gun … we do like to see several days before we can call it a trend but certainly cases overall have stabilised and appear to be dropping in some areas … where we have had rapidly increasing vaccination uptake as well as good compliance,” Dr McAnulty said.
Under the Victorian road map, Melburnians get their first small reprieve when an 80 per cent first dose target is reached on September 26, with outdoor facilities opening for contactless recreation such as golf and tennis.
School reopens from October 6 for year 12 students, with preps to return three days a week from October 18, and grades 1 and 2 for two days a week. Bigger changes come at 70 per cent double dose on October 26, when the 9pm to 5am curfew and lockdown will be lifted, and the travel limit increased to 25km.
Students in grades 3-6 and 8-10 will return to the classroom for two days a week, and those in years 7 and 11 will be back full-time, while childcare will fully reopen for children of double-dosed parents.
Vaccination will ultimately be mandatory for authorised workers, teachers, childcare workers, parents of children in childcare, hospitality workers and hospitality patrons.
Hospitality venues will reopen for outdoor service for the fully vaccinated, subject to a one person per 4sq m density limit, when 70 per cent full vaccination is reached.Non-essential retail will not reopen until 80 per cent full vaccination is reached.
Visits to private homes will still be banned at 70 per cent, with up to five visitors permitted at 80 per cent, although Mr Andrews did say the government was aiming to allow 30 visitors to the home on Christmas Day.
Masks will continue to be mandatory outdoors until the 80 per cent full vaccination rate is reached, and will still be required indoors even after that point.
The slow pace of the reopening prompted Victoria’s peak industry body VECCI to dub it “a road map of roadblocks” and the Australian Hotels Association to deem it “unviable”.
Victoria’s 507 new cases and the death of a man in his 90s from Moreland in Melbourne’s north also represented a stabilisation of daily case numbers, following a peak of 525 on Saturday, 510 on Friday and 514 on Thursday.
Asked whether the Burnet modelling was too pessimistic in its prediction that case numbers would reach 1400-2900 cases between October 19 and 31, Mr Andrews said: “I absolutely hope so.” He said he would be open to a discussion with health bureaucrats about speeding up the reopening road map should the Burnet predictions not eventuate, but indicated the approach would remain cautious.
“Even if you were lower than Burnet’s, even their median, let alone their worst forecast, that won’t be an easy day on any ward in any hospital. That’ll be really, really tough,” he said.
Amid rising case numbers, the regional Victorian LGAs of Geelong, Surf Coast and the Mitchell Shire joined Melbourne and Ballarat in lockdown as of Sunday night for at least the next week.

Full text: Gladys Berejiklian has warned “we will be seeing things unfold before our eyes that we have not seen before in Australia because of the pandemic’’ as she urged people to prepare for a sharp rise in case numbers, hospitalisations and deaths as Covid-19 restrictions eased.
The NSW Premier and Victorian leader Daniel Andrews on Sunday declared their communities must prepare for difficult weeks ahead as their economies reopened when vaccination rates reached 70 and 80 per cent.
Mr Andrews insisted the state’s health system would face intense pressure but the state would be able to pass through the reopening spike to a position where it could live with the virus.
Ms Berejiklian on Sunday cited the Doherty Institute modelling underpinning national cabinet’s plan for reopening, saying Australia needed to prepare to see higher case numbers when NSW reopened after reaching 80 per cent full vaccinations.
“Numbers might be higher than we have ever seen. In fact, the Doherty report predicts that the case numbers that we will see are likely to be the highest cases we have seen in Australia.” Mr Andrews unveiled a road map by which Melburnians will be locked down for at least another five weeks until 70 per cent of those 16 and over are fully ­vaccinated.
The most substantive relaxations – including the reopening of indoor dining and non-essential retail – are not expected to occur until the 80 per cent target is reached on about November 5.
Mr Andrews framed his road map — based on modelling from the Burnet Institute — as balancing the need to ensure the health system was not overwhelmed with the imperative to reopen.
He said Victoria would closely watch the reopening in NSW, which was a couple of weeks ahead of it in vaccination rates because it had received greater supplies, to adjust its modelling based on real world experience.
“If … we open steadily, gradually, but open, as we get to 70 and 80 per cent double dose, then our nurses, doctors, our ambos, they’ll come under intense pressure … it will be incredibly difficult in our health system, but we will be able to pass through a gateway, an important gateway. We will be able to normalise this,” Mr Andrews said on Sunday.
“We cannot perennially or permanently suppress this virus. Lockdowns have been about buying time to get to 70 and 80 per cent vaccination. We are fast ­approaching those milestones.
“At that point we have got to open the place up, because remaining closed forever has its own cost in every sense of that word.” Mr Andrews acknowledged the easing of restrictions would likely see thousands hospitalised and hundreds die, with the Burnet model predicting 2202 Covid deaths in Victoria between July 1 and December 31 (there have so far been 11 Covid deaths in Victoria this year), and a peak in December of 3150 hospitalisations and 4543 daily cases.
As of Saturday, 82.23 per cent of those aged 16 and over in NSW had received a first dose of Covid vaccine, and 52.65 per cent had received a second.
This compares with 71.97 per cent first dose and 43.85 per cent second dose in Victoria, and a ­national average of 71.67 per cent first dose and 46.67 per cent for the second.
New Covid infections in NSW dropped to 1083 – the lowest number since August – but the state also recorded its deadliest day in the pandemic with 13 deaths.
NSW Health’s Jeremy Mc­Anulty said the figures were “very encouraging” but urged caution.
“We don’t want to jump the gun … we do like to see several days before we can call it a trend but certainly cases overall have stabilised and appear to be dropping in some areas … where we have had rapidly increasing vaccination uptake as well as good compliance,” Dr McAnulty said.
Under the Victorian road map, Melburnians get their first small reprieve when an 80 per cent first dose target is reached on September 26, with outdoor facilities opening for contactless recreation such as golf and tennis.
School reopens from October 6 for year 12 students, with preps to return three days a week from October 18, and grades 1 and 2 for two days a week. Bigger changes come at 70 per cent double dose on October 26, when the 9pm to 5am curfew and lockdown will be lifted, and the travel limit increased to 25km.
Students in grades 3-6 and 8-10 will return to the classroom for two days a week, and those in years 7 and 11 will be back full-time, while childcare will fully reopen for children of double-dosed parents.
Vaccination will ultimately be mandatory for authorised workers, teachers, childcare workers, parents of children in childcare, hospitality workers and hospitality patrons.
Hospitality venues will reopen for outdoor service for the fully vaccinated, subject to a one person per 4sq m density limit, when 70 per cent full vaccination is reached. Non-essential retail will not reopen until 80 per cent full vaccination is reached.
Visits to private homes will still be banned at 70 per cent, with up to five visitors permitted at 80 per cent, although Mr Andrews did say the government was aiming to allow 30 visitors to the home on Christmas Day.
Masks will continue to be mandatory outdoors until the 80 per cent full vaccination rate is reached, and will still be required indoors even after that point.
The slow pace of the reopening prompted Victoria’s peak industry body VECCI to dub it “a road map of roadblocks” and the Australian Hotels Association to deem it “unviable”.
Victoria’s 507 new cases and the death of a man in his 90s from Moreland in Melbourne’s north also represented a stabilisation of daily case numbers, following a peak of 525 on Saturday, 510 on Friday and 514 on Thursday.

Full text: There is good reason to think COVID-19 cases will soon peak in NSW, if they haven't already.
Deputy chief health officer Jeremy McNulty said on Tuesday that it was "still a little bit early to know" if the transmission rate of the virus had fallen below one, which would signal a contraction of case numbers.
NSW recorded 1127 cases in the 24 hours to 8pm on Monday, a third drop since Friday's record tally of 1599.
Monday case counts, which are reported on Tuesdays, have been lower than on other days of the week during the latest outbreak.
Dr McNulty noted that case numbers could bounce around and he would "like to see a few more days" before declaring a peak.
In the news
Hunter vax rates up to 15% behind state Hunter adds 14 cases, NSW adds 1127 and two deaths
COVID exposure sites in Newcastle and the Hunter Valley today Newcastle's Oasis Village Kebab Shop and Toronto, Glendale and Salamander Bay supermarkets flagged as exposure sites Hunter-based GPs and pharmacies to receive more Moderna and Pfizer But modelling suggests the numbers, at least on a statewide level, probably peaked in the middle of last week.
Former World Health Organisation epidemiologist Adrian Esterman said on Tuesday that the transmission rate had fallen to 0.95.
"Gladys' light at the end of the tunnel is in sight," he wrote on Twitter.
Chris Billington, a post-doctoral research fellow in physics at the University of Melbourne, has calculated the transmission rate began falling in mid-August, when all of regional NSW joined Sydney in lockdown and the government introduced a night-time curfew in 12 areas of concern.
His calculations show the rate dropped below one some time before last weekend.
Newcastle Herald contributor Bradley Perrett, a former economics journalist, used a method the Australian Bureau of Statistics applies to economics data to calculate that cases peaked around September 7.
His trend analysis shows cases grew at about 5 per cent a day for most of August before an acceleration to 9 per cent a day in the middle of that month.
The average rate of increase began falling quickly at the end of August.
Mr Perrett said his method, known as a Henderson moving average, was similar to, but more accurate than, the simple averages sometimes used in "trying to discern what's going on behind bumpy statistics".
He said the most recent estimates of the trend were preliminary and could change as more raw numbers came in.
The Burnet Institute's Allan Saul, Brendan Crabb and Mark Stoove, writing in The Conversation on Tuesday, identified the curfew and closing more retail stores in Sydney's 12 LGAs of concern as the turning point in stopping the virus.
They warned that the virus' spread was growing outside the 12 LGAs and tighter restrictions might be required to control it.
"Other LGAs with rising case numbers should not rely solely on vaccination to cut case numbers in the short to medium term," they wrote.

Rule-breach school hit by COVID outbreak

Full text: A Fitzroy North primary school whose principal has repeatedly flouted public health orders and invited families to send in their children during lockdowns has been hit by a significant coronavirus outbreak.
Premier Daniel Andrews warned yesterday that reopening Melbourne's classrooms would cause COVID-19 cases to spread quickly through schools, forcing many to close again almost immediately.
With the state recording 392 new coronavirus infections yesterday, the state's Deputy Chief Health Officer, Dan O'Brien, said 30 students and staff had tested positive at the Fitzroy Community School in Brunswick Street, Fitzroy North.
"It looks like the case numbers are at least 30 but it's growing from there," he said.
Emails obtained by The Age reveal the principal, Timothy Berryman, invited parents to send in their children repeatedly while Melbourne has been in lockdown, arguing that the damage to their mental health from extended periods of remote learning was potentially severe, while the health risks to children from catching coronavirus were negligible.
News of the school outbreak came as Prime Minister Scott Morrison announced Victoria would get more than 400,000 extra Pfizer and Moderna vaccine shots. It followed Mr Andrews' claim last week that Victoria was being short-changed by about 340,000 doses of Pfizer vaccines, in preference for Sydney.
Health Minister Greg Hunt said yesterday the additional 417,000 vaccine doses showed the Morrison government had "responded to and exceeded the Victorian government's request".
Mr Berryman, whose "alternative independent school" is now a tier 1 exposure site, told families on September 9 he believed it was "only a matter of time" before there was a positive case at the school, and expressed hope that schools would be permitted to remain open with positive cases in future.
"I can sincerely say that it has been a much longer run than I had hoped for or expected," he wrote.
A June 3 email from Mr Berryman to parents states: "I cannot in good conscience continue to request that you continue to keep your children at home. Please feel free to send your child to school if you feel that this is best for them or best for your family balance. I do not write this lightly, as this does breach government imposed directives."
Three days later, he wrote that the Department of Health had contacted the school and warned him to comply. By late July, Mr Berryman was again inviting parents to breach the rules. "I am again offering you all the option of sending your children to school," he wrote on July 20.
The Age attempted to contact Mr Berryman but could not reach him.
Mr Andrews declined to answer when asked yesterday whether it should be mandatory for teachers to be vaccinated, but flagged the government was considering compelling some people to get immunised.
"Making it mandatory in a number of areas is very important. It won't just be schools, it won't just be teachers, it won't just be nurses - it will be a whole range of different people ... I will make those announcements when I'm ready."
Victoria yesterday launched a "pop-up" vaccination program targeting the north and west of Melbourne. Sixty-five per cent of new cases detailed yesterday were in Melbourne's north, particularly the council area of Hume, where 147 new cases were recorded. Just 107 were from known outbreaks.
Eight of the pop-up vaccination centres will be in secondary colleges in a bid to get more students immunised. These high schools are in Dandenong, Point Cook, Gladstone Park, Roxburgh, Brunswick, Tarneit, Werribee and Lakeview Senior College in Caroline Springs.
Lakeview Senior College principal Shayne Rule said more than 110 students and staff had booked in for a jab on campus this Thursday, but more had already had their first shot or made an appointment elsewhere.
Mr Rule said his senior students' desire to be vaccinated as soon as possible was overwhelming, although a small number of parents had shown hesitancy or opposition.
"I know of a number of kids who come from anti-vaccine families and the kids have hopped on buses, made their own appointments and gone and got shots without the support of their parents," he said.
"I really admire their courage and commitment."
Year 7 student Lucy Kerr, 13, who attends Our Lady of Mercy College in Heidelberg, will become eligible for the COVID-19 vaccine from today and said she was eager to book in for the jab "as soon as possible".
"I'm just excited for when there are enough people vaccinated that we can end lockdowns," she said.
Yesterday, Mr Andrews declined to nominate a date for a return to face-to-face learning, saying modelling being done by the Burnet Institute held the key to reopening.
He said he wanted schools back this year but a plan for the rest of the school year would be made public in about a week.
Despite hundreds of daily infections, Victoria's contact-tracing team was reaching almost 100 per cent of COVID-19 cases within 24 hours and primary close contacts within 48 hours, Deputy Chief Health Officer Dan O'Brien said.
When the Premier was told yesterday of the extra vaccine doses being sent to Victoria, he told reporters it was the first he had heard of the matter.
Federal government sources, who asked not to be named so they could describe discussions between the state and federal governments, said the Commonwealth had discussions with the Victorian government on Friday and Saturday to let them know of the extra doses.

Covid histrionics gone to the dogs

Full text: “Why are they on this mission to bring Covid into Western Australia, to infect our public,” he asked last week. “To ensure we shut down parts of the economy? That we lose jobs? That people get sick and some people die?”
What prompted his measured speculation was federal Attorney-General Michaelia Cash’s declaration that the increasing vaccination rates bring into question the constitutional legitimacy of state border closures. According to McGowan, this statement “obviously would encourage someone like Clive Palmer or someone else with his attitudes to bring on another High Court challenge”.
All reasonable people would surely agree it is a terrible thing that litigants can force governments to account for the lawfulness of such legislation. It is not the first time the Premier has been subjected to this indignity. Last year he described Palmer as “an enemy of our state” who was “committed to breaking down WA’s door”. As he said then: “strong border controls have been our best weapon in this fight”. Talking about defending WA certainly brings out the warrior in McGowan, attributable perhaps to his days in the navy, where he served as a lawyer.
Why the Morrison government is so insistent on provoking the great man is beyond comprehension. McGowan is a man of his word, which is why we should believe him when he stated this week he will consider reopening the state when vaccination rates reach 90 per cent. Or rather, he will consider opening the state two months from that point. Just like on August 6 when he agreed to the national cabinet’s plan to exempt vaccinated residents from all domestic restrictions once 80 per cent of the population was fully vaccinated.
Magnaminous McGowan
Nonetheless he has said he will permit entry into his state sometime next year.
This should not be seen as a grudging concession to constitutional realities but instead as evidence of McGowan’s magnanimity. And it would be churlish of us to complain should he yet again renege on that promise. After all, the man is dealing with systemic failings in his public hospital system. If only he had, say, a $5bn surplus to address this.
Kudos as well for WA Labor, which last week decided to honour its favourite son in typical low-key but tasteful fashion. “Happy Father’s Day to our State Dad, Mark McGowan,” its website proclaimed, inviting West Australians to sign an e-card to that effect, as well as encouraging them to add a “message to Mark”. Last time we witnessed something this cringeworthy was in 2013 when over 100 ambassadors and high commissioners were ‘invited’ to line up at The Lodge to congratulate Kevin Rudd on having regained the prime ministership.
But if a card is to be signed, then allow me to add my words. Greetings to his esteemed magnificence, great extractor of iron ore, saviour of the national economy, guardian of the western province, nemesis of east coast freeloaders, he-who-ensures-prosperity-and-harmony, repository of divine wind, grand poohbah of gratuitous postulating, and provincial buffoon extraordinaire. Never let it be said that the Premier fosters the cult of the leader. After all, one cannot establish a personality cult if the individual concerned is devoid of a personality.
Meanwhile, in Queensland .....
Having delayed by several months getting vaccinated and being given Pfizer instead of AstraZeneca, Queensland Premier Annastacia Palaszczuk claimed in June that one Winton – her dog – was to blame. He had supposedly bitten her, which required a tetanus booster. I was one of many who derided her for what seemed a convenient excuse, but it now appears she was telling the truth. Symptoms of those infected by the bite of a rabid dog include anxiety, hallucinations, confusion, and agitation.
How else would you explain, for example, Palaszczuk’s disingenuous extrapolation of Doherty Institute modelling last week to claim that opening the borders once a 70 per cent vaccination had been achieved would result in the deaths of 80 people each day and 2240 per month? Or her insistence that border closures would remain until every child under 12 had been vaccinated, despite there being no vaccine for them and the Delta variant being a low risk to that demographic?
Someone think of the children
“You open this state and you let the virus in here and every child under 12 is vulnerable,” the Premier told Parliament last week. This is alarmist nonsense. As an analysis by the National Centre for Immunisation Research and Surveillance has found, 98 per cent of 2864 children and teenagers who tested positive between mid-June and July 31 were asymptomatic or reported only mild symptoms. Of the two per cent hospitalised, very few required intensive care.
Palaszczuk’s concern for children is such she gives preference not to Queenslanders stranded outside the border, but to the wives and girlfriends of NRL players. Last week it was revealed a three-year-old boy had been waiting in NSW since July for permission to re-join his frantic mother in Queensland. Barring him from entry while allowing a junket flight during a travel ban must be yet another example of keeping Queenslanders safe, as Palaszczuk is fond of saying.
The sight of separated family members tearfully embracing over border barricades at Coolangatta on Father’s Day was one that was hard to watch. As sad as it is, however, the agony of their estrangement is nothing compared to the suffering of Queensland chief health officer Dr Jeannette Young, who this week defended Palaszczuk’s risible take on the Doherty Institute’s forecast.
“You’ve got me quite upset now,” said the outraged medico in response to a journalist’s suggestion she was “making political decisions”. I remember reading in 2018 that Young’ salary was $622,000, and we can only hope this paltry amount has since been increased significantly to compensate for her distress and the impertinence of the media. “Thank goodness I work with a Premier that we have here and the Cabinet to stop the virus coming into Queensland,” she said.
That a statutory appointee would effusively endorse the Premier and her Cabinet reminded me of a former high-ranking Queensland official and his ill-advised remarks.
“The people of Queensland and the police force owe the Premier a very deep gratitude,” said then Queensland Police commissioner Terry Lewis during a graduation ceremony in 1983. “The free enterprise policy of the Bjelke-Petersen government has been responsible for Queensland’s tremendous growth. Irrespective of whether some people agree with the politics, statements, or stands, there is a universal respect, even admiration, for the total loyalty he and his colleagues show for what they believe is in the best interests of Queensland.”
That same year, Premier Joh Bjelke-Petersen nominated Lewis for a knighthood. Palaszczuk nominated Young to be the next Queensland Governor, a role she will assume in November.
I do not suggest for a moment equivalence between Young and Lewis, a man who was imprisoned for multiple counts of corruption. Young has a longstanding and honourable record in public health administration. But that does not remove the need for her to account for her advice to the government during the pandemic, especially given she has frequently defended Palaszczuk’s capricious and electorally advantageous approach to border closures. Preserving her independence and acting apolitically are essential in her determinations. Being Palaszczuk’s bestie and acting outside her remit can only damage Young’s reputation and compromise the office she holds.
That Young so angrily insisted last week she did not make political decisions is telling. After all, this was the same person who audaciously said last year regarding entry permits for celebrities: “I have given exemptions for people in entertainment and film because that is bringing a lot of money into this state and, can I say, we need every single dollar in our state”.
Between Young deciding what is good for Queensland economically and Palaszczuk telling people “I don’t make the decisions,” one has trouble distinguishing the political leader and the statutory office holder. But that might just be me reading too much into this. As Bjelke-Petersen used to say: “Don’t you worry about that”.

Full text: The effectiveness of the now-cancelled masks and social distancing is called into question, as are the inaccurate modelling predictions of doom. This Delta variant is more infectious but less deadly and we can safely open up as vaccination rates rise.
Dr Graham Pinn, Maroochydore, Qld
The management of the pandemic in Australia can only be described as dysfunctional and chaotic. We have some premiers still clinging to the delusional aspiration of the elimination of the virus. We have others hiding behind “the best medical advice” to justify lockdowns and draconian restrictions on freedom when between the states and territories the “best” advice is inconsistent if not contradictory.
We don’t know if the magical vaccination threshold is 70, 80, 90 or 100 per cent. We don’t know what vaccines are said to be safe at what age. We don’t know how long the vaccines remain effective.
No one dares to question the epidemiological credentials of the so-called “experts”. In South Australia our “expert” has a background as a paediatrician. There is simply no consensus as to the way out of the pandemic.
All of this with a national population that is less than that of many cities around the world.
It all goes to show how divided and over-governed we are. Any remaining suggestion that “we are all in this together” is nonsense. We are the laughing stock of the rest of the world.
Geoff Forbes, Kensington Gardens, SA
I am one Aussie with grateful thanks for a PM who works day and night in torrid circumstances. He must endure the petty slings and arrows of those on the left, those who don’t like to be personally inconvenienced and the plain stupid. After all that he does internationally, strategically, locally, under constant fire with the demands of leadership, surely he is entitled to include a visit to his distant children and aged parents with two necessary work appearances in NSW on Fathers Day.
If we keep up this juvenile narcissism toward our leaders, we will never get a normal decent family man to enter politics.
Judy Crooke, Claremont, WA
The recent hysterical outbursts from certain premiers over vaccine allocation must surely rank as one of the uglier and more unedifying examples of populist base politics witnessed in recent times, and that’s saying something. People in western and southwestern Sydney are dying. Outside the southeast corner of NSW, Victoria and the ACT, the country is virtually Covid free and nobody is dying. To vaccinate people in Rockhampton or Albany at the expense of vaccines reaching those in Campsie and Yagoona is nothing short of criminal.
Shayne Thompson, Queens Park, NSW
As Janet Albrechtsen says, serious mental health tragedies are unfolding due to Covid restrictions (“Come to the party, Santa Claus, and reopen the border”, 8/9). Spare a thought for women who have just had their first baby (particularly in Victoria) and are sent home from hospital after only a few hours to a partner with no experience with a newborn, and no relative permitted to cross borders or other visitors allowed. No one to share the joy or to help. Should we be surprised at the increase in postnatal depression that will surely ensue?
Roseanne Schneider, Toowoomba, Qld
Never in living memory have we been such a divided country. The only time we become parochial about our states is when there are football grand finals or state of origin matches. Any other time when there has been natural disasters such as bushfires, floods or cyclones we rally to support each other and that is the thing I love about Australia.
It is unbelievable that during the worst global pandemic the world has experienced in 100 years, we are now the most divided country in the world.

Full text: Covid-19 commissioner Jane Halton has called for an end to politicking and bickering by leaders, saying all states would receive “equitable amounts” of the Covid-19 vaccine.
It comes off the back of revelations NSW had received a greater share of Pfizer vaccines allocated to GPs last month.
On Monday, Victorian Premier Daniel Andrews said his state was being left behind in accessing vaccinations in favour of NSW.
“ … What I didn’t know is Premier (Gladys) Berejiklian is in a sprint, while the rest of us do some egg and spoon race,” Mr Andrews said.
Meanwhile, Queensland Premier Annastacia Palaszczuk and WA Premier Mark McGowan have both called for a greater allocation of vaccines to boost their states’ lagging rates.
Ms Halton said she could “understand the frustration” coming from Mr Andrews, Mr McGowan and Ms Palaszczuk, but that NSW had a greater need.
“The international advice is that when there is a (Covid-19) crisis, we should be using vaccines to bring the crisis to an end,” she told Sunrise.
“What we have seen here is a short-term additional allocation of vaccine into NSW, but particularly into Sydney, to help bring the crisis to an end.
“It’s a bit like saying ‘I’m going to send the fire truck to where the fire is in the short term’, that is what is happening here. But, there is a commitment to ensure everyone gets equitable allocations.”
Ms Halton shut down allegations the additional doses had been routed to Sydney “in secret”.
“When there is a crisis, we have to use our resources. Let’s remember, Victoria got extra vaccines when there was that outbreak early on, so no, there is nothing secret here,” she said.
It comes as new modelling was released by the Burnet Institute, suggesting that if NSW hadn’t enforced strict restrictions and did not have high vaccination rates, more than 5000 people in the 12 local government areas of concern could have died during the Delta outbreak.
Brendan Crabb, the director of the institute, told Sunrise the “extraordinary” vaccine rollout had saved “lots of lives”.
“It has made a massive difference to have lockdowns and restrictions and the extraordinary vaccination rollouts,” he said.
“We’ve got some work to do and some hard yards ahead, but there is a good end in sight and people should be proud of the job they have done.”
As of Wednesday morning, 63 per cent of Australians had received their first dose:

- NSW: 74.8 per cent first dose
- ACT: 70.1 per cent first doe
- Tasmania: 63.2 per cent first dose
- Victoria: 61.6 per cent first dose
- Northern Territory: 57.8 per cent first dose
- South Australia: 56.1 per cent first dose
- Western Australia: 54.3 per cent first dose
- Queensland: 53.8 per cent first dose

Covid-19: Scott Morrison mission to accelerate freedom plans for vaccinated

Full text: The Prime Minister on Tuesday told national cabinet to get on with jabbing Australians after rejecting criticism from Premier Daniel Andrews that Victorians had been short-changed on ­vaccines.
Mr Morrison said he had stopped a push to take vaccines from other states and give them to NSW and praised Tasmania, South Australia, the ACT and Northern Territory for leading vaccine efforts despite not receiving brought-forward jabs.
“Victoria had doses brought forward in their case as well on two occasions. In their first crisis they had and which they were able to come out of. And when they were hit again, we brought forward doses to Victoria,” Mr Morrison told Sky News.
“We’ve just gone from 4.5 million mRNA Pfizer doses to nine million in one month. That’s all being delivered, not by state governments, by the federal government. And we’re getting it out to all of them, and we look forward to them getting them into arms.”
Mr Andrews said if Victoria had received its share of doses, the state would be closer to reaching 70 and 80 per cent vaccine targets.
“I don’t begrudge any other state getting their fair share but that’s predicated on us getting our fair share. The national plan is predicated on us all moving together. Some don’t like to see this as a race but a race it surely is,” he said.
“What I didn’t know was that Premier (Gladys) Berejiklian’s in a sprint while the rest of us are supposed to do some sort of egg and spoon thing. We want our fair share. These allocations which are totally unfair and were under the table need to stop and we need to get a make-good. We need to get those doses that we didn’t get fast-tracked to us.”
Prime Minister Scott Morrison says he does not believe any premiers think the easing of restrictions will mean “willy-nilly movement” of those who are not vaccinated against COVID-19. “A lot is being said right now, but let’s be clear about what the plan says, when you get to 80 per cent, what it says is domestic restrictions on vaccinated persons should be lifted,” he told Sky News Australia. “We’re not talking about willy-nilly movement of people who are unvaccinated around the country; we’re not talking about planeloads of COVID going from one state to the next.” Mr Morrison said under the plan, the easing of COVID-19 restrictions will look different as states have different levels of the virus, and less affected states will need less in place. “What the Doherty modelling shows is that for those states, the restrictions are needed once you go into the 70 and 80 per cent are much less than what needs to be in place in New South Wales and Victoria,” he said. “In those two states, in New South Wales and Victoria, when you go into 70 and 80 per cent, they won’t have the same level of eased restrictions that you’d see in Western Australia or Queensland.”
Queensland Premier Annastacia Palaszczuk said the Morrison government shouldn’t pick fights “when another state is getting more vaccines”.
“Don’t blame Queensland and Western Australia for getting out the vaccine that we have available,” she said.
Ahead of Friday’s national cabinet meeting, Mr Morrison said he was writing to state and territory leaders to get timetables on introducing home quarantine and integrating check-in technologies. “For international travel to work – we need home quarantine done,” he said. “Home quarantine is where we go next and the length of that quarantine also is what we’re looking at.”
He said access to ­venues and planes for vaccinated Australians would be facilitated by QR code readers that check-in people and record vaccination status, enabling “fully vaccinated theatres, fully vaccinated events, a Bluesfest which is fully vaccinated”.
“So (at) these events people can get back on stage, restaurants can get back and open their doors to their patrons and be able to operate under much less restrictions.”
Mr Morrison said pubs, cafes, sporting venues, restaurants and shops had the right to refuse entry to unvaccinated people and vaccine certificates would be needed for international travel.
He said while NSW and Victoria would have slower returns to freedom, at 80 per cent vaccine coverage “domestic restrictions on vaccinated persons should be lifted”. “We’re not talking about willy-nilly movement of people who are unvaccinated around the country … That’s a nonsense. That’s not what is under contemplation and I don’t think any premier thinks that’s the case.”

What Dan Andrews needs to reopen Victorian schools

Full text: Parents anxious about whether classroom learning will return at the start of term four in October will be forced to wait longer for details of the government’s plan.
Mr Andrews last week raised hopes that a road map for school reopenings would be announced this week.
However, he said that he was still waiting on modelling from the Burnet Institute before a decision would be made.
Mr Andrews said on Tuesday that school reopenings would be based on case numbers at the time and the amount of hospital beds occupied with Covid-19 patients.
“There’s been an enormous amount of work being done … the Burnet are doing some modelling for us,” he said.
“There will be two lines on the graph, essentially, there’ll be the number of cases and how they’re going to grow.
“And then there’s the amount of hospital capacity that we have and how it flexes up.”
Victoria recorded 246 cases on Tuesday, with that number likely to increase in coming weeks now the state has abandoned its Covid zero policy.
He said there were “parts of the hospital system you can turn off” such as elective surgery, but that came at a cost.
And he was unable to clarify whether an entire school would be closed if it recorded a case, or just the classroom or year level would be sent home, when schools reopened.
“We’ve been very clear that term three will not be returned to face-to-face learning
term four will have a detailed plan,” he said.
“But again, that’s got to be based on evidence, it’s got to be based on how many cases are in the community.
“If we have many, many cases in the community, much more than we have now … then that’s going to limit our options around school.”
He said he didn’t want to open schools and then have to close them because of cases.
NSW announced last month that schools would start to return on October 25, despite cases soaring above 1000 a day there.
Kindergarten, year 1 and year 12 students would be first back, followed by the rest of the school community in November.

Or the sight of the Premier of Victoria, solemnly warning about the dangers of watching sunsets on the beach?
Maybe it was his decision that only one parent may supervise children at a playground and must check in using a QR code.
Or his Western Australian counterpart’s accusation that others were on a “mission” to bring coronavirus to his state.
Perhaps it was ATAGI’s decision to base its risk assessment on the use of the only vaccine of which we have an unlimited supply on the danger it posed in a community without any Covid rather than the situation in which we find ourselves today.
Or the ban – introduced without any announcement – that non-resident citizens required the permission of the federal government to return.
Maybe what has shocked you, even more than the absurdities to which we have been subjected, has been the incredible passivity with which they have been accepted by a resigned population.
Australia’s winter of discontent may have technically come to an end but there is no sign that spring is here.
The Doherty Institute’s modelling on the vaccination rates required for us to rejoin the world was meant to give us hope – something that has been in short supply this winter.
But the speed at which WA and QLD have crab-walked away from it makes you fear our new public health overlords are not going to let go of us easily.
No doubt the Doherty refuseniks in Queensland and Western Australia have research which backs up their position.
In Mark McGowan’s case the best sort of research there is – a thumping great victory at a general election.
But if we have learned anything throughout this adventure it’s that political fortunes can change very quickly.
When the virus gets into QLD and WA as it eventually will now that elimination has been abandoned by NSW and Victoria, the conversation among the publics there will quickly change from ‘how good are we!’ to ‘what the hell have you been doing for the past 18 months to prepare our hospital system for this crisis?’
Perhaps McGowan and Palaszczuk’s recalcitrance over the Doherty is a backhanded acknowledgment that their hospital systems haven’t been prepared as well as they should have been.
You can accuse Daniel Andrews of many things but being slow on the uptake isn’t one of them.
So when last week the lockdown king himself dumped his treasured zero cases target and started making noises about how he would soon be setting Victorians free, you can be sure it wasn’t done on a whim.
Andrews has grasped that it isn’t just the delta variant that has changed the equation of managing the pandemic.
Victorians have run out of patience with restrictions.
Most of them aren’t going to protests, but after two-hundred-and-whatever days in a hard lockdown people everywhere have started quietly ignoring them.
Andrews has grasped this which is why he has been backing-in Morrison in the national cabinet.
He’s also grasped that he has to find a way to make sure that when he faces the electorate next year the lockdowns are a distant and unpleasant memory.
NED-1859 State of our borders
Even so it might not be enough. It made sense during this crisis that voters would stick with incumbents.
But the longer this goes I suspect incumbency is going to become less and less of an asset on election day.
That applies whether or not the crisis is over.
If it is still rolling on voters might start expressing that frustration by taking it out on the politicians who have been in their faces throughout.
But even if the crisis is over and things have returned to normal or something that looks like normal, there is a danger to incumbents that voters will turn on them because they remind of a time we will all want to forget.
In other words elections going forward will not be about how well anyone has done up until now but who is best able to give people hope that things are going to be better in the future.
The good news for Scott Morrison if this is true is that the slow vaccine rollout is unlikely to be held against him.
Not just because politically it is turning out to be a bit like child care: it matters a lot to those who need it right now but it isn’t really a vote shifter for those who don’t need it anymore.
But also because people won’t be voting on his record but on what he plans to do next.
And those plans need to include a promise to make sure we never again will desperate Australians be forced to camp along state borders.

Full text: There's more pain in store before life gets back on track, write Deborah Snow and Lucy Carroll.
A new word, "confronting", has crept into Gladys Berejiklian's lexicon as she tries to massage public expectations around the worsening Delta outbreak.
This week she asked the state's citizens to "get very real" about accepting that living with COVID-19 will mean some people would continue to die, citing the fact that the (less lethal) flu already takes hundreds of lives every year. "I know it's a very difficult conversation to have ... nobody likes to talk about this because it's confronting ... but this is what will get us through," the Premier said, in her most determinedly matter-of-fact tone.
She was also able to brandish some good news: 70 per cent of NSW residents are now vaccinated with at least one dose. That's led to the promise of rewards for the fully jabbed: events and meals out when 70 per cent double doses are reached (expected by mid-October); reunions from overseas at Christmas when that figure hits 80 per cent.
Yet there's a perilous gulf to be crossed between now and then, and success hangs on how big the surge of critically ill will get as the virus infiltrates the ranks of the unvaccinated. Friday brought the chilling announcement of 12 more deaths, against a new daily case record of 1431.
"There is trepidation," one Liberal MP admitted this week. "The risk of relaxing too early is an overwhelmed hospital system. The impact, if it happens, of ambulances queued up, people being turned away, some of the things we have seen overseas, would be huge psychologically, because the one thing we regard as a certainty in our lives is that our health system can cope with most things that are thrown at it. At the other end there's the political risk of losing support because of lockdowns. Striking the middle course will require great political skill."
In reality Berejiklian has little choice but to keep running forward over a burning bridge.
"The Premier has chopped and changed her messages enough," a former coalition minister told the Herald.
"If she backs down now on the freedom one, I think she is in for terrible grief. I don't think it's an option for her."
Piling on the pressure, this week 80 of the country's largest businesses placed full page ads in the nation's press pleading with leaders to "stay the course" and open up between 70 and 80 per cent double vaccinated, as foreshadowed in the national plan based on the Doherty Institute modelling.
Berejiklian has warned repeatedly that October will be "the worst month for our hospital system". Just how much worse remains unclear.
She's promised to give a better idea of that next week, along with unveiling plans by NSW Health for increasing intensive care unit capacity - including plans to "reconfigure some of our hospitals [and] hospital wards". She's also insistent that no matter how "high or scary" the numbers get, the system will cope.
Prime Minister Scott Morrison was also grilled yesterday about how bad case and hospitalisation numbers might get in NSW, but said he won't "go out and talk about numbers which are not yet finalised and are changing on an almost daily basis".
Health Minister Brad Hazzard offers assurances that the state's heath system is "world class" and interconnected enough to spread the strains evident in western Sydney hospitals across the network.
But there is a dissonance between those assurances, and dispatches from the coal face. In raw numbers, hospitalisations in NSW have quadrupled in the last month, from 232 in early August to nearly 1000 yesterday. There were 160 COVID-19 patients in ICU, taking up almost 20 per cent of the state's current total of 846 intensive care beds across public and private systems, though Berejiklian indicated to 2GB yesterday this could surge to 1500.
Rising vaccination rates have kept the brake on deaths, which are much lower than during Victoria's winter outbreak last year when carnage was unleashed on the elderly. The state insists it's able to expand capacity to about 2000 ventilators. But as many insiders point out, finding enough specialist staff is the key challenge, not just the hardware.
On Thursday the numbers of healthcare workers in isolation, or "furloughed" because of being COVID-19 "close contacts", reached more than 1400, exacerbating the pressure on the workforce.
Morrison was in urgent talks with Berejiklian and Victorian Premier Dan Andrews during the week on how to bolster their already under-pressure hospital systems. Commonwealth chief medical officer Paul Kelly has been given the task of assessing public health capacity across the country, and told reporters yesterday "the numbers are one thing, but it's the preparation of the health system and how we can cope with numbers as projected as the important component".
In NSW, COVID-positive patients are spread across at least 35 hospitals with another 2200 people receiving hospital-led care in the home, and a further 690 positive cases being cared for in the state's medi-hotels. Deputy chief health officer Dr Marianne Gale has cited "close to 11,000 people with COVID-19" being cared for. People infected with Delta are twice as likely to go to hospital compared with earlier strains, according to a recent study in the Lancet.
Westmead Hospital, at the epicentre of the outbreak, was forced on August 25 to establish an Emergency Operations Centre, redirecting ambulances and transferring patients elsewhere, with the intensive care unit only treating people infected with the virus while "green" non-COVID-19 patients were moved into a makeshift ICU.
Nurses in Sydney's hotspots, who have spoken to the Herald on the condition of anonymity, report exhaustion and burnout managing what one calls "floods of patients coming and no end in sight".
"Every shift we are short, asking for overtime. This means more patients are being cared for as a 1:2 ratio rather than 1:1 simply because there aren't enough staff," a Westmead ICU nurse reported. "As nurses we are left feeling like we're not providing quality care and that is mentally draining and debilitating."
Another reported that about 30 per cent of the ICU staff [at her hospital] had been pulled in from private hospitals, paediatric intensive care and operating theatres over the past week.
"All of us have facial pressure injuries from wearing N95 masks for 12-hour shifts. We are all extremely burnt out. And we're scared of catching COVID at work and taking it home to our families. People with children are scared to hug their kids."
Paramedics are painting an equally grim picture. "It's a massive strain," one said. "It's the lack of breaks, the workload, the worry about COVID for themselves and their families, it's the gear, the PPE they have to wear, which would ordinarily be considered an occupational health and safety risk in itself because of the heat - on top of the usual pressures of the trauma of the work."
Despite requests, NSW Health has been unable to provide an exact number of ICU nurses or the numbers that have recently been "upskilled" to boost the intensive care workforce.
A spokesperson for the department said: "All local health districts have well-developed workforce surge and demand management plans in place, and our networked hospital system ensures patients can be transferred or redirected to other hospitals where necessary, including private hospitals ... Strategies have already been implemented such as the temporary suspension of non-urgent elective surgery."
Vice-president of the Australian and New Zealand Intensive Care Society Mark Nicholls, an intensivist at St Vincent's Hospital, says while health personnel are "highly trained, motivated and determined" to deliver intensive care, staffing remains a challenge.
"It is uncharted territory. The hope is that as vaccination rates rise we will get to the point where we can have a sustainable flow of patients through ICU," Nicholls says.
Melbourne University health systems modeller Dr Jason Thompson points out that the amount of time COVID-19 patients tend to spend in ICU is considerably longer (up to five times longer) than most other ICU patients.
"There's a finite capacity in any of these systems and once you hit it, that's it," he says. "All sorts of other things start to hit tipping points as well."
There is a general view among epidemiologists that the state has done well to keep daily case numbers from climbing more steeply than they currently are.
What's less clear is how much the vaccination surge is contributing to this, and how much owes to continuing lockdown measures and contact tracing, testing and isolation.
Professor Margaret Hellard, a modeller with the Burnet Institute in Melbourne, says even single dose vaccine rates will be helping to push down the infection rate. But she warns, "even when you have high levels of dual vaccination - and our [Burnet] models suggest that's over 80 per cent for all of the community - you may need occasional restrictions to control an outbreak to stop numbers rising high enough to overwhelm your health system".
Berejiklian however is doggedly adhering to the Doherty road map, which envisages restrictions starting to ease at 70 per cent double dose, albeit with strong public health measures still in place.
Yet the Doherty plan is also fast becoming a political football, with Queensland Premier Annastacia Palaszczuk triggering cold fury in federal circles this week after she cherry-picked a table in the report to assert 80 people would die each day after easing at 70 per cent vaccination rates. Federal Health Minister Greg Hunt accused her of "selectively misusing" the document in a "breach of good faith".
The Kirby Institute's Professor John Kaldor says "no politician can credibly claim that the modelling is predicting what will actually transpire. But [Doherty] is based on a reasonable set of scientific assumptions".
Associate Professor James Wood from the University of NSW, part of a team now helping to update the NSW modelling, acknowledges that "the caution has been whether 1000 cases a day versus a 100 makes a difference" to the report's assumptions.
"As best we can tell, contact tracing has continued to perform fairly well, despite the large numbers of cases ... I do think you can be reasonably confident that the scenarios that the Doherty model looks at are applicable in the NSW context," he says.
Wood concedes that if cases resume a steep climb "there is going to be a point at which it can't continue to scale".
Whatever easing of restrictions does take place at 70 per cent double dose will have to ensure the same level of protection extends across the most
at-risk groups, including Indigenous Australians and minority group populations.
Nearly 600,000 Australians aged over 60 are still to receive a single dose of a vaccine, prompting the Prime Minister to write to them urging them to do so.
One MP said there was a "rump" of over-60s in his electorate still hanging out for Pfizer, some having been advised to do so by GPs.
The hospitalisation rate is a key number government will be watching. Berejiklian on Wednesday said the current rate was about 5.5 per cent of active cases. But according to NSW Health's weekly COVID-19 surveillance report, data up to August 14 shows a hospitalisation rate of 12 per cent.
Juliette O'Brien, data journalist and creator of covid19data.com.au, warns the lower 5.5 per cent hospitalisation rate may not take into account the roughly 8300 people who have tested positive in the past week but who are probably not yet sick enough to be admitted to hospital.
"Because there can be a delay between a person becoming ill with COVID-19 and subsequently requiring a hospitalisation, and because cases in the current outbreak have a median of 11 days between onset and death, hospitalisations and deaths are under-reported for the most recently notified cases," the department's own surveillance report acknowledges.
Federal Liberal MP Trent Zimmerman believes that on top of the 70 and 80 per cent thresholds, "the most important threshold [for the government] is that you have been able to offer a vaccine to everyone who wants it ... I do think it's reasonable for us to have been able to offer everyone under 60 either Pfizer of AstraZeneca".
That may become easier when Australia receives the flood of mRNA vaccines which start in a few weeks. In a vaccine swap with Britain that was announced yesterday, Australia will get a further 4 million Pfizer doses this month, on top of the 500,000-dose deal with Singapore announced earlier this week.
It doubles the amount of Pfizer available in September. Throughout the month, Australia will receive more than 9 million doses of Pfizer alongside 1 million Moderna doses and continued AstraZeneca supply.
Berejiklian, for her part, insists she is not being rash. "Unlike other places around the world, we will have a measured and planned opening up".
It remains to be seen whether Delta plays along with those plans.

Full text: PREMIER SLAMMED FOR ‘SELECTIVE’ USE OF DATA PREMIER Annastacia Palaszczuk has been accused of misrepresenting the number of Covid deaths Australia faces and undermining public confidence even as she called for “serious discussions” on the path forward.
But Chief Health Officer Dr Jeannette Young defended the Premier from political fire, arguing Queenslanders needed to “understand what the risks are”.
In a highly-charged parliamentary performance, Ms Palaszczuk relied on a single graph and extrapolated, worst-case scenario Doherty modelling that relied on a reopening model which is not being proposed by any jurisdiction to warn of the impending body count. “Doherty Institute modelling predicts that even with 70 per cent of the population vaccinated, 80 people will die each day from Covid once the outbreak reaches six months after it started,” she said.
“That is 2240 who will die each month.” Pointing to the situation in NSW, she repeatedly promised to protect Queenslanders, and asked LNP members if they were “on Queensland’s side or are you on the other side?” But claims of mass death and children being vulnerable under the national plan were blasted as “false, misleading and wrong” during a press conference with federal Health Minister Greg Hunt and Chief Medical Officer Paul Kelly.
Federal authorities say the figures used represented what would happen with no restrictions in place, but that the national cabinet plan was for restrictions, quarantine and strong test, trace and isolate measures to remain in place at a 70 per cent vaccination rate.
Dr Young defended Ms Palaszczuk’s “responsible” comments that were repeated in a tweet to 186,000 followers, telling reporters: “Our Premier has to make sure that our population in Queensland understands what the risks are.” “They’re the figures, you can see them on the website,” she said. “Well I believe it is (responsible),” she added.
“You’ve got to look at the extremes. If you look at the extremes you can then work out what you then need to do and that’s what modelling does for you.” Mr Hunt (left) disagreed that the Premier’s message was responsible. “She is selectively misusing the Doherty modelling, it breaches good faith and damages public confidence,” he said.
Mr Hunt said the Doherty Institute made it clear that “with optimal public health measures and no lockdowns this can be significantly reduced to 2787 infections and 13 deaths”.
Doherty Institute modelling shows if the country opened up at 70 per cent and the national plan was followed, the number of deaths in the first six months of an outbreak would be 13.
If there were no low level restrictions and test and trace measures were failing, in the worst case scenario deaths would be about 1457 in the first six months – lower than the Premier’s calculations.
Meanwhile, the Doherty Institute modelling specifically took into consideration children, Mr Hunt said following Ms Palaszczuk’s fears around the vulnerability of unvaccinated young children and calls for more modelling.
“The claim that children were not considered is false, wrong and inaccurate,” Mr Hunt said.
Queensland LNP Senator Matt Canavan said it was disgraceful for the Premier to use children as “blackmail” to justify harsh restrictions continuing.
Using a slang term for an entitled person who makes unjustified demands, he said Ms Palaszczuk was “fast becoming ‘the Karen’ of the coronavirus pandemic for her heartless approach”.
Chief Medical Officer Paul Kelly declined to address the Premier’s claims directly, to avoid politicisation of his role, but he said people needed to learn to live with Covid.
“There will be people that die from Covid,” Dr Kelly said.
He said there would be additional analysis around the Doherty Institute’s modelling presented at national cabinet on Friday, “looking at what we’re actually seeing on the ground in NSW”.
“For example, starting at a base of cases,” he said.

Why October will be NSW's 'worst month' as Covid cases soar

Author: Lyons, Erin

Full text: Speaking to the media on Thursday the NSW Premier Gladys Berejiklian said people were likely to experience the worst of their symptoms during the second week of infection.
“Serious illness comes in the second week (and) that is why October is likely to be the worst month for (the) number of people .... unfortunately who die or who are in intensive care,” she said.
“We are obviously continuing to address those issues.”
Last year medical experts flagged what they described as a “second week crash” where people with relatively mild symptoms could rapidly deteriorate after day seven of being infected.
This is what happened to British Prime Minister Boris Johnson, who described experiencing mild symptoms during the first week but later ended up in ICU.
The incubation period of Covid-19 ranges between one and 14 days, with a average incubation period of five to six days.
At first, people infected with the virus might experience mild symptoms such as a slight cough, slight fever or a headache.
Usually during the second week, they’ll either start improving or suddenly decline – and for those whose symptoms get worse, it can quickly escalate to a trip to the emergency department.
There are currently 957 Covid-19 patients in hospital across NSW with 160 of those in intensive care. Sixty require a ventilator.
According to modelling from the Doherty Institute, infection rates are expected to peak in October, putting serious pressure on the health system, before slowly declining as more people got vaccinated.
Earlier in the week Ms Berejiklian confessed October would be the “worst time” for intensive care units but couldn’t put an exact figure on it, citing a lot of variables.
“The most important figures we are looking out on a day-to-day basis are the rate of vaccination and how many people, regrettably, have to be taken care of in intensive care,” she said on Thursday.
“Will our system cope? Of course it will. Will it be stretched? Of course it will. Our hearts go out to those healthcare workers.”
Last month the Doherty Institute released its modelling which predicted what would happen when Australia reached a 70 per cent vaccination rate and the states ended lockdowns.
The medical research institute forecasted that, with 70 per cent vaccine coverage of the adult population and partial public health measures, there will be 385,983 symptomatic cases and 1457 deaths over six months.
However, with “optimal public health measures” — and no lockdowns, this could be significantly reduced to 2737 infections and 13 deaths, the institute said.
But the experts behind the plan revealed there would never be a “freedom day” because there would never be “Covid zero”.
NSW recorded 1288 cases and seven deaths on Thursday.

Full text: A taskforce, led by Health ­Department secretary Brendan Murphy and counterparts across the country, will on Friday address the concerns of governments about health workers being furloughed during outbreaks and strains on public hospitals.
National cabinet leaders will be told state and territory public health networks can cope with higher caseloads, assisted by an additional 30,000 beds and 57,000 nurses across the private hospital system.
Detailed analysis to be presented at the national cabinet meeting will outline pressure points in the health system and potential gaps during outbreaks in regional and vulnerable communities.
Scott Morrison will face a divided national cabinet. Recalcitrant states and territories have ramped up attacks this week over vaccines for children and rising death rates when the country reopens after 70 per cent of the population is fully vaccinated.
South Australia on Thursday joined Victoria and NSW in strongly backing the national plan, as Covid-free states including Western Australia, Queensland and Tasmania baulked over easing border restrictions.
Writing in The Australian, Queensland Deputy Premier ­Steven Miles accused the Prime Minister of selling “false hope” in states with high Covid case numbers that the nation could “live with the virus”. Mr Miles said the Doherty ­Institute modelling was “much more complicated than that” and would require a collective decision to be made about “how many people’s lives we risk and how we protect those who cannot be vaccinated”, including children, transplant recipients and cancer patients.
“Decide how many people should die and work back from there – what level of vaccination you need and what other public health measures need to stay in place,” he wrote. “That is the ­complex, difficult, life-and-death decision Scott Morrison tried to simplify down to a simple number and three-word slogan.”
Health Minister Greg Hunt on Thursday accused Queensland Premier Annastacia Palaszczuk of “profound moral failure” after letting NRL staff and players’ families enter the state while shutting out thousands of others including children and cancer patients.
Health experts also attacked Ms Palaszczuk’s claims that children could become severely ill from Covid-19 and that 80 people would die each day from the virus when the country moved to stage two of the reopening plan.
Mr Hunt said national cabinet’s modelling projected 13 deaths across 180 days when Australia reached 70 per cent vaccine coverage and described Ms Palaszczuk’s comments as “selective misuse” of the Doherty Institute advice.
Ms Palaszczuk had earlier claimed that even after 70 per cent of the population was vaccinated, “80 people will die each day six months after the outbreak”.
“That’s 2240 who will die each month,” Ms Palaszczuk said. “I sympathise with people interstate enduring months of lockdown but my job is to protect ­Queenslanders.
Despite no country in the world vaccinating under 12s, and only preliminary work underway to trial vaccines in young children, Ms Palaszczuk demanded more information be provided to national cabinet.
Chief Medical Officer Paul Kelly said there was no evidence the Delta strain was more severe in children, with national data this year showing only three children under the age of 12 had been admitted to intensive care.
“There have been 134 hospitalisations,” Professor Kelly said. “Most of the kids who have been admitted to hospital have been for social reasons, not because they are particularly unwell. There have only been three children under the age of 12 that have been admitted to intensive care. Three out of 3815. That is way less than one in 1000. The disease in children is very different from what we’re seeing in adults.”
The national cabinet agenda includes discussions around the transition plan, Doherty scenarios and Indigenous vaccine surge strategy. Professor Murphy’s “optimising health system” briefing will discuss what test, trace, isolate, quarantine and public health measures will be required to support hospital and workforce capacity. Jane Halton will update leaders on her second review of the national quarantine system and the South Australian home quarantine trial.
Amid warnings from the Australian Medical Association on Thursday that hospitals were ill-prepared for a surge in cases, Mr Hunt said the private hospital network would bolster access to care and health professionals.
“It’s about the partnership ­between the public hospitals and the private hospitals,” Mr Hunt said. “In particular, it brings 57,000 nurses, over 30,000 beds, over 100,000 staff all up into that partnership, so to provide a massive surge capacity.”
Mr Hunt said significant work had been done to prepare hospitals, including increasing ventilated beds from 2000 to 7500. He singled out the NSW government for boosting ICU capacity.
Professor Kelly said that, since January last year, the focus had been on preparing for Covid-19 spikes in hospitalisations and ICU admissions. “We’ve still got 4000 invasive ventilators in our national medical stockpile, as well as other treatments,” he said. “There’s an issue of workforce. We need to work through that. And we did last year and provided training to extra nurses at that time with an idea we would have had to surge last year.”
Federal government sources said some states and territories “had been better than others” in scaling up hospital and staffing arrangements.
AMA president Omar Khorshid said new modelling based on hospital and staffing capacity must be urgently undertaken. “Even pre-Covid, emergency departments were full, ambulances ramped, and waiting times for elective surgery too long,” he said.

Full text: A new breakdown of state ­vaccination rates shows that WA will not achieve 80 per cent of over-16s double vaccinated – ending most domestic restrictions under Scott Morrison’s road map to recovery – until November 30, followed later by Queensland on December 7.
In the case of the Sunshine State, this would be five weeks after NSW hit 80 per cent to qualify to shift to a more Covid-normal setting of living with the virus. Citywide and state lockdowns are supposed to have ceased by then.
As of September 1, 32.9 per cent of eligible Queenslanders and 32.66 per cent of those in WA were fully dosed, against 38.68 per cent in NSW and 36.01 per cent in Victoria. NSW has administered 1.09 shots of vaccine per person compared to 0.85 doses per person in Queensland and 0.84 doses in WA.
Queensland Premier Annastacia Palaszczuk, increasingly at odds with the Prime Minister over the reopening plan, on Thursday warned the 70 per cent trigger to begin opening up would also lift Covid-19 deaths to 2240 a month nationally.
But she failed to mention this was a worst-case scenario under the benchmark Doherty Institute modelling, assuming little else was done to contain the virus.
Federal Health Department data shows that Queensland is delivering 48,933 jabs a day and WA 27,002 as the vaccine rollout ramps up. But this is still far slower than in NSW, with 139,914 doses administered on Wednesday. Victoria posted 81,683 vaccinations and there were 16,973 in South Australia, 5896 in Tasmania, 7389 in the ACT and 2796 in the Northern Territory for a national tally of 330,586 shots in the 24 hours to September 1.
Infectious disease expert Paul Griffin, who was charged by Ms Palaszczuk with investigating a disruptive hospital outbreak in July, said Queensland’s sluggish vaccine uptake reflected false ­security in the community that border controls and lockdowns would keep Covid-19 in check.
“The messaging has been ­focused on the fact we are being kept safe and this is an effective way of managing the virus,” Dr Griffin said. “People have this perception that Covid is being kept out of the state and they are being kept safe. Let them know it will keep coming.”
While Vaxzevria (formerly AstraZeneca) was given in state-run vaccination clinics in NSW and Victoria, Queensland used only Pfizer, further slowing distribution. “Even people well within the eligible age group were discouraged from that vaccine,” Dr Griffin said, citing controversial comments by chief health officer Jeannette Young questioning the safety of Vaxzevria for under-60s.
WA Premier Mark McGowan has pinned the blame for the state’s low vaccination rates on the decision – which had WA’s support – to prioritise an additional million doses of Pfizer for NSW due to the scale of its emergency. He said on Wednesday it was galling his state was criticised by Mr Morrison “for not having the same vaccination levels as NSW when we didn’t get the million extra doses they got on top of their per-capita share”.
Despite Mr McGowan’s complaints about vaccine supply, a check on the main state-run ­vaccination clinic in Claremont on Thursday showed there were still vaccination slots available on both Thursday and Friday, and on at least one day for each of the next few weeks.
Shafi Sahibzada, a lecturer in epidemiology at Perth’s Murdoch University, said the tight border controls had allowed people in WA to put off getting their jabs.
On top of that, he said the pressures on WA’s health system – which this week cancelled some scheduled elective surgeries despite there being no Covid cases in the state’s hospitals – showed WA was not ready for an outbreak of the scale of those in Sydney and Melbourne.
“We will see spikes and we will see outbreaks and we are not prepared,” he said. “Instead of preparing for that, we are taking the easy path and keeping the border closed. That just won’t work for the long term.”
The head of the AMA in WA, Mark Duncan-Smith, said the lack of Covid-19 in the state was the biggest driver of vaccine hesitancy. “The maintenance of zero Covid and avoiding Covid outbreaks in Western Australia has been very good and effective, but it also reduces the motivation to get coverage for vaccination as people don’t feel pressured about it,” Dr Duncan-Smith said.
“The evidence of what’s happening in NSW hopefully will overcome that.”
Dr Griffin, director of ­infec­tious disease at Brisbane’s Mater Health, said some of Ms Palaszczuk’s language “had the potential” to fuel vaccine hesitancy.
Analysis of the federal Health Department data shows that the ACT will be the first jurisdiction to achieve 80 per cent of over-16s doubled-jabbed on October 20 on current vaccination rates, followed by Tasmania on October 27 and NSW on October 30.

Full text: But only in targeted radio appearances and only in the low Covid-19 states of Queensland, South Australia and Western Australia. He is deliberately letting his false hope stand in other markets, especially Sydney.
Nowhere does the Doherty modelling say there is a magic number at which we can “open up”, “leave our cave like that girl in The Croods” or “live with the virus”.
It’s much more complicated than that.
Covid vaccines are a new and powerful tool to help control the virus and reduce hospitalisation and deaths. They come on top of the other public health tools that are available.
The effectiveness of each tool depends on compliance.
A lockdown will be more effective if 80 per cent comply than 70 per cent. Masks will be more effective if 80 per cent of people wear them than 70 per cent.
Vaccines are more effective when 80 per cent of people are vaccinated than 70 per cent.
Because vaccines are new, we will need fewer of the other tools. That is what the Doherty Modelling says.
From there, we need to make a collective decision about how much pressure we want to put on our hospitals, how many people’s lives we risk and how we protect those who cannot be vaccinated, think children, transplant recipients and cancer patients.
Decide how many people should die and work back from there – what level of vaccination you need and what other public health measures need to stay in place.
That is the complex, difficult, life-and-death decision that Scott Morrison tried to simplify down to a simple number and three-word slogan.
I think that even with his background in marketing, people will see it’s not that simple.
Especially as they watch the case numbers climb in NSW. As they see hospitals fill up and turn away patients with other conditions because intensive care units are full and there are not enough ICU-trained health professionals to open more.
His simple message of false hope might have been welcome in Sydney, where residents are holed up in their caves for a tenth straight week.
But not in Queensland, where masks and a tough border with NSW have so far kept the virus out and let us lead a relatively normal life outside our caves while we rush to reach our vaccination targets.
Up here, it looked more like a prime minister desperate to avoid responsibility after demanding the delay in lockdown which led to the Sydney outbreak.
A prime minister who has somehow spent the Sydney Covid-19 crisis talking about Queensland and WA.
His focus group research might have said Australians were ready to let the virus rip through their children, but that is not what Queenslanders have been telling me.

Full text: Premier Gladys Berejiklian confirmed the figure on Thursday and said seven people with the virus had tragically lost their lives.
Ms Berejiklian said seven million doses of Covid-19 vaccines had now been administerd after 121,000 people rolled up their sleeves on Wednesday.
“We are the first state or territory to hit that (mark), and I can’t thank our people enough,” Ms Berejiklian said
“It’s been a difficult couple of months and the fact that people have heard the messages we’ve been giving and coming forward to get vaccinated and hitting that 70 per cent first dose is an outstanding achievement.”
Ms Berejiklian as a result of hitting the milestone, residents living in areas of concern — local government areas in western and southwestern Sydney — will now be allowed to have unlimited time to exercise 5am on Friday. However, the 9pm to 5am curfew will remain in place.
They were previously only allowed to exercise for one hour a day.
Gaps between the two doses suggest there are just weeks to go before the state can begin reopening, with modelling predicting the state will hit 70 per cent of fully vaccinated residents (over 16) on October 17.
However, Ms Berejiklian has hinted the rapid rate of vaccinations means the state could hit that figure before October 17.
Those receiving Pfizer must wait at least three weeks between doses, while the AstraZeneca vaccine has a minimum four week gap for areas with high rates of Covid transmission, and a 12-week gap as standard.
NSW chief health officer Dr Kerry Chant revealed there are currently 160 people in intensive care, 64 of whom require ventilation.
Dr Chant also revealed one of the seven deaths recorded overnight was a man who was fully vaccinated, however he “did have significant underlying conditions.”
“A man in his 70s from southwest Sydney died at Liverpool Hospital; he acquired his infection at the hospital,” she said, meaning the man was admitted for other conditions.
“He had received both doses of a vaccination however he did have significant underlying health conditions.”

PM’S ASTRAZENECA VACCINE THREAT
Australians aged over 60 have been told to get vaccinated with AstraZeneca now or be put at the back of the queue when supply of the Pfizer and Moderna vaccines ramp up.
Scott Morrison will next week send a letter to more than 580,000 unvaccinated Australians aged between 60 and 69 to urge them to get the AstraZeneca jab as soon as possible.
“The recent outbreaks of the new more infectious strains of the Covid-19 virus, with some tragic deaths in Sydney, make it even more important that Australians over 60 get vaccinated now,” the letter reads.
The letter contained no hope senior Australians would be offered the Pfizer of Moderna vaccine any time in the near future.
“We have expanded the number of community pharmacies who are administering the highly effective AstraZeneca Covid-19 vaccine around the country … This gives you, your family, and your loved ones more opportunities to get vaccinated,” it continued.
Health Minister Greg Hunt and chief medical officer Paul Kelly also signed their names to the letter, which outlined the increased risk of people within the age group have of getting severe disease with Covid-19.
“The expert health advice is very clear, people over 60 have a greatly increased risk of getting severe disease with Covid-19 and must be vaccinated as soon as possible.”
AstraZeneca is the recommended vaccine for Australians over 60 and is readily available from GPs, state-run vaccination hubs and pharmacies.
It’s estimated there are more than three million doses sitting in fridges waiting to be administered.
More than 80 per cent of people over 60 have had their first dose of the vaccine. Mr Morrison thanked those who were already vaccinated for serving as a “great example to others”.
“Thank you for keeping our country safe and for setting a great example to others. Your vaccination will not only help protect you and your loved ones from hospitalisation and death from Covid-19 but also ensure we can all move towards our return to normal sooner,” he said.
More than 35 per cent of Australians are fully vaccinated, with close to 60 per cent of Australians over 16 vaccinated with at least one dose.
The letter is set to drop in letterboxes the same week the Covid-19 jab will be made available to all Australians 12 years and over.
Australia’s supply of the Pfizer vaccine is set to rise to 4.5 million in September, but doses will be prioritised for people aged 12 to 39.
2000 A DAY: GRIM WARNING AS VIC HAS 176 NEW CASES
Victorian authorities have revealed two concerning hot spots where transmission of the deadly virus is occurring during the state’s worsening Covid-19 outbreak.
The state recorded 176 new locally acquired Covid-19 cases on Thursday, the highest spike in the state in 366 days, as the latest outbreak spirals out of control.
Of particular concern to health officials is rising case numbers at a call centre just south of the CBD and an infection at a backpackers in St Kilda.
Health Minister Martin Foley said 17 positive cases had now been linked to the Acquire call centre that was co-located with Healthcare Australia, which was assisting the federal government with the nation’s vaccine rollout.
Mr Foley said more than 400 primary close contacts had been isolated as a result of the call centre cluster.
He said all staff who worked from August 25 at the Acquire call centre had been classified as primary close contacts.
The second hot spot flagged by the Health Minister was the Base Backpackers in St Kilda where a positive case has been identified.
That case was immediately move into hotel quarantine.
“Given the nature of the complex, and the shared communal facilities, we are working with our authorised officers, and with the residents there, to establish a public health response, and ensure that the residents can be quarantined to safely,” Mr Foley said.
Deputy chief health officer Ben Cowie said there was not one corner of metropolitan Melbourne that had not been touched by the virus.
“We have been seeing and continue to see high case numbers in the suburbs to the north and the west of Melbourne.
“We are still really concerned by the number of cases, and the trends we are seeing in the suburbs of Altona, Broadmeadows, and Truganina.
“We have seen a significant increase in suburbs throughout the south and east of Melbourne as well.”
The 176 new local cases is the highest daily spike in virus cases in more than a year, since 202 infections reported on August 22, 2020 during Victoria’s deadly second wave.
The health department confirmed the new local Covid-19 cases about 8.30am, as infections spiral out of control despite the state’s sixth lockdown.
Another 97 new mystery infections were announced within the cases, with the department revealing only 83 of the new cases could be linked to existing outbreaks.
They did not say how many cases were in isolation during their infectious period.
Premier Daniel Andrews has conceded the case numbers will not go down.
“These last few days have seen a dramatic shift in the nature and the number of cases coming forward,” he said.
“We will not see these case numbers go down. They are going to go up. The question is by how many and how fast?
“What we must do is suppress case numbers sufficient to buy us time to get people vaccinated.”
Mr Andrews said some form of restrictions would need to remain in place in Victoria until the state reached the national threshold of 70 and 80 per cent of the population double dosed vaccinated.
It comes as University of Melbourne epidemiologist Professor Tony Blakely warned Victorian case numbers could hit 2000 a day in October.
“The case numbers are going up at about 5 per cent per day,” Prof Blakely said.
He said if infections continue on this trajectory, Victoria “will probably have 2000 cases a day in late October or early November when the vaccine coverage catches up”
There are now 1029 active cases across the state, up from 900 on Wednesday, with more than 13,800 people in isolation across the state.
Professor Cowie said 192 of the 1029 active cases were aged nine and under, 157 were aged between 10 and 19, and 243 were aged in their 20s.
No new cases were recorded in hotel quarantine on Thursday

QLD RECORDS ONE NEW LOCAL CASE
Queensland has recorded a new locally acquired Covid-19 case who was “potentially” infectious in the community for five days.
The new case was a truck driver who lives on the Gold Coast and in addition to the truck driver from NSW who was reported on Wednesday, Annastacia Palaszczuk told parliament.
The case is currently under investigation with the beginning of the infection period potentially beginning on August 28.
Ms Palaszczuk said the driver had travelled to Sydney and was currently in NSW but was infectious on the Gold Coast in the five days to Wednesday.
Contact tracing is underway with exposure sites expected to be revealed later in the morning.
On Wednesday, exposure sites emerged at Archerfield and Goondiwindi with the first driver infectious in the community for a full day who was also under investigation.
This man was assigned as a NSW infection, not a Queensland case.
Authorities have issued close contact alerts for a BP Service Station in Archerfield and the amenities and dining section of a BP Truckstop in Goondiwindi.

The ACT has recorded a further 12 new cases of Covid-19 overnight but the community has been criticised for its low testing numbers.
Chief Minister Andrew Barr said six cases were linked to current exposure sites or identified close contacts, while another six remained under investigation.
“We’re certain that four were in quarantine during their entire infectious period,” he told reporters on Thursday.
“It leaves the remaining eight who were in the community for at least part of their infectious period.”
Mr Barr said 13 people were in hospital, including four in intensive care and two requiring ventilation.
The latest person requiring ventilation is a man aged in his 20s, who has no pre-existing health conditions. He is not vaccinated.
Mr Barr also revealed only 2500 coronavirus tests were conducted on Wednesday.
“This is just not high enough. The virus is out in our community, so it is critical if you have symptoms to get tested as soon as possible,” he said.
The Chief Minister said 68 per cent of the population over the age of 16 had been administered their first dose, while 44.5 per cent were fully vaccinated.
He also revealed ACT residents aged 75 to 79 were the first group in Australia to pass the 80 per cent target of being fully-vaccinated.
But people aged 16 to 29 are facing a wait of up to three months for a vaccine.
Mr Barr said over the next few months the ACT would face a “challenging scenario” and there were “no easy choices”.
“Canberrans have worked incredibly hard to minimise the spread of the virus and to significantly reduce the risk to our community,” he said.
“Our strategy is to get our caseload down as quickly as we can.
“What that means is that new cases are able to linked and they are in quarantine for their entire infectious period.”
Mr Barr said it would be a difficult time over the next few months.
“We can only gradually ease restrictions as the vaccination rate increases,” he said.
“This means there will be inconveniences, there will be frustrations. We will try to minimise these as much as possible.”
The Chief Minister said the best way to help was to get vaccinated.
“We can and should lead the nation on vaccination. It’s a worthy goal to strive for,” he said.


STATES TURN THEIR BACKS ON PLAN OUT OF PANDEMIC
Premiers have cast doubt on whether their states will follow the national roadmap out of the pandemic.
Queensland Premier Annastacia Palaszczuk said on Wednesday that her state’s border restrictions would be lifted until children have been vaccinated, The Australian reports.
“Until I can get every child vaccinated, we will stand firm and we will stand strong (on border -closures),” Ms Palaszczuk said.
It came as West Australian Premier Mark McGowan accused the commonwealth of trying to “infect the public” by pressuring states ease restrictions, as he warned borders could remain shut with NSW and Victoria for months.
Victorian Premier Daniel Andrews on Wednesday ditched his zero-case strategy and outlined a plan to ease restrictions starting on September 23, when 70 per cent of the state’s adults are expected to have received their first dose of a Covid-19 vaccine.
But tough restrictions like stay-at-home orders and curfews may now be lifted until Victoria reaches 70 or 80 per full vaccination coverage — a target it is expected to reach in November.
Mr McGowan and Ms Palaszczuk are alarmed by the growing number of virus cases in NSW and Victoria, and have cast doubt on the Doherty Institute modelling that underpins national cabinet’s pathway out of lockdown.
The modelling recommends an easing of restrictions when 70 per cent of the adult population is vaccinated, with an end to lockdowns one vaccine coverage hits 80 per cent.
Ms Palaszczuk said it had failed to take into account children, while Mr McGowan reacted furiously to a comment by Attorney-General Michaelia Cash questioning the constitutionality of state border closures as vaccination rates rose.
“Why are they on this mission to bring Covid into Western Australia to infect our public, to ensure that we shut down parts of the economy, that we lose jobs, people get sick and some people die?” Mr McGowan said.
“Haven’t they seen what’s happening in NSW.”
In response to a question on whether the border could remain shut well into 2022, Mr Andrews said: “Yep, and no one’s happy about that but again we’ll have many more options when we get to 80 per cent.”

Full text: Mask wearing and social distancing will need to be more heavily relied on to contain Covid transmission as Australia starts to reopen because of Sydney's overwhelmed contact tracing system, ACT Chief Minister Andrew Barr has said.
Mr Barr believes the outbreaks in Sydney and Melbourne have challenged one of the crucial assumptions in the contentious Doherty Institute modelling, which underpins national cabinet's four-step plan to end lockdowns and reopen Australian to the world.
He said rising case numbers meant leaders would no longer be able to base decisions around easing restrictions on the assumption that there would be "optimal" capacity to manage outbreaks through testing, tracing, isolation and quarantine (TTIQ).
NSW reported another pandemic record of 1218 cases on Sunday, as the number of infections which contact tracers have been unable to link to known sources continues to surge.
Victoria recorded a further 92 cases - its highest daily number since its deadly second wave last year.
With contact tracing under immense strain, Mr Barr said public health measures combined with the "principal weapon" of vaccination would be relied on to manage outbreaks as restrictions eased under the national plan.
He said the implications of the Delta outbreaks on the Doherty Institute modelling were discussed extensively at Friday's national cabinet meeting.
"It's clear that we can't base our decisions on optimal TTIQ, that that will not be possible with very high case numbers."
The Doherty Modelling looked at the effect of vaccination rates and public health measures on containing Covid transmission, in separate scenarios which assumed either "optimal" or "partial" testing, trace, isolation and quarantine.
Under the "partial" scenario, low and medium public health restrictions - which could include stay-at-home orders - would be needed to contain the virus' spread even when 70 per cent of the population was fully vaccinated.
Under the "optimal" scenario, only low-level public health restrictions would be needed to suppress the virus' spread at 70 per cent vaccination coverage.

Our Covid mindset must change if we are ever to open up

Publication info: Weekend Australian ; Canberra, A.C.T. [Canberra, A.C.T]. 28 Aug 2021: 14.

Full text: It’s time for Australians – including the premiers – to face a tough truth Australia is finally beginning the most important mental adjustment of this pandemic as it grasps what the rest of the world has known for months – that the ­unavoidable price of freedom from Covid-19 is the acceptance of death.
We are not talking about just a few deaths but many deaths, possibly in the thousands, if Australia is to join the rest of the Western world in opening up and resuming something approximating normal life.
It’s a jarring but necessary transition for a country that prided itself on a low death count during the deadliest phase of the pandemic last year and then became addicted to the fantasy idea that zero Covid was possible into the future.
This week saw a historic tipping point in Australia’s debate over the pandemic. For the first time, the momentum is clearly swinging towards accepting and understanding the need for deadly trade-offs to regain freedoms as soon as vaccination rates meet the threshold targets of 70 and 80 per cent of the eligible population.
The change in rhetoric is being led by the Morrison government, especially Josh Frydenberg. But the mood is also changing among epidemiologists, health professionals and business operators who are increasingly taking a broader view of the growing social, economic and health costs of endless lockdowns in NSW and Victoria.
It is also being powered by changing public opinion, as exhausted locked-down populations in NSW and Victoria realise the Delta variant cannot be contained and that there is no choice but to live with it.
Nothing better illustrated this changing debate than NSW Premier Gladys Berejiklian this week announcing an easing of restrictions of social gatherings on the same day as her state clocked up 1029 new Covid cases, a new national record.
But this mood shift is not yet a uniform one or a national one. The Morrison government and the NSW Premier are sharply at odds with the premiers of low-Covid states, especially Western Australia and Queensland, who have threatened to delay reopening if it means Covid coming into their state.
A very uncivil war is also being fought in suburbs across the country where the debate over freedoms versus health risks continues to pit neighbour against neighbour. Social media is a sewer of abuse as dominant left-leaning voices continue to portray lockdown critics as reckless granny killers.
The fast-growing pace of the vaccine rollout, after a disastrously slow start, has emboldened a previously cautious Morrison government to finally take more assertive leadership in trying to change the national psyche to accept the necessity of death as a price for reopening the country.
“The only long-term solution for Australia is to live with Covid, and people expect their leaders to be upfront with them as to what that means,” the Treasurer tells Inquirer.
“More cases, severe illness and, tragically, the loss of life will occur. People need to be conditioned to this reality given that, to date, states have used the bluntest of instruments, namely lockdowns, but in the process Australia has avoided the loss of life seen elsewhere.
“Now that we have the vaccine rollout gaining real momentum there is an alternative.” Scott Morrison, who says the country must “adjust” its mindset, has warned Australians will be stuck “in the cave forever” if any premiers abandon the agreed national plan to progressively ease Covid restrictions at 70 and 80 per cent vaccination rates.
WA and Queensland have baulked at reopening borders or ruling out lockdowns once the vaccination targets are reached, knowing that this will inject Covid into their state – especially if NSW continues to have high case numbers.
“Just because the NSW government has made a mess of it doesn’t mean the rest of us should suffer,” WA Premier Mark McGowan says.
“We should do everything we can to stay in the state we are currently in, and at the same time vaccinate like hell.” But the Prime Minister has, in effect called their bluff, by posing the logical question: “If not at 70 per cent and 80 per cent, then when?
“We must make that move and we must prepare to make that move and we must prepare the country to make that move,” Morrison says.
As Berejiklian says, a zero-Covid target by any state is “completely unrealistic”. “I don’t know any state or nation on the planet who abides by those rules,” she says. “It’s just not possible. We can’t pretend we’re special or very different from other places.” The bottom line is that McGowan and Queensland Premier Annastacia Palaszczuk are avoiding having an honest conversation with their own voters about the inevitable infections, illness and deaths that will be a consequence of Australia’s reopening.
The standoff has pushed the Doherty Institute, the modeller of the Covid national vaccination plan, into the spotlight after Queensland this week argued that the 70 and 80 per cent inoculation targets were not modelled on having such a large Covid outbreak in NSW.
It was a potentially perilous moment for the national reopening plan, but the plan remains intact after the institute publicly denied the claim, stating that its modelling is still valid even with higher case numbers in NSW and elsewhere.
The institute has also given Australians the first glimpse of the projected deaths involved in reopening once the initial 70 per cent vaccination target has been reached.
“Opening up at 70 per cent ‘with partial health measures’ we predict 385,983 symptomatic cases and 1457 deaths over six months,” the institute says.
This quote was spotlighted by the media and by those who support higher vaccination rates ­before reopening, but Health Minister Greg Hunt argued it was the second Doherty projection, involving “optimal” not “partial” health measures which was more relevant – “With optimal public health measures (and no lockdowns) this can be significantly reduced to 2737 infections and 13 deaths,” the Doherty Institute says.
The institute also places these projected deaths in context, pointing out that some 600 Australians die of the flu each year: “Any death is a tragedy but our health system can cope with this.” However, it did say there would be no “freedom day” like in Britain and any easing of restrictions would need to be a progressive one even after vaccination targets have been met.
The experience of other highly vaccinated nations – although not a direct apples-for-apples comparison – suggests infection rates and deaths upon reopening could be higher than the Doherty Institute estimates.
Britain, with 67 million people, has about 75 per cent over 12 years of age fully vaccinated and is currently experiencing about 33,000 new Covid cases a day with 100 daily deaths.
The United States, with 330 million people, has about 52 per cent fully vaccinated and is recording about 150,000 new cases a day with some 900 daily deaths. However, the key statistic in both of these countries – and also throughout the rest of Europe – is that more than 95 per cent of all Covid deaths are people who are unvaccinated by choice.
By the time Australia reaches the Doherty Institute vaccination targets, everyone over the age of 16 who wants a vaccine will have had the opportunity to have one. So the deaths that will occur here in Australia later this year when the country opens up will overwhelmingly be among those who have chosen not to get vaccinated.
A more balanced debate in Australia about the trade-off between Covid deaths and freedoms has been long overdue compared to the rest of the Western world where high infections and deaths are accepted as an unfortunate price for freedoms once people have had a chance to be vaccinated. The debate here is now being fast-tracked by the situation in NSW, where the uncontrolled Covid outbreak has led Berejiklian to rely on vaccination rates rather than suppression as the only realistic path to lifting the state’s lockdown.
This focus on vaccinations rather than new cases is now the most relevant statistic for Australians as they race towards the Doherty targets but most premiers have yet to adjust their thinking as they continue to fixate on case numbers.
Victoria also appears to have lost control of its Covid outbreak, with about 50 to 80 new cases a day dashing hopes of any reprieve from that state’s lockdown for many weeks and possibly months.
The inability of Victoria’s lockdown-prone Premier Daniel Andrews to quell the Delta outbreak in Melbourne, despite locking down early and hard, sends a message to the rest of the country that it is all but impossible to keep the highly infectious Delta variant out of large cities in the long term. But Andrews, who is easily the country’s least sympathetic premier when it comes to understanding the broader costs of lockdowns, shows no sign of following Berejiklian in relaxing lockdown rules in the face of ongoing infections.
Some epidemiologists are now softening their advice to account for this new Delta reality, even if some premiers refuse to listen.
University of Melbourne epidemiologist Professor Tony Blakely says it may be time to consider a “soft lockdown” in Victoria if the state cannot get below 40 cases a day by September 2.
He expressed concern about the impact of another prolonged lockdown on people’s mental health and the economy and says certain freedoms like bubbles between vaccinated households, industries resuming work and curfews being ditched could be part of the plan.
“I think we need a week as a civil society to start chatting about these things,” Blakely says.
But Andrews, who has not given up the notion of defeating the latest outbreak, rejected Blakely’s idea, saying Covid case numbers would inevitably rise under a softer lockdown.
This week another prominent infectious diseases expert, Professor Peter Collignon of Canberra’s ANU, also flagged the need to take a more balanced approach to the debate as Australia gets closer to the vaccination targets.
“We will need to start thinking about how our mindset will need to change if we want to not just minimise deaths but also minimise the many long-term social, education, psychological and economic impacts caused by severe restrictions to slow transmission,” he says.
“The Delta variant has made ‘zero Covid’ an unlikely sustainable long-term, or even medium-term strategy,” he adds.
Former deputy chief medical officer Nick Coatsworth now says he regrets that the country’s medical establishment did not more aggressively challenge those commentators and academics who for so long have called for an indefinite zero Covid strategy.
“We should have been a lot firmer. We needed stronger voices out there,” he says.
But the government’s plan for a unified national reopening is also being threatened by the growing disparity in vaccination rates around the country.
In NSW, where fear of catching Covid is highest, about 60 per cent of first doses have been delivered, putting the state on track to reach its 70 per cent double jab target around October 29 and 80 per cent around November 16.
Victoria is set to reach the 70 per cent full vaccination threshold around November 3 and 80 per cent around November 21. But the national laggards are the largely Covid-free states of Western Australia and Queensland which are sitting at around 46 per cent for the first dose.
At current rates, Queensland is not expected to reach a 70 per cent full vaccination rate until about December 4 and 80 per cent around December 28, while WA is not projected to reach 70 per cent until around November 11 and 80 per cent around November 29.
Unless this changes, the Morrison government will be faced with an uneven relaxation of restrictions around the country including the continued imposition of cross-border travel bans between Covid-free states and those with ongoing outbreaks, which will include NSW and probably Victoria.
With the country’s two biggest states in a prolonged lockdown, the Morrison government’s political fortunes are hugely dependent on reaching the Doherty Institute targets as quickly as possible.
As a new part of this plan, national cabinet this week examined proposals to encourage jabs by ­allowing fully vaccinated Australians to fly freely on planes and visit restaurants, sporting venues and bars under a uniform standard.
Polls show that such a move, which is similar in practice to a so-called vaccination passport, would be welcomed by most Australians if it restores many of the basic freedoms they have lost in lockdowns.
Recent opinion polls show that Australians, especially those in lockdowns, are now restless to open up as vaccination rates continue to rise.
A new poll taken for the Centre for Independent Studies found the NSW lockdown has sparked a marked shift in public attitudes ­towards Covid-19 restrictions. More than two-thirds of Australians, 71 per cent, now want restrictions and lockdowns to end as soon as possible or when vaccine targets are met and do not believe that returning to zero Covid-19 cases is possible. Only 10 per cent argue that everyone should be vaccinated before restrictions are lifted.
The dilemma for the Morrison government will be if full vaccination rates stall short of the 70 and 80 per cent rates.
Public opinion is unlikely to support ongoing lockdowns and restrictions regardless of the Doherty targets if every Australian who wants a vaccine has had the opportunity to get one. Failure to lift restrictions at this point would mean that the country was being held hostage by anti-vaxxers.
But for now, this remains a ­hypothetical problem for the government because the vaccine take up is strong and vaccine hesitancy is falling.
As Frydenberg puts it, the Doherty Institute plan is the only credible and safe way out of the country’s Covid crisis.
“The plan must be adhered to if we are going to give people hope,” he says. “The plan is the right plan and it is the agreed plan. The health of the Australian public and the economy depend on it being followed.”

Full text: Reaching vaccination thresholds will grant us old freedoms but with new realities, write Melissa Cunningham and Aisha Dow.
It's March 2022 in Australia and a wedding invitation arrives. Included inside is an RSVP note with instructions about how to use a rapid coronavirus test on the day of the nuptials.
It may seem like science fiction but in the United States and Britain, some COVID-19-conscious hosts have screening requirements, and it's become a prerequisite to show proof of vaccination or a recent negative test before attending a gathering.
So while we can expect old freedoms to return next year, they will come with new realities, such as mask-wearing and wedding invites asking people to "comply with the following COVID health and safety rules".
Crowds may be allowed to snake back into sporting stadiums and live music venues - at a safe distance - while cinemas and museums will be open, perhaps requiring a vaccination passport for entry.
Thousands of secondary close contacts will no longer have to isolate. International travel will resume and millions will have our first real encounter with the pathogen that caused our worlds to shrink.
And when we do meet this virus, many of us, even if we are fully vaccinated, could still end up sick for three or so days with a mild illness but, infectious disease physician Professor Peter Collignon says, "that is far better than ending up in intensive care for three weeks".
There is now widespread recognition that a high rate of vaccinations will not be enough to allow Australians to live as freely as we could otherwise, or to avoid thousands of deaths. This has been highlighted by international experiences, including in Israel, once the poster child for vaccination, Britain and the US.
The danger has also been spelled out by the Doherty Institute, which estimated the substantial gap between beginning to open up at 70 per cent of the population fully vaccinated with "partial" versus "optimal" public health measures.
The partial scenario could see close to 400,000 symptomatic cases and 1457 deaths over six months, versus a few thousand symptomatic cases and 13 deaths in the optimal scenario.
But should contact-tracing systems become strained due to an outbreak of more than 1000 cases each day, and if fewer restrictions are in place, the situation could be worse.
So what would Australia look like once we learn to live with COVID-19?
Continued contact tracing is one of the key measures that will allow us to live more freely once vaccination rates reach 70 per cent and beyond.
Anyone visiting shops, restaurants and public places will still have to check in using QR codes, meaning thousands will still be receiving texts declaring "you have been identified as a close contact of a person with coronavirus".
But mandatory home quarantine may no longer be a requirement for vaccinated Australians exposed to the virus fleetingly or in low-risk settings such as supermarkets.
Instead, outbreaks at hairdressers, warehouses, abattoirs, offices and restaurants, where people spend extended periods of time indoors, will require those exposed and vaccinated to be tested and spend a few days in home quarantine.
Doherty Institute director Professor Sharon Lewin said the goal of contact tracing would change once Australia was "living" with COVID-19 rather than trying to eliminate it. In Victoria, more than half of the 32,000 people currently in isolation are secondary close contacts of cases, and Professor Lewin said this group would no longer need to isolate.
Professor Collignon said contact tracing would concentrate on those who offered the most probable routes of transmission: family units, households and work colleagues. "If there is a one in 1000 chance somebody in a supermarket gave it to somebody else, you're not going to use contact-tracing resources to chase every single one of those people," he said.
As contact tracing changes, so will international quarantine rules, with people likely to face different restrictions depending on the country from which they are coming. Home quarantine could be an option for fully vaccinated Australians coming from places with low amounts of COVID-19, said Professor Lewin.
Experts are unified on the continuing importance of masks.
"It may be that we actually have indoor mask-wearing for years in certain settings," NSW's Chief Health Officer Kerry Chant said on Tuesday.
A sudden easing of restrictions in June, including lifting a mandate on masks in public spaces, led to Israel going from single-digit infections to one of the world's highest daily infection rates - nearly 7500.
Professor Nadav Davidovitch, who works at Israel's Ben-Gurion University, said: "Israel wanted this to be over but it wasn't, and this should act as a warning to Australia."
There is also a growing acknowledgement of the importance of ventilation in buildings. Burnet Institute director Brendan Crabb hopes that in a year, carbon-dioxide monitors, which can be used to measure poor ventilation, will be widely used in shared spaces such as schools and restaurants, and the issue rigorously monitored by workplace health and safety teams. "Air quality will have the same level of regulation as water quality," he predicted.
But while the importance of public health measures in our reopening strategy has been broadly recognised, many of the details about exactly what Australians, governments and businesses will be doing to stem the spread of COVID-19 beyond vaccination remain speculative.
For example, will school students have to have a rapid test before they go to school, or if they have a sniffle? "What's the policy there? ... Where is the taskforce? What are these sensible measures?" asked Mr Crabb. "Because everything about our opening is going to depend on how good all that is."
In Britain and the US, residents frequently use rapid tests to keep workplaces and schools open. They can be purchased at corner shops.
Professor Lewin said while antigen tests might be too risky in the current environment of lower vaccine coverage, Australia was likely to follow other countries in adopting rapid tests once the COVID-zero strategy was abandoned.
Like populations across the world, Australians who are vaccinated will have far more freedoms than others and infectious diseases expert Robert Booy says some businesses may even ban those who are unvaccinated.
"The times have changed. People don't want to deal with having people who are coughing and spluttering. Businesses will make their own choices about how they operate," Professor Booy said.
But there is an ethical dilemma about when to decide that everyone has had equal opportunity to access a vaccine and to let the virus wash in.
Professor Booy suggests an appropriate milestone would be when we reach 80 per cent vaccination because people would have had "months and months" to vaccinate.
There remains significant uncertainty about how many deaths Australia might have once the vaccine milestones are reached, reflected in the scenarios in the Doherty modelling.
Although a 70 per cent rate of vaccination for the adult population has been estimated to make lockdowns less likely, there is no guarantee that we'll see the end of them in 2021. "The modelling actually predicts that we could be still spending 20 per cent of time in lockdown at 70 per cent [vaccination]. So that tool is still in the toolbox," said Professor Lewin.
While pubs may be able to fill up again and you can resume hugging your friends without that pang of anxiety at 80 per cent vaccination levels, epidemiologist Tony Blakely says the prospect of a short, sharp lockdown can never be ruled out.
He warns that if the virus crept into an Indigenous community, a pocket of society where thousands of essential workers lived, or a suburb full of unvaccinated families, it could still take off like wildfire.
The divide between the vaccinated and unvaccinated will widen. Outbreaks in suburbs of low vaccination could result in geographical lockdowns to stop local health services being overwhelmed.
In those pockets of society, restaurants and bars might still be closed without notice when outbreaks emerged or limits on numbers re-imposed. Rather than a blanket lockdown, health authorities might choose to ban residents from having visitors to their home and order those in hotspots with low vaccination levels to work from home.
While countries have experienced waves of the virus in the young and unvaccinated, Nancy Baxter of the Melbourne School of Population and Global Health is less concerned about young people being infected and more worried about those who are unable to be vaccinated because they are immuno-compromised.
Young people in Australia had shown a lot of enthusiasm to be vaccinated, Professor Baxter said.
"But people with medical reasons for not being able to be vaccinated have been completely left out of the decisions about when we open up.
"Delta will seek out and find the unvaccinated. It will find that
20 per cent."
Every major pandemic in global history has fundamentally changed society, says epidemiologist James McCaw, whose team has been providing modelling to the federal government throughout this one. "And this pandemic is the biggest we've seen since 1918 in terms of its devastation. It's going to change the world."
Some things won't change. But there will be parts of life that will be left behind, probably considered backward, by a new generation
of Australians.
Today's children will probably think it strange that in 2018 people didn't wear masks when they went to the shopping centre. Soldiering on and going to work with a sniffle is likely to be seen as a "relic of a naive society" and, ideally, hundreds of preventable deaths from the flu in aged care will no longer be accepted as the normal course of things.
"Humans are adaptable," says Professor McCaw, "And I think we'll just get on with life."

Full text: Charting the state’s reopening path, Mr Marshall flagged more targeted border restrictions to exclude people who had been in Covid-19 hot spots but said he wanted to normalise borders once vaccine targets were reached.
He said he hoped to open state borders safely, repeating that health advice stated this could happen by Christmas, once vaccination rates hit 80 per cent.
“If there is a state which has got 1000 cases per day, it doesn’t make much sense to throw open your borders ­because, why introduce it to your state?” Mr Marshall told The Advertiser.
“But I’m strongly of the opinion, and the Doherty model (guiding national reopening) suggests that as we get a higher vaccination rate, we’re going to have a much lower transmission rate, which will mean lower-level infections interstate and they will become more localised.”
Mr Marshall said a nation-first home quarantine trial in South Australia for low-risk travellers might be a game-changer, potentially, reducing isolation periods from 14 days.
Forecasts have shown 70 per cent of SA’s adults older than 16 would be fully vaccinated by November and 80 per cent by December. But ­increased dosage rates suggest the 80 per cent target could be hit by mid-November.
NED-4292-Percentage-of-eligible-population-fully-vaccinated-by-state
National employer association Ai Group chief executive Innes Willox has urged the ­removal of barriers to business travellers and returning Australians, and extending SA’s home quarantine trial.
The Doherty Institute has reiterated to national cabinet that it will be safe to fully ­re-open Australia when 80 per cent of people 16 years and over are fully vaccinated, ­regardless of case numbers.
After a week of back and forth between the federal government and the states and territories over the vaccination levels required to banish lockdowns, national cabinet was given another briefing from Doherty Institute’s modelling scenarios.
National cabinet was told that some public measures such as mask wearing, contact tracing and localised “moderate restrictions” would be necessary at 70 to 80 per cent of vaccination coverage.
Another 882 new cases of Covid-19 were recorded in NSW on Friday and two people died. Victoria announced 79 new locally acquired cases, and the ACT announced 21 new cases.

Full text: The government’s expert ­immunisation panel on Friday gave the green light to the children receiving the Pfizer vaccine, moving the minimum age from 16 to 12. Bookings open from September 13 and will be available through GPs, Aboriginal community-controlled health centres, commonwealth and state-run vaccination centres and school-based programs.
Since the start of the month, vulnerable children in the 12-15 age group, including Indigenous children and those with under­lying health conditions, have been eligible to receive a vaccination.
Health Minister Greg Hunt said the updated advice was an “extremely important” next step in Australia’s vaccination rollout.
Education Minister Alan Tudge said it would give “peace of mind” to kids, parents and teachers as schools in NSW, the ACT and Victoria prepared to reopen.
The government confirmed the Moderna vaccine could also be administered to teenagers if it was registered by the Therapeutic Goods Administration and recommended by the Australian Technical Advisory Group on Immunisation. Despite Pfizer supplies remaining tight, the Morrison government said every family who wanted their adolescent to be vaccinated could do so before the end of the year.
Scott Morrison also flagged there were “promising leads” about doses for the age cohort.
The Prime Minister said the updated advice would make it possible for families to be vaccinated at the same time. “I would see that happening especially through the GP network, and that provides the opportunity for family vaccinations, for the family to go along together across those age groups,” he said.
ATAGI said the benefits of ­offering vaccinations to younger adolescents outweighed known or potential risks. It also said it would help reduce disruption to their education by preventing disease.
“Covid-19 epidemiology in this age group is rapidly evolving, with younger age groups more implicated in transmission in the context of Delta,” it said.
“With older age groups ­increasingly protected by vaccination, a greater proportion of Covid-19 is anticipated to occur in adolescents and children.”
Some premiers had called for children to be included in the vaccination targets that are tied to the staged easing of restrictions across the country. The Doherty Institute’s modelling, which underpins the ­national plan, is based on vaccinations of those 16 and over.
But Mr Morrison said there was no medical advice to include 12 to 15-year-olds in the national targets. “Inclusion in the target does not mean they shouldn’t be vaccinated. The target is about the overall level of vaccination in the adult population, which are the primary transmitters of the virus.”
Of Australians over 16, 33 per cent are fully vaccinated and 56 per cent have received a first dose.

Full text: The state’s health department announced the new local cases just before 8.30am on Friday, which included another 26 mystery infections.
The department said 53 of the 79 new cases could be linked to existing outbreaks.
The department did not say how many cases were in isolation throughout their infectious period, with more detail expected later on Friday

COVID SCARE FOR SUNRISE
Sunrise has been hit with a Covid-19 scare as a crew member tested positive to the virus, forcing newsreader Edwina Bartholomew to self -isolate at home.
Bartholomew is a close contact of the positive case.
Channel 7 confirmed the employee tested positive on Thursday after working at Sunrise’s Martin Place, Sydney offices earlier this week.
The staff member, who is fully vaccinated and doesn’t live in a hotspot, was tested after they were identified as a close contact of another case.
Host Natalie Barr told viewers the offices were undergoing a deep clean and that all staff had been tested.
“Hello and welcome to Friday. A Covid scare of our own overnight, we join you after a staffer tested positive,” she said.
NEW MODELLING ON DEATH RATES
New modelling from the Doherty Institute finds lifting restrictions amid thousands of Covid-19 cases won’t lead to more deaths than waiting for cases to fall.
The updated modelling was given to states and territories ahead of Friday’s national cabinet meeting, where Prime Minister Scott Morrison is expected to hold leaders to easing restrictions at vaccination rates of 70 to 80 per cent, The Australian reported.
The new analysis modelled the number of fatality rates over 180 days based on a range of Covid cases from the tens to the thousands, and found there was no difference in the number of deaths.
6,000 CASES A DAY TO COME IN OCTOBER PEAK
The worst may be yet to come, however, with another study finding daily Covid-19 cases could rise to between 1,500 to 6,000 cases per day by early October under current restrictions.
That could blow out to 40,000 cases per day if restrictions are lifted once 80 per cent of people are vaccinated.
The University of Sydney modelling comes as NSW eases some restrictions for those vaccinated.
Professor Mikhail Prokopenko, Director of the University of Sydney’s Centre for Complex Systems, said more than half a million Australians could catch the virus in the month after restrictions are removed, even with continued testing, tracing, isolation, quarantine and international travel restrictions.
“We can expect to see a rapid increase in cases when we exit the lockdown. In fact, our modelling suggests the worst is yet to come if the restrictions are removed too soon and too abruptly,” he said.
NSW Covid Exposure Sites
RECORD NEW DAILY CASES IN NSW
The dire warning comes as NSW Premier Gladys Berejiklian announced new freedoms for vaccinated families amid a new daily high of 1029 Covid cases and three deaths on Thursday.
Ninety-one were in isolation throughout their infectious period and 33 were in isolation for part of their infectious period.
Sixty-one cases were infectious in the community, and the isolation status of 844 cases remains under investigation.
One of the three deaths was a man aged in his 30s.
Premier Gladys Berejiklian said no one is coming out of lockdown in NSW this weekend.
The regional lockdown has been extended for another couple of weeks to Friday September 10.
She also said that “additional freedoms” will be given to those who are vaccinated from next month.
From 12.01am, Monday, September 13:
· For those who live outside the LGAs of concern, outdoor gatherings of up to five people (including children, all adults must be vaccinated) will be allowed in a person’s LGA or within 5km of home.
· For those who live in the LGAs of concern households with all adults vaccinated will be able to gather outdoors for recreation (including picnics) within the existing rules (for one hour only, outside curfew hours and within 5km of home). This is in addition to the one hour allowed for exercise.
Ms Berejiklian then called on the community and industry to prepare for opening up more widely when NSW hits 70 per cent double dose vaccination of the eligible population.
She said this could be as soon as the middle of October.
“That is when there will be more freedoms,” she said.
NSW Deputy Premier John Barilaro said regional NSW was “sitting on a knife’s edge” and they needed to keep the lockdown on to keep people safe as more get vaccinated.
“It is a tinder box waiting to explode,” he said.
NSW Chief Health Officer Dr Kerry Chant said they have 698 people admitted to hospital and 116 people in intensive care, 43 who require ventilation. The age range is from their 20s through to their 70s.
“So, again, Covid can impact in a very serious way on all age groups, and there is no room for complacency,” she said.
“The vast majority of people – 102 of the 116 people in ICU – are not vaccinated. So, again, please do not delay.
“Access vaccines now. Vaccines are available through pharmacies, GPs, through the booking system, so go online. Please get vaccinated.”

VICTORIA HAS 80 NEW CASES
Victoria recorded 80 new locally acquired Covid-19 cases on Thursday, the highest daily figure of the latest outbreak.
The state’s health department announced the new local cases about 9am, which included another 13 mystery infections.
The department said 67 of the 80 new cases could be linked to existing outbreaks.
But alarmingly only 39 cases – less than half – were in isolation throughout their infectious period, meaning 41 were out in the community.
Victoria’s sixth Covid lockdown is due to end in a week with a call on whether it will be extended drawing ever closer.
Covid-19 commander Jeroen Weimar said it was still possible for contact tracers to get a ring around the outbreak by September 2 but another day over 50 new cases comes as a blow to that hope.
More than 50 new local cases has been recorded on six of the past seven days.
“If we continue to work together, we have pulled six, seven outbreaks now in the last eight months, so collectively as a Victorian community we can absolutely (get a ring around the outbreak),” Mr Weimar said.
It comes as 150,000 bookings to get the Covid vaccine were made on Wednesday at the state government’s mass hubs after the Pfizer jab was finally opened up to Victorians aged 16 to 39.
There are now more than 800 exposure sites in multiple suburbs across metropolitan Melbourne and more than 17,400 people remain in isolation across the state.
There are now 600 active cases across the state, up from 538 on Wednesday.
Covid-19 commander Jeroen Weimar said 114 of the 538 active cases were aged 9 and under, 101 were aged between 10 and 19 years old, and 89 were aged in their 20s.
No new cases were recorded in hotel quarantine on Thursday.

National – 2021 – Covid Vaccination Stats
MORE BLOOD CLOTS LINKED TO AZ
Australia has recorded eight more cases of blood clots linked to the AstraZeneca vaccine.
The Therapeutic Goods Administration Covid-19 vaccine weekly safety report found two ‘confirmed’ cases of thrombosis with thrombocytopenia syndrome or TTS. They were a 34-year-old woman from NSW and a 68-year-old woman from South Australia.
The other cases were also considered “probable” and affected 27 and 69-year-old women from Victoria; 73, 74 and 75-year-old women from NSW; and a 83-year-old man from NSW.
The latest cases of severe blood clots linked to the AstraZeneca vaccine to 116 cases (67 confirmed, 49 probable) from nearly 8.8 million vaccine doses.
The TGA says in Australia, severe cases of TTS appear to be more common in women in younger age groups. Nearly half of the TTS cases in women required treatment in intensive care.
To date, six deaths have resulted from the condition – five of these were in women aged 34, 48 (two cases), 52 and 72. The other death was in a 44-year-old man.
Most cases have happened about two weeks after vaccination.
The TGA advises people should seek immediate medical attention if they develop any of the following symptoms after vaccination:
– severe or persistent headache, blurred vision, confusion or seizures
– shortness of breath, chest pain, leg swelling or persistent abdominal pain
– unusual skin bruising and/or pinpoint round spots beyond the site of vaccination.
The most common time period for onset of TTS symptoms is 4–30 days after vaccination.

Full text: The UK farewelled all Covid restrictions last month with its Freedom Day and the US has ramped up vaccinations with more than 300 million people getting the jab.
Overseas, people are holidaying, attending concerts and sporting events, and masks and social distancing are a thing of the past.
Yet doubt has been cast over Prime Minister Scott Morrison’s four-phase “road map” out of Covid-19, with concerns that opening up too soon would result in higher daily cases, hospitalisations and deaths.
Here’s how Victoria and Australia compares to life in the US, UK and other countries with at least 70 per cent vaccination rates — and what that means for daily Covid cases, hospitalisation and deaths.

VICTORIA Vaccination rate: 31.4 per cent fully vaccinated, 51.8 per cent first dose.
Hospital admissions: 34, nine in ICU
Ventilator cases: 7
Restrictions: Stage 4 lockdown restrictions,including mandatory masks, 5km radius, curfew.

AUSTRALIA Vaccination rate: 30.9 per cent fully vaccinated, 53.6 per cent first dose.
Restrictions: NSW and Victoria under stage 4 lockdown restrictions. Masks mandatory.
ScoMo’s road map to Covid normal is based on Doherty Institute modelling.
Under the national cabinet backed plan, when 70 per cent of people aged 16 years and over are double jabbed, we will enter Phase B “Vaccination Transition Phase”— where restrictions and lockdowns are still possible but less likely.
At 80 per cent, under Phase C “Consolidation”, lockdowns will only be targeted and vaccinated residents will be exempt from domestic restrictions.
New Doherty modelling is expected to be presented to national cabinet on Friday, which will consider the soaring daily case numbers in New South Wales.

UNITED STATES Vaccination rate: 51 per cent fully vaccinated, 60 per cent first dose.
Hospitalisation rate: 77,727 rolling seven day average.
Restrictions: Little to no infection control.
The highly infectious Delta variant is behind the United State’s fourth wave.
A whopping 43,222 new cases were recorded on Monday — with states such as Florida and Texas leading the charge.
Florida had 149,077 new cases and 263 deaths in the last week, while Texas had 117,306 cases and 903 deaths.
Florida was one of the first US jurisdictions to wind back initial restrictions to combat the virus, while cases were still rising, in a bid to return to normal life.
Face masks mandates were lifted and other restrictions disregarded.
Now it’s one of just three US states to hit three million total cases.
If Florida was a country, it would now rank 16th in terms of the most infections in the world.
Fatalities are up 190 per cent to an average of 170 per day.
About 41,000 people in Florida have died since the start of the pandemic.
While the US’s strong vaccination numbers sound impressive — only 51 per cent are fully vaccinated and 60 per cent have received at least one dose.
The rolling seven-day average for US Covid hospitalisations is 77,727 — down almost 40 per cent from the peak average of 123,865 in January, according to Centre of Disease and Prevention Control Covid Data.
Demand for ICU beds has increased, with about one in four intensive care units across the country having at least 95 per cent of beds occupied, according to the New York Times.
Hospitals are also facing a nursing shortage.
UNITED KINGDOM Vaccine rate: 76.9 per cent fully vaccinated, 87.7 per cent first dose.
Hospitalisation: 6441 people
Restrictions: No mandated infection control.
The UK has been living restriction-free since its controversial Freedom Day on July 19.
Masks are not legally required to be worn, social distancing has gone and sporting stadiums and nightclubs can run at full capacity.
More than one month later, daily case numbers have jumped but are not nearly as bad as they were in January.
On Monday the daily cases were 31,914, compared to 68,192 in January.
More than 75 per cent of the adult population is now fully vaccinated, deaths have remained steady and hospitalisations have slightly increased.
A total of 948 people are in hospital with Covid, according to Public Health England figures.
This pales in comparison to the UK’s worst day on January 12 — when restrictions were still in place — which saw 4583 people admitted daily.
Deaths within 28 days of a positive Covid test have decreased significantly since January — down from 1359 to just 14 on Sunday.
Although, the number of people on ventilators has climbed since Freedom Day.
A few days after restrictions were scrapped the number of Covid patients on ventilators increased by 41 per cent to 227, the Guardian reported.
One month later, 928 people are on ventilators.

UNITED ARAB EMIRATES Vaccine rate: 74 per cent fully vaccinated, 10 per cent first dose.
Restrictions : Compulsory mask wearing, social distancing of two metres, hotels can be fully occupied and live entertainment and activities are permitted in restaurants, cafes and shopping malls.
BAHRAIN Vaccine rate: 63 per cent full vaccinated, 67 per cent first dose.
ISRAEL Vaccine rate: 63 per cent fully vaccinated, 5.3 per cent first dose
Hospitalisation: 1124 people in hospital.
Restrictions: Masks indoors, proof of vaccine.
The UAE is among the top 10 vaccinated countries in the world. Along with Israel and Bahrain, it’s in the top three Middle Eastern countries with high vaccination figures.
On Monday there were only 1060 cases in the UAE and four reported deaths.
In Bahrain only 84 cases and one death were reported and in Israel, which has experienced another wave of cases, thanks to the Delta variant, recorded 8586 cases and 26 deaths, on August 23.
Remarkably, the three Middle Eastern countries have high daily testing rates — the UAE’s seven-day rolling average was 300,803 tests.
Much like the UAE, Israel’s daily testing numbers are also high with a rolling seven-day average of 124,933.
Israel, which has a population slightly larger than NSW, reopened completely in June after reaching the 80 per cent mark (inclusive of fully and partially vaccinated people)— a move that has since backfired.
A surprise Covid-19 resurgence saw daily cases soar.
Hospital admissions are up, with 1386 admissions in the last week, up from a mere 18 in June. One hundred and sixty-eight people are in ICU.
Israel is also the first country in the world to administer a third booster shot to the elderly and healthcare workers, after reports some people were still experiencing serious symptoms after two jabs. Bahrain is also offering boosters.
In Israel, masks have been reintroduced indoors and proof of vaccination is required to enter some venues.

Anthony Albanese left exposed by Labor Covid-zero strategy zealots

Full text: The Opposition Leader said Mr McGowan had “kept Western Australia safe” and would not distance himself from Mr McGowan’s goal to have no Covid cases, which is at odds with the aims of the national plan that is informed by modelling from the Doherty Institute.
“I find it quite extraordinary that the Prime Minister has basically described Western Australians and Queenslanders as somehow being cave people wanting to stay in the cave,” Mr Albanese told the ABC.
“The reason why there are restrictions is because of the Prime Minister’s failure to secure enough vaccines, including for Western Australians and Queenslanders, and a failure to build purpose-built quarantine.”
After senior MPs Bill Shorten and Joel Fitzgibbon on Wednesday called for an end to lockdowns when vaccination rates reached 80 per cent, Mr Albanese said Labor backed the reopening plan formulated by national cabinet in July.
Mr Albanese said, under the four-stage plan to normality, there was scope for targeted lockdowns when vaccination rates reached 70 and 80 per cent of the population.
“It has proposals at 70 per cent and 80 per cent. It is, as it is written, there is scope there for lockdowns, but targeted if they’re absolutely necessary,” Mr Albanese said.
“Labor supports the national plan. No one wants to see lockdowns there for one day more than necessary.”
Finance Minister Simon Birmingham conceded targeted lockdowns “in some circumstances” could be used under the national plan when vaccination rates reached 70 to 80 per cent.
“Lockdowns become much less likely and if they do occur you are talking more about particular geographical centres,” Senator Birmingham told the ABC.
A fiery exchange has erupted in Question Time on Wednesday between Health Minister Greg Hunt and Shadow Industrial Relations Minister Tony Burke over the issue of vaccine supply. The heated exchange took place in Parliament after Mr Burke asked the Health Minister why vaccine supply issues were currently taking place in the COVID-19 hotspot of Lakemba.
“Because right now, understandably, people living across Victoria, living across NSW and living across most parts of the country, (when they hear) lockdowns, they think that what we’re talking about, what we are facing is a potential of … a prolonged statewide lockdown.”
Senator Birmingham said there could be commonwealth funding available for victims of lockdowns in stages B and C in the plan, as long as state governments used the measure “in the spirit of the agreement”.
Doherty Institute director Sharon Lewin on Wednesday reiterated her advice that a Covid-zero goal was not sustainable.
“We will still make every effort to stop transmission, but we don’t need to get to that very difficult spot of zero,” Professor Lewin said.
On Tuesday, opposition health spokesman Mark Butler conceded Australians would be living with Covid but he also would not disavow the strategy of Mr McGowan.
“Covid at some point, if it hasn’t already, will become endemic in this nation as it’s likely to in pretty much every other nation on the planet,” Mr Butler said.
In caucus on Tuesday, Mr Albanese accused Mr Morrison of being misleading about the contents of the plan, but some Labor MPs believed Mr Albanese risked walking into a trap set by Mr Morrison and making the party look like it was opposed to reopening.

It's establishing the strategy for managing COVID that matters

Full text: Public health measures are here to stay, no matter what percentage of people are fully immunised. This fact has got lost among the statistical noise and competing modelling.
Australia's path out of the pandemic lockdowns does not mean the end of mask-wearing, social distancing, and QR code check-ins. But it does need a solid plan for living with the virus.
As vaccination rates rise, the federal government wants you to be able to go to the pub once again - but you'll probably have to wear a mask on the train or tram there, and use a check-in app to sign in.
You could book a holiday to the Sunshine Coast or Perth without having to stress about sudden border closures or two weeks in hotel quarantine, but you might need to show proof of vaccination and wear a mask on the flight.
The federal government has committed to using the Doherty Institute's modelling to form the backbone of its four-phase pandemic recovery plan and set vaccination rates the country needs to hit before widespread lockdowns aren't necessary.
Doherty's experts concluded that with 70 per cent of the eligible population aged over 16 vaccinated (that's 56 per cent of the total population), it would be much easier to start living with the virus.
But that does not mean the Doherty Institute, or state or federal governments, want all restrictions removed once that initial target is reached. It doesn't even mean an end to strict lockdowns in rare cases. As the institute said in a statement on Monday, there is no "freedom day".
Any sensible modelling assumes a baseline level of ongoing restrictions.
"It may be that we actually have indoor mask-wearing for years in certain settings," NSW Chief Health Officer Dr Kerry Chant said yesterday. "The world is grappling with how we co-exist with COVID and the virus may throw us curve balls."
People will get sick, and many will still die. The Doherty modelling forecasts a death rate similar to that of the 2010 influenza season.
"Any death is a tragedy, but our health system can cope with this," the institute said.
The key here is the plan. Australian Medical Association president Dr Omar Khorshid said beyond vaccination targets, what really mattered was how well the nation managed the virus like any other infectious disease. Because at 70, 80, or even 90 per cent fully vaccinated, there will still be cases.
Australia needs to be ready, and not just with intensive care beds. It needs plans for rapid testing across hospitals so staff can continue to work despite COVID. Children's health experts say authorities need to work out how to keep children in school next year and make sure they stay safe.
National cabinet is meeting every week, in part to add more flesh to the national transition plan. It's these details that will be the key to our success at managing the virus with fewer lockdowns and border closures, no matter what curveballs the virus throws.

PM’s team stakes all on reopening gambit

Full text: With his leadership authority having eroded for weeks, Morrison has embraced a new stance. It is based on hope, restoring economic activity, insisting that Australia change its mindset to live with the virus and concluding that statewide lockdowns become yesterday’s solutions.
This edifice rests on two assumptions. The first is that 70 to 80 per cent vaccination rates, once achieved, will turn public opinion decisively against lockdowns and the elimination mania that has governed the premiers. And second, that hospital systems can cope with the consequences of opening up given the higher intensive care unit and death rates that will result.
The Morrison government’s future depends on these judgments. The ultimate issue is whether the lockdown power of the premiers will be destroyed by the Delta strand. The political transformation is far advanced in NSW, where Gladys Berejiklian champions vaccination as the path to reopening and attacks as “completely unrealistic” the zero cases stance of other premiers, notably WA’s Mark McGowan.
The immediate political battlefield is Victoria, where Australia’s lockdown titleholder, Daniel Andrews, faces his moment of truth against Delta. As daily numbers rise, Andrews still forecasts his victory but the probability is that Victoria will follow NSW into a protracted and losing lockdown.
If Delta out-muscles Andrews the appeal of lockdowns will face a devastating blow. The Morrison-Frydenberg position that the virus cannot be eliminated will be vindicated in the second most populous state. Andrews, having issued patronising critiques of Berejiklian for weeks, will find himself consigned to a similar fate as NSW.
pk2508
Andrews and Berejiklian, while using lockdowns to try to contain the virus, are strong proponents of the national plan endorsed by the national cabinet last month that envisages a four-stage return to normality with the two big triggers for reopening being 70 per cent and then 80 per cent vaccination rates based on Doherty Institute modelling.
Morrison worked for months to secure this plan in the cause of national consistency. But Morrison and Frydenberg, faced with resistance from McGowan and Queensland’s Annastacia Palaszczuk, decided to put their plan into lights, turn it into a popular national aspiration and use it to sway public opinion from lockdowns to reopening.
There are risks in doing this as the politics vary from state to state. McGowan’s hermit kingdom stance in WA remains popular despite it being, ultimately, an unsustainable fraud. In truth, Morrison and Frydenberg had no other viable option. They must show leadership. Morrison has been seriously damaged by the appallingly slow vaccine rollout and being cast as politically subservient to, and an economic conscript of, the premiers.
Prime Minister Scott Morrison has told premiers the states must prepare to live with the coronavirus.Mr Morrison argued lockdowns can’t last forever but he is already facing pushback from some premiers.National Cabinet agreed to the 70 and 80 per cent vaccine targets that would see lockdowns lifted and borders reopened.
The turning point was Frydenberg’s ABC 7.30 interview last Thursday when he said elimination of Covid was a fallacy, that the nation must live with the virus for “years to come” and accept the “deaths and serious illness” this involved. He warned premiers once the vaccine targets were reached there should be “no expectations” of the same levels of federal financial support if they persisted with the same lockdown strategy.
The next day Morrison called the agreed national plan a “deal with the Australian people” that the premiers had signed. These words reveal the heart of Morrison’s calculation – that at 70 to 80 per cent vaccination levels the public will expect their leaders to deliver more freedom, economic activity and a jobs revival.
On Monday Morrison went harder. He said the plan, based on Doherty Institute advice, meant vaccinating at record pace and changing our mindset to reward the public for its sacrifices. “If not at 70 per cent and 80 per cent, then when?” Morrison asked. “We must make that move. We must prepare the country to make that move.”
Without identifying the recalcitrant premiers or federal Labor, Morrison said “there will be those who seek to undermine the national plan”, adding they were motivated by politics. This sets up a potentially explosive political situation – a nation divided state by state when reopening begins.
There are three problems for the Morrison-Frydenberg strategy. First, opening up from a high number of cases in NSW and maybe Victoria is being used by other premiers demanding a rethink, with McGowan denouncing NSW policies as a failure. In response Morrison said the Doherty Institute would update on this situation but its advice to him was that “the start point does not influence the overall conclusions of the model”.
Successfully eliminating COVID-19 is a “fallacy” and state leaders will have to accept the Doherty Institute’s modelling as the only “sustainable, long-term solution” to the COVID-19 pandemic, says Treasurer Josh Frydenberg. The federal government has partnered with state governments to provide economic support to struggling businesses with employees in NSW and Victoria eligible for COVID disaster payments of up to $750 a week. “Now, that economic support is absolutely vital in the immediate short term in enabling those businesses to survive, and those families to get through the crisis but it is not a sustainable, long-term solution,” Mr Frydenberg said.“The only sustainable, long-term solution to this crisis is that we stick to the plan agreed at National Cabinet. “It is up to the state premiers and to the chief ministers together with the Prime Minister, to stick to the plan that was agreed at National Cabinet because that plan is a pathway out of this crisis. “It’s a fallacy that you can eliminate COVID. You must learn to live with it, just as other countries are doing right now, and just as we in Australia have done so with other infectious diseases.”
In a Monday statement Doherty Institute director Sharon Lewin said reopening with the large case numbers was still valid at 70 to 80 per cent vaccination.
In a separate statement the institute said: “Once we reach 70 per cent vaccine coverage, opening up at tens or hundreds of cases nationally per day is possible; however, we will need vigilant public health interventions with higher caseloads.”
Second, vaccination of young people aged 12 to 15 must still be factored into the agenda overall. And third, the national plan said 70 to 80 per cent easing should occur only when these thresholds were reached at the national level and in each jurisdiction. That’s a double test and this is the catch.
The vaccination rates in the states fluctuate wildly. This will become a devastating reality. The bonus of the NSW lockdown is its huge incentive for vaccination. Surging rates suggest that NSW hits 70 per cent before the end of October and 80 per cent by mid-November – maybe faster – yet Queensland, South Australia and WA will be lagging weeks behind.
Berejiklian won’t wait. She will begin to reopen NSW at 70 per cent. For her, that’s a political imperative. Morrison and Frydenberg, obviously, will have little option but to support her. Yet other premiers will say this violates the letter of the national plan – just wait for the outcry from McGowan and Palaszczuk. But Andrews addressed this reality on Tuesday, saying each state was in a different situation and would make its own decisions.
The Doherty Institute behind the modelling for Australia’s pathway out of the pandemic has confirmed the country can reopen under current caseloads once vaccination thresholds are met.Under the roadmap - which has been agreed to by all chief minister and premiers – once Australia hits the vaccination rates of 70 and 80 per cent, lockdowns and border closures will become a thing of the past. However, some states have been pushing back, arguing the modelling which underpinned the roadmap was done off a caseload of 30 infections and not the 11,000 which are being seen across the country at the moment. Western Australia and Queensland have threatened to go it alone and maintain their hard borders once the vaccination targets are met if case numbers are still high. Prime Minister Scott Morrison has pushed back and said there is no option but to reopen and the roadmap was an agreement to the Australian people and not just to National Cabinet.
The timing of vaccination will determine the timing of reopening, state by state. The politics are certain to be fraught and different among states. If cases are low or zero in WA and Queensland when Berejiklian opens up then the denunciation from McGowan and Palaszczuk is likely to be deafening, claiming Berejiklian threatens the entire nation. Expect a pro-lockdown media to back the populist alarmism.
Yet support for reopening will be strong. Morrison and Frydenberg must lead the country away from a futile hermit island fate. Everything will hinge on the public accepting the rate of hospitalisations and deaths. The transition will be high risk. But Morrison and Frydenberg, living together at the Lodge during the current sittings, have staked their government’s revival on this agenda.

Full text: While the Premier boasted yesterday that the state remained open, with cafes trading and spectators at sport, devastated businesses warned their doors would be forced to close without a pathway out of the pandemic, while families remained separated by border closures.
Ms Palaszczuk could not answer whether Queenslanders could look forward to an interstate holiday this Christmas.
Prime Minister Scott Morrison has ramped up pressure saying Australians want to see the national deal to start easing restrictions from 70 and 80 per cent vaccination milestones delivered.
“We have a plan to get out out of this. We can’t stay in a cave forever,” he said.
But Ms Palaszczuk said Queensland was not in a cave, but would not ruled out pulling out of the Doherty plan to open up Australia.
She said the modelling used was “predicated on 30 cases across Australia, not 13,000”.
“So I’m looking forward to seeing that modelling.”
“At the moment the borders are shut and, you know, we don’t know when they’re going to come out of their current outbreak.”
It is despite the Doherty Institute’s professor Sharon Lewin stating this week that the “advice still holds” and that the Delta strain was taken into account in the modelling.
Queensland restrictions easing
“If you open up with more cases, you reach that peak quicker and you have a greater load on your public health system to make sure that you can slow that, can flatten the curve, essentially. So, the outcome is the same,” she said.
The Premier’s comments provoked a devastated response from the state’s business community, eager for certainty and a way forward.
Queensland Tourism Industry Council chief executive Daniel Gschwind said people deserved a national coherent plan with specifics around what they would and wouldn’t be able to do in the months ahead.
“We’ve lost a vision of the path forward,” he said.
“We’re in the darkness again and that’s maybe the worst aspect.
“We’ve lost hope.
“We need some plain speaking and some basic certainty.”
He said businesses and holidaymakers were in limbo, too afraid to make decisions.
Chamber of Commerce and Industry Queensland senior policy advisor Gus Mandigora said it was “critical” Queensland stick to the agreement secured at national cabinet so businesses could plan for their recovery.
“They also need a forward-looking road map outlining how the Queensland government plans to handle the pandemic in future,” he said.
“Every time states warn of the potential of more snap lockdowns and trading restrictions, businesses and consumer confidence take a hit,” he said.
Queensland Morrison government ministers have lashed the Premier for backing away, saying the state would continue to languish in the vaccine rollout race without something to hope for.
Queensland Vaccine Locator
Employment Minister Stuart Robert said while Queensland’s can watch sport and go to restaurants, livelihoods were being destroyed, workers could not cross borders and tourism businesses were suffering.
“We see families torn apart by not being able to grieve together. That is right now,” he said.
“The Queensland Premier needs to stick to the plan, reopen under less-harsh and truly devastating restrictions once we meet the agreed national cabinet vaccination targets, because until we do so, Queensland isn’t truly open”.
Assistant Minister for Women and Industrial Relations Amanda Stoker said the Premier’s comments were dangerous and encouraging vaccine complacency.
“The national plan is clear: vaccination is the path to stability, confidence and freedom. It’s irresponsible for Queensland Labor to undermine it,” she said.
“I’m under 40 and had my first dose of AstraZeneca without problems – and I encourage everyone to reject Labor’s politics of fear.”
The Doherty Institute released a statement on its modelling describing the 70-80 per cent targets as the “light at the end of the tunnel”.
“It won’t be possible to maintain a situation where there are no cases at all. The focus will shift to keeping the number of people going to hospital and dying at a minimum,” it stated.
“The team of modellers from across Australia led by the Doherty Institute is now working through the implementation issues specific to the states and territories, specific populations and high risk settings.”
Meanwhile, NSW recorded 753 new Covid-19 cases, Victoria added another 50 to its tally and the ACT had a record 30 cases, with all three states in lockdown.

Anthony Albanese in danger of playing losing hand on Covid-19 vaccines

Full text: In gaming parlance, he is betting against the house.
The first strategic mistake was to use the vaccine rollout as a proxy for the failure of the Morrison government.
This may have seemed like a good bet a month ago when the jab rates were at a level that meant that an 80 per cent coverage of the population probably wouldn’t have been achieved until March next year.
But since then the daily rate has tripled, with the end of lockdown horizon now appearing closer to November.
By Albanese’s own standard, the rollout has now become a proxy for the Morrison government’s success, with the likelihood that Australia will eventually overtake the US on vaccination rates.
The Labor leader bet on red and it has come up black.
A second strategic mistake is brewing with ambiguity clouding Labor’s support for the national plan to bringing an end to lockdowns.
Backing in the rights of the States to keep locking down its citizens beyond an 80 per cent vax rate may become an indefensible position.
Yet this is the message that some of his colleagues took out of caucus meeting yesterday.
Albanese is also reported to have lost his nerve during a debate on the Doherty Institute modelling and described the Morrison government’s handling of the vaccination rollout as a “clusterf..k”.
Three of Albanese’s colleagues, including frontbencher Mark Butler, have publicly backed the principle of ending lockdowns after the 80 per cent vaccination rate is reached. So far not Albanese.
The only assumption one can make is that Albanese’s position within the broader Labor movement is too weak to take on the Labor premiers, who have now become pin-up stars for lockdowns.
Morrison’s posture this week reflects a leader who clearly believes the momentum is with him. He has become the proprietor of responsible liberation. But he is also laying odds that his position will be a superior one that only becomes more entrenched as more people get vaccinated and demand their freedoms back.

ACT hits ‘record day’ for Covid-19 cases, with 30 new infections

Full text: Chief Minister Andrew Barr on Tuesday said four people were in hospital and one of them, a 40-year-old woman, was in intensive care.
Only 13 of the 30 new cases were in quarantine for their entire infectious period, while 11 were infectious in the community. Six cases remain under investigation, with more than 400 exposure sites across the ACT.
ACT chief health officer Kerryn Coleman said while the high number of cases might have come as a shock to many Canberrans, it was not necessarily surprising to health authorities.
She said it was a reminder of how fast the Delta strain of the virus could move through the community. “Specifically of these new cases today, I can confirm that out of the 30, 25 can be linked to known cases or ongoing clusters,” Dr Coleman said.
“We know that 21 of the 25 are actually household contacts, and the remaining four come from ­existing clusters.”
She said the woman in intensive care had not been vaccinated and urged those living in the ACT to book an appointment to get immunised.
Mr Barr echoed the call. “The more Canberrans who are vaccinated, the better protected our community will be from the virus and from the decisions of other governments that are beyond the control of the ACT government,” he said.
“Vaccination remains absolutely critical in stopping the spread of the virus and protecting our community.”
He reiterated his desire for the territory to achieve a higher vaccination rate than the 70 to 80 per cent figure flagged by Doherty Institute modelling as a threshold to start easing restrictions.
More than 60 per cent of Canberra adults have now had at least one jab.
Mr Barr said it was too early to speculate on how long the lockdown – which is scheduled to end on September 2 – would last.

‘We haven’t given up’: Queensland Premier Palaszczuk’s swipe at NSW’s handling of Delta outbreak

Full text: The Queensland Premier said she reserved the right to impose lockdowns on her constituents to control future outbreaks, even if 80 per cent of the state’s population was fully vaccinated.
Ms Palaszczuk also defended the approach to go hard and early to suppress virus threats in response to a swipe from the Prime Minister, where he declared “we can’t stay in the cave forever”.
“Have a look out in Queensland at the moment,” the state premier told reporters on Tuesday morning.
“You can go to work, you can go school, you can go and watch sport, you can play community sport, you can go to a restaurant, you can go out.
“We haven’t given up.
“We come out here every day and Queenslanders are doing such a good job in making sure that when we go hard and go fast, people abide by what we’re asking them to do.
“And look where we’re living.”
Ms Berejiklian told ABC’s 7.30 on Monday she would forge ahead with her plan to lift restrictions when NSW reaches 70 per cent of eligible vaccinations, regardless of the number of active cases in the community.
“You do need to see if you can suppress the virus, if you can, and reduce the case numbers but you have to be realistic about it,” she said.
“To have zero cases, no deaths and get to complete vaccination, that is not the real world.”
But Ms Palaszczuk bluntly declared her approach would differ, suggesting her counterpart in the neighbouring state had given up attempting to control soaring case numbers and deaths.
“I don’t think the people in NSW want to give up on trying to get on top of their current outbreak,” she said.
“Look at the number of cases in NSW, Queenslanders don’t want to see those cases.”
The Queensland Premier remained defiant on her approach, despite criticism from Scott Morrison who declared rolling lockdowns were “not sustainable” and that “we have to move forward”.
The Prime Minister is expected to present new modelling from the Doherty Institute to state leaders at national cabinet on Friday, which will outline how the country will fare under 70 per cent vaccine coverage.
The current projections said there would be would will be 2737 infections and 13 deaths in six months across the country when the vaccination rate hits the target of 80 per cent, with “optimal public health measures” and no lockdowns, declaring there would be no “freedom day” or “Covid-zero”.
Instead, with enough vaccination, Covid-19 will become less of a burden on the health system and citizens will learn to live with it like they do influenza.
But Ms Palaszczuk refused to speculate about the findings, accusing the Prime Minister of lacking transparency and reserving the right to lockdown Queensland.
“I haven’t seen the modelling,” she said.
“Apparently the Prime Minister has seen the modelling — share it with us. Don’t just drop it on the Friday morning, how about send it out now so we can all have a look at it.
“If the Prime Minister can get that modelling as quick as he possibly can and get it out to the premiers so we can read it, not on the Friday morning when we get into national cabinet, I think we’d all be better for it.”
In response to Mr Morrison’s comments about the damage imposed by lockdowns, Ms Palaszczuk said she understood how catastrophic stay-at-home orders were for the economy, airline industry, tourism and the business sector more broadly.
“But the reality is, we are in a pandemic,” the Premier said.
Citing previous advice from the Doherty Institute, Ms Palaszczuk said pandemic policy response would still require “some restrictions and lockdowns” even when the vaccination rate reaches 80 per cent.
“That may be specific localities or specific regions so that is nothing new,” she said.
“But that was all predicated on 30 cases across Australia, not 13,000 cases.”

Full text: Some infectious disease specialists believe contact tracing was unable to keep up once 100 to 200 cases were recorded each a day. NSW recorded 818 cases on Monday, with just 47 known to have been isolated for the entirety of their infectious period.
University of Melbourne epidemiologist Tony Blakely said his modelling was based on the assumption that at just five cases contact tracers were able to reach 90 per cent of close contacts within three days.
“We assume that 90 per cent starts to fall as the case numbers go up in our models, that the maximum number of contacts per day is over 200, or 100 in some scenarios,” he said.
Professor Blakely said the Delta variant was moving too quickly for the 1000 contact tracers in NSW.
“Delta is such a pig, it takes away the window we used to have with the Wuhan variant of the virus,” he said. “The person who was infected didn’t start being infectious until day three or four of their infection, but with Delta they can start infecting people 24 hours after they’re infected. It’s reduced that window where they can find someone, throw them into quarantine and they become infectious in quarantine.”
ANU infectious diseases expert Peter Collignon said it was fair to say NSW had moved beyond being able to uncover significant details about each case.
“Once you’ve got more than 100 cases a day it starts getting stretched,” he said.
University of South Australia epidemiologist Adrian Esterman said the days of “gold standard” contact tracing, where investigators reached out to both close contacts and their close contacts after an infection was detected, were long gone.
“The gold standard of contact tracing is to do this double ring where you look at the close contact of the infected person which makes it, say, 10 and their close contacts to get to 100,” he said. “How many contact tracers are you going to need when you have a thousand cases?”

Covid-19 updates: Scott Morrison calls on states, territories to stick to vaccine agreement to open up

Full text: Mr McGowan said the pressure from the Prime Minister for WA and other states to ease border restrictions and abandon lockdowns when vaccination rates hit between 70 and 80 per cent failed to take into account what was happening in the rest of the country.
“This is a time for cool heads. We don’t need rash decision making on the basis of what is occurring in NSW. There is an Australia outside of NSW,” Mr McGowan said, per The Australian.
“Just because the NSW Government has made a mess of it, doesn’t mean the rest of us should suffer.”
Mr Morrison said the country would “stay in the cave forever” if states didn’t commit to moving forward at the agreed upon vaccination thresholds.
But Mr McGowan has noted that the National Cabinet had already agreed that targeted lockdowns would remain even when vaccination rates hit 80 per cent.
“That’s not the plan,” Mr McGowan said, in response to the Prime Minister’s latest comments.
“The plan allows for lockdowns at 70 per cent two-dose vaccinations and 80 per cent two-dose vaccinations. It’s in black and white. People should read the plan.”
Mr McGowan said people in Covid-free states outside of NSW wanted to stay that way.
“We have the freest society, the most successful community of anywhere in the world,” he said.
“I’d prefer not to have lockdowns. I’d prefer not to have Covid. That’s the point.”
‘LIVE WITH THIS VIRUS’
It came as Mr Morrison called on all states and territories to stick to their agreement to open up the nation as Australia hits 70 and 80 per cent vaccination targets and not walk back on commitments made at National Cabinet.
However, Mr Morrison also refused to confirm whether he would withhold federal aid from premiers who kept their borders shut after they’d hit the nominated target of 80 per cent of residents double-dosed.
“Our goal to live with this virus, not to live in fear of it,” the prime minister said Monday.
“It is a plan based on the best possible scientific and medical and economic advice – I would argue the best in the world.
“The plan sets forward (what has to be done) to move forward. You cannot hold back,” he said.
The comments came after opposition leader Anthony Albanese attacked the government on social media, saying, “The wheels are falling off Scott Morrison’s latest plan. Australians deserve clear answers about the pathway out of this mess, not just more spin and blame shifting.”
Mr Morrison rejected the notion that the plan agreed at National Cabinet was not the way out of the pandemic.
“We have been told very clearly that lockdowns, once you push past that level, come at more cost than gain.
“So it puzzles me why anyone would want to go against the plan.”
He said in relation to lockdowns that “this cannot go on forever”.
But Mr Morrison refused to confirm states who locked down or kept their borders shut would not receive federal aid, calling it a “hypothetical” situation.
“I’m committed to the national plan and I think Australians are too … they’ll be expecting that plan to be put in place. So let’ just see what happens,” he said.
His comments come after Chief medical officer Paul Kelly said lessons can be learnt from the UK and Israel as Australia races to vaccinate its way to more freedoms.
Professor Kelly addressed media on Sunday as 891 new locally acquired infections were recorded around the country.
There are 554 Australians in hospital with Covid-19 while there are an estimated 10,223 active cases in the country.
As both new infections and vaccinations soar in Australia, Professor Kelly said there were lessons to be learnt in places such as Israel where outbreaks have surged but hospitalisations and deaths have been limited due to vaccination.
Professor Kelly backed the federal government’s claim that restrictions could lift once key vaccination targets are met, regardless of case numbers.
It comes as national cabinet will this week be given updated modelling from the Doherty Institute’s researchers about how reopening plans will be ­affected by surging case numbers in Victoria and NSW.
NSW was the state with the most Covid-19 hospitalisations but admissions were also beginning to climb in other states.
“They (rising numbers of cases) are starting present to hospital and intensive care are also increasing,” Professor said.
“Particularly in NSW but also in other jurisdictions. This is something we've (hospitals) been planning for, for 18 months, and we know that our hospitals, particularly our intensive care, are ready for this.”
Professor Kelly praised Australians for reaching 52 per cent of people (older than 16) having received at least one dose of the vaccine (10.8 million doses) while 30 per cent (6.2 million) of the same age group are fully vaccinated.
NED-4292-Percentage-of-eligible-population-fully-vaccinated-by-state
Those figures come after Australia gave out 196,000 doses of vaccinations on Saturday.
“1.1 million doses in four days, we're getting close to 2 million a week and it is close to what we are planning to do in the coming weeks,” he said.
“That is extraordinary, thank you have one involved.”
Professor Kelly said lessons could be learnt from the UK and Israel and their experiences with vaccinations and opening up.
Israel has fully vaccinated 80 per cent of its adult population but the country registered 7600 new infections overnight.
NED-4235-Australias-Vaccine-Rollout-Timeline
Some Australian premiers have expressed hesitancy towards lifting restrictions once 70 or 80 per cent of Australian adults are vaccinated, warning the modelling used by national cabinet uses low case numbers in the community.
“Does this need to go back to the drawing board? The answer is absolutely not,” Professor Kelly said.
“The assumption is of course all modelling can be changed and sensitivity analysis, that’s the technical terms for what’s being done by the Doherty Institute, can be relatively easily done.”
Professor Kelly said expectations were always for case numbers to rise as the country opens but stressed the importance of vaccination.
“(There are) lots of lessons; when the UK decided to open up, they did have an increase in cases but not an increase in any great extent in deaths or in hospitalisations or ICU except in some small pockets of the population, particularly in the Midlands, where they had lower than the national average vaccination rates,” he said.
“They have actually done what we are proposing to do at that around 80 per cent rate of vaccination.
“Israel similarly, they recently have seen an increase in cases but the death rates in hospitalisation rates have not increased the great extent.
“We’ve absolutely looked at those (countries) every day and every week and are learning from their experiences.”

Full text: Speaking on Sunday, Steven Miles said the Doherty Institute’s vaccine modelling – which Nation Cabinet has based a four-stage plan for easing restrictions on – was endorsed “before the NSW outbreak” and might not be honoured.
The bombshell announcement came as Prime Minister Scott Morrison conceded a Covid-zero Australia is “highly unlikely”, but that the number of community cases should have no bearing on the plan to ease restrictions.
Despite this, Mr Miles said Queensland had agreed to the national cabinet endorsed plan, which includes isolating lockdowns and reopening borders, before the NSW outbreak.
“We’re not going to get ahead of ourselves. We’re looking to see what’s happening and we’ll adjust our posture accordingly,” he said on Sunday.
“ … We’ve had road maps all along. They are based on the circumstances of the time. Decisions have to be made based on the circumstances of the time.
“For the past 18 months I’ve tried to predict where this pandemic would go, and I’ve almost always been wrong.
“We are committed to the plan, but some facts have changed.”
Mr Morrison told ABC’s Insiders on Sunday morning the country would be able to ‘move out of … an unsustainable situation” when vaccination rates hit 70 and 80 per cent.
“You can’t live with lockdowns forever and at some point you need to make that gear change,” he said.
“Case numbers are not the whole story … but right now we need to make the lockdowns effective, we need to suppress the virus as best we can.”
Queensland recorded no local cases on Sunday, while NSW recorded 830 new infections.
Tensions over the tightened Queensland/ NSW border are mounting, after 55 fines were dished out following a mass protest on Sunday.
More than 2000 people gathered on both sides of the Coolangatta checkpoint, protesting against Covid-19 restrictions and Queensland’s toughest ever border measures which has severely limited cross-border movement.
Mr Miles labelled the protests as “shameful and reckless”.
“I’ve been to a lot of protests, I’ve organised a lot of protests, I love a good protest, but now is not the time for protests, particularly on the border,” he said on Sunday.
“The border is our riskiest place right now. We have to see the situation in NSW the same way we’ve seen the situation in other countries throughout this pandemic.
“By having a protest there, they put the safety of our police at risk, they put their own safety at risk and they put the safety of the community at risk.
“Frankly, I’m pretty disgusted.”
On Saturday, 2715 vehicles were intercepted at the border, and 142 were turned away.
Twelve essential workers were denied entry to Queensland because they were not vaccinated, in line with new protocols introduced last week.

Scott Morrison urges states to stick to deal on Covid-19 lockdowns

Full text: The Prime Minister said the ­national plan, which would terminate lockdowns once vaccination rates hit 80 per cent, was a “deal with Australians” to encourage take-up of the jab.
“You’re taking the instructions. You’re making the sacrifices. You’re getting tested. You’re isolating. You’re getting vaccinated,” Mr Morrison said. “And the ­national plan is a deal with Australians, which says when we achieve those marks of 70 per cent and 80 per cent, there’ll be changes. And I’m committed to that plan.
“And premiers and chief ministers have signed up to that plan, but they haven’t signed up with me. They’ve signed up with the Australian people.”
There have been 16.5 million doses of Covid-19 vaccines administered in Australia, including 1.7 million over the past week.
With NSW and Victoria facing tougher lockdowns, Josh Frydenberg cautioned leaders not to ­expect ongoing federal economic support from once their populations reached the 70-80 per cent vaccination threshold.
West Australian Premier Mark McGowan has reserved the right to continue lockdowns when the vaccination rates are above 80 per cent, while other leaders have given conflicting advice on the path out of Covid.
COVID-19 Australia: Cumulative vaccinations by state
NSW Premier Gladys Berejiklian said she was examining minimal easings of restrictions for September, but that these and further freedoms for October would be outlined next week.
Asked how people would be able to prove their vaccinated ­status – in the event that vaccinated people were given greater freedoms – Ms Berejiklian said her government was developing technology to make it possible. “At the moment you can go through Medicare and verify that you’ve been vaccinated – but NSW is also working on an easy-to-use feature which will be linked into QR codes.”
Victorian Premier Daniel Andrews said the “game-changing” vaccination rate was 80 per cent, at which point he was willing to ease restrictions. “Every leader in the country, regardless of what political party they’re from, is committed to that national plan,” he said.
He said letting the virus rip was not an option and said the “narrative” that Australians could live with the virus was unhelpful.
Prime Minister Scott Morrison says there is “no change to the 70 per cent threshold” advised by the Doherty Institute even as major cities are facing COVID-19 outbreaks and extended lockdowns.“It isn’t 70 per cent and nothing else going on, you still have to be managing COVID in the community at 70 per cent, indeed at 80 per cent,” he said.Mr Morrison said at an 80 per cent vaccination level “you don’t have to have lockdowns” to curtail COVID in the community.“There are other ways of managing things at that level which means you that don’t have to have those lockdowns because they are terribly impactful on the community, people’s mental health, and obviously on the economy,” he said.
Queensland Deputy Premier Steven Miles said the need for lockdowns was “less likely” when 70 to 80 per cent of the population was vaccinated, but could not rule them out completely.
“The modelling is based on a number of assumptions. It was done at a time when transmission in the community was very, very low and that is not the case now,” he said. “We cannot predict the future.”
Mr Andrews and ACT Chief Minister Andrew Barr criticised Mr Morrison for his surprise ­announcement on Thursday that Pfizer vaccines would be available for people aged 16-39 at the end of August. “I wouldn’t be banking on anything being here in two weeks, like I haven’t seen that stock,” Mr ­Andrews said. “Is it even here?”
Mr Morrison said he was awaiting interim advice on opening the vaccination program for 12 to 16-year-olds.
Opposition health spokesman Mark Butler called on Mr Morrison to “set a clear case number ­target for when restrictions are lifted”. “The Doherty Institute modelling does not assume restrictions can be lifted in the way they outline if case numbers are still in the hundreds,” Mr Butler said.
“So what is that number?”

Full text: Greater Sydney’s lockdown has been extended until September 30 after NSW recorded 642 new local cases. Victoria has recorded 55 new local cases, as Premier Daniel Andrews is unable to rule out an extension to Victoria’s lockdown after the state yesterday recorded its highest daily coronavirus case count since last year’s deadly second wave. And The Australian can reveal that NSW bars, restaurants and gyms would reopen to the fully inoculated once vaccination coverage across reaches 70 per cent, under a proposal awaiting sign off from Gladys Berejiklian .
Jess Malcolm 9.00pm Residential aged care patients moved to private hospitals
Residential aged-care patients will be moved to Sydney private hospitals from Monday in a bid to ease pressure on the health system and redistribute public health resources.
St Vincent’s Private Hospital, in Sydney’s eastern suburbs, has told The Daily Telegraph it has been advised by NSW Health it needs to administer residential aged care residents from “multiple areas”.
Some of these residents could include Covid-19 positive patients, and it was not clear which local government areas residents would be coming from.
One staff member told the Daily Telegraph the residents were being referred to as “Scovid cases” indicating that they had suspected Covid.
“Staff are nervous because they’ve fought 18 months to keep Covid out of SVPH,” the staff member said.
“We’ve been taking up public patients from St Vincent’s Public next door to free up their beds in the ICU.”
It is understood St Vincent’s Private Hospital is one of 19 other operators who will provide accommodation.

The Victorian government will receive advice on further restrictions tomorrow as ministers and public health officials consider putting the entire state in lockdown.
A Victorian government spokeswoman confirmed “all options are on the table” and said all regional community sporting leagues had been asked to cancel their activities this weekend.
“The situation in Melbourne and across regional Victoria is extremely concerning,” she said.
“Advice will be provided to government tomorrow morning and all options are on the table.
“In the interests of not contributing to any further spread of the virus, all community sporting leagues across regional Victoria are asked to immediately cancel their activities for this weekend.
“A further update will be provided tomorrow.”

Jess Malcolm 7.00pm: ‘Curfew will make policing easier’: Elliott
NSW Police Minister David Elliott says new curfew rules enforced in hotspot LGAs from Monday will make policing “a lot easier”, and help clamp down on high rates of household transmission.
Twelve LGAs under concern will be subjected to a 9pm to 5am curfew from Monday as authorities battle to improve compliance to the public health orders.
Mr Elliott said that while he would prefer people had more freedom, police needed extra powers to restrict movement.
“There’s no silver bullet when it comes to responding to the virus, but the police have said to me that this will make policing a lot easier particularly given in those LGAs, a lot of the transmission is occurring because people ignored the house to house visitors,” he told Sky News.
Mr Elliott also blasted fraudulent scammers who charged people for vaccination appointments meant for healthcare workers.
“We are hitting a new low in this country if people think they can sell vaccinations that are meant for nurses.”
Jess Malcolm 6.00pm: Man who planned anti-lockdown protest jailed
A 29-year-old man has been sentenced to eight months prison for his involvement in organising an unauthorised protest, and multiple breaches of the public health order.
NSW Police released a statement following the man’s appearance at Hornsby Local Court today.
“He was arrested following an investigation by detectives from North Shore Police Area Command into breaches of Public Health Orders, including travelling from Queensland to Sydney and his involvement in planning an unauthorised protest for this weekend,” it read.
“(He) pleaded guilty to four counts of not comply with noticed direction re s 7/8/9 – COVID-19, encourage the commission of crimes, and false representation resulting in police investigation.”
The man was sentenced to a maximum eight months in prison with a non-parole period of three months.
Remy Varga 4.56pm: Shepparton outbreak grows again to 12 new cases
Another five cases have been confirmed in the regional Victorian town of Shepparton, around 190km north of Melbourne, bringing the total detected on Friday to 12.
In a statement, Goulburn Valley Health chief executive Matt Sharp said the immediate and extended family of a man in his 30s had tested positive for Covid-19.
“There are now an additional 11 people that have tested positive for Covid-19 today bringing the total of the outbreak in Shepparton to 12 at this time,” he said.
“All people that have tested positive are family members from two separate households and are now isolating.”
Paige Taylor 4.32pm: WA residents in NSW: get home or get locked out
West Australians in New South Wales have five days to come home before they are locked out of their own state.
The McGowan government has for weeks limited the circumstances in which West Australians in NSW can return but at a press conference in Perth on Friday afternoon, premier Mark McGowan said he would further tighten the rules.
“The window is closing,” he said.
Mr McGowan said that from 12.01am on Thursday, his government would continue to allow defence personnel and a limited number of Commonwealth and state officials to travel into WA from NSW if they are prepared to self isolate and if they meet other criteria including returning a negative Covid-19 test. However, West Australians in NSW who want to return home must now meet the criteria for what Mr McGowan called “the most exceptional or extraordinary circumstances”. Any decision to allow a West Australian to come home from NSW after Wednesday would be made at the highest levels of WA Police Force and WA Health, he said.
While 50 contract tracers are already working remotely on the NSW outbreak, Mr McGowan said WA also wanted to help NSW’s health system by providing doctors and nurses if necessary.
He continued to criticise the Berejiklian government’s response to the outbreak.
“If they put the right things in place back in June I suspect they would be out of it by now but they didn’t,” he said.
“It is so frustrating to watch.
“They always put in place half measures they don’t go all the way and with Covid you have to go all the way
for some reason NSW always takes half measures and it doesn’t work.”
Remy Varga 4.23pm: Crisis meeting to discuss tougher Vic lockdown
Victoria’s crisis cabinet will meet at 4.30pm today to discuss further strengthening Melbourne’s hard lockdown.
The Australian understands a statewide lockdown, further limits on exercise and time allowed outdoors, restrictions on childcare and the full standing down of the construction industry are being discussed.
Jack Paynter 4.15pm: 10.5m eligible Aussies have had at least one jab
Over 10.5 million people have now had at least one dose of Covid-19 vaccine, and nearly 6 million Australians are fully vaccinated.
This marks 51 per cent of Australians half-vaccinated, and 28.9 per cent fully vaccinated.
NSW continues to lead the way with 5,639,016 doses given with 120,581 completed in the last 24 hours, followed by Victoria with 4,264,873 vaccines given.
ACT has the highest first dose vaccine coverage, followed by NSW, Tasmania, the Northern Territory, Victoria, South Australia, Queensland and lastly West Australia.
A total of 693,200 vaccines have been administered in aged and disability facilities, with 10,104 given in the past 24 hours.

Jack Paynter 3.55pm: Chant fights tears, speaks on resignation rumours
NSW chief health officer Kerry Chant choked back tears on Friday as she announced another four Covid deaths in NSW before breaking her silence on resignation rumours.
The NSW chief health officer teared up and appeared to stumble over her words as she gave her update just after 11am on Friday.
Dr Chant extended her sincere condolences and sympathies to the loved ones of those who died.
“I do not want to be standing here every day, announcing these high rates of hospitalisations and these deaths. Every one of these deaths is someone’s mother, father, grandmother, grandfather,” she said as she choked back tears.
“I am asking everyone to hang with us for the next four to six weeks. Buckle down. I do not want to be standing here every day announcing deaths.
Dr Chant also said she had not threatened to resign during Sydney’s outbreak.
“I am so committed to seeing this outbreak behind us, I am so committed to doing all I can as part of a broader team across health and across government.”
The number of Covid-related deaths in NSW since June 16 now stands at 65, while 121 lives have been lost in the state since the start of the pandemic.

Jess Malcolm 3.50pm: 1400 police ready for illegal anti-lockdown protests
More than 1400 NSW Police officers will be deployed across Sydney to disrupt illegal anti-lockdown protests planned for the weekend.
The major police operation will include officers from the public order and riot squad, operations support group, dog and mounted unit, traffic and highway patrol, police transport command and police air.
Protesters should expect a significant “highly visible and agile” police presence in the CBD and surrounds, as well as on major roadways, public transport networks and Sydney Harbour.
NSW Police continue to monitor commentary about protest events planned for regional NSW, and will deploy officers if needed.
Jess Malcolm 3.20pm: New Zealand extends lockdown, 11 new cases

Debbie Schipp 2.35pm: Bunnings to close stores across all Greater Sydney
Bunnings stores will be closed to all but trade customers across Sydney from Monday in response to today’s tougher lockdown measures.
The hardware store and other major retailers are being forced to close their doors and offer only click and collect in 12 hotspot LGA’s under the harsher restrictions, but news.com.au reports Bunnings will go a step further from Monday, August 23.
It will apply the new rules in all of its stores in Greater Sydney.
Trade customers will continue to have access Bunnings stores. But retail customers will only be able to purchase items online using click and deliver and contactless drive and collect, said Mike Schneider, Bunnings manager director.

Remy Varga 1.58pm: ‘Real game changing’ vax number is 80pc: Andrews
Victorian Premier Daniel Andrews says the “real game changing” proportion of the population that needs to be vaccinated before restrictions ease is 80 per cent.
His comments follow reports NSW counterpart Gladys Berejiklian is considering allowing bars restaurants and gyms to reopen to the fully vaccinated once coverage across NSW reaches 70 per cent.
Mr Andrews said under the plan agreed upon by national cabinet, some freedoms return at 70 per cent but the real game changing number was 80 per cent.
“Every leader in the country, regardless of what political party they’re from, is committed to that national plan,” he said.
“There are some changes at 70 but the big changes come at 80 per cent.”
Mr Andrews said letting the virus rip was not an option and said the “narrative” that we can live with the virus was unhelpful.
“if you don’t have these restrictions, it will run wild and not enough people are vaccinated, and then the hospitals will be absolutely full to the rafters with people,” he said.
“This notion that it’s just all well we just, you know, suck it up and we should live with it... No. That’s not an option.”

Nicholas Jensen 1.46pm: TGA approves new Covid treatment for infected Aussies
The Therapeutic Goods Administration has granted provisional approval to the antibody drug Sotrovimab, allowing Australians at risk of hospitalisation to access the treatment before progressing to severe infection from Covid-19.
The approval comes after the federal government ­secured a shipment of 7700 doses earlier this month, with Health Minister Greg Hunt saying it would provide effective treatment against hospitalisation in mild to moderate Covid-19 cases.
“This treatment will provide another tool in the ongoing challenge against Covid-19, in addition to the vaccines … but it is not a silver bullet. ”
The new treatment, manufactured by drug giant GlaxoSmithKline, is administered via IV infusion to ­patients who do not require oxygen and who are at risk of progressing to severe disease.
After proving 85 per cent effective in reducing hospitalisations in its initial phase of clinical trials, Sotrovimab has been approved in Bahrain, Kuwait, Qatar, Singapore and the United Arab Emirates.
Chief health officer Paul Kelly said the treatment is “not for everybody ... It will be mostly aimed at people that are not vaccinated and people who are at highest risk of severe disease”.
Alongside the monoclonal antibody treatment Regeneron, Sotrovimab is considered one of the most effective therapies in pinpointing antigens and fighting off ­Covid-19 infection.

Remy Varga 1.36pm: Andrews blasts PM’s Pfizer plan for 16-39 year-olds
Victorian Premier Daniel Andrews has cast doubt on the Prime Minister’s ability to deliver Pfizer to those aged between 16 and 39.
Mr Andrews said he hadn’t seen any of the additional Pfizer supplies and said he wouldn’t cancel any appointments for AstraZeneca.
“I wouldn’t be banking on anything being here in two weeks, like I haven’t seen that stock,” he said.
“Is it even here? I hope that by the end of the month 18 to 39-year-olds can get Pfizer. I don’t know whether they’ll be able to.”
Mr Andrews said he wasn’t informed ahead of the announcement and urged people to honour their appointments for AZ.

Max Maddison 1.20pm: PM warns premiers to ‘live up to agreed jab plans’
Scott Morrison has thrown his support behind NSW Premier Gladys Berejiklian’s decision to enforce more draconian restrictions across Greater Sydney, as he warns states he expects them to “live up to the plans they’ve agreed to”.
“There are further restrictions that have been placed in NSW as they seek to make the lockdown work. It’s very important that the lockdown works. Very important the lockdown works,” Mr Morrison told journalists on Friday morning.
“Of course there are additional vaccines that have been rolling in this week … but that doesn’t take away from the necessity of the lockdown working. Those measures will add further to that.”
He also sought to address concerns West Australia Premier Mark McGowan may break his agreement to follow the national roadmap to reopening, after Josh Frydenberg warned city and state-wide economic support wouldn’t be forthcoming once vaccination thresholds were reached
“I expect the states and territories to live up to the plan they’ve agreed to. That’s what I expect them to do,” he said.

Paige Taylor 1.07pm: NSW outbreak reaches tiny Aboriginal community
The Covid-19 outbreak in western New South Wales has spread within 20km of the Queensland border to the tiny Aboriginal community of Goodooga. Two Aboriginal people in Goodooga are among the new cases announced on Friday morning at a press conference on the emergency response to the growing crisis. One of the people with Covid-19 in Goodooga has been deemed to have been infectious while in the community. Goodooga is a township of 247 people. Of those, 183 were Indigenous at the last Census in 2016.
The western NSW outbreak has now climbed to 194 cases, with one patient on a ventilator in intensive care at Dubbo hospital for the past two days.
Half of all people infected are under 30 years old and 65 per cent are Aboriginal, according to Western NSW local health district chief executive Scott McLachlan.
Most of the new cases - 21 - were in Dubbo and the majority were not infectious before they were isolated, Mr McLachlan said. There were two also new cases in Bourke and two new cases in Gilgandra.

Lydia Lynch 12.51pm: Police seize large drug stash during Covid border check
Queensland police have seized a large stash of crystal methamphetamine during a routine coronavirus border check.
A 40-year-old man was charged after being pulled over in his car at a border checkpoint on the Gold Coast on Tuesday morning.
Police allege the Hope Island man was driving while high and had 236.4 grams of a substance suspected of being crystal methamphetamine hidden behind carpet on the passenger side footwell as well as $1800 cash in the dashboard.
The man was charged with possessing drugs, proceeds of drug crime and drug utensils and was due to appear in the Southport Magistrates Court on Friday.
Deputy Police Commissioner Steve Gollschewski said people had continued to try and smuggle drugs across the border “periodically” throughout the pandemic.
“Probably not the wisest thing to do when you have got checkpoints manned by police,” he said.
“It clearly wasn’t successful.”
Max Maddison 12.30pm: ACT records 12 new cases
The ACT has recorded 12 new infections, with 11 linked to known cases.
Chief Minister Andrew Barr announced the third day of falling case numbers on Friday, with one of the 12 cases currently under investigation. He said 20,372 people in the territory were currently in isolation.
Of the 94 cases, 87 are linked to known outbreaks. One person is in hospital.
Remy Varga 12.25pm: Longer lockdown not ruled out: Andrews
Victorian Premier Daniel Andrews has refused to rule out introducing tougher restrictions, saying compliance with lockdown was the only way to crush the Delta outbreak.
Mr Andrews declared it a “bad day” for Victoria, with 30 cases infectious in the community.
“I have no restriction announcements to make, no rule changes to make today,” he said.
“But I can’t rule that out.”
Remy Varga 12.20pm: Andrews: people will die if lockdown breached
Victorian Premier Daniel Andrews has issued a stern warning to people to follow lockdown, saying the state could not risk a repeat of last weekend.
Mr Andrews said cases would explode, people would die and Melbourne would turn into Sydney if people did not follow the rules.
“It’s not a tipping point, like we are right on the edge of this getting away from us,” he said.
Mr Andrews said he would not rule out strengthening restrictions in regional Victoria after a case was confirmed in Shepparton.
Nicholas Jensen 12.10pm: Berejiklian: We’re in uncharted territory
Gladys Berejiklian has again called on other state and territory leaders to learn from the NSW outbreak, saying “eventually we will all need to open up”.
New South Wales Premier Gladys Berejiklian says she will extend Sydney’s lockdown until the end of September as the state records 644 cases. “Yesterday in New South Wales to 642 cases of community transmission at least 41 of those, and this number will go up as we further finalise the cases, at least 41 were infectious in the community during this time,” she said. Ms Berejiklian said the lockdown will be formally extended to September 30 from Monday midnight but Shellharbour and the Central Coast will be classified as regional. “I also want to stress that from Monday midnight, unless you’re exercising, masks should be worn outdoors everywhere across New South Wales,” she said. Ms Berejiklian said a curfew would also apply from Monday midnight but would be localised to the LGAs with the highest transmission of COVID-19.
“Delta is uncharted territory for Australia, and I’d like it if you speak to a few other state leaders and first ministers today, because they will tell you how difficult it is to keep the lid on it.”
Defending her government’s approach to the lockdown, Ms Berejiklian said NSW continues to “respond quickly to the advice, but we have also learned a lot”.
“I think the learnings on NSW can be applied to other states when they go through what all states will have to go through … to come to terms with the fact that eventually, you need to provide freedoms to your citizens, eventually we need to open up to the rest of the world.”
Nicholas Jensen 12.00pm: NSW police chief: Wish I’d enacted curfew earlier
NSW Police Commissioner Mick Fuller has told reporters he wished he enacted the curfew on 12 LGAs of concern earlier in the outbreak.
“In hindsight, I wish that I raised curfew day one, but you probably would have laughed me out,” he said.
“There has been a progressive lockdown based on the numbers, based on whether we think there is compliance in areas and the spread of the virus,” he said.
However, Ms Berejiklian said the evidence that curfews are an effective tool against transmission remains unclear.
“While the evidence of curfews is mixed … I do not want us to have a look back and say we did not try, we do not put everything into.”
Dr Chant said the evidence for curfews was not strong, but stressed it may assist in changing people’s attitudes.
Nicholas Jensen 11.55am: Residential properties ‘can be locked down’ Fuller
NSW Police Commissioner Mick Fuller said authorities will continue to crackdown on residents who break public health orders, focusing on those who choose to leave one of the 12 LGAs of concern.
“If someone enters an LGA of concern without excuse, not only will they be fined, they will be sent home and they will have to self isolate for 14 days,” he said.
Commissioner Fuller said the new powers given to the NSW Police will allow authorities to declare and lockdown a residential property “at risk”. He cited a case in Maroubra which led to eight infections following an illegal party.
“This is all about stopping the transmission of the virus from the areas of concern, those 12 LGA’s to the rest of Greater Sydney and certainly regional NSW. The police commission now has powers at residential premises that pose a Covid risk.”
Commissioner Fuller said new residential visits will not just make sure people comply with the health orders, but allow police and defence to “come across people who are gravely ill”.
Dr Kerry Chant said NSW Health supports the new powers given to the Police.
Remy Varga 11.45am: Positive case detected 190km from Melbourne
A positive Covid-19 case has been confirmed in the regional city of Shepparton, about 190km north of Melbourne.
Goulburn Valley Health chief executive Matt Sharp said the person was isolating at home and any close contacts would be alerted shortly.
“Contact tracing is underway and will continue as a primary focus of GV Health‘s Local Public Health Unit,” he said.
“Further details regarding any community locations of concern will be provided once this information is known and if it represents a concern.”
Regional Victoria is not in lockdown.
Remy Varga 11.40am: Andrews to provide update at 12pm
Victorian Premier Daniel Andrews will provide an update on the state’s Covid-19 situation at 12pm.
He will be accompanied by Health Minister Martin Foley, acting chief health officer Ben Cowie and logistics chief Ben Cowie.
Nicholas Jensen 11.35am: Five new cases in far west of NSW
Deputy Premier John Barilaro said five new cases had been reported in the state’s far west, including three in Wilcannia and two more in Broken Hill, while the central coast detected three cases in the Hunter New England local health district.
“Our focus and a message to the people of the central west, especially Dubbo, is to get tested if you have got symptoms to stay home … We saw how this escalated into Sydney, which allowed escalators in places like Victoria and the ACT, the basis for regional and rural NSW is to continue to get tested and more importantly get vaccinated.”
The state’s north coast had an additional case overnight in South Kempsey, which was a close contact to a previous case.
Nicholas Jensen 11.30am: Majority of patients in ICU unvaccinated
Deputy Chief Officer Kerry Chant said there were four deaths recorded in the last 24 hours, including a woman in her 80s from Sydney’s inner west, a man in his 70s from south-east Sydney, a man in his 80s from western Sydney and a woman in her 80s from south-west Sydney.
NSW Health confirmed there are currently 470 cases in hospital, with 80 patients in ICU. Dr Chat confirmed the vast majority of cases are not vaccinated.
“I am urging everyone, particularly those who have had the AstraZeneca vaccine, if you have had it within four weeks, bring your doctor and get an appointment.”
“Can I indicate that I understand that this is going to be so hard for everyone across New South Wales for the next 4-6 weeks. But I do not want to be standing here every day, announcing these high rates of hospitalisations and these deaths”
Nicholas Jensen 11.20am: Curfew ‘to break chains of transmission’
Gladys Berejilikan said her government considered advice from police yesterday and decided to implement a 9pm to 5am curfew to help break chains of transmission across the region.
“Police will be stopping everybody who’s leaving their home from 9pm to 5am, and again this is based on police feedback received in the last few days about the type of activity that’s unfortunately being carried out by a small number of people.”
“I apologise deeply, to the vast majority of people in those communities for doing the right thing, but for our own health and safety we need to make these difficult decisions,” she said
Ms Berejiklian also said that residents in the 12 LGAs of concern must limit their exercise to one hour a day.
Nicholas Jensen 11.15am: Curfew announced for 12 hotspot LGAs
NSW Premier Gladys Berejiklian said rising case numbers had given her no choice but introduce a curfew in the 12 LGAs of concern as well as extending the Greater Sydney lockdown.
“From Monday at midnight, the Greater Sydney lockdown will extend until the end of September. I also want to state that the Central Coast and Shellharbour will be defined as regional.”
Ms Berejiklian said this will include all those areas that are currently in lockdown in Greater Sydney, except the Central Coast and Shellharbour.
Ms Berejikilian announced there would also be a curfew introduced in the LGAs of concern which will run from 9pm until 5am.
From Monday midnight, unless you are exercising, masks must also be worn outdoors at all times across NSW.
Nicholas Jensen 11am: Lockdown extended as NSW records 642 cases
Greater Sydney’s lockdown has been extended until September 30 after NSW recorded 642 locally acquired cases of Covid-19, with at least 41 people infectious in the community.
There were four deaths recorded in the last 24 hours; two women in their 80s a man in his 80s and a man in his 70s.
Premier Gladys Berejiklian said the south west and western Sydney remain the key areas of concern.
There were over 132,000 vaccinations conducted across the state yesterday, reaching 5.6m jabs in NSW, with 29 per cent of the population fully vaccinated.
Lydia Lynch 10.55am: Mandatory vax possible for travellers to Qld
Queensland’s Chief Health Officer has left the door open for mandatory vaccination for interstate travellers when the state’s border reopens.
From Friday, all essential workers from NSW must have at least one jab to enter Queensland.
Asked if it was likely this would be extended for all arrivals once the borders reopened, Dr Jeannette Young said it was “possible”.
Queensland has begun tightening eligibility requirements for those crossing state lines for work with thousands continuing to arrive from NSW every day.
Medical professionals, agriculture workers and those building critical infrastructure will still be allowed into the state is there is no staff in Queensland able to do the job.
“The more people we have crossing the border the more chance one of them, and it only takes one, has Covid,” Dr Young said.
“The aim here is to just slow the movement across the border.”
Nicholas Jensen 10.46am: SA eases restrictions, opens border to NT, regional Qld
South Australia has softened its border rules for the Northern Territory and regional Queensland, after the state’s transition committee met this morning to consider the easing of restrictions.
Health officials have advised that home gatherings can now be raised from ten to 20 people, function centres can host 150 people and stand up drinking is allowed at private gatherings if there is 1 person per 2 square metres.
Travellers from south-east Queensland, including Brisbane, will also be permitted to enter, after they undertake a test and isolate until they return a negative result. However, residents from Katherine will not be allowed to cross the border.
The state’s borders remain closed to NSW, Victoria and the ACT.
Last week, the SA government declined to ease any restrictions after a case travelled through the far west of NSW while infectious in recent days.
Health officials remain on high alert following the detection of a Covid-19 case in Broken Hill.
Nicholas Jensen 10.15am: Tasmania premier to release lockdown plan
Despite recording zero cases of Covid-19, Tasmanian Premier Peter Gutwein says his government will release a lockdown plan to residents, explaining what will occur if a statewide lockdown is imposed.
“I haven’t sugar coated the information around the challenges that we face at any time over the last 18 months,” the Premier told a press conference this morning.
“Today we’ll be releasing additional information to help Tasmanians understand what will occur should a lockdown be necessary in the state … What we’re doing is putting in a plan to indicate to people what will occur (if we go into lockdown).”
Mr Gutwein stressed this did not mean there would be a lockdown, but said the example of other jurisdictions shows that it is crucial “to get on top of this as quickly as possible”.
“Our intention is to go in as hard as we possibly can, and to be in a lockdown for three to five days.”
It is understood the lockdown plan details restrictions on businesses, gatherings in homes, access to aged care facilities and hospitals, as well as the use of face masks and social distancing.
Mr Gutwein said there is no “magic number” to trigger a lockdown and how long the lockdown will last.

Lydia Lynch 10.10am: Qld child tests positive after 4 negative tests
One new local case was confirmed in Queensland on Friday.
The child was in home quarantine for their entire infectious period after being named as a close contact.
They tested negative four times during their quarantine stay, but serology testing confirmed they did have the virus and had since recovered.
Deputy Premier Steven Miles said 127 defence force members from the navy, army and airforce would begin patrolling the Queensland/NSW border on Wednesday.
Max Maddison 9.55am: Covid zero means zero travel: Porter
Industry, Science and Technology Minister Christian Porter says Australians have a right to travel “without threat”, as West Australia Premier Mark McGowan moves to completely cut off his state from NSW.
Mr McGowan has flagged he will continue to reserve his right to close the state’s border and lockdown in the pursuit of zero infections, even once the nation reached the thresholds outlined by the Doherty Institute, but Mr Porter said leaders needed to accept the virus would be around for years.
“It’s conceivable, I guess, that in some kind of geographical area, whether it’s a state or territory or an island or whatever it might be that you can potentially get close to zero Covid. But that would mean also getting very close to zero travel,” Mr Porter told Sky News on Friday morning.
“Australians have a right to travel. I think they want to travel. And I think that in the long run, what we have to do is structure an Australian society where people are able to travel,” he later added.
“Our federation, state to state, territory was built upon the simple premise that Australians, whether you’re a West Australian or a South Australian from Victoria, you are able to leave their state and return to their state without threat, and that is a founding principle.”
With the world reopening rapidly, Mr Porter said jurisdictions like WA would soon be forced to live with the emotional and economic consequences of zero Covid, if they decided to pursue an eradication strategy.
“Businesses suffer, the tourism industry gets completely destroyed in any jurisdiction that decides that they’re going to try and get close to Covid zero over the next decade,” Mr Porter said.

Stephen Rice 9.50am: Lockdown protest organiser Khallouf charged
One of the activists behind last month’s violent anti-lockdown march has been charged with breaching Public Health Orders after The Australian revealed earlier this week he had slipped into Sydney to organise a planned illegal rally on Saturday.
Anthony Khallouf, the founder of Australians vs The Agenda, arrived in Sydney on Sunday after driving from Queensland in breach of travel restrictions, and spent two days moving around the city in disregard of public health orders.
Mr Khallouf had booked into View Sydney, a luxury four-star hotel in North Sydney with expansive views overlooking Sydney harbour and the city.
Detectives from North Shore Police Area Command went to the hotel on Wednesday morning, only to discover Mr Khallouf had left.
On Wednesday afternoon Mr Khallouf live-streamed a brief call for help to his supporters on social media, saying: “I need everybody to call the NSW police right now and tell them there’s a threat to my life.”

Remy Varga 9.40am: New alert over Melbourne vaccination hub
A vaccination hub in the Melbourne suburb Frankston has been declared an exposure site but has not been listed on the Victorian government’s website.
According to Peninsula Health, an asymptomatic person received a Covid-19 vaccine at the Frankston Community Vaccination Hub at Bayside Centre on Monday before testing positive on Thursday.
“Due to the positive case attending the venue earlier this week, the Frankston Community Vaccination Hub has been deemed a Tier Two Exposure site,” a spokesperson said.
“If you attended the venue between the times of 11.30am and 12.45pm on Monday August 16, please get tested as soon as possible and isolate until you receive a negative result.”
Nicholas Jensen 9.30am: NZ cases spread to capital
New Zealand health authorities are bracing for more cases of Covid-19 today, following fears the outbreak has spread from Auckland to Wellington.
On Thursday New Zealand reported 11 local cases of the Delta variant, taking the number of total active cases to 21.
The New Zealand Herald is reporting there are now at least 30 local cases, with more details to be revealed later this afternoon.
It is understood at least two cases have been detected in Wellington, while authorities consider a lockdown extension, which is due to end on Tuesday.
Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern said genomic sequencing confirmed the Auckland outbreak was linked back to the NSW outbreak, after a traveller returned from Sydney earlier this month.

Remy Varga 9.20am: Vic exposure sites grow
Supermarkets, a McDonalds and a pizza restaurant are among new exposure sites in Melbourne as the number of possible sites of transmission increased to 536 overnight.
Victoria’s Health Department has declared the following sites tier two exposure sites, meaning anyone who visited the sites during the potential exposure period must urgently undergo testing and isolate until they receive a result
They are:
Coles Broadmeadows 10:05am - 10:55am on 17/08/2021
Jack Roper Reserve Broadmeadows 3:30pm - 4:25pm 13/08/2021

Nicholas Jensen 9.00am: Families forced into iso as exposed teacher refuses test
More than 40 families in Melbourne have been forced back into mandatory quarantine, after a teacher refused to undertake a Covid-19 test.
The Herald Sun is reporting a Glenroy kindergarten teacher refused a test despite potentially being exposed to the virus.
According to reports, about 50 families linked to the York St Kindergarten, located in Glenroy West, will now be forced to complete another two-weeks of mandatory quarantine because of the refusal.
However, the teacher, who attended the kindergarten between August 6 and August 12, will not face any penalties because it is not illegal to refuse a test.
Premier Daniel Andrews said getting a test was the “least you can do” to stop the spread of the virus.
“If you’re asked to test because there’s a sense you may have the virus, and we want to rule you out … I don’t think that’s such a big ask,” he said.
Remy Varga 8.50am: Victoria records 55 new local cases
Victoria has recorded 55 new local cases in the 24 hours to Thursday night, of which 30 were in the community for at least part of their infectious period.
Of Friday’s cases, 49 are linked to known outbreaks.
Max Maddison 8.45am: Decision on jabs for 12-15 yr olds ‘next week’
Health Minister Greg Hunt says he expects the country’s expert panel on immunisation to decide on opening up Covid-19 vaccinations to 12-15-year-olds to get Covid-19 by “the end of next week”.
The Australian Technical Advisory Group on Immunisation has already approved jabs for children who are immunocompromised or have underlying medical conditions, a cohort of around 220,000. But with the Delta variant indiscriminately impacting kids, Mr Hunt said a decision was imminent.
“They’re considering that at the moment and we’re hopeful by the end of next week they’ll be in position to have formed a view, but on balance, the early indications are that it’s likely that they will approve that,” Mr Hunt told Sky News on Friday morning.
Max Maddison 8.40am: Hunt warns states: we keep common cause
Health Minister Greg Hunt has made a veiled swipe at states who are considering breaking ranks despite the agreed national roadmap, saying the direction for the country is “clear”.
With West Australia Premier Mark McGowan reserving the right to lockdown even once 80 per cent of the state was vaccinated, Mr Hunt signalled the need for unity across the nation, saying the targets give the country a “common purpose”.
“What it does do is it means we keep a common cause and a common direction and it plays an incredibly important role in that all states and territories have adopted and signed up to the 70 and 80 per cent thresholds,” Mr Hunt told Seven’s Sunrise on Friday morning.
“We have always respected their role as jurisdictions under the circumstances on the ground, but the direction for the country is clear. 70 per cent, 80 per cent: these numbers give Australians hope, a target, a common purpose and they give us a pathway.”

Nicholas Jensen 8.30am: NT to vax 12 - 15-yr-olds from today
The NT government will begin to vaccinate children aged between 12 and 15 today in a bid to stop the transmission of the Delta variant amongst children and protect the territory’s Indigenous community.
In Greater Darwin, children aged 12 to 15 will only be eligible for the Pfizer vaccine if they have an underlying medical condition or if they are Aboriginal or Torres Strait Islander. However, there remains no eligibility requirements for children outside the Greater Darwin region.
NT Health Minister Natasha Fyles said the government wanted to target vulnerable and exposed remote communities, and provide a range of delivery options.
“We know the Delta strain of the virus is more infectious than every previous variant and we need to take every step to ensure we are keeping Territorians safe,” she said.
“The vaccine is available, free and effective and I want to encourage every Territorian to get vaccinated so we can reach the other side of this pandemic.”
Earlier this week, Chief Minister Michael Gunner said he was monitoring the crisis in NSW and concerned about the threat the virus poses to young people and Aboriginal communities in the NT.
The rollout expansion comes after Prime Minister Scott Morrison announced the Pfizer vaccine will be made available to all Australians aged 16 to 39 by the end of the month.

Andrew McMillen 8.20am: Splendour in the Grass cancelled
The horror run for major Australian events in 2021 continues, as the organisers of Byron Bay festival Splendour in the Grass announced on Friday that the event planned for late November has been rescheduled.
“With vaccine rollout progressing more slowly than anticipated, we have made the decision to move the 20th anniversary edition of the festival to July 2022,” said co-founders Jessica Ducrou and Paul Piticco in a statement.
“We are confident that moving the festival to July 2022 will finally see us enjoying Splendour in the Grass in all its glory,” they said. “More of the population will be vaccinated, international talent will have the ability to enter the country more freely and we’ll be able to deliver the Splendour in the Grass that you know and love.”
On yet another dark day for music fans, the one bright spot is that the headliners previously announced for the 2021 edition are all confirmed for the new dates, July 22-24.

Nicholas Jensen 8.00am: Dutton welcomes NSW vax freedom plan
Defence Minister Peter Dutton has welcomed reports this morning that NSW will consider lifting some restrictions once its population reaches 70 percent vaccination, saying it will provide encouragement and hope for its residents.
Responding to reports in The Australian, Minister Dutton told the Today program: “If that plan is the case, and that is what has happened elsewhere in the world, let’s have a look at it ... It will give some hope for people and some encouragement and incentive to get the vaccine is important.”
While supporting lockdown measures, Mr Dutton said leaders need to be conscious “there is a big price to pay”.
“Reports of mental health conditions particularly amongst kids and the rest are concerning and we have to be mindful of that.”
Mr Dutton also called on Premier Gladys Berejiklian to move the NSW-Queensland border further south during the current outbreak.
“We have thousands of cars a day. People who can’t get to work at the Gold Coast Hospital and people who need treatment at the Gold Coast Hospital. If you are coming up from the Tweed you have just all this checkpoint drama which is not necessary.”
“If it was moved a little further south, that would be positive. Most of these people have much closer connections to the Gold Coast than they do Sydney,” he said.

Nicholas Jensen 7.40am: NSW alerts list grows overnight
A supermarket, restaurant and backpacker residence have been named as the latest Covid-hit venues in NSW, with contact tracers racing to contain the spread of the Delta variant.
The sites are among a string of new locations that have been added to the state’s expanding list of exposure sites, including a Woolworths in Raymond Terrace, Summer House Backpackers in Newtown and Burger Urge in central Dubbo.
Burger Urge, Shop 34-35, Dubbo Square, 177 Macquarie St, August 14, from 6.45pm to 7pm
Summer House Backpackers, Newtown, 5-11 Egan Street, all day August 12 and August 13
Woolworths, Raymond Terrace, MarketPlace, 39 Port Stephens Street, August 8, 7.20am to 10.50am
Anyone who attended the following venues at the times listed is a close contact and must get tested and isolate for 14 days since they were there, regardless of the result.

Nicholas Jensen 7.15am: States must reopen at 80pc vax: Frydenberg
Treasurer Josh Frydenberg has warned state and territory leaders there should be “no expectation” of continued economic support from the commonwealth once their populations reach the 70 to 80 per cent vaccination threshold.
“All premiers, chief ministers and the prime minister had bought the same ticket out of this crisis and that’s to get the vaccination rates up to 70 to 80 per cent,” the Treasurer told Sky News this morning.
“At that point, there should be no expectation on behalf of the states and the territories that the commonwealth’s significant emergency economic support will continue at the scale that it has already been delivered.”
Mr Frydenberg said it was essential that state and territory leaders delivered on their promises and followed the recommendations set out in the Doherty Institute’s modelling.
“Once we get to that 70 per cent target, the Doherty Institute has said that stringent lockdowns become unlikely. And at that point, the state premiers and chief ministers have to level with their public and say we’ve met that target.”
“People have been faithful to reaching that target, they’ve gone out and got the vaccination. And at that point in time restrictions should ease.”

Nicholas Jensen 6.55am: Covid cases around the country
After recording 681 local infections, a new peak in daily cases, the NSW government announced an extension to the state’s regional lockdown, with restrictions to remain in place until at least August 28.
While 25 new cases were detected in western NSW, with three additional cases in Wilcannia, south-western and western Sydney remains the epicentre of the state’s Delta outbreak.
Merrylands, Guildford, Auburn, Granville, Lidcombe, Greenacre and Blacktown continue to show the fastest rates of infection.
Despite spiralling case numbers, a defiant Gladys Berejiklian rebuffed her critics on Wednesday, telling reporters NSW remains the first state in the country to confront the challenge of the “insidious” Delta variant.
She warned other states and territories would also need to abandon their Covid zero targets and learn to live with the virus.
“This is the challenge that every state has to live with: the fact that once you get to 80 per cent double doses, and your population is allowed to live more freely, the Delta variant will creep in because we are so connected.”
“We are confronting this earlier than what we had hoped,” she added.
NSW administered 110,000 vaccinations on Wednesday, taking the state total to 5.5m.
Meanwhile, the ACT reported 16 new local infections, bringing its total number of 83
Chief Minister Andrew Barr said the capital was entering a crucial stage of the pandemic, warning the virus needed to be suppressed now or risk becoming like NSW.
“We don’t want to live like Sydney with ever-growing case numbers two months into a lockdown, with the virus seeding out all over the country and into New Zealand,” he said.
The source of nine cases remain under investigation, including five further infections reported on Thursday.
The number of close contacts associated with Canberra’s exposure sites doubled in one day, with more than 19,000 residents identified.
In the Northern Territory, the lockdown of Greater Darwin ended on Thursday after zero local cases were recorded, while restrictions remained in place in Katherine.
Chief Minister Michael Gunner said the lack of cases meant authorities were comfortable lifting the lockdown in Darwin, but wanted to monitor Katherine for at least another 24 hours.
“We need Katherine to hang tight for another day,” said Mr Gunner.
Rachel Baxendale 5am: Andrews weighs longer lockdown for Victoria
Victoria has recorded its highest daily coronavirus case count since the state’s deadly second wave last year, leaving Premier Daniel ­Andrews unable to rule out a longer lockdown.
Health authorities on Thursday said they were reassured the vast majority of new cases were quarantined throughout their infectious period but warned the battle was far from over as mystery cases continued to emerge.
Of 57 new community-­acquired cases recorded in the 24 hours to midnight on Thursday, 44 were close contacts quarantined as part of a cluster that emerged just over a fortnight ago, starting with an Al-Taqwa College teacher in her 20s and her ­optometrist partner, who live in Newport in Hobsons Bay in Melbourne’s inner southwest.
Sky News Political Editor Andrew Clennell says the rising number of COVID-19 infections in Melbourne does "raise questions” about when the lockdown in the city will end.
That cluster now comprises 255 cases, and includes subclusters at the Caroline Springs Square shopping centre where the teacher’s partner worked, and the Newport football club where he played AFL, as well as a smaller cluster linked to a Melton family, and a larger one linked to Glenroy West Primary School.
A further 10 people spent time in the community while infectious and were linked to more ­recent clusters, including one centred on public housing towers in Carlton, another linked to cases in the Jewish Orthodox community in East St Kilda, and a third associated with an East Malvern pizza shop.
Three mystery cases include residents of Glenroy and Ascot Vale in Melbourne’s northwest, and a resident of Doncaster in Melbourne’s east.
New daily cases in Victoria, from July 10, 2021
Of 309 cases linked to Victorian outbreaks that have emerged since August 4, 156, or 50 per cent, have been in quarantine for the duration of their infectious period – up significantly from 36 per cent last Sunday.

Yoni Bashan 4.45am: Freedom plan for fully vaccinated in NSW
Bars, restaurants and gyms would reopen to the fully inoculated once vaccination coverage across NSW reaches 70 per cent, under a proposal drawn up by government ministers and awaiting sign off from Gladys Berejiklian .
Businesses are unlikely to ­receive a September reprieve from the current NSW lockdown under the plan, which is expected to be finalised and announced next week.
Instead, individuals are likely to be the beneficiaries of low-risk ­adjustments to restrictions, with the state’s chief psychiatrist, Murray Wright , making assessments and submissions to the government for some rules to be eased over the next six weeks.
New South Wales Premier Gladys Berejiklian has declared residents will have to learn to live with the Delta variant, conceding COVID-19 “never had a rule book”.
These are likely to include an expansion of the existing “singles bubble”, and other measures, but they are unlikely to apply to Greater Sydney’s 12 local government areas of concern, where the virus remains concentrated.
The NSW Premier has stopped short of detailing the road map, ­despite again raising the prospect of lifting some restrictions as vaccination rates rise.
Thursday was a record day for vaccinations, with 309,000 doses administered. More than half of all eligible Australians have now received at least one dose.

Jess Malcolm 4.30am: AstraZeneca set for name change in Australia
AstraZeneca has changed the brand name of its Covid-19 vaccine to Vaxzevria after it was granted approval by the Therapeutic Goods Administration.
The pharmaceutical giant hopes the name change will help to smooth the pathway for Australians vaccinated with the domestically produced Vaxzevria to travel internationally.
Vaxzevria is the brand name already in use in Europe and the UK, approved by both the European Medicines Agency and the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) in the UK.
The use of its previous name (Covid-19 Vaccine AstraZeneca) had triggered concerns that some European countries or the UK may not recognise the Australian-produced AstraZeneca vaccine, or that it would be seen differently to the same vaccine made overseas.
Emergency Management Minister Bridget McKenzie says we will never be able to eradicate COVID-19 from Australia or from the globe following Mark McGowan's comments that he aims to pursue a Covid zero policy in Western Australia.

Victorian Premier Daniel Andrews says Covid-19 vaccination, testing ‘best way forward’

Full text: After the state posted 24 new locally acquired infections on Tuesday and Melburnians woke to even harsher public health measures, the Victorian Premier slammed Sydney for the state’s struggles.
“We wish them all the success. Their success will be our success, just like their problem has become ours,” he told reporters.
“I can‘t rewind – I can’t send it back to NSW where it came from. We’ve got to deal with what is here.”
NSW recorded 452 new cases and one new death overnight as the state approaches nearly two months in lockdown.
While it was a slight dip in cases from Monday’s 478 new infections, the NSW Premier warned September and October would be “the most difficult” months for the state.
Victorian authorities this week announced an extension of the current lockdown for Melbourne and introduced a night curfew for the city.
The lockdown features are similar to Melbourne’s strictest 2020 lockdown, which took the state’s 700 daily count to zero.
Mr Andrews said he did not want to see the state spiral into hundreds of cases a day.
“We are determined not to get to that point,” he said.
“I don‘t want a limbo position where, (while) we don’t have the hospitalisations that NSW have, we don’t have the tragic deaths that they are dealing with, but we have too many cases to open up.
“That is why we have to drive this down as low as we can and maybe zero is possible.”
Mr Andrews said health authorities were aiming to avoid the escalating situation north of the border happening in Victoria.
“No matter what any other state is doing or choosing to prioritise in their daily briefings, the national strategy remains the national strategy and that is to actively suppress the virus as best we can,” he said.
“Sometimes that means you get down to zero cases, sometimes you won’t be able to achieve that.
“We won’t be indefinitely locked down – we have to do our very best to avoid what Sydney is going through at the moment.”
The Premier said the “best way forward” for the state was to get tested immediately if anyone was showing symptoms and to get vaccinated.
“We have got an agreed plan that says when we get to 70 per cent (vaccination rate) based on the Doherty Institute modelling,” Mr Andrews said.
“When we get to 70 per cent things are possible, at 80 per cent you are not in lockdowns.
“This is a degree of protection and certainty and the future looks different – that is the agreed plan and no one is walking away from that.”

Full text: It comes as Queensland Health declares Greater Darwin and the Katherine region as Covid hotspots.
The Premier was repeatedly asked whether she would continue to pursue a no-Covid policy once 80 per cent of the population is vaccinated, or whether she’d let the virus run.
But while she said she agreed that hitting that threshold would allow an easing of restrictions, she repeatedly said that was a long way away and would not answer what her strategy would be at that point.
“These are decisions that are being talked about at National Cabinet,” Ms Palaszczuk said.
“We are provided constantly with advice from the Doherty Institute and what the Doherty Institute is saying is that 80 per cent national threshold is what we are aiming towards.
“So we haven’t reached that yet.”
The Doherty Institute modelling expected 80 per cent of the population to be vaccinated by the end of November.
The modelling revealed that even if we hit an 80 per vaccination rate, about 1300 people would die over six months in an out-of-control outbreak with minimal restrictions.
It follows comments from the WA Premier Mark McGowan suggested he planned to pursue a zero Covid approach even after the state reaches an 80 per cent vaccination rate and would continue to use lockdowns and border closures until the National Cabinet’s last phase of its four-step plan out of the pandemic.
Responding, Prime Minister Scott Morrison said that was not the agreement he had through National Cabinet.
“First of all, when you move from Phase B, you move from managing cases to ensure you’re managing hospitalisations, serious illness and things of that nature,” he told Sky News.
“And that was done in our first discussion on the national plan and it was then agreed in principle with the targets that were set by the Doherty Institute, which made it very clear that once you get to 70 per cent and 80 per cent at that level, particularly at 80 per cent, you’re managing the virus just like you would the flu.
“That’s what the national plan was about, it gives people that hope and the path forward. It is the path out. That was the plan that was agreed to.”
It comes as it’s announced Greater Darwin and the Katherine region will be declared Covid-19 hotspots from 1am Wednesday, August 18, says Queensland Health.
The declaration comes after a man in his 30s tested positive to Covid-19 and spent time in the community whilst infectious.
From 1am Wednesday, anyone arriving into Queensland who has been to Darwin or Katherine in the Northern Territory since August 12 must hotel quarantine, unless they are a returning resident or have been granted an exemption.
Anyone who has already arrived, or arrives in Queensland from the Greater Darwin and Katherine regions before 1am, Wednesday 18 August, should monitor their symptoms and get tested immediately if they experience symptoms.
Queensland’s Chief Health Officer Dr Jeannette Young said the positive case meant there was a need to take action and that restrictions will also apply to the state’s prisons, aged care facilities, disability accommodation services and hospitals.
“From 1am, Wednesday 18 August, anyone who has been in these NT hotspots on or after 12 August cannot enter these facilities, except for end of life visits unless 14 days have passed since they were there,” Dr Young said.

NSW crisis risks hopes of opening the nation

Full text: Australia's plan to reopen and move beyond lockdowns this year will be in jeopardy unless NSW drives COVID-19 case numbers close to zero as well as hitting a vaccination target of 70 per cent of the adult population.
Experts predict Victoria and other states could return to a COVID-normal situation if the vaccination targets were reached and case numbers remained low, but NSW would be shut out by the rest of the country.
If Australia did open up at 70 per cent adult vaccination with daily cases in the hundreds, as they were in NSW yesterday, Doherty Institute modelling suggests 385,000 coronavirus cases and almost 1500 deaths could occur in six months.
To avoid thousands of cases a day, states and territories would be required to continue using border closures and lockdowns even after hitting 80 per cent vaccination. By comparison, reopening with low or no cases at 70 per cent vaccination would bring 2737 infections and
13 deaths over six months.
Yesterday, NSW reported 466 cases - another record total for a single day - and rules were toughened hours before lockdown was extended to the entire state.
Three federal MPs from Sydney - Fiona Martin, Dave Sharma and Jason Falinski - said they believed it would be impossible for NSW to return to zero COVID-19 cases and that mass vaccination offered the only path to freedom.
The dramatic decision yesterday afternoon to belatedly lock down all of NSW did not change the views of those MPs on the state's prospects.
Prime Minister Scott Morrison has said lockdowns, rather than vaccination, are the way out of NSW's outbreak - a markedly different emphasis from Premier Gladys Berejiklian's focus on jabs.
With more than 100,000 vaccines being administered each day, Ms Berejiklian has estimated NSW would hit 70 per cent double-dose vaccination by late October and
80 per cent by mid-November.
Under the national four-phase reopening plan based on the Doherty Institute modelling, lockdowns would be "unlikely but possible and targeted" at 70 per cent vaccination then "highly targeted only" with minimum baseline restrictions at 80 per cent. Domestic border closures would also become unnecessary.
Nic Rebuli, a researcher at the University of NSW School of Population Health who worked on the modelling, said anything above 100 cases a day was probably too high to consider moving beyond border closures and lockdowns, even at 70 per cent vaccination.
"NSW's hope is if they can get vaccines to more at-risk areas such as essential workers, they can bring transmission down."
Victorian Health Minister Martin Foley emphasised yesterday that moving to a world without lockdowns was only possible with "zero or low cases" nationwide. "Victoria has to do its bit. Queensland has to do its bit. Every state and territory has to do its bit. The biggest challenge is clearly NSW," he said.
"I would encourage NSW to take all the measures it needs to,
to drive those numbers down ... we can't have that level of confidence until all of us have achieved the preconditions that the Doherty modelling is predicated on."
Melbourne University epidemiologist Professor Tony Blakely said that even with a stage 4, statewide lockdown it was difficult to see NSW returning to zero cases before November or December. "From there, there is a question over whether they might just choose to live with it. When vaccination coverage is higher, it is easier, we believe, to achieve elimination then," he said.
Michael Lydeamore, an infectious-diseases modeller at Monash University who also worked on the Doherty Institute modelling, said it was clear opening up at a higher base level of cases would accelerate infections.
"If you open up at 70 per cent vaccination with 30 cases, by the time you get to 80 per cent vaccination, you may have 100 infections per day, for example. If you open up with 400 cases, you're well over the 1000 mark after the same period," he said. "Everything gets riskier the more cases you start with - a lot riskier, really."
University of NSW mathematician Jason Wood, another co-author of the Doherty Institute modelling, said it forecast two scenarios: zero or low cases versus an unchecked epidemic. In the latter, an initial high number of daily cases puts an increasing strain on testing, tracing and quarantine safeguards, allowing 385,000 cases over six months. In reality, however, government measures such as lockdowns and border closures would prevent the epidemic reaching those heights.
Professor Nancy Baxter, the head of Melbourne University's School of Population and Global Health, said the most important thing for NSW to do was to reduce the R0 - the reproduction rate of the virus - to below one. "The relevant question is what we do to get reproduction under one because otherwise it's not 500 cases a day, it's 5000 cases. It doesn't take too long once reproduction is over one to get to a shocking number of cases," she said.
"Can NSW get to zero cases? I don't know. It will take longer than two months. They have to impose all the things they've resisted until now because it maybe won't make a difference - they need to impose them now, try them."
Mr Foley conceded authorities had "growing concerns" about Victoria's outbreak, which grew by 21 cases yesterday, with only 11 in quarantine during their infectious period. The acquisition source remains unknown for eight cases recorded over the past week, spread across eight local government areas.
Wastewater sampling has picked up traces of the virus in Shepparton and Lakes Entrance, where lockdown was lifted from Tuesday. Testing is to be ramped up, though Mr Foley said additional restrictions were not necessary.

Full text: The hospitality industry is calling for outdoor dining with limited indoor services to be restored, while the state’s leading business lobby is advocating for an ­industry-by-industry relaxation approach that would ease in line with vaccination targets.
NSW recorded one death and 283 fresh cases of the virus in the 24 hours to 8pm on Sunday, of which 106 people were known to be active in the community during their infectious period. The isolation status of another 71 cases remains under investigation.
Officials began placing numerous regional areas into lockdown to keep ahead of exposure sites emerging in some locations. The Tamworth region, in the state’s northeast, was placed into a week-long lockdown after a Covid-­positive woman travelled to the area from Newcastle.
By late Monday afternoon, the NSW government also announced that the Byron Bay, Ballina, Lismore and the Richmond Valley local government areas, all located in the state’s far north, would be placed in a similar lockdown because of a Covid-positive case identified in the region.
The man in his 50s, now in hospital, had travelled from Sydney to the area for reasons that remain under investigation; residents of metropolitan Sydney and other areas are forbidden to travel to the regions, although this is permitted in narrow circumstances.
With the lockdown of Greater Sydney due to expire on August 28, Premier Gladys Berejiklian on Monday appeared to firm in her conviction that easing restrictions would be possible for vaccinated individuals in some areas, suggesting the government was eager to implement these measures.
New daily cases in New South Wales
This has already happened in the construction sector, due to resume operations at 50 per cent capacity from Wednesday; workers from hotspot locations will be permitted to participate as long as they are fully or partially vaccinated, an edict that has angered some conservative Liberal MPs. They plan to oppose the move at a partyroom meeting on Tuesday where they will argue it is not the role of government or business to mandate workers receive vaccinations.
“Please think about the future,” Ms Berejiklian said. “If you work in an industry where you’d like to go back to serving customers … or you work in a workplace which is currently not open – please consider getting vaccinated.”
Doherty Institute modelling provided to national cabinet last week set a target of 70 per cent coverage before restrictions could be eased in a comprehensive way. NSW is tracking towards six million inoculations by the end of the month, which would amount to roughly 50-60 per cent of the state.
COVID-19 Australia: Cumulative vaccinations by state
Ms Berejiklian said NSW would respect the conclusions of the Doherty Institute report, but it was her belief that options for easing restrictions could tentatively occur much sooner. “That report obviously allows certain freedoms at 70 per cent vaccination, at 80 per cent vaccination ... Please know that once we hit 50 to 60 (per cent of vaccination coverage), lockdown plus easing some restrictions is very different to what the Doherty report says must happen at 70 per cent,” she said.
Wes Lambert, chief executive of Restaurant and Catering Australian, said a further lockdown extension was probable, meaning flexibility for vaccinated workers and patrons would be welcomed.
The sentiment was backed by Clubs NSW chief executive Josh Landis, who said the mental and fin­ancial wellbeing of 25,000 workers was a primary concern.

Mackenzie Scott 7pm: Lockdowns buoy strong auction results
Lockdowns dealt a blow to auction numbers last week, helping to underpin the strong clearance rates.
Last week saw the country’s three largest cities – Sydney, Melbourne and Brisbane – end the week in lockdown following continued Covid-19 outbreaks.
As a result, the number of properties taken to auction fell week-on-week to 1672 auctions, with preliminary data from researcher CoreLogic finding just over three quarters (76.4 per cent) sold.
While final numbers are not expected until later in the week, early data shows 10 per cent of properties originally scheduled for auction last week were rescheduled to a later date.
CoreLogic’s research executive Tim Lawless said the high levels of properties sold prior and withdrawals suggested vendor confidence might be waning.
“That really says to me that if vendors were super confident, they would be selling under the hammer and testing the market,” Mr Lawless said.
“But it looks like they’re much more willing to accept that offer beforehand if it’s reasonable, and no doubt there is still some good offers coming in as this is still a really tight seller’s market.”

Paul Garvey 6.15pm: Extra medics, beds to ease strain on health
Western Australia will pump ­almost $2bn of extra funding into its health system as it looks to ease the strain that has plagued its hospitals in recent months.
Premier Mark McGowan and Health Minister Roger Cook on Sunday pledged to deliver another 332 hospital beds – including 109 mental-health beds – and promised to recruit 100 new doctors and 500 new nurses.
The government also promised another $88m for additional nursing and administration staff at the Perth Children’s Hospital. The death of seven-year-old Aishwarya Aswath at the hospital earlier this year, after she waited almost two hours for help, prompted a public outcry and ­exposed shortcomings in the hospital’s practices.
Ambulance ramping levels have also hit unprecedented highs this year, peaking at 5246 hours in June, and have consistently been at multiples of the 1030 hours-per-month level that Mr Cook ­described as a “crisis” when he was in opposition.
The government has been under mounting pressure in ­recent months to use its growing budget surplus – the product of ­record-high royalty revenues from the state’s iron ore industry – to improve its health system.
Mr McGowan said the extra spending on staffing levels and ­infrastructure in the health system were the result of his government’s financial management.
The strain in the health system in recent months has come ­despite WA being largely untouched by the pandemic. While the feared hospitalisations due to Covid-19 have not materialised in WA, the closure of international borders has cut off the supply of foreign doctors and nurses that underpinned the health system.
Mr Cook said international studies had shown the pandemic had deterred people from engaging with GPs and hospitals last year, which had led to an increase in the frequency and acuity of hospital presentations this year.
“Every health minister in Australia is feeling the heat from dealing with Covid and dealing with the unprecedented demand on our hospitals,” he said.
“We are very fortunate in Western Australia that we have managed the state’s finances properly and as a result of that we are able to put significant investment as part of the budget process to try to address the situation.”

AFP 5.30pm: Brunei clamps down after first local cases in 15 months
Brunei has imposed strict curbs to halt the spread of Covid-19, after finding its first locally transmitted cases in the country in over a year.
Seven community infections were found, the health ministry said, leading the government to close all places of worship and postpone social events for two weeks.
Mass events were also limited to groups of 30 people over this period as school classes were moved online and restaurants barred from serving dine-in.
The tiny Islamic sultanate has largely remained coronavirus free, logging only three deaths since the pandemic began.
More than half of its 347 infections so far were imported, with tight border controls and quarantine measures keeping the virus’s spread in check.
Five of the oil-rich nation first local infections since May last year were linked to a government-run virus monitoring centre.
“This cluster is believed to likely have been exposed to one of the imported cases in Brunei,” the ministry said in a statement.
The source of infection for the other two could not be identified, the ministry added.
An imported case was also announced Saturday: a man who arrived from the Middle East via Malaysia on July 30 before experiencing symptoms on Tuesday.
Brunei has been spared the serious coronavirus outbreaks that are overwhelming health systems in much of Southeast Asia.
It shares its only land border with Malaysia, which has recorded nearly 1.25 million infections and more than 10,000 deaths.
The country has also been steadily ramping up its vaccination process, with nearly 32 per cent of its 450,000 people getting at least one jab

Rebecca Le May 4.50pm: Hunt confirms third vaccine option for Aussies nears
The Therapeutic Goods Administration is on track to approve the Moderna Covid-19 vaccine within a fortnight, giving Australians a third option to Pfizer and Astra Zeneca, Health Minister Greg Hunt has confirmed.
Mr Hunt told reporters on Sunday it was expected the first million doses would be available next month.
A further three million doses would be supplied each month through October, November and December, he said, although consignment dates had not yet been provided by the company.
Mr Hunt said Australians were rolling up their sleeves in record numbers.
“We see that the hesitancy is down and the intention to vaccinate is up,” he said.
Intention to get the jab was at 77 per cent, the minister said.
Weekly vaccination rates had nearly doubled from 700,000 a month and a half ago to almost 1.3 million over the past seven days, Mr Hunt said.

Agencies 4.30pm: Counting the coronavirus cost at Tokyo’s Olympics
The pandemic affected almost every part of Tokyo’s Olympics, forcing a historic postponement, the banning of almost all spectators, and ending the dreams of more than a few athletes.
As the Games wrap up, how did virus concerns play out during the pandemic Olympics.
How many cases were there?
From July 1 to Sunday, the final day of the Games, Tokyo 2020 says it identified 430 positive cases in a population of 52,000 overseas participants and athletes and many more Japanese volunteers and security.
Most positive cases were among residents of Japan, largely staff or contractors, with 29 athletes and 25 members of the media also testing positive.
There was one so-called “cluster”, in the Greek artistic swimming team. All 12 members went into isolation in the second week of the Games after five members tested positive.
Outside the Olympic bubble, Japan hit new virus records, with the capital accounting for a large portion of the numbers.
Cases were already on the rise before the Games, and Tokyo has been under a state of emergency for weeks.
Did the virus affect events?
Virus regulations meant athletes who tested positive could not continue in the Games.
And some saw their Olympic journey end even before it began. Former US Open winner Bryson DeChambeau and tennis star Coco Gauff tested positive before setting out for the Games.
And others like Chilean taekwondo athlete Fernanda Aguirre were ruled out after a positive test at the airport.
Some athletes were already on the ground and training when they got the news, including US pole vaulter Sam Kendricks, who withdrew from the Games.
But the cases had no major effect on events, with none cancelled or moved as a result.
How did teams react?
There was little outcry from teams forced to withdraw athletes from competition. But the rules around isolation for those testing positive did cause some controversy.
Members of the Dutch team in hotel quarantine went on “strike” over a lack of fresh air in the rooms, winning 15 minutes a day at an open window.
Dutch taekwondo fighter Reshmie Oogink described the quarantine as “Olympic jail”.
Did the ‘bubble’ hold?
For the most part, teams stuck to the rules and got on with their sport. But there were a few notable exceptions.
Members of the Georgian judo team had their Olympic passes removed after an unauthorised sightseeing trip.
And five members of Australia’s mens hockey team were reprimanded for breaking out of the bubble to buy beer.
But organisers said overall the rules were respected and the comparatively low number of cases in the Olympic Village were “a very successful outcome,” said Brian McCloskey, a member of the expert panel advising the IOC on virus measures.
Organisers also denied any connection to rising virus cases in Tokyo, and the city’s governor even argued the Games helped people keep at home to watch on TV.
Some experts argue there was an “indirect relationship” and that holding the Games undermined the government’s messaging on virus risks.

Agencies 4.00pm: Data dynamo’s ‘digital twins’ aiming to tame Covid
“When you turn on the news, you just see queues: queues for vaccination, queues for tests. I see data.”
From her office in Brisbane, Dr Kellie Nuttall’s job is to build solutions to wicked problems and Covid-19 ticks the box.
A digital native still in her 30s, Nuttall is one of Deloitte Australia’s youngest partners, promoted under chief executive Adam Powick’s leadership and now the artificial intelligence lead for the firm. For the past nine years, she has been knee-deep in big data analytics and artificial intelligence and more recently data-rich virtual models known as “digital twins”. She says these will give Australia a much-needed boost to get ahead of the curve in the pandemic.
“I see data. I see supply and demand issues that are just waiting to be optimised,” Nuttall tells The Australian.
“Imagine looking at that vaccination and testing system as a whole. We could build the digital twin of it, and we can quickly see where we have supply and where we have demand issues and how we optimise that system. The digital twins can tell us where tomorrow’s bottlenecks are likely to be before they have even occurred. That’s how we can reduce pressure on the system,” she says.
Digital twins use data to understand fiendishly complex and ever-changing environments.
Vast amounts of data are combined to create a complete digital copy of the environment, which could be a company or a community.
Twins have explored space, made cities smarter, optimised manufacturing systems and generated renewable energy more efficiently.
“There are answers in the data but you need to know what questions to ask of that twin,” Nuttall says.
“What twins are really effective at doing is scenario testing. In a pandemic, I believe that can be extremely effective in helping us test a range of scenarios very quickly to shape an optimal response.”
In Australia, there’s a wealth of lazy data at our disposal.

Philip Sherwell 3.30pm: China outbreak deepens vaccine effectiveness doubts
China has long trumpeted its success in stamping out coronavirus cases at home and distributing vaccines abroad as proof of its superiority over the West.
Now those claims are coming under unprecedented scrutiny as Beijing scrambles to contain China’s worst outbreak for more than a year by placing millions under lockdown and ordering mass testing in cities with infections.
As in many other countries the highly transmissible Delta variant has up-ended previous calculations.
For the first time some Chinese public health experts are suggesting that the country may need to contemplate a dramatic shift in its approach: away from “zero tolerance” of infections and towards a “living with Covid” strategy.
The new wave has deepened existing doubts about the effectiveness of Chinese vaccines against new variants even as President Xi Jinping last week announced that China would supply two billion doses of its vaccines for global use, the latest broadside in an aggressive vaccine diplomacy campaign.
The new outbreak is understood to have started with the arrival of a passenger with the Delta variant on a flight from Russia in the eastern city of Nanjing on July 10. It was spread by aircraft cleaners who were infected after a breakdown in safety protocols. By yesterday, there had been more than 1,500 new confirmed cases since mid-July - and hundreds more asymptomatic ones, which China does not include in tallies.

Ellen Ransley 3.05pm: Woman charged with fleeing Qld quarantine
A woman has been charged with multiple offences after she allegedly fled her Gold Coast hotel quarantine room.
Queensland Police said the 24-year-old had travelled to the Sunshine State from New South Wales when she was picked up at a border control checkpoint last Saturday.
She was transported to hotel quarantine, but on Tuesday allegedly forced open the glass door of her room and absconded.
She allegedly remained on the run until Saturday, when she was found at Centenary Lakes Park in Caboolture, more than a 100km from where she was last seen.
She was taken into custody and later charged with one count each of fail to comply with Covid-19 direction, wilful damage and stealing, and two counts of breach of bail in relation to other matters.
Deputy Commissioner Steve Gollschewski said she would remain in custody while she completed her quarantine.
The woman was denied bail and will appear in Brisbane Magistrates Court via video link on Monday.

Agencies 2.40pm: Unvaccinated twice as likely to get Covid re-infection
Unvaccinated people are more than twice as likely to be reinfected with Covid-19 as the fully vaccinated, a study by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said.
The agency said the finding supports its recommendation “that all eligible persons be offered Covid-19 vaccination, regardless of previous SARS-CoV-2 infection status.” Some US politicians, including Senator Rand Paul, have in the past said they do not plan to take a Covid-19 vaccine because of their natural immunity derived from prior infection.
The new study was based on 246 Kentucky adults who were reinfected in May and June this year after previously being infected in 2020.
They were compared with 492 “controls” who were matched by sex, age, and time of initial positive test.
The analysis found that unvaccinated people were 2.34 times as likely to be reinfected compared to people fully vaccinated with the Pfizer, Moderna or Johnson & Johnson vaccines.
The duration of infection-acquired immunity remains poorly understood and may be affected by the emergency of newer variants, the paper said.
For example, laboratory studies have shown that blood samples from people previously infected with the original Wuhan strain had poor antibody responses to the Beta variant first identified in South Africa.
One of the limitations of the study is it was conducted before Delta became the dominant strain in the United States.ia/ft

Ellen Ransley 2.20pm: What you can and can’t do in Qld post lockdown
Southeast Queenslanders will be released from lockdown on Sunday afternoon, but will need to follow strict rules for at least two weeks.
Premier Annastacia Palaszczuk said it was important residents of the 11 local government areas that spent the past eight days in lockdown recognised they were “not out of the woods yet”.
For the next 14 days, high school students will be required to wear masks at school.
“For all our high school students, please, I need you to wear masks, because you’ll be helping to keep the whole community safe,” Ms Palaszczuk said.
“Because we have the Delta strain, and until we can get to those 70 and 80 per cent of vaccination rates, masks are absolutely critical.”
Other rules that will come into place at 4pm Sunday include a maximum of 10 people inside homes.
“You are able to go and visit your loved ones in hospital and aged care, but of course you can’t do that if you are subject to a home quarantine order,” Ms Palaszczuk said.
Weddings and funerals will be capped at 20 people.
Places of worship, convention centres, retail, hospitality, gyms, hairdressers, beauty and personal care venues will all reopen, but the one person per four square metre restrictions will come back into force.
Community sports will not be permitted over the next two weeks.
Ms Palaszczuk stressed that masks would continue to be “really important” and would need to be worn widely.
She said those living in southeast Queensland could travel within that area, but now was “not the time” to be travelling to regional parts of the state.
“Please, put off plans to visit family and friends in regional Queensland for the next two weeks,” she said.

Evin Priest 2.00pm: The restrictions NSW will ease first
A return to school and to work is slated for Greater Sydney residents if New South Wales can hit a total of 6 million doses of Covid-19 vaccinations by August 28.
The race is on to get another 1.6 million jabs in arms during the next three weeks after the state reached 4.4 million jabs.
“Pleasingly, New South Wales has now made sure that there are 4.4 million jabs in arms. That is positive,” Premier Gladys Berejiklian said.
“This is a race. We are tracking well to hit our 6 million target (of at least one dose).
“I am keen to get to 6 million jabs by the end of August because that will provide us opportunities to consider what life looks like in September.”
On Sunday, NSW recorded 262 new locally acquired cases and at least 50 were active in the community while infectious.
A woman with the virus died overnight, bringing the number of Covid-related deaths during the current outbreak to 28.
Health officials confirmed the woman, aged in her 80s, was a resident at the Wyoming Residential Aged Care Facility in Summer Hill, which is at the centre of an outbreak, and died at Royal Prince Alfred Hospital.
Ms Berejiklian and health officials insist not only will the amount of Covid-19 deaths be reduced if NSW can get to 6 million jabs, but two restrictions could be eased.
“Our priorities as a government are getting face-to-face learning back, but also getting workers back to the workplaces,” Ms Berejiklian said.
“If certain categories of workers go back to work, it also means all citizens will perhaps have access to services they don’t have access to (currently).”
Students will be only able to return to school on Monday if their school is not in a high-risk local government area (LGA), while a public health order prevents workers from attending offices unless they are essential workers.
For suburbs in Greater Sydney that are not in high-risk LGAs, the allowed reasons to leave home are:
• Shopping for food or other essential goods and service (within 10kms of home)
• Medical care or compassionate needs, including getting a Covid-19 vaccine
• Exercise outdoors in groups of two (within 10km)
• Essential work or education where you cannot work or study from home
However, people who live in the LGAs of Penrith, Blacktown, Campbelltown, Canterbury-Bankstown, Cumberland, Fairfield, GeorgesRiver, Liverpool and Parramatta can only leave home to:
• Obtain food or other goods and services (within 5km)
• For work if you cannot reasonably work from home and your workplace is in the same local government or if you are an authorisedworker
• Education if it cannot be done at home
• Exercise (within 5km)
• Medical care, including obtaining a COVID-19 vaccination
Another incentive for NSW residents to get the jab is a growing number of people hospitalised with the virus.
There are currently 362 cases in hospital, with 58 people in intensive care, 24 of whom require ventilation.
There were 95,480 Covid tests in NSW in the 24 hours to 8pm on Saturday as well as 20,612 vaccinations.

Michael McKenna 1.27pm: Campbell Newman returns to politics with swipe at PM
Former Queensland premier Campbell Newman is returning to politics, running for a senate spot for the Liberal Democrats at the next federal election.
Just weeks after quitting the Liberal National Party, Mr Newman on Sunday announced he would be leading the Queensland senate campaign ticket for the Liberal Democrats.
Mr Newman said he had been approached to run by a number of minor parties, including Clive Palmer’s party and One Nation.
Despite being ousted from government and his seat after just a single term in state politics, Mr Newman said he felt compelled to return to politics, accusing the Morrison government of an abject failure with its vaccination rollout.
Mr Newman also criticised the Palaszczuk’s Governments mounting lode and the burden on business of Covid-related restrictions over the past 18 months, while conceding the latest lockdown was necessary because of the threat of the Delta variant and low vaccination rates.
“Six years ago, I declared my political career over. But I simply cannot sit by and watch Australia being so poorly led, and this crisis being so poorly managed, by our major political parties,’’ he said.
“I love Australia and I love Queensland. I want to represent Queensland in the Senate and hold the major parties’ feet to the fire, because right now they are all seriously letting us down.’’

Rebecca Urban 12.18am: Victoria to offer AZ to 18-39 year olds
Victoria will be offering AstraZeneca shots to 18 to 39-year-olds as part of a push to boost vaccination rates.
Premier Daniel Andrews announced that nine of the 50 open-access state-run clinics would have 200,000 doses designated for young people from next week.
He said that he anticipated sites would be busy.
“A lot has been written and said about vaccine hesitancy,” he said. “That’s not what I’m picking up on.”
Premier Gladys Berejiklian says New South Wales has recorded 262 new locally acquired COVID cases with at least 50 infectious in the community and the death of an unvaccinated woman in her 80s.
Mr Andrews urged Victorians aged 18 to 39 to book to be vaccinated.
“It’s critical to us being open and staying open.”
The state also announced the first drive-through vaccination site, which will be open for bookings from Monday.
A former Bunnings warehouse at Melton has been converted for the purpose.
“Today we’re announcing the soft launch of Australia’s first drive-through vaccination clinic,” Victorian Acting Covid Commander Naomi Bromley said.
“You book, you drive up, roll down your window, roll up your sleeve, get a jab, it’s that easy.
“It is has been planned very carefully in line with advice that ATAGI has provided about what a drive-through vaccine model looks like.”

Jess Malcolm 11.43am: Berejiklian flags restrictions easing by September
Gladys Berejiklian has denied suggestions her vaccination targets are at odds with the Prime Minister, flagging that some restrictions could be eased if NSW reaches six million doses by September.
The NSW Premier said some restrictions could be eased at a threshold of 50 to 60 per cent, a much lower target than Doherty Institute modelling for the commonwealth released last week which set a 70 to 80 per cent target.
“We are currently in lockdown, and lockdown plus some level of easing of restrictions is possible once we get to 50 or 60 per cent rates of vaccination,” she said.
“The Prime Minister said publicly... that because New South Wales is in lockdown, if we hit certain vaccination targets we can ease some restrictions.
“It doesn’t mean you get to what you would ease if you are 70 per cent, but there are certainly opportunities for us to look at what we can ease in September, so long as we hit our
vaccination targets, we can look for opportunities as to how we live in the month of September.”
Ms Berejiklian said NSW Health experts had been carefully observing how other countries such as Canada had eased restrictions with higher vaccination rates.

Jess Malcolm 11.25am: NSW ‘on track to hit vaccination target’
Gladys Berejiklian has urged people to listen to health professionals amid growing concerns of widespread misinformation about vaccines.
The NSW Premier has urged people to get vaccinated and said there were a wide range of places for people to come forward to get vaccinated, including GPs, pharmacies, mass vaccination hubs and mobile clinics.
“Speak to your GP, your pharmacist, a community leader, who has provided you with information,” she said.
“We have targeted grassroots information to so many diverse communities. Over 200 different communities of diverse backgrounds, in greater western Sydney, something our state is very proud of, but also something we need to acknowledge.”
Ms Berejiklian also urged all essential workers to get vaccinated as soon as possible, but foreshadowed the state was “on track” to hit its six million-dose target.
“What it does mean is that September can be a month where we have greater freedom than we do now,” she said.
“Freedom relies on vaccination, and there is no doubt about that, but it also means having to suppress the virus.”

Jess Malcolm 11.02am: NSW records 262 new cases, one more death
NSW has recorded 262 new cases of Covid in the past 24 hours, with residents in the Penrith local government area to be subject to tougher restrictions from today.
A woman in her 80s also died overnight. She was a resident of a Summer Hill aged care home.
“Regrettably, there are 12 suburbs in the Penrith local government area that will now be listed as an area of concern and will be subjected to those harsher restrictions,” Premier Gladys Berejiklian said, citing fears of cases spreading from eight other LGA hotspots bordering Penrith.
“We want to make sure that we stem the tide of the virus seeping into those additional communities and we ask residence from five o’clock this afternoon to adhere to the additional restrictions placed upon them.”
Those suburbs are Caddens, Claremont Meadows, Colyton, Erskine Park, Kemps Creek, Kingswood, Mount Vernon, North St Marys, Orchard Hills, Oxley Park, St Clair, and St Mary’s.
For rolling coverage watch Sky News Australia on Foxtel or visit www.skynews.com.au.
“In line with restrictions currently in place in Blacktown, Campbelltown, Canterbury-Bankstown, Cumberland, Fairfield, Georges River, Liverpool and Parramatta LGAs, people in those 12 suburbs must only obtain food and other goods and services and exercise 5km from their home,” NSW Health’s Dr Jeremy McAnulty said.
“You cannot travel to other areas of work outside those areas unless you are an authorised worker. Masks must be worn whenever you are outdoors, except in a common outdoor area of a backyard, apartment, for example.”
The woman’s death overnight brings the total number of deaths in the latest outbreak to 28.
There are now 362 cases in hospital, with 58 in intensive care and 24 cases are ventilated.
Of the 58 cases in intensive care, five are in their 20s, seven in their 30s, four in their 40s, 17 in their 50s, seven in their 60s, 15 in their 70s and three in their 80s.
Dr McAnulty said young people are at serious risk of illness from Covid-19 and urged all people to get vaccinated.
“So young people are certainly getting caught up with this disease,” he said.
“With the 58 people in ICU, 54 were not vaccinated, three had received their first dose of AstraZeneca and one had received their first dose of Pfizer vaccine.”

Mackenzie Scott, Jess Malcolm 10.03am: Qld records nine new cases, Cairns in lockdown
Lockdown will end in Queensland for 11 local government areas in the state’s south east at 4pm today, but an infected taxi driver has triggered a snap, three-day lockdown in Cairns.
The state has recorded nine new cases of Covid, with concern emerging over the taxi driver, who was infectious in the community for 10 days.
Seven of today’s cases are locally acquired and linked to the Indooroopilly cluster. Another case on the Gold Coast is still under investigation.
“Unfortunately, this discovery of a positive case in Cairns is something that we were not expecting, and we really need the residence of Cairns to come forward with any symptoms and get tested,” Premier Annastacia Palaszczuk has told a press conference.
“So, from 4pm today, for the next three days, Cairns and Yaribah will go into a lockdown. It is essentially a lockdown that the 11 LGAs went to, but they will be allowed to have up to two visitors to come and visit their homes. We need more testing in Cairns. I am very concerned.”
It is unclear if the infection is linked to a fully vaccinated reef pilot who tested positive last week.
For rolling coverage watch Sky News Australia on Foxtel or visit www.skynews.com.au.
While lockdown will lift at 4pm for 11 LGAs stretching from the Gold to Sunshine coasts, some restrictions will remain.
People will now be able to leave their homes and schools will reopen, and visits in hospitals and aged care are now allowed.
But several restrictions remain, including mask wearing for all high school students and primary school staff at schools.
Weddings and funerals will be capped at 20 people, and places of worship, convention centres, retail, dining, gyms and beauty services will operate at 50 per cent capacity.
People will only also be able to have 10 people in their homes.
Ms Palaszcuk has also advised people not to travel into regional Queensland, confirming the state was “not out of the woods.”

Max Maddison 9.45am: Hunt tight-lipped on Gladys’ reopening plan
Health Minister Greg Hunt has refused to say whether NSW Premier Gladys Berejiklian will rescind lockdown restrictions before the state gets to 70 per cent, despite the intention being in clear contradiction to modelling conducted by the Doherty Institute.
Ms Berejiklian has stated she will begin to ease draconian public health orders once NSW reaches 50 per cent vaccination coverage. The figure, however, stands in stark contrast to the federal government’s own modelling which showed the effective threshold was significantly higher.
When pressed on the issue, despite saying he had recently spoken to NSW chief health officer Kerry Chant, Mr Hunt declined to say whether the state intended on breaking away from the rest of the country to carve their own path.
“What I can say is clear, David, is that they are committed to defeating COVID,” Mr Hunt told ABC’s Insiders on Sunday morning. “That’s what I can say is clear, and as to the way in which they’re doing it, one of the things which is really important is to continue to provide support for the public”
He added that children were likely to begin receiving vaccinations in the “last quarter” of this year.
Mr Hunt also sought to stem speculations that federal chief medical officer Paul Kelly was publicly calling for tougher measures in NSW, saying he was merely encouraging people to comply with existing restrictions.
“To continue to move to suppression, it is about encouraging people to stay home, it is about the compliance which comes with the additional positive support of the Australian Defence Force,” he said.

Ellen Ransley 9.37am: Qld teachers, FIFO workers jab priority
Queensland teachers and FIFO workers have become priorities for the state’s vaccination rollout amid the Delta outbreak.
School staff and childcare workers have been added to the state’s 1B priority list, as well as fly-in-fly-out, freight and distribution centre workers.
More than a hundred cases are now linked to southeast Queensland’s Delta cluster, which began when a high school student somehow contracted the virus last month.
It spread to a number of students, staff and family members at Indooroopilly State High School, Ironside State School, Brisbane Girls Grammar and Brisbane Grammar.
Premier Annastacia Palaszczuk said the reason for adding school and childcare workers was because of how much of an impact the latest outbreak had had on educational facilities.
“We need to provide the best possible protection for staff and students,” she said.
“This strain of the virus moves incredibly quickly, and we need to be just as fast in our response.”
Ms Palaszczuk said the changes to the state’s vaccine rollout, “coupled with the remarkable work of Queenslanders during this lockdown” would bolster the state’s efforts to get out on top of the latest outbreak.
Education Minister Grace Grace, said she hoped staff in all schools and childcare centres across Queensland would take up the offer of vaccination.
“I would urge any eligible worker who has not yet been vaccinated to jump online and register,” she said.
“I am also asking schools to be as flexible as possible when it comes to assisting staff to access leave to attend their vaccination appointments.”
To date, Queensland has administered more than 2.5 million doses of the Covid-19 vaccine.
Anyone who works at a school or childcare centre is included in the eligible 1B group, including childcare educators, teachers, teacher aides, management and administrative staff, groundskeepers, cleaners, locum staff, regular volunteers, and any other ancillary school and early learning support staff.

Max Maddison 9.15am: Vaccine still a struggle for non-English speakers
Opposition communications spokeswoman Michelle Rowland says it remains a “real struggle” for people from non-English speaking backgrounds to get information about vaccinations, as she laments the long-term damage school closures may have on students.
A record day of case numbers in Greater Sydney was set to climb higher on Sunday, as outbreaks in Newcastle, Melbourne and Brisbane left the eastern seaboard of the country under strict lockdown orders.
Premiers are racing to vaccinate a sufficient proportion of their population, but Ms Rowland said there remained insufficient vaccine information for some culturally diverse communities, which was undermining attempts to mitigate vaccination hesitancy.
“I think that there has been a real struggle here for people of non-English speaking backgrounds to get information about Covid Safety, let alone about vaccination,” she told Sky News on Sunday morning.
“When you go to the vaccination checker, you can get information in Icelandic, but you can’t get information in Tamil. And I have one of the highest proportions of Tamil speakers in all of Australia in my electorate.”
She also expressed concern that ongoing school closures, forcing kids into home learning, would have unforeseen consequences further down the track.
“Part of it is wondering what impact this is going to have on them in the long term, again, with no end dates to remote schooling inside at the moment,” she said.

Max Maddison 8.54am: States ‘reserving their rights on reopening’
Employment Minister Stuart Robert has refrained from criticising NSW Premier Gladys Berejiklian, despite her plans to plough ahead with reopening at odds with the Morrison government’s own modelling.
Amid rising infections across Greater Sydney, including an outbreak in Newcastle, Ms Berejiklian has changed her milestone from case numbers to jabs, flagging her intention to begin easing restrictions at the end of August, once 50 per cent of the NSW population is vaccinated.
But despite the figure being considerably lower than modelling conducted by the Doherty Institute, which pointed to 70 per cent as the key metric for easing restrictions, Mr Roberts refused to question the plan.
“States have always reserved their rights on a whole range of issues — we’ve seen that consistently. But we’ve also seen the simple message: phase one, let’s get 70 per cent of the population vaccinated,” Mr Robets told Sky News on Sunday morning.

Angelica Snowden 8.38am: Victoria records 11 new cases
Victoria has recorded 11 new local cases of coronavirus in 24 hours, from more than 38,000 tests.
That’s down from a high of 29 cases on Saturday.
All 11 cases were out in the community during their infectious period, authorities say.
The cases have all been linked to current outbreaks
There are a further two cases that have been recorded in hotel quarantine.
Yesterday’s 29 cases — the highest daily rise this year — has thrown the end of lockdown number six into doubt on Thursday.
All 29 cases yesterday were also in the community during their infectious period and Premier Daniel Andrews said mystery cases were behind two outbreaks in Hobson’s Bay and Maribyrnong.

Max Maddison 8.20am: Moderna set to be given the green light
Ten million Modern jabs will soon be given the green light, with the Therapeutic Goods Administration set to approve the vaccine as early as next week.
Senior federal government sources told The Daily Telegraph that the drugs regulator was set to approve Moderna within a fortnight, opening the door for the first 300,000 doses to hit Australia’s shores in September. It will become the third vaccine in the Morrison government’s arsenal.
The country has another three million doses scheduled from October until December.
The highly effective mRNA vaccine’s arrival in Australia comes with over half the country suffering through ongoing lockdowns. The Morrison government is under intense pressure for the perceived failure to procure enough vaccines, with mixed messaging undermining the rollout of AstraZeneca.
With vaccine demand rising amid the most serious outbreak since the start of the pandemic, Health Minister Greg Hunt said more than 200,000 vaccinations had taken place over each of the preceding five days, and pointed to declining vaccine hesitancy in the community.
“What we do know is that the capacity is now fully established to deliver over two million doses per week of AZ plus Pfizer and Moderna, as supplies become available,” he told The Daily Telegraph.
“As the Pfizer numbers grow from one to two million per week, and as Moderna grows to 700,000 per week, we will be able to deliver well over two million doses per week if there is demand.”
The Morrison government has also procured almost 8000 doses of Sotrovimab, a monoclonal antibody treatment, used to treatment Covid-19 patients with mild symptoms who are at high risk of developing severe symptoms.
Trials for the treatment have shown it dramatically reduces hospitalisation and death among unvaccinated Covid patients.

Agencies 6.40am: Protesters mass in France against Covid health pass
Almost a quarter of a million people took to the streets across France on Saturday for the biggest protests yet against a coronavirus health pass needed to enter a cafe or travel on an inter-city train, two days before the new rules come into force.
Similar but smaller protests were held in Italy.
Championed by President Emmanuel Macron, the French regulations make it obligatory to have either a full course of vaccination against Covid-19, a negative test or be recently recovered from the virus to enjoy routine activities.
Macron, who faces re-election next year, hopes to encourage all French to be vaccinated against Covid-19 and thereby defeat the virus and its fast-spreading Delta variant.
But opponents — who have now held four weekends of consecutive protests — argue the rules encroach on civil liberties in a country where individual freedom is highly prized.
About 237,000 people turned out across France, including 17,000 in Paris, the interior ministry said, exceeding the 204,000 recorded last weekend -— unusual numbers for protests at the height of the summer break.
In one of several protests in Paris, hundreds marched from the western suburbs to the centre, chanting “Freedom!” and “Macron, we don’t want your pass!”.
Wearing a mask, Alexandre Fourez, 34, said he was protesting for the first time and that he had himself recovered from Covid.
“The problem with the health pass is that our hand is being forced,” said the marketing employee, adding he “really has difficulty believing its use will be temporary”.

Rhiannon Down 5am: NSW government resists harsher lockdown
The NSW Opposition says it would support tougher lockdown measures to try to reign in the state’s spiralling Covid crisis, after 319 new cases on Saturday marked the state’s darkest day this year.
But the Berejiklian government is resisting pressure to come down harder on Greater Sydney, despite NSW Health Minister Brad Hazzard revealing a third of Saturday’s new cases were out and about in the community while infectious. Instead, he said the responsibility remained with people to do the right thing.
“We are satisfied that the orders in place are appropriate,” Mr Hazzard told Nine newspapers, saying the state already had in place the “toughest lockdown in the country at the present time.”
“The real problem remains: it doesn’t matter what orders you put in place if people ignore them.”
Five more deaths – including three linked to a ballooning cluster at Liverpool Hospital’s geriatric ward sparked by an infected nurse – have pushed the death toll from this outbreak to 27, with authorities citing a growing number of young people left desperately ill with Delta and requiring ventilation in intensive care.
NSW Health's Dr Jeremy McAnulty says Canterbury-Bankstown is the "number one LGA for cases" following the state recording 319 new locally acquired cases.
Meanwhile, a new epicentre of the virus is emerging in the Canterbury-Bankstown local government area. Mr Hazzard said general compliance with public health orders as well as the region’s reliance on manufacturing and distribution industries were behind the spread there.
“The NSW government must hold to the strategy of bringing community transmission to zero or close to zero,” Labor leader Chris Minns told The Daily Telegraph. “If the CHO and NSW government think that more measures are needed, NSW Labor will support them.”
NSW Health Minister Brad Hazzard says NSW has “the toughest lockdown in the country” but the problem is citizens are “not complying” with public health order.
More than 340 people are now in hospital in NSW with coronavirus, 56 of them in intensive care. Of those, four are in their 20s, four are in their 30s, and three are in their 40s. So this disease is infecting people of all ages,” Deputy Chief Health Officer Jeremy McAnulty said on Saturday.
“Of the 56 people in ICU, 51 were not vaccinated at all, four had received the first to dose of AstraZeneca vaccine, and one has received the first dose of the Pfizer vaccines.”
Premier Gladys Berejiklian was criticised on social media for not attending Saturday’s press conference, instead leaving it to Mr Hazzard, who announced the 319 figure and a seven-day lockdown in regional Armidale after cases were detected there.
Mitch Clarke 4.45am: Victoria’s lockdown to be extended beyond seven days
Victoria’s sixth lockdown is set to be extended past Thursday after the state recorded its worst day of cases in almost a year.
The Sunday Herald Sun was told by senior government sources on Saturday night that hopes of coming out of lockdown later this week are fading fast.
It is believed fears are mounting within the government that contact tracers will be unable to identify and connect all cases in the community in time for the lockdown to end as planned.
The state government is expected to announce details about an expanded vaccination program – including for younger people and key workers such as teachers – in the coming days.
Leading epidemiologists on Saturday said they expected the Victorian lockdown to be extended after the state recorded 29 cases – the highest daily case number since last September.
Premier Daniel Andrews has warned that more infections were likely to be discovered in the community.
The leader of Melbourne's Victoria state, Daniel Andrews, comments on the current coronavirus outbreak, after the state returned to lockdown for the sixth time since the pandemic began. Australia's three largest cities are in lockdown, as New South Wales records 319 community cases of the virus and five more deaths — a third straight day of record case numbers.

Cormac Pearson 4.30am: Minister’s plea with Queensland on ‘knife edge’
Queensland health minister Yvette D’Ath has called on Queenslanders not to “undo all the hard work” after footage showed people mingling at a popular market in Brisbane this morning.
Footage showed groups of people sitting together at the Jan Powers Farmers Markets at Brisbane Powerhouse in New Farm which is classified as essential, with some seemingly without masks.
“With southeast Queensland on a knife-edge, we’re asking everyone to stay home and not leave their front door unless it’s absolutely necessary,” Ms D’Ath said.
“Now is not the time to undo all our great work, and eating out at the markets can probably wait.
“The purpose of allowing food stalls is for people to get essential groceries or takeaway food.
“If you go out, mask-up and socially distance – that’s what will get us through this.”
People took to social media in anger at the scenes with a decision on the end of the lockdown looming on Sunday.
Queensland Deputy Premier Steven Miles says the state has recorded 13 new cases of COVID-19.

Full text: Victorian Premier Daniel Andrews has announced a seven-day lockdown from 8pm tonight amid eight new cases.
Gladys Berejiklian has announced one-week lockdown in Newcastle-Hunter region as Delta spreads to the state’s regions. The NSW outbreak has worsened with 262 new cases and five deaths recorded today.
Queensland has recorded 16 new locally-acquired cases of Covid-19 overnight, all linked to a cluster in Brisbane which has grown to 79.
A group of the nation’s leading health experts including Nick Coatsworth and Ian Frazer has urged Australians to get the AstraZeneca vaccine.
Patrick Commins 11.30pm: ‘We could hit 80pc by November’
Australia could reach 80 per cent vaccination rates and be free of the threat of lockdowns by ­November if it matches the world-leading pace set by Canada, economists say.
Scott Morrison this week said reaching the 70 per cent threshold by the end of the year was ­“absolutely achievable” if “we all turn up to the task and we have a gold medal run till Christmas”.
Jarden chief economist Carlos Cacho said that the pace of vaccination would ramp up in October with the arrival of more Pfizer doses. With the pace of the rollout no longer limited by supply from that point, Mr Cacho then looked at the experience of other advanced economies to project when Australia might reach thresholds laid out by the ­Doherty Institute.

Joseph Lam 10.55pm: Anti-lockdown protest in Melbourne
Hundreds of protesters descended on the Melbourne CBD as Victoria’s sixth lockdown began on Thursday night.
A sea of men and women chanting slurs against Premier Daniel Andrews and calling for his resignation are believed to have met at Flinders St before marching on to Swanston St and circling the CBD.
Protesters were met by dozens of police, some on horseback and carrying capsicum spray.
Video footage and photos from the protest circulating on social media show at least one arrest took place and that at least two flares were lit by the crowd.
Robyn Ironside 10.45pm: Border closures leave tourism on its knees
Tourism operators are facing the most desperate time of the Covid crisis to date with lockdowns and border closures reducing visitors to new lows, triggering urgent calls for help.
Queensland Tourism Industry Council chief Daniel Gschwind said it was definitely the worst time of the pandemic for operators who had seen bookings evaporate in recent weeks, leaving them with no income and little hope.
Throughout the state, losses were mounting, with the Gold Coast missing out on an estimated $250m in visitor expenditure in July, the Sunshine Coast losing $45m a week, the Whitsundays $20m, and Tropical North Queensland $8.6m a day.
“It’s not just suddenly a crisis. It’s a crisis after 18 months of crises,” Mr Gschwind said. “Most businesses have zero forward bookings and for the first time I’m genuinely concerned we will have significant numbers of business failures.”
Those outside of lockdown areas were in an even worse state because they were not eligible for the commonwealth Covid-19 disaster payment.
Mr Gschwind said he had written to the Prime Minister requesting the disaster payment be extended to employees of tourism and hospitality businesses outside of lockdown areas, in the same way the allowance had been made available to airline workers.

AFP 10pm: Virus cases surge in Tokyo
Tokyo has reported another large jump in virus cases, again shattering records, as the government expanded restrictions to eight more regions just days before the Olympics ends.
Tokyo is already under a virus state of emergency but is seeing an exponential growth in cases, driven by the more contagious Delta variant.
On Thursday, the city reported 5042 cases, up from 3865 a week earlier, and 1979 the week before that.
Daily case numbers have also broken records nationwide, topping 14,000 for the first time on Wednesday.
“Infections are spreading with a speed we have never experienced before,” Prime Minister Yoshihide Suga said at a virus taskforce meeting on Thursday.
“With the rapid increase of cases, the number of patients in serious condition, which had been contained, is growing,” he warned.
Japan’s virus outbreak has been comparatively small overall, with around 15,000 deaths and no harsh lockdown measures, but only around a third of the population is fully vaccinated.
Six parts of the country are under a virus emergency, which bans restaurants and bars from selling alcohol and asks them to close by 8:00 pm.
Other parts of Japan are under so-called quasi-emergency measures, with the government expanding those restrictions to another eight areas on Thursday.
The measures also limit opening hours and alcohol sales, but experts have questioned whether any of the restrictions are sufficient.
“At this point in time we really need to introduce some other kind of measures in order to tackle this situation,” warned health expert Koji Wada, a professor at Japan’s International University of Health and Welfare.
The spike comes with the Olympic Games in full swing in Tokyo, taking place largely without spectators.
Organisers have reported 353 cases among Games staff, officials, teams and media since July 1.
But they insist there is no evidence of infection spreading from the Games into Japan.
Helen Trinca 9.15pm: ‘No jab, no job’ open to testing
Fruit and vegetable processor SPC broke no laws when it told staff they had to be vaccinated against Covid-19, but time will tell whether the action is legal.
Ultimately, the decision on whether SPC can run a “no jab, no job” workplace rests with the Fair Work Commission – and even a positive ruling will not necessarily make it easier for other companies to follow suit.
If SPC sacks someone who is not vaccinated, it could face ­action from the employee, with the FWC asked to decide whether the request was “lawful and reasonable”.

Olivia Caisley 8.30pm: Shields and masks ‘the ideal combo’
Health experts are calling for people in Sydney’s Covid-19 hot spots to wear both face shields and masks while they are outside to prevent further transmission of the Delta variant.
As NSW recorded 262 new cases and five deaths on Thursday, ANU epidemiologist Darren Gray said the state should consider mandating masks and face shields to prevent the virus infecting people via their eyes.
At least 45 people were active in the NSW community for the entirety of their infectious ­period, which Premier Gladys Berejiklian said was “the number we are desperate to see reduced”.

AFP 7.45pm: France to offer booster shots to elderly
France will offer Covid booster shots to the elderly and vulnerable from September, joining a growing list of countries offering third vaccine shots to fight new virus variants, President Emmanuel Macron said Thursday.
“Yes, we will probably need a third dose, not for everyone straight away but at any rate for the elderly and the most vulnerable,” Macron said in his latest in a series of explanatory videos on the government’s vaccination drive, adding that it would start in September.

AFP 7pm: Global cases hits 200m
More than 200 million Covid-19 cases have now been registered worldwide since the novel coronavirus emerged in China in December 2019, according to a tally from official sources compiled by news service Agence France-Presse on Thursday.
At least 200,065,905 cases have been officially recorded, but the actual number is believed to be even higher, since a large number of the less severe or asymptomatic cases remain undetected, despite intensified testing in many countries.
The number of infections is rising sharply, driven primarily by the spread of the highly contagious Delta variant, but the number of deaths is increasing at a slower rate, the data showed.
The global average daily number of new infections over the past seven days stands at more than 600,000, an increase of 68 per cent over the seven-day average in mid-June.
At the same time, the average number of daily deaths stands at 9350, an increase of 20 per cent compared with the beginning of July.
The gap between the number of infections and the number of deaths is most noticeable in the countries currently hardest hit by the pandemic.
In the US the number of new cases has exploded by more than 820 per cent, now standing at an average of 94,000 per day compared to 11,000 at the end of June.
But the rise in the daily number of deaths in the US is much slower, climbing 105 per cent to 430 over the same period.
In Britain, where as many as 47,000 new cases have been recorded every day for the past few weeks — a 30-fold increase compared with May — the number of deaths has increased more than ten-fold from six to over 80.
Nevertheless, that is far below record levels seen in January, when Britain’s daily number of deaths shot to 1250.
By contrast, the average daily number of infections in hard-hit Indonesia has fallen by 19 per cent over the past week to 35,000, but the daily number of deaths is up eight percent at 1700.
The current wave in Indonesia is the worst since the outbreak of the pandemic and the country is now recording by far the most daily deaths worldwide.
The difference reflects the inequality in access to vaccines — 58 per cent of Americans and 69 per cent of Britons have received at least one jab, but only 18 percent of Indonesians.
The US health authorities estimate that people who are vaccinated are 25 times less likely to be hospitalised or die from Covid-19 than those who are not.
The novel coronavirus has killed more than 4.25 million people worldwide since the start of the pandemic, but the World Health Organisation estimates that the overall toll could be two to three times higher than official records, due to the excess mortality that is directly and indirectly linked to Covid-19.
Joseph Lam 6.20pm: Cases left in ambulance outside hospital
Two Covid-19 patients could not be admitted to Sydney’s Westmead Hospital because it was too busy, according to Nine News.
One patient reportedly waited in an ambulance outside the hospital in western Sydney for seven hours, while the other waited in an ambulance for four hours.
The hospital said both patients were treated while waiting.
Joseph Lam 5.50pm: New Pfizer goes to victims of cancelled jabs
NSW Health will begin rebooking spots for those who had Covid-19 vaccinations cancelled so Year 12 students in Sydney could be inoculated.
The move comes after the federal government announced NSW would receive an additional 183,690 Pfizer doses over the next two weeks.
“People whose bookings were recently cancelled will be rebooked to ensure they are the first to receive the new doses,” NSW Health said on Thursday.
“NSW Health has begun work on reinstating these bookings and further information will be available soon. We thank everybody for their patience and understanding.”
Remy Varga 5.15pm: Andrews warns of hundreds of cases
Victoria has entered its six lockdown on the anniversary of the peak of its second wave, when the state saw a horrifying 725 cases.
But Premier Daniel Andrews said Victoria would suffer 725 cases in a matter of days if the Delta variant was allowed to let rip in the state.
“I think that, as every Victoria would want us to, we have learnt from every case,” he said.
Remy Varga 5.05pm: Andrews requests more Pfizer
Daniel Andrews says he’s requested extra Pfizer vaccine from the commonwealth after NSW and Queensland received additional supplies.
The Victorian Premier said he was surprised to learn NSW was receiving additional Pfizer.
“We hadn’t been told about that ... that’s fine. They have got a greater need, give them a greater amount of Pfizer.”
Mr Andrews said the amount of additional Pfizer Victoria would receive was yet to be determined but said last week he had asked for an extra 7500 doses.
Remy Varga 4.55pm: New Vic case visited couple who had been in Sydney
Health authorities are investigating links between one of the latest cases and a household involving people who had recently completed hotel quarantine in NSW before returning to Victoria on a “red zone” permit, which required them to quarantine at home for a fortnight.
Victorian Premier Dan Andrews said the visit, potentially in contravention of the rules, was an active line of inquiry for contact tracers but it was unclear who had the virus first.
“There are a couple of people who came back from Sydney, they were in hotel quarantine,” he said.
“It may be the case they have been visited against the rules by someone who is a positive case.
“Whether they got it from them, whether they even have it, we will have to wait and see.
Mr Andrews said a number of close contacts were public housing residents.
Victoria will enter into a week-long lockdown from 8pm on Thursday, Premier Daniel Andrews has announced.
Matthew Denholm 4.53pm: Tasmania shuts quarantin-free border to Victoria
Tasmania has shut its border to quarantine-free arrivals from Victoria for seven days.
Recent arrivals from Victoria would need to immediately self-isolate and contact public health, said Tasmanian Premier Peter Gutwein.
Remy Varga 4.51pm: Andrews won’t say if new case worked while infectious
Victorian Premier Daniel Andrews has declined to confirm if one of the new cases worked while infectious, saying it wouldn’t help to criticise the person.
Instead Mr Andrews said it was crucial Victorians got tested as soon as they began experiencing symptoms and not “waiting for four or five days”.
Mr Andrews then said that while throwing “the book at these people” was easy, it would not help drive numbers down and he couldn’t “change what they have done”.
“It might make us all feel a bit better for a short period of time if we are going after some of these people,” he said.
“I can’t change what they have done, I can only appeal to people and appeal to Victorians to make decisions that aren’t, it’s not about making decisions that are in my best
interests.”
Mr Andrews said people needed to isolate and follow rules prohibiting home visits to family and friends.
“The rules prohibit visiting family and friends in their home for good reason because as we see here, it can do nothing more than contribute to the spread of this virus and add to a lockdown,” he said.
“That is not what we want.”
Joseph Lam 4.45pm: 34-year-old NSW woman dies after getting AZ vaccine
A 34-year-old woman in NSW has died from blood clotting after receiving her first dose of the AstraZeneca Covid-19 vaccine.
The woman, who died on Wednesday, is among three new cases of TTS recorded in the TGA’s weekly Covid-19 report between July 26 and August 1. All three cases were women; the deceased woman and another aged 51 have been confirmed as TTS meanwhile a 67-year-old woman from Victoria has been deemed as likely.
“The TGA extends its sincerest condolences to her family and loved ones. We are in close communication with NSW Health who are undertaking further investigation of this case,” the report said.
The TGA has confirmed a total of 93 cases of TTS following the AstraZeneca vaccine, 57 of which are confirmed and 36 are probable. Of these cases, 51 were women and 42 were men.
“In Australia, severe cases of TTS appear to be more common in women in younger age groups,” the report said. “Nearly half of the TTS cases in women required treatment in intensive care.”
“Cases meeting the criteria for Tier 1 were also twice as likely to occur in women compared to men.”
Five of the six deaths linked to TTS have been women aged 34, 48 (two cases), 52 and 72. A man who died of TTS was 44.
Remy Varga 4.36pm: Regions included in Victoria’s snap lockdown
Victorian Premier Daniel Andrews says the regions will be included in the snap seven-day lockdown to prevent the virus bleeding from Melbourne.
Mr Andrews acknowledged “it was painful” for the regions to be locked down but said contact tracers needed time to prevent the Delta variant spreading across the state.
“We don’t want this taking hold in country Victoria... None of us are happy to be here but these are the realities we face,” he said.
“None of us have the luxury of ignoring them.”
Remy Varga 4.33pm: Further business support for Victoria revealed tomorrow
Victorian Premier Daniel Andrews has flagged further business support will be announced on Friday.
Alluding to the NSW Covid-19 crisis, Mr Andrews said Victoria had no choice other than a snap lockdown.
“Just look at what is happening in other parts of the country... that will happen here,” he said.
“We don’t want that. That’s why these difficult decisions have been made.
“Nothing about this is optional. This is a lockdown, it will be enforced.”
Mr Andrews said lockdowns would be required less when more of the population had been vaccinated.
Victoria will enter another snap lockdown for seven days from 8pm tonight.
Remy Varga 4.24pm: Andrews confirms Victoria’s sixth lockdown
Victorian Premier Daniel Andrews has confirmed the state will enter its sixth lockdown from 8pm tonight.
The lockdown will last seven days. There will be five reasons to leave home and schools will be closed.
“We’ve been through that long lockdown, we don’t want to go back to that,” Mr Andrews said.
It comes as Victoria recorded eight cases, including five mystery cases, on Thursday.
Mr Andrews said the decision to lockdown at 8pm, and not 11.59pm as custom, was to avoid transmission through last drinks scenarios.
Rachel Baxendale 4.07pm: Lockdown announcement expected shortly
Victorian Premier Daniel Andrews, Health Minister Martin Foley, Covid logistics chief Jeroen Weimar and an acting chief health officer are expected to announce a lockdown at 4.15pm.
The stay-at-home orders are expected to apply from as early as 8pm tonight, and to last for at least seven days.
Rachel Baxendale 3.44pm: Details of Victoria’s sixth lockdown being confirmed
A meeting of Victoria’s crisis council of cabinet is currently underway, at which the length and timing of what will be the state’s sixth lockdown are being confirmed.
The Australian understands ministers were told a short time ago that a lockdown will be imposed.
Rachel Baxendale 3.41pm: String of new exposure sites in Melbourne’s west
A string of new coronavirus exposure sites in Melbourne’s west have been added to the Victorian health department website on Thursday afternoon.
The sites include male toilets in a shopping centre in Caroline Springs, a poultry shop in Laverton North, and a gym and Aldi supermarket in Altona North.
A listing has also been added for the Spectacle Hub optometrist in the Caroline Springs CS Square shopping centre on July 27, implying that authorities believe a case may have been infectious there as early as Tuesday last week.
Earlier the optometrist was listed for Thursday July 29, Friday July 30, Monday August 2 and Tuesday August 3.
More information is available on the health department website.
Adeshola Ore 3.13pm: Minister stands by commuter carpark scheme
Urban Infrastructure Minister Paul Fletcher has stood by the federal government’s commuter car parks scheme, which has come under fire following accusations of pork-barreling.
A scathing report by the Auditor-General into the $660 million scheme found almost 90 per cent of the funded projects were in targeted or Coalition-held seats, and none of the 47 car park projects were recommended by the department. Then-urban infrastructure minister Alan Tudge’s o ffice kept a spreadsheet of the top 20 marginal electorates to track projects for the Coalition’s scheme.
Labor used question time on Thursday to attack the Morrison government for the scheme. Bur Mr Fletcher reiterated that Mr Tudge was “acting within his authority” as minister.
“The Auditor-General’s report also makes it perfectly clear, Mr Speaker, under the project, the Australian government may commit funding to an investment project at any time based on information it deems appropriate,” he said.

Rachel Baxendale 3.07pm: Pop-up Pfizer clinic set up at Islamic school
The Andrews government has established a pilot pop-up Pfizer vaccination clinic at the Islamic school at the centre of Victoria’s latest coronavirus cases.
Education Minister James Merlino told question time in state parliament on Wednesday afternoon all staff, students and family members aged 16 and over at Al-Taqwa College would be offered Pfizer vaccinations at the same time as they are being tested for the virus at the school Melbourne’s outer southwest..
“The availability of Pfizer for the program is made possible, Speaker, following Victoria’s decision to revise the recommended Pfizer second dose interval to six weeks, and this pilot program will provide the department with data regarding pop-up vaccination coverage, which will inform future vaccine programs, once more supply becomes available,” Mr Merlino said.
One of the largest coronavirus clusters of Victoria’s second wave was linked to Al-Taqwa college, infecting 113 students, staff and family members.
About 2500 students and staff travel to the school from all over Melbourne, including from public housing towers in Melbourne’s inner north and west which were last year locked down amid Covid outbreaks.
Many households associated with the school are larger than average and many of the parents work in essential industries such as logistics and food processing.
Adeshola Ore 2.47pm: All lockdowns are hard, Morrison says
Scott Morrison says lockdowns are always “difficult decisions”, as Victorians await to hear if they will be plunged into the state’s sixth lockdown.
During question time, Labor pressed the Prime Minister on why he had previously praised NSW Premier Gladys Berejiklian for resisting a lockdown earlier in the state’s Covid-19 outbreak.
“Over the course of the past 18 months the premiers across the country, chief ministers and I have worked together to ensure that in this country we have one the lowest rates of death as a result of Covid of any country in the world,” Mr Morrison said.
He said NSW had been unable to avoid going into a lockdown to attempt to contain its outbreak.

Dennis Shanahan 2.19pm: PM comes close to criticising Berejiklian
Scott Morrison has gone as close as he ever has to criticising Gladys Berejiklian’s handling of the Covid-19 outbreak and lockdown and declared he won’t favour NSW over Victoria or Queensland in a state-of-origin fight for vaccines.
Prime Minister Scott Morrison Scott Morrison says the decision for Victoria to enter its sixth lockdown will be made “on the best possible information and advice” available and federal support will be available. “Where state governments are taking those decisions, then obviously our support with the COVID Disaster Assistance Payments kicks right in,” he said. Mr Morrison said in Victoria a total of $214.5 million has already been paid to those “who have had to go through those lockdowns”. “My message, whether in Victoria or anywhere else, state government will make their decision, they’ll do it in a timely way, they’ll consider all the issues they need to manage. “I believe they’ll make a decision which is in the best public health interests of their state.”
With NSW facing a record outbreak, five new deaths and bitter fighting between Sydney and regions over vaccination availability, the Prime Minister has rejected the NSW Premier’s emphasis on vaccinations over lockdowns.
Morrison said he will not provide running commentary and criticism of the Premier’s actions but what he did say made it clear he does not accept the NSW government’s claims about vaccine being the key to getting out of lockdown nor is he going to strip vaccines from other
states to help Berejiklian more than he’s helped Victoria and Queensland.

JARED LYNCH 2.07pm: Union decries ‘unrealistic’ SPC vax mandate
The Australian Manufacturing Workers’ Union has criticised fruit and vegetable processor, SPC, over its plans to ban workers and visitors who fail to get vaccinated by November, slamming it as “unrealistic”.
The AMWU said it was not “properly” consulted over SPC plans. It is understood SPC informed the union about the mandatory vaccinations on Wednesday - the same day Sydney recorded 262 new infections and five deaths, while Melbourne sweated on a potential sixth lockdown.
AMWU national president Andrew Dettmer said SPC’s requirement for staff to have their first jab booked within six weeks was “unrealistic”, with many not yet eligible for a vaccination.
The union’s action is the first shot in what is looming to become the biggest workplace issue of the year as businesses - at the request of the government - step up to ensure at least 70 per cent of the country is vaccinated to eradicate lockdowns.
“The SPC are not showing workers that they are genuinely willing to consult with them over a planned vaccine rollout,” Mr Dettmer said.
“The issue isn’t people’s willingness to get the vaccine, it’s accessibility. The responsibility for the Morrison Government’s failing rollout shouldn’t be shifted onto the shoulders of working people.

Adeshola Ore 1.17pm: Lockdown key to ending Sydney’s misery: PM
Scott Morrison has reiterated that lockdown is key to Sydney emerging from its Covid-19 outbreak, after the state reported 262 new cases of the virus.
“The primary tool to end the lockdown in Sydney is the success of the lockdown in Sydney,” he said.
“The virus doesn’t move by itself. People staying at home ensures that the virus doesn’t move.”
The commonwealth is providing an additional 180,000 Pfizer doses to NSW as it battles the highly infectious Delta strain.
New South Wales has recorded 262 local coronavirus cases - the highest daily number in the state since the pandemic begun - along with five additional deaths on Thursday. Of the 262 new local cases, 110 were fully isolating, while an additional 43 were infectious in the community, and 80 cases are under inquiry. There were 130 unlinked cases in Thursday's figures. Of the five new deaths experienced in the state, three men were in their 60s, there was a man in his 70s and a woman in her 80s.
Asked if companies should mandate Covid-19 jabs for employees, Mr Morrison said “businesses have to make choices.”
The Australian revealed that food and vegetable processor SPC has given staff and contractors six weeks to schedule their first vaccine dose before they are barred from coming to work.
“In a business, that business, at the end of the day, will wear costs of having to do the clean-downs of facilities and the various other things that could happen as a result of an outbreak or something like that nature in their premises,” Mr Morrison said.

Remy VArga 12.32pm: Victorian close contacts expected to explode to 10,000
Victorian Health Minister Martin Foley says he expects the number of close contacts to explode to 10,000 in possibly hours.
Mr Foley said thousands of people had already been potentially exposed at the al-Taqwa college as well as their families and members of the student communities.
Premier Dan Andrews has remained coy on the prospect of Victoria entering into a sharp lockdown but says the government’s priority is to avoid COVID-19 cases “getting out of control like they are in Sydney”. With the origins of the latest outbreak still under investigation, speculation is rife the state will be forced into lockdown after recording a further two cases from midnight on Wednesday. Premier Andrews said it was “too early to say” if a lockdown was needed with officials still yet to hear back on test results and genomic sequencing. “It’s too early to say what will happen in relation to these cases,” he told reporters. “What I can indicate, obviously, is that the government’s priority is to avoid what’s going on in Sydney - we have got to do everything we can to avoid cases getting out of control like they are in Sydney. “We’re still waiting, as I said, on interviews, on tests results, genomic sequencing, there’s a lot of work going on this morning and there’ll be more of it going on throughout the day. “If and when I have more information to share with you and the Victorian community, I will.”
“We would imagine given our understanding of the [al-Taqwa school community] that we will very quickly pass five to ten thousand close contacts in hours if not days,” he said.
Mr Weimar said two other schools had closed as a precautionary measure due to links with al-Taqwa college.
He said none of three mystery cases had visited any of the exposure sites.

Remy Varga 12.16pm: Jabs our way out of jail, GP tells his community
Former Australian Medical Association president Dr Mukesh Haikerwal has urged people to come forward for testing and vaccination.
Dr Haikerwal operates a GP clinic in Altona North, which sits in the southwest region of Melbourne where cases and exposure sites are quickly multiplying.
He said vaccination was the only way to overcome the pandemic and said it was crucial people came forward for the jab.
“That is our way out of jail,” he said. “We’ve got to get vaccinated,”
Remy Varga 12.12pm: Victoria adds two more cases linked to Islamic school
Victoria’s Covid-19 logistics commander Jeroen Weimar has announced two new additional cases, both linked to the positive al-Taqwa college teacher.
This brings the number of cases recorded in Victoria on Thursday to eight but the numbers will be part of Friday’s count.
Mr Weimar said around 2,500 staff and students, including 300 closely linked to the teacher, would need to isolate for 14-days.
Mr Weimar said the parents and family members of students and staff would have to isolate for 14-days.
“Not only the children that attend the school but anyone they lived in must isolate for 14 days,” he said.
Remy Varga 12.09pm: Expect more exposure sites, Victorians warned
Victorian Health Minister Martin Foley has warned the state to expect more exposure sites after the state recorded six new cases, including three mystery cases.
Mr Foley said there are “multiple thousands” of close contacts after positive cases visited the Elite Performance Gym in Spotswood and a football club in Newport.
Mr Foley said a testing site had been established at the Al-Taqwa Islamic school, which last year saw one of the biggest outbreaks of the second wave.
Of the three new mystery cases, one is a Maribyrnong man in his 20s who tested positive late last night. The source of acquisition remains under investigation. He works in a warehouse in Derrimut and lives with one other person.
The other two mystery cases is a teacher at the Al-Taqwa school and a household contact. The pair live in Hobsons Bay.
“We started off yesterday with no cases and now 24-hours later we have at least three unlinked cases,” Mr Foley said.
The three remaining cases are linked to a traffic controller who worked at the Moonee Valley testing site.
Rachel Baxendale 12.06am: Don’t bank on restrictions easing: Andrews
Victorian Premier Daniel Andrew has told journalists at the back door of state parliament that “no one should be banking on restrictions easing next Tuesday”.
Mr Andrews said he had no announcements to make yet regarding a lockdown, as meetings and case interviews continue.
The Premier timed his entry to parliament ahead of question time to coincide with his Health Minister Martin Foley’s Covid press conference.
Ellie Dudley 11.58am: NSW health system under stress: Hazzard
NSW Health Minister Brad Hazzard said there was “no doubt” the NSW health system was “under stress”.
A total of 21 deaths associated with the latest outbreak have been recorded in NSW.
Up to 209 people are in hospital, with 51 people in intensive care, 24 of which are requiring ventilation.
“There’s no doubt the health system is under stress because we have a massive battle. A war with the virus,” Mr Hazzard said.
“That to last night, has taken 21 lives just in this current outbreak and a quarter of those were literally in the last 24 hours.
“So, yeah, we’re - the health team are under stress.”
Premier Gladys Berejiklian says Prime Minister Scott Morrison personally advised her New South Wales will receive an addition 180,000 Pfizer doses in the next fortnight which will make a “big difference” in containing the spread. “I also want to stress that yesterday, after a number of conversations with the prime minister, that I was advised by him directly that NSW will be receiving an extra 180,000 doses of Pfizer, which is good news, over the next fortnight, commencing in the week 9th of August and the 16th of August,” she said. “This is very positive news. It means that in the week of the 16th of August, we can redirect those doses we'd taken from the regions for the HSC students and it also means we can put the balance into those eight local government areas in Greater Sydney of concern in particular. “So I'm very relieved about that. I want to thank the prime minister for those extra doses on top of what we've already been allocated. “That will make a big difference in us containing the spread.”
However, Mr Hazzard said because the health system was “very big”, hospitals are managing the extra work.
“It’s a very big system. And there are priority areas. ICUs, intensive care units, are priority areas,” he said.
“I was advised yesterday or the day before that Westmead was under pressure. But there are normally 36 beds in the intensive care unit there. The only reduction is to 32, which I thank the staff for all the work they’re doing there.”

Ellie Dudley 11.47am: Berejiklian searching for ‘positive’ vax incentives
NSW Premier Gladys Berejiklian said the government was looking at “more positive” incentives for those who receive the Covid-19 vaccine.
Asked whether she would consider a “no jab, no work” policy for workers, Ms Berejiklian said she would rather implement incentives which were “more positive”.
NSW Covid Exposure Sites
“(Perhaps) to say classes of employees can go back if they’ve had the vaccination,” she said.
“We’re considering those options. I don’t want to rule anything out. Our decisions will be based on health advice and what is critical.”
Ms Berejiklian said the government would feel “more comfortable” relaxing restrictions on work on August 29 if “as many people as possible” were vaccinated.

Ellie Dudley 11.35am: Year 12 NSW students first in line for Pfizer
NSW chief health officer Kerry Chant said year 12 students aged over 18 in Sydney would receive the Pfizer vaccine, not AstraZeneca, because it is “easier”.
All NSW residents aged over 18 have been encouraged to get any vaccination that is available to them.
Premier Gladys Berejiklian says New South Wales has seen five COVID-related deaths in the past 24 hours as the state recorded 262 new local cases with at least 45 infectious in the community. “I do also sadly want to report that five people lost their lives with COVID to this point in time, in the last 24 hours,” she said. “Three people in their 60s, one person in their 70s, one person in their 80s and, of course, we extend our deepest condolences to all of their loved ones at the tragic loss. “It's horrible that, during this time, families are losing their loved ones. “I do also want to convey that unfortunately four out of those five people were not vaccinated at all and one person had one dose of AstraZeneca. “So again, no one who’s died has had both doses of vaccine.”
Asked why HSC students over the age of 18 are being prioritised for the Pfizer vaccine, Dr Chant said it “is much easier to use one vaccine.”
“We’re keen to get vaccines in arms as quickly as possible,” she said.
Rachel Baxendale 11.32am: Andrews team debating lockdown #6 for Victoria
The Andrews government and health authorities are deliberating over whether to send Victoria into its sixth lockdown.
The discussions come after Victoria recorded six new coronavirus cases in the 24 hours to midnight on Wednesday, three of which are yet to be linked to known outbreaks.
The Australian understands more positive test results have since been received by the health department.
Victorian Health Minister Martin Foley , Covid-19 logistics chief Jeroen Weimar and former AMA president Mukesh Haikerwal are due to address the media at 11.45am.
Dr Haikerwal runs a GP practice in Altona North, in close proximity to communities affected by the latest cases.
However, any announcement about a snap lockdown is not expected until later on Thursday.
The latest cases include a teacher in her 20s who works at Al-Taqwa College in Truganina in Melbourne’s outer southwest, and her husband, who works as an optometrist in Caroline Springs in the outer west.
Transport workers should be added to the “priority queue” after a survey revealed one in two are not vaccinated despite half of them working in hotspots, according to Transport Workers Union National Secretary Michael Kaine. “This is a large survey of truckies, you’ve got couriers, rideshare workers, food delivery riders, bus drivers and of course they’ve been some of the heroes of the pandemic,” he told Sky News Australia. Mr Kaine said work hours and fatigue rules make it difficult for transport workers to access the vaccine. “They don’t have the luxury of just picking and choosing," he said. "They’ve got vaccination hubs that are open from eight till four. Transport workers work around the clock. “They’ve got fatigue rules that they have to comply with and of course a high majority of them unfortunately in our modern economy are casualised or working as contractors. “So getting vaccination if they don’t have paid vaccination leave means they’ve got a decision about whether they feed their families or get the vaccine. “So there’s some barriers here that we have to lift and we’ve got to get them in the priority queue as quickly as we can.”
The couple live in the Hobson’s Bay area in the inner southwest, and the husband played AFL football for the local Newport club over the weekend while likely infectious.
More than 15 exposure sites have been listed in throughout Melbourne’s western suburbs since the teacher’s case emerged late on Wednesday.

Ellie Dudley 11.20am: Virus detected as far away as Dubbo, Armidale
Chief health officer Kerry Chant said she was “very concerned” about the spread of Covid-19 into regional NSW after sewage detection found traces of the virus in Dubbo and Armidale.
“No-one can be complacent,” she said.
“Whilst we have allowed rural New South Wales to continue a range of activities which are not available to people in Sydney, we need to make sure that you are still vigilant about signs and symptoms, getting tested.”
Low levels of the virus have been detected in Armidale sewage tracing previously, but Dr Chant said the levels had increased.
NSW Vaccine Locator
NSW Premier Gladys Berejiklian said Pfizer doses taken from the regions to vaccinate year 12 students will be replaced in mid-August.
The doses were redirected from regional NSW - including the central coast and south coast - to inoculate HSC students in high risk areas of Sydney, causing outrage in rural areas.
Ms Berejiklian said the doses would be replaced in the week beginning August 16.
“That’s because the Prime Minister informed me personally last night that he was able to provide an extra 180,000 doses to New South Wales over the next two weeks,” Ms Berejiklian said.
“I’m very grateful for that because, as you know, a key priority of our Government is to make sure every student can sit the HSC.
“It’s a legal requirement for every student to sit a public examination process.”
Ms Berejiklian spoke to objections from the NSW Teachers Federation who claim it would be “premature” to allow year 12 students back to school.
“I don’t think anybody in this state would disagree that our priority should be having Year 12 complete their HSC in as safe and as timely a way as possible,” Ms Berejiklian said.
Ellie Dudley 11.07am: Hunter region goes into 7-day lockdown
The Hunter and upper Hunter regions will enter a seven day lockdown after high levels of the virus and “some cases” were found in the area, premier Gladys Berejiklian said.
“There will be a one-week lockdown in the Hunter and upper Hunter region,” she said.
“The local government areas impacted are Newcastle, Lake Macquarie, Maitland, Port Stephens, Cessnock, Dungog, Singleton and Muswellbrook.
NED-3760-NSW’s new COVID restrictions
“That will commence at 5.00pm tonight and go until midnight next Thursday.”
The eight LGAs affected will live under the same restrictions currently enforced in the greater Sydney, central coast, Wollongong and Shellharbour regions.
Five people in the Hunter region have tested positive for Covid-19, the source of which health authorities are attributing to a “gathering” on Blacksmiths Beach.
“Currently Hunter New England is providing care and support to five people that were diagnosed (with the virus),” chief health officer Kerry Chant said.
“While the source of infection continues to be investigated we think the source originated from a gathering on Blacksmiths Beach on Friday night, believed to be the source of the initial cases.”
Two of the cases are students at Maitland Christian School, which has since been closed for cleaning.
Dr Chant said she believed some people from greater Sydney were present at the beach gathering which is how the virus was introduced.
Ellie Dudley 11.10am: NSW records 262 new cases, 5 deaths
NSW has recorded 262 new locally-acquired cases of Covid-19 as infections in greater Sydney continue to spread.
New daily cases in New South Wales
At least 45 cases were active in the community for the entirety of their infectious period, which Premier Gladys Berejiklian said is “the number we are desperate to see reduced.”
Up to 107,000 tests were conducted in the 24 hours to 8pm last night.
Five deaths associated with NSW’s latest outbreak have been recorded in the past 24 hours, Ms Berejiklian said.
“Three people in their 60s, one person in their 70s, one person in their 80s and, of course, we extend our deepest condolences to all of their loved ones at the tragic loss,” Ms BErejiklian said.
“I want to convey that unfortunately four out of those five people were not vaccinated at all and one person had one dose of AstraZeneca.”
Ms Berejiklian announced a one-week lockdown in Newcastle-Hunter region as virus spreads to state’s regions.

Charlie Peel 10.39am: Hopes boosted for Queensland lockdown to end
Queensland’s chief health officer Jeannette Young says the results of the lockdown in the state’s southeast have surpassed her expectations, boosting hope that stay-at-home restrictions could be lifted on Sunday.
Only four of the state’s 16 new cases were infectious while in the community, down from 14 infectious community cases on Wednesday.
“There were only those four cases today that were out and about during the infectious period and between the four of them, there were only five days that they were out in the community while infectious,” Dr Young said.
Queensland Deputy Premier Steven Miles has thanked the thousands of people who are in home quarantine saying they are “doing a service to all Queenslanders”. “I want to speak now directly to the 7766 people who are in home quarantine, subject to home quarantine directions, and I want to thank them for what they are doing for all of us,” Mr Miles said during a media conference on Thursday. “They are our first line of defence against this outbreak. “They are doing a service to all Queenslanders.”’ On Thursday it was announced there were 16 new community cases of COVID-19 in the state.
“Of those five days, all happened while we were in that lockdown so that should have minimal interactions but of course we will work with them and see where they
were and will put up those exposure venues on our website.
“So this is excellent.”
Dr Young said the decreased risk of community exposure had given her hope the lockdown could end on Sunday, which she said would be the “quickest response to any cluster anywhere”.
“This is fantastic news, we did not expect to be this far in front of the virus,” she said.
“This is Queensland coming together brilliantly and working with us.
“We have still got a long way to go but we have done really, really, really well until now so let’s see how we go in the next few days.
“Let’s see if we can lift those restrictions on Sunday. That would be extremely special to be able to do that on Sunday and I am hopeful we can.”

Ellie Dudley 10.30am: Virus speads to NSW central coast
Four cases of Covid-19 have been detected on the NSW central coast.
Two of the new cases were reported this morning, in school students at Lake Munmorah Public School.
Morisset High School has also been closed for deep cleaning after a student tested positive, understood to be a sibling of the two students at Lake Munmorah, Member for Wyong David Harris said.
He understands the three students caught the virus from their father.
Mr Harris said the community was “furious” Pfizer vaccines had been taken from the area to vaccinate HSC students in south-west and western Sydney, especially in light of the latest cases.
“We’ve been in lockdown, the same as greater Sydney, and when we asked it we could be let out we were told there was still a risk,” he said
“So if we are still at risk, why are our vaccines being taken?”
Mr Harris’ wife is a teacher at Lake Munmorah Public School, whose Pfizer vaccine appointment was cancelled due to the repurposed doses.
“It’s nothing against the HSC kids, but if you consider us to be part of the lockdown and part of the issue then why are you taking these resources away?” he said.

Charlie Peel 10.17am: Sunshine State to get extra 112,000 Pfizer doses
The federal government will deliver an extra 112,000 doses of the Pfizer vaccine to Queensland to help curb the state’s escalating outbreak.
The Pfizer delivery will be in addition to the extra 150,000 AstraZeneca doses expected to be delivered to Queensland pharmacists in the next week.
“Last night, the Prime Minister phoned the Premier and they have had a very productive conversation,” Deputy Premier Steven Miles said.
AstraZeneca v Pfizer - Doherty
“The result is that the Commonwealth will bring forward the delivery of some Pfizer
vaccines allocated to Queensland for September and bringing those forward to August.
“They are not additional vaccines but they will allow for Queensland health to do more vaccinations in August so that is very good news and it is great to be able to work collaboratively with the commonwealth to be able to support Queenslanders.”
Health Minister Yvette D’Ath said half of the extra Pfizer vaccines were expected to arrive next week and the rest the following week.
The Queensland government will be sending AstraZeneca vaccines to pharmacies from today.

Charlie Peel 10.07am: Queensland records 16 new cases, 3 infectious in community
Queensland has recorded 16 new locally-acquired cases of Covid-19 overnight, all linked to a cluster in Brisbane which has grown to 79.
All of the new cases are linked to schools in Brisbane’s inner west but only three of the cases spent time in the community while infectious.
Deputy Premier Steven Miles said it was “very encouraging” news.
“The 16 locally acquired cases are all directly linked to the Indooroopilly outbreak that we have been monitoring,” he said.
“It is encouraging the fact that of the cases reported today, only three were infectious in the community for one day and one was infectious for two days.
“Three on the 31st (of July), one on the 30th and 31st, the other 12 were in quarantine throughout the entire infectious period so the fact they are all linked and mostly were in quarantine is a positive development as well.”

Adeshola Ore 9.48am: No Indigenous Covid deaths significant: PM
Scott Morrison has said the fact that no Indigenous people had died from Covid-19 in Australia was “one of the most significant achievements Australia has had.”
“Indigenous Australians have been six times less likely to contract COVID-19 in the wider population. That shows what happens when we work in partnership but we must invest in the capabilities of such partnership,” he said.
Mr Morrison is delivering his Closing the Gap speech in parliament this morning.
The Prime Minister paid tribute to 65,000 years of “stewardship by the original custodians of this land.”
“We pay respect to the Ngunnawal people, first nations across the land and to elders past and present and emerging,” he said.
Mr Morrison also paid tribute to Pat Turner , lead convenor of the Coalition of Peaks which negotiated a a new national agreement on Closing the Gap.
Mr Morrison announced the commonwealth’s $378m redress scheme which will provide a one-off $75,000 payment to thousands of Indigenous Australians who were removed from their families as children and taken to commonwealth-run facilities.
He said it would recognise the harm inflicted on children from the Stolen Generation and give each survivor the opportunity to tell their story and receive an individual apology.
“To say formally, not just that we are deeply sorry for what happened but that we will take responsibility for it,” he said.

Ellie Dudley 9.35am: Leaders from Covid-hit state set to deliver updates
State authorities from across Australia will provide Covid-19 updates this morning to inform the public of the evolving outbreaks.
Queensland Deputy Premier Steven Miles , Health Minister Yvette D’Ath and chief health officer Jeannette Young will front the media at 10am, following reports of 16 new cases of Covid-19 on Wednesday.
Concerns continue to rise for the far north of the state where a reef pilot tested positive for the highly-infectious Delta variant of the virus.
Shadow Finance Minister Katy Gallagher says the death of a 27-year-old Sydney man has “sobered up” the discussions surrounding the risk of COVID and its impact on families. “First I’d like to extend my condolences to the family of that young man and his wife,” she told Sky News Australia. “it must have been a terribly awful, distressing, situation, and I think has really sobered up the discussion about the risk of COVID, what it means for families and I think some of the pressures people in Sydney in particular are under at the moment. “I think part of the issue we’ve got here is supply of course. “I think there’s a willingness of people to get vaccinated. “I know a lot of young people under the age of 40 are wanting to get vaccinated but are struggling to get appointments and I think that’s a real issue.”
The pilot is believed to have picked up the virus from a ship and is not connected to the existing outbreak in southeast Queensland.
He had been fully vaccinated and carried little amounts of the virus.
NSW Premier Gladys Berejiklian will provide an update for her state at 11am, following the detection of 233 locally acquired cases on Wednesday.
At least 47 cases were active in the community for the entirety of their infectious period.
Ms Berejiklian will speak alongside Health Minister Brad Hazzard and chief health officer Kerry Chant , as the state authorities continue to plead with NSW residents to be vaccinated as soon as possible.
Victorian authorities are also expected to speak this morning, after the state recorded six new cases of Covid-19 this morning.

Adeshola Ore 9.25am: Climate activists protest at Frydenberg’s office
Extinction Rebellion activists are staging a protest outside Josh Frydenberg’s electoral office in Melbourne, demanding the government drop its appeal against a landmark climate change ruling.
Environment Minister Sussan Ley is appealing a Federal Court ruling which said she owed children a duty of care to protect them from being harmed or killed by carbon emissions when considering the approval of a coal mine expansion. The case, launched by a group of teenagers, centred on Whitehaven Coal’s plans to extend its Vickery mine in northwestern New South Wales.
Videos posted on Twitter show the activists holding banners which read “Josh Frydenberg failing to protect us.”
“Supported by parents and grandparents, rebels have locked-on to the door and super glued themselves to windows because the government is failing its duty of care to young people,” Extinction Rebellion Australia said on Twitter.

Rachel Baxendale 9.04am: Victoria records six new local virus cases
Victoria has recorded six new locally acquired coronavirus cases in the 24 hours to midnight on Wednesday.
New daily cases in Victoria, from July 10, 2021
“Of the six new locally-acquired cases, investigations are continuing into three cases (including one reported yesterday),” Victoria’s health department said.
“The remaining three cases are all linked to the current outbreaks and were in quarantine during their infectious period.”
The latest cases include that of a teacher in her 20s from Hobson’s Bay, in Melbourne’s inner southwest, who works at Al-Taqwa College, in Truganina Melbourne’s outer southwest.
The same school was at the centre of one of Melbourne’s largest coronavirus clusters of 113 cases during Victoria’s second wave last year.
About 2500 students and staff travel to the school from all over Melbourne, including from public housing towers in Melbourne’s inner north and west which were last year locked down amid Covid outbreaks.
Many households associated with the school are larger than average and many of the parents work in essential industries such as logistics and food processing.
Two other Islamic schools, namely Ilim College and Australian International Academy, both in Melbourne’s north, have also closed as a precaution, although neither have yet confirmed cases.
The teacher was tested on Tuesday and returned a positive result on Wednesday.
Authorities believe she may have been infectious as early as the previous Wednesday.
She worked Wednesday, Thursday and Friday last week, attending a Coles supermarket in Yarraville in Melbourne’s inner southwest on Thursday, but staying home from work due to symptoms from Monday.
The teacher’s husband is also understood to have tested positive, and to have played AFL football for the local Newport club over the weekend.
Donut day celebrations short-lived
Thursday’s six cases, including three mysteries, follow short-lived celebrations after Victoria reached zero cases on Wednesday, for the first time since the state’s fifth lockdown.
Earlier, Victoria had four locally-acquired cases on Tuesday, two on Monday, four on Sunday, two on Saturday, three on Friday, and an outbreak peak of 26 on Thursday July 22.
Only one of the 15 cases over the six days to Wednesday had not been in quarantine for the duration of their infectious period.
Victoria’s total number of community acquired cases since two incursions from NSW emerged almost four weeks ago is now 226.
There are currently 80 active cases, including up to four active cases acquired overseas.
At least 142 of those infected during the current outbreaks have recovered, and more are expected to do so in coming days.
As of Wednesday, there were nine people in Victorian hospitals with coronavirus, including two in intensive care on ventilators.
The latest cases come after 27,279 tests were processed on Wednesday, down from on Tuesday but up from 22,217 on Monday, 21,417 on Sunday and 25,779 on Saturday.
However, the latest testing numbers are well down on last Friday’s 32,760 tests, last Thursday’s 43,542 and Victoria’s testing record is 59,355 tests on July 20.
Adeshola Ore 8.55am: ‘Anyone in food industry should be getting jabbed’
Tasmanian senator Jacqui Lambie has commended SPC for becoming the first Australian company outside of healthcare to mandate Covid-19 jabs for all staff and visitors.
The Australian revealed that the food and vegetable processor has given staff and contractors six weeks to schedule their first vaccine dose before they are barred from coming to work.
Senator Lambie said other companies should follow in SPC’s footsteps, in a bid to stamp out lockdowns by boosting vaccination rates.
“There’ll be some people out there that can’t because of medical reasons, but anyone in that food industry should be having vaccines,” she told Sky News.
“I applaud SPC for having the courage and the guts to be the first ones to make a move on this.”

Ellie Dudley 8.48am: ACT opens Pfizer vaccinations to under 40s
The ACT has opened up Pfizer vaccinations for those under the age of 40, causing a rush of eager residents to book in their jabs.
The territory has started offering the general public in the 30-39 age group the vaccine, with 20,000 people booked in on the first day they became eligible.
COVID-19 Australia: Cumulative vaccinations by state
“It was the equivalent for booking for a Taylor Swift concert, I was told,” ACT Chief Minister Andrew Barr told ABC Radio National.
“It shows that if you’ve got the vaccine supply, young people are very keen to get vaccinated,” he said.
He said the territory’s program had been “very, very efficient” due to the “incredibly” strong uptake of the AstraZeneca vaccine among the older population.
At least 93 per cent of 70-79 year olds in the ACT have “essentially” received the AstraZeneca jab, he said.

Jared Lynch 8.32am: SPC first company to mandate Covid vax for all staff
Fruit and vegetable processor SPC has become the first company in the country to mandate Covid-19 vaccines for all onsite staff and visitors.
All 450 onsite workers of the Shepparton-based cannery must be fully vaccinated by November, in what is thought to be a legal test-case for Australia.
“We believe that the only way that we can get out and protect our employees and our customers, and the communities in which we work is to go to the vaccine,” SPC chair Hussein Rifai told ABC News Breakfast .
Staff will be provided paid vaccination leave and up to two days of special leave to recover if they become unwell after receiving the shot.
They have six weeks to book their first vaccination or risk being barred from working onsite.
SPC’s move comes as Westpac and CBA commence trials of vaccinating staff in eight Sydney hotspot LGAs.
Vaccination mandates have also already been introduced in some healthcare settings.

Ellie Dudley 7.53am: Queensland lockdown will extend beyond Sunday
Australian Medical Association Queensland President Chris Perry says the state’s lockdown will not end as scheduled on Sunday.
Queensland recorded 16 new cases of the virus on Wednesday, growing the state’s cluster to the largest since the first wave.

While Dr Perry said he hoped the curve was flattening, the state would not end the already-extended lockdown on Sunday as planned.
“We won’t open up on Sunday but we could open halfway through next week or another week’s time,” he said.
“We will just have to see the numbers.”
Dr Perry said vaccines were the key to opening up because the virus would likely “come up from NSW” even if the current outbreak stops.

Ellie Dudley 7.37am: 185,000 extra Pfizer doses to help Sydney
The head of Australia’s Covid-19 task force has said the 185,000 new doses of Pfizer being sent to Sydney would assist the state government in having high-risk areas inoculated sooner.
Lieutenant General John Frewen said the “intent” of 185,000 doses of the Pfizer vaccine shipped to Sydney would be to support south-west and west Sydney.
COVID-19 Taskforce Commander Lieutenant General John Frewen says vaccine incentives may be discussed later in the rollout as currently “demand is still exceeding supply”. “I have said incentives is something we will consider but right now Australians are coming forward, in the last seven days, we've have had 1.2 million doses going into people’s arms,” he said. Lieutenant General Frewen said incentives may be introduced to get “some of the more hesitant” groups to get inoculated and “positive alternatives” are being considered. “There's cash, there's the ideas of lotteries, all these things have been discussed but what is resonating with people right now really is being able to get back to the sort of lifestyle we used to enjoy.”
“We are talking with NSW authorities all the time and I know they have been given priority to those areas, and we have also been working with GPs and pharmacists,” Lieutenant Frewen told Sunrise.
Lieutenant General Frewen also threw his support behind vaccination passports, claiming they were “the future going forward.”
“Ultimately achieving those high levels of vaccination allows us to get back to some of those freedoms that we want to enjoy,” he said.
“Already, other countries are putting in place vaccine passport, international travel is already not possible into some countries without these passports.”

Ellie Dudley 7am: Supermarkets must enforce health orders: police
NSW Police are demanding supermarkets better enforce public health orders, amid Sydney’s growing outbreak of the highly-infectious Delta variant.
NSW Police Minister David Elliott said it was the “obligation” of supermarkets to make sure the public are signing in on QR codes, despite objections staff members may experience from disgruntled customers.
“If you believe your staff would be at risk, then spend the extra money and get security personnel put on the door,” Ms Elliott told Channel 9’s Today. “We’re not doing it to dish out penalties, we are not doing it to scare people.
“This is an action that the public health orders have said will allow us to contact anybody that has been in a supermarket when it’s been exposed.”
Mr Elliott’s comments come as 30 new supermarkets join NSW Health’s growing list of potential exposure sites overnight.

Ellie Dudley 6.30am: 28 Sydney supermarkets added to casual contact list
Almost 30 supermarkets in Sydney’s south west and western suburbs have been added to NSW Health’s list of potential exposure sites in the past 24 hours, as concerns of community spread continue to grow.
NSW chief health officer Kerry Chant on Wednesday said less trips to the shops were going to be key in reducing locally acquired case numbers across greater Sydney.
“From a public health perspective, I can’t be clearer, please do not go out and about,” she said. “Please minimise. If you can go shopping every three days, if you are able to do that, please do.”
But later that day, 28 new supermarkets were put on the “casual contact” list issued by the health department, meaning anyone who attended the venue at the time stipulated must urgently be tested and isolate until a negative result is received.
They include: Woolworths Auburn; Woolworths Bankstown; Woolworths Bass Hill; Aldi Bass Hill; Coles Blacktown; Aldi Campbelltown Mall; Woolworths Campbelltown; Woolworths Campbelltown Market Fair; Woolworths Campsie; Woolworths Canterbury; Coles Willowdale; Coles Earlwood; Aldi Erskine Park; Woolworths Fairfield Heights; Coles Green Valley; Woolworths Green Valley; Woolworths Gregory Hills; Aldi Lakemba; Aldi Lidcombe; Woolworths Lidcombe; Woolworths Macquarie Fields; Aldi Merrylands; Aldi Mount Annan; Coles Parramatta; Coles Nepean Village; Woolworths South Penrith; Coles Wetherill Park; Woolworths Wetherill Park.
The full list of 66 new venues and times is available on the health department website.
Two locations were also added to the list of venues that are at high risk of exposure.
Anyone who attended either of the following sites at the time listed should be tested immediately and isolate for 14 days regardless of the result.
Strathfield South: Polytrade Recycling Centre, 40 Madeline Street, Monday July 26 5.30am to 2.20pm, Tuesday 27 July 8.45am to 2.20pm
Penrith: High Street Family Doctors, 243 High Street, Tuesday July 27 2.00pm to 3.10pm.

Ellie Dudley 6am: Two NSW Central Coast school students test positive
Hundreds of staff and students from a school on the NSW Central Coast have been forced into self-isolation after two students tested positive for Covid-19.
Lake Munmorah Public School was advised of the cases on Wednesday night, forcing principal Narelle Baldwin to issue an urgent warning on the school’s Facebook page.
“Our school will be non-operational effective immediately for the on-site attendance of staff and visitors to allow time for contact tracing and cleaning,” she wrote.
“All staff and students are asked to self-isolate until you receive further advice.”
Anyone who has been in contact with people from the school and is unwell or develops any symptoms of Covid-19 must be tested immediately.
“While we recognise this will be disruptive and inconvenient for families, it is important that we follow NSW Health advice and take all necessary precautions to minimise the risk of further transmission to support our community,” Ms Baldwin wrote.
Students on the Central Coast have been learning online, unless their parent is an essential worker who does not have the capacity to home school them.

Geoff Chambers 5am: ‘Get AstraZeneca now, don’t wait for Pfizer’
A group of the nation’s leading medical professionals have urged Australians not to wait for Pfizer and to get jabbed with AstraZeneca, as new Treasury modelling found that a lower vaccine take-up rate would wipe nearly $7bn off growth every three months.
The economic necessity of imposing short, sharp lockdowns and achieving higher inoculation rates was revealed in Treasury analysis that showed Australians would be forced into five lockdowns every quarter if vaccination coverage flatlined at 50 per cent.
In addition, Treasury found the cost of governments failing to act quickly to rein in outbreaks would rise to an even more ­brutal $35bn a quarter under the Delta strain.
Cost of lockdowns and restrictions
The warning came as an alliance of prominent medical and health specialists penned an open letter debunking myths about the AstraZeneca vaccine and pleaded for all people to urgently get jabbed.
The letter, published in The Australian, reveals a growing number of doctors, professors and medical researchers are pushing back against the undermining of AstraZeneca, which they say provides similar protections against the Delta variant as Pfizer.
“Our strong recommendation to all Australians in an outbreak setting is to get a first dose of AstraZeneca or Pfizer vaccine as soon as possible … This is consistent with the latest Australian Technical Advisory Group on Immunisation advice,” the health professionals wrote.
“Do not wait for the Pfizer ­vaccine if the AstraZeneca vaccine is available to you. AstraZeneca is an excellent vaccine that has ­already saved millions of lives and will save many more. Covid kills, and by the time you or someone you love is infected, hospitalised or in ICU it is too late.”
Australian Medical Association Vice President Dr Chris Moy has urged the federal government to focus on the vaccination of mobile younger Australians who fall under the category of essential workers.

Charlie Peel 4.45am: Queensland braced for extension to lockdown
Queensland faces a further extension of its lockdown beyond ­Sunday if the state’s Covid-19 ­outbreak continues to grow at its current rate.
Only two of 16 new cases reported on Wednesday did not spend time in the community while infectious, increasing the likelihood the outbreak could multiply exponentially.
There are now 63 cases linked to the cluster around Indooroopilly in Brisbane’s inner west, mostly spreading through school students and their families.
Among those in quarantine are more than 400 Queensland Health staff, putting the state’s health system under increased pressure.
All the new cases have been linked to an infection source, although there is still a missing link between a family of five, who tested positive last week, and two ­people who arrived from overseas earlier in July.
Chief health officer Jeannette Young said the lockdown of 11 government areas in the southeast, which was supposed to end on Tuesday, was unlikely to be lifted until there were no new cases detected outside of quarantine or isolation.
Queensland health authorities are still searching for the source of infection for the Covid case which was reported in Cairns late on Tuesday afternoon.

Yoni Bashan 4.30am: Delays, long waits hinder NSW vaccine rollout
NSW vaccination rates have recorded only a modest uptick since Gladys Berejiklian called for an increase over the month of ­August, with progress being ­stifled by lengthy waiting periods at some clinics and access points, confusing residents and causing them to delay getting a jab.
The state recorded more than 84,000 vaccinations on Tuesday, according to figures released by the federal government, only slightly higher than the 82,000 doses reported on Sunday – with the increases reported mostly at GP clinics and primary care sites managed by the commonwealth.
At state-run vaccination hubs, daily inoculation rates have remained relatively unchanged in recent days, hovering between 24,000 and 26,000 doses, as they have since late July.
According to numerous accounts provided to The Australian, people seeking vaccinations through a GP or medical centre have experienced lengthy delays across the city, with bookings for AstraZeneca requiring six to eight weeks of waiting in some regions.
The Doherty Institute’s modelling underpinning national cabinet’s four-stage road map out of COVID-19 was a “slap down” of the NSW government’s vaccination strategy out of lockdown, says The Australian’s health editor Natasha Robinson.

Full text: They are mental shortcuts our brains create to fast-track decision-making based on past experiences. Heuristics are why we feel compelled to buy something that’s selling out, why we hurry up when we encounter someone in an alley at night, and why we tend to trust someone’s opinion if they are considered an expert.
In recent weeks, there’s been a bit of talk about the availability heuristic, and how it influences AstraZeneca vaccine hesitancy.
For someone under 50, the risk of dying from a clot caused by the jab is about 0.00009 per cent. Climbing a ladder, driving a car or drinking too much are all more likely to be fatal, and yet that risk would not prompt us to abandon such activities.
Some of us feel nervous about AstraZeneca because our brains subconsciously focus on the scary headlines and the shifting health advice. By contrast, the brain does not create similar shortcuts about other risks, because potential sources of fear are not available to it.
We can rationalise our way past the availability heuristic, as thousands of young Australians have done to get the AstraZeneca vaccine. Vaccine hesitancy can be overcome.
The bigger question is this: can we retrain the way our brains think about Covid-19 itself?
It is a measure of Australia’s relative success during the pandemic that the majority of the population is unwilling to live with the virus.
Does your heart rate quicken when your phone buzzes with the daily case numbers? Do you wonder why state borders aren’t closed as soon as an outbreak flares hundreds of kilometres away? Do you wish horrible things on anyone who brings the virus into your city?
Since Victoria’s second wave, state and federal leaders have progressively shifted their suppression strategy to a zero-Covid stance. Gladys Berejiklian was the last holdout – backed by Scott Morrison – and Sydney is paying the price.
As the PM declared this week, short and sharp lockdowns are now the preferred response. Eliminating the virus is the goal, and what our brains have been trained to expect.
Herein lies the challenge for Morrison this year. When 70 per cent of the adult population is vaccinated, he believes – quite rightly, according to modelling from the Doherty Institute – that Australia can flick a switch and live with Covid. No more lockdowns.
Will the nation accept this? The obvious answer is yes, because while Australia’s approach to Covid has saved thousands of lives, it has also deprived millions of freedoms they want back.
But Morrison should not underestimate the fear this virus causes, nor the difficulties he will face convincing Australians it can be treated like any other infectious disease.
The modelling, upon which the vaccination target is based, confirms inoculating the nation is the only way out of the pandemic.
It also details a harsher truth, which Health Minister Greg Hunt has recently articulated: Covid will be with us for decades.
Consider this. Once 80 per cent of adults are vaccinated – and exempted from all domestic restrictions – there would be 230,164 symptomatic infections in a six-month outbreak, if we maintained only low-level social distancing and tracing, testing, isolation and quarantine measures struggled to keep up. Hospitals would be inundated and 996 people would die.
It sounds frightening. For the sake of comparison, however, Australia averages 178,621 flu cases every year and 642 deaths.
With optimal containment measures, the Doherty experts expect Covid infections could be slashed to 1160 over six months, with only seven deaths.
This is merely a model, of course, but as Chief Medical Officer Paul Kelly says: “We do need to accept that there will be cases. We need to accept that there will be hospitalisations, there will be ICU admissions and there will be deaths.”
Morrison will not be able to prepare Australians for this reality, whatever the numbers, without the national cabinet’s support. While the state leaders have given their “in-principle” backing to the vaccination rates required to reopen the country, they have shown a penchant to go their own way throughout the pandemic, for practical and political reasons.
This time, the PM has painted it as a test of their “integrity and honesty with the Australian people”. To succeed, he will need a pact with Berejikilian and Daniel Andrews, who can bring the others with them and shift the Covid narrative so it no longer exploits voters’ fears.
This will not be easy, in the face of a virus which finds and rips open cracks in our political architecture with brutal efficiency, but it is Morrison’s best chance. Failure will have serious consequences for his leadership, let alone the country.
A unified national cabinet approach to life with Covid is even more important when we have simply no idea about life beyond Covid. To combat this uncertainty, they must present a clear vision of how vaccinated Australians will be exempt from ongoing restrictions.
That freedom will be the best incentive for the jab – and the best way to train our brains to live with the virus.

Full text: The large group met at Flinders St at 7pm on Thursday and marched into Swanston St shortly after and circled the CBD, the Herald Sun reports.
At least two flares were lit, with the crowd chanting “no more lockdowns”, according to the newspaper.
Police were seen clashing with protesters and there are reports of at least 15 arrests and another 16 people fined.
The late-night anti-lockdown rally erupted after the state’s Premier Daniel Andrews said there was “no alternative” to get on top of the latest Covid outbreak other than to impose another seven-day stay-at-home order on the state, which started at 8pm on Thursday.
“I can’t tell you how disappointed I am to have to be here doing this again. But with so few in the community with one vaccination let alone two, I have no choice but to accept advice and we collectively to make this important decision to keep Victorians safe,” Mr Andrews saids.
“The alternative is we let this run that gets away from us, and our hospitals will be absolutely overwhelmed. Not hundreds of patients but thousands.”
Victoria went from zero new cases to another lockdown in just over a day. It is just over a week since the fifth lockdown ended.
The state’s health department confirmed six new local virus cases on Thursday morning, but one case was previously announced on Wednesday afternoon.
That case – a teacher at Al-Taqwa College in Truganina – was announced just hours after a doughnut day in a fresh blow for Victorians as they emerge from their fifth coronavirus lockdown.
The health department said the acquisition source of the woman’s infection remain a mystery and household contacts of the case were being urgently tested.
The department said two of the remaining cases were mystery infections, with the three others linked to existing outbreaks and in isolation for their entire infectious period.
Victoria’s Covid-19 response commander Jeroen Weimar said health officials believed the teacher may have been infectious while teaching at the school on Wednesday, Thursday and Friday last week.
All staff, students, families and visitors who attended the school on July 28, 29 and 30 have also been ordered to get tested immediately and quarantine for 14 days.
Al-Taqwa College spokesman Terry Barnes said in a statement the campus had been “completely shut down” and would likely remain closed for 14 days.
“The college campus will be completely shut down with no staff members or students permitted to attend the college premises (and) deep cleaning is being arranged,” he said.
Victoria has recorded more than 220 cases linked to the two outbreaks that jumped the border from Sydney’s deadly Delta cluster – one from a team of Sydney removalists who transited through the state and the other from a family who returned to Melbourne’s north from a NSW red zone.
No new cases were recorded in hotel quarantine, with the number of active infections in the state falling to 80 – down from 99 on Wednesday.
PM’s WARNING AS 5 DEATHS, 262 NSW COVID CASES
Prime Minister Scott Morrison has issued a warning to those in NSW, saying compliance with the lockdown rules in NSW will get the state out of its paralysis because of the Delta outbreak.
“The primary tool to end the lockdown in Sydney is the success of the lockdown in Sydney,” he said.
“The virus doesn’t move by itself. People staying at home ensures that the virus doesn’t move.
And I can only reinforce the importance, as was achieved in Melbourne last year over a long period of time. Different variant, the Delta variant, as opposed to the Alpha variant last year, the earlier variant. And that makes the challenge so much harder.”
Mr Morrison said 20,000 of the new doses of Pfizer being sent to NSW to help vaccinate the population would go back into the regional communities, where jabs were taken for school students.
Mr Morrison said they hadn’t taken those doses from other states or territories.
“We haven’t done it in a way that would mean that the vaccination program would be slowed in other parts of the country,” he said.
“That would be dangerous, because the whole program needs to go forward. And so we didn’t want to have appointments cancelled in other parts of the country.
“What we did on top of the 200,000 doses we had already additionally provided to New South Wales for Pfizer, and over a million doses are available to New South Wales of AstraZeneca, in addition to that we have brought forward these other 180,000 doses.
“And it means that later on they won’t have to be changing any appointments either. That’s what the premier and I discussed. The other thing is, I’m very pleased — and I made it really clear — those 20,000 doses in New South Wales of Pfizer have to go back into those regional communities.”
He also urged everyone to get vaccinated now to avoid hospitalisation and protect their loved ones and themselves against Covid.
While he is still against Labor’s $300 cash incentive to get people to get the jab, he said he was open to “good ideas”.
It comes as NSW Premier Gladys Berejiklian said her state would get 180,000 more Pfizer vaccines from the federal government.
“After a number of conversations with the Prime Minister, I was advised by him directly that NSW will receive an extra 180,000 doses of Pfizer, which is good news, in the next fortnight, commencing in the week August 9 and August 16.
“This is very positive news. It means that in the week of 16 August, we can redirect those doses we had taken from the regions for the HSC students and it also means we can put the balance into those eight local government areas in Greater Sydney of concern in particular.
“So I’m relieved about that.”
FIVE DEATHS IN NSW AND 262 COVID CASES NSW has had five deaths with 262 new Covid cases as the lockdown in Greater Sydney was extended to regional parts of the state.
There were also 45 people infectious in the community and more than 107,000 tests.
Premier Gladys Berejiklian confirmed four out of the five people who died were unvaccinated.
Two men in their 60s died at Campbelltown and Westmead hospital, one man in his 70s died at Concord hospital, and one woman in her 80s died at Liverpool hospital. Another man died at Royal Prince Alfred hospital.
Ms Berejiklian said that there would be a one-week lockdown in the Hunter and Upper Hunter Region to try to stop the spread of the Delta outbreak there.
The local government areas impacted are Newcastle, Lake Macquarie, Maitland, Port Stephens, Cessnock, Dungog, Singleton and Muswellbrook.
“These community leaders and local leaders are being advised of this. That will commence at 5pm Thursday night and go until midnight next Thursday,” she said.
“I want to confirm the arrangements in the eight local government areas will be exactly the same as exists in Greater Sydney, including the Central Coast. So that means no school and the same stay at home provisions apply.”
NSW chief health officer Dr Kerry Chant said there were currently 290 Covid cases
in hospital and 251 people in intensive care and 24 of whom require ventilation, and young people were being admitted to ICU.
“We are seeing people in their teens, in their 20s and their 30s, as well as older individuals,” she said.
“But my comments are that please now is the time to strongly consider getting vaccinated if you’re over 18 and, for the elderly, who have not been vaccinated, again, I put out a plea to you — make an announcement. Get vaccinated.
“Even one vaccine reduces hospitalisation and death by Pfizer and AstraZeneca by 70 per cent. And two doses achieves about a 90 per cent effectiveness against hospitalisation and death. We have the tools to allow us to protect ourselves and our loved ones from Covid. I call on everyone to act now.”

16 NEW CASES IN QLD Queenslanders are “so far in front” of the virus that they have been given their surest sign yet that lockdown could end on Sunday, despite 16 new local cases of Covid-19 reported on Thursday.
The state’s Delta cluster, which began at a west Brisbane high school last week, now stands at 79.
But, of the new cases announced on Thursday, all were “directly linked” to the Indooroopilly outbreak, and only four people were infectious while in the community, which Deputy Premier Steven Miles said was “encouraging news”.
Three are children from Ironside State School, nine are close contacts linked to Ironside State School, one is a teacher at Brisbane Grammar School, one is a student at the school and the others are linked to the school.
“It’s encouraging that of the cases reported today, only three were infectious in the community for one day, and one was infectious for two days,” Mr Miles said.
“The other 12 were in quarantine throughout their entire infectious period … the fact they are all linked is a positive development as well.”
Chief health officer Jeannette Young said it was “excellent” news.
“The fact that we only had five days being infectious in the community between four people is the most encouraging part,” she said.
“Those five days were while we were in lockdown. That’s what you want to happen.”
Dr Young said she didn’t expect Queensland to be “so far in front of the virus” at this stage.
“It doesn’t mean we’re through it yet, we’ve still got a long way to go but we have done really, really, really well until now so let’s see how we go in the next few days,” she said.
“Let’s see if we can lift those restrictions on Sunday. That would be extremely special … I am hopeful we can.”
Mr Miles said a decision on whether the lockdown would end on Sunday is “difficult to say at this stage” because he doesn’t know what the next few days will look like.
“We will need to see those play out before we can advise Queenslanders what the arrangements will be,” he said.
“My absolute focus is on doing everything that we need to do today and tomorrow and Saturday to hopefully be able to lift the lockdown on Sunday, that is the goal right now.”
In the past 24 hours, 52,350 tests were recorded.
“That level of testing gives the chief health officer a chance to be confident,” Mr Miles said.
There are currently 7766 people in home quarantine.

‘DO NOT WAIT FOR PFIZER’ A group of top medical professionals has urged Australians not to wait for Pfizer and to have the AstraZeneca vaccine if they can.
“Our strong recommendation to all Australians in an outbreak setting is to get a first dose of AstraZeneca or Pfizer vaccine as soon as possible,” the leading doctors and other health professionals wrote in The Australian.
“This is consistent with the latest Australian Technical Advisory Group on Immunisation advice.
“Do not wait for the Pfizer ­vaccine if the AstraZeneca vaccine is available to you.
“AstraZeneca is an excellent vaccine that has ­already saved millions of lives and will save many more.
“Covid kills, and by the time you or someone you love is infected, hospitalised or in ICU it is too late.”
It came as The Australian reported that short, sharp lockdowns could be a reality for some time to come if vaccination rates stall.
Treasury analysis that showed Australians would be forced into “five lockdowns every quarter” if vaccination coverage flatlined at 50 per cent.
‘VACCINATE UNDER 40S’: FREWEN Vaccination commander Lieutenant-General John Frewen said the federal government would not start giving Covid jabs to under 40s, despite warnings that age group were high coronavirus transmitters.
Speaking at a press conference, Frewen said vaccine incentives may be discussed later in the rollout as currently “demand is still exceeding supply”, The Australian reports.
“I have said incentives is something we will consider but right now Australians are coming forward, in the last seven days.”
Frewen reiterated that AstraZeneca was already accessible for younger age groups, but said the main reason for not opening up mRNA to all cohorts was expectation, which was undermined by constrained supplies.
“The idea for 30-39 – we will open mRNA towards the end of this month, early next month – means that when people are told they can access the vaccine, they can do it in a reasonable period of time,” Frewen told reporters on Wednesday, according to The Australian.
“AstraZeneca is available right now under informed consent. People need to make a decision whether they have the available vaccine now or whether they wait.”
The Doherty Institute recommended that vaccinating under 40-year-olds offered the “greatest potential to reduce transmission” given that a high proportion of vulnerable Australians were already vaccinated.
Frewen said the reason younger people, such as those in their 30s, were not yet eligible for Pfizer is to manage “public expectation” because demand is too high among older age groups, The Australian reported.
Frewen expects that will change “towards the end of this month (or) early next month”, according to The Australian.

STATE OF PLAY IN SA Just as South Australia starts to shake the shackles of lockdown, another locally acquired Covid-19 case has been recorded.
But, the plan to ease some restrictions from 12.01am on Thursday will go ahead.
The man in his 20s was already isolating at home after one of his family members previously tested positive to the virus two weeks ago.
He has since been shifted to the state’s dedicated coronavirus facility, Tom’s Court Hotel.
Premier Steven Marshall confirmed the infection was linked to the Modbury cluster, bringing the total number of connected infections to 22.
SA chief public health officer Nicola Spurrier said the man had quite a long incubation period and did not display any symptoms.
His positive test was a “late pick-up” on day 13.
Three of his family members were also taken to medi-hotels and will need to complete a further 14 days of quarantine.
Professor Spurrier said there was no reason to suspect community exposure.
But she said testing rates had dropped across the state and stressed anyone with even the mildest of symptoms needed to get tested.
There were 7163 tests conducted on Tuesday.
FREWEN OPEN TO CASH FOR JABS Lieutenant General John Frewen is not ruling out cash incentives to encourage people to get the Covid vaccine.
It comes after Prime Minister Scott Morrison on Tuesday labelled Labor’s cash for jabs proposal “an insult”.
“We will look at all positive alternatives. There is cash, there is the ideas of lotteries, all these things are being discussed,” he said, but added demand is still outstripping supply, so now is not the time to look at it.
He said there is no plan to open the Pfizer vaccine program to under 30s earlier, despite the Doherty Institute reporting they are a critical group for vaccinations in its modelling released on Tuesday.
“All age groups can access AstraZeneca, those age groups. The main reason for not opening up all cohorts to mRNA is expectation, filling up looking systems and not realistically be able to access the stuff. The idea for 30-39 we will open mRNA towards the end of this month, early next month means that when people are told they can access the vaccine they can do it in a reasonable period of time,” he said.
PM’S Covid CRACK TEAM PLAN Prime Minister Scott Morrison has another part to his Covid-19 battle plan — a vaccination unit targeting infection outbreaks.
According to the National Covid Vaccine Campaign Plan for Operation Covid Shield, The Australian reports a new crack National Response Option “is an opportunity to increase vaccination capacity when and where required” in the event of an outbreak.
The new unit will be sent out nationally and be on call to move quickly.
The co-ordinator general of the National Covid-19 Vaccine Taskforce, Lieutenant General John Frewen, said “while there are many factors involved in reducing the spread of Covid-19, vaccination is the most effective means we have to build nation resilience”.
The new unit would support the “states and territories in achieving or exceeding targets either by reinforcing success or addressing delay in extraordinary circumstances”.
“Once we reach threshold vaccination rate levels, we will be able to live with this virus and begin our recovery,” the plan said.
“The National Response Option will be dedicated solely to the task of administering vaccinations and will maintain a high level of readiness in the event of a call-out, being dispatched to the location directed to provide between 2000 and 3000 additional vaccinations daily over the course of a two-week campaign.”
It comes as carparks at major sporting stadiums could become vaccine hubs as early as next month.
The federal government is considering the move to help get the Pfizer Covid-19 vaccine to Australians aged 30 and over, Nine News reported on Tuesday.
While Westfield is already on board to give jabs nationally, other shopping centres will also reportedly be involved in the drive-through plan.
“Flying squads” of nurses will reportedly go to workplaces to vaccinate employees as early as October.

PM LASHES CASH FOR JABS; NEW MODELLING REVEALED Scott Morrison has dismissed Labor’s cash for jabs proposal, describing it as “a vote of no-confidence in Australians”.
Labor Leader Anthony Albanese put forward the $6b plan on Tuesday to give Australians fully vaccinated by December 1 $300 in cash. But Mr Morrison distanced himself from cash incentives.
“This is a serious public health crisis, it is not a game show,” the prime minister told reporters on Tuesday.
“So if they do have hesitancy about vaccine, I am not going to pay them off.”
The prime minister was taking questions following the release of the Doherty Institute’s modelling for Australia’s National Covid-19 response.
In an opening speech, Mr Morrison praised the nation’s handling of pandemic saying 30,000 Australians or more would be dead if we had not responded the “Australian way”.
“I have great faith in the Australian people to get this country vaccinated,” he said.
The modelling shows vaccinating 70 per cent of the population aged 16 plus may allow Australia to transition to phase B of Australia’s response.
At 70 per cent, the number of strict lockdowns would be significantly reduced.
Fifty to 60 per cent doesn’t come anywhere near enough reaching that point, the modelling shows.
The Prime Minister noted: “When you get it down to 80 per cent, the sort of death hospitalisation and infection rates is what you expect to see with something like a flu.”
NED-4305-Vaccine-effectiveness-estimates
As vaccine rates increase, less stringent public health and social measures will be needed.
Allowing vaccinations for under 40s offers the greatest potential to reduce transmission now that a higher proportion of vulnerable Australians are vaccinated, the modelling shows.
We need to increase the uptake of AstraZeneca to combat the challenge the Delta strain presents.
“What we are delighted to see and what really supports the use of both of the vaccines that we have in Australia is both the Pfizer and AstraZeneca doses are highly effective at reducing severe disease outcomes following two doses,” the Doherty Institute’s Professor Jodie McVernon said.
“For Pfizer, reduction in hospitalisation is 87 per cent, ICU admission 87 per cent, mortality 92 per cent. For AstraZeneca, corresponding numbers are 86, 86 and 90.
“We have two very highly effective vaccines and this work really encourages their best strategic use.”
NED-4150-Pathway-out-of-pandemic
Treasurer Josh Frydenberg said the key economic message out of the modelling is that until we get to 70 per cent and above vaccination rates the economic imperative is that governments need to move fast to get on top of those cases.
“If they don’t, we see lengthier and more severe lockdowns which have a much more significant economic cost,” he said.
He said early interventions, short, sharp lockdowns, are the most cost effective way to handle the virus.
Mr Frydenberg said at 50 per cent vaccination rates, if governments were getting on top of those early cases, it was costing the economy $570 million a week. At 60 per cent vaccination rates, if governments were getting on top of the cases early, it was costing $430 million a week. At a 70 per cent vaccination rate it’s costing the economy $200 million a week. And at 80 per cent vaccination rates it’s costing the economy $140 million a week. And that’s base
line-type restrictions, light or moderate restrictions.
COVID-19 Stats – Horizontal with Lazy Load
HALF-PRICE PLANE SEATS EXTENDED The federal government has thrown a lifeline to the aviation sector as it struggles with the impact of worsening lockdowns, with the popular half-price fares initiative extended until the end of November.
The government will also enable airlines to access $750 weekly payments for 50 per cent of their pilots and cabin attendants, if the business has taken a hit of more than 30 per cent since the Sydney hotspot declaration was made.
The Domestic Aviation Network Support (DANS) and Regional Airline Network Support (RANS) programs would also be extended until the end of the year, Deputy Prime Minister Barnaby Joyce announced.
The half-price seats initiative, which prompted a huge flurry of sales when it was announced in March, was being extended “to ensure travellers impacted by lockdowns or border closures can access these tickets and benefit key tourism regions as soon as possible,” Mr Joyce said.
Initially 800,000 half-price seats were offered to 15 destinations most impacted by the downturn in tourism.
Mr Joyce, who is also Minister Infrastructure, Transport and Regional Development, described the aviation sector as “absolutely seminal,” especially for the tourism industry.
“This is a crucial sector of the economy,” he said.
“It is crucial to keep a sovereign airline capacity, crucial that as soon as the economy opens up, this sector of the economy is up and running and able to deliver.”
“We are laser-focused on keeping the nation connected and supporting economically critical freight movements as we continue to manage the ongoing challenges of this global pandemic and move into a recovery phase.”
A spokesperson for Mr Joyce confirmed that while the half-price seats program was being extended, it was not an increase on the initial allocation of 800,000 seats, and the 15 destinations within the program were not being changed.
Tourism and Transport Forum CEO Margy Osmond welcomed the extended support measures, but said the tourism industry’s biggest challenges were the “devastating impacts of ongoing lockdowns and border uncertainty”.
She also called for timelines to be set against national vaccination targets, saying they would restore confidence to the industry.
Parts of the industry dependent on international arrivals had “effectively been in lockdown for 16 months,” Ms Osmond said, and the domestic sector “continues to be decimated by these extended lockdowns and border restrictions.”
PFIZER OPEN TO TEENS Health Minister Greg Hunt has announced more PPE will be sent to southeast Queensland after it was declared a Commonwealth hotspot, and the Pfizer vaccine will be made available to children aged between 12 and 15 who are immunocompromised.
This change in the vaccine rollout will occur on August 9.
“ … for 12-year-olds to 15-year-olds, as foreshadowed just over a week ago, the Pfizer vaccine will now be made available on ATAGI’s advice for immunocompromised children, or children with underlying medical conditions, indigenous children, and children in remote communities aged 12-15,” he said.
“Although, if any GP wishes to administer before then, then it is free for them, or states, to do so.
“But that’s the commencement of that program. They will be included under phase 1B, which means that they will have access as part of that program going forward.
It includes approximately 220,000 children who will be given access now as a consequence of that decision.”
Mr Hunt said this last week saw a record vaccination week with 1.18 million Australians coming forward, taking us to almost 12.4 million vaccinations.
HANSON SLAMS QLD LOCKDOWN Senator Pauline Hanson has criticised Prime Minister Scott Morrison claiming he had “lost control of Australia” as part of Queensland went into a three-day snap lockdown.
In a video posted online on Saturday, Ms Hanson described the lockdown as “bloody ridiculous”.
“Like a lot of Aussies I was out enjoying my weekend but now we are going to have to be locked down,” she said.
“It is bloody ridiculous for only six cases of Delta. I’m sorry this is over the top.”
“The prime minister said yesterday it would get no worse than what it is at this point, he’s supposed to guide us through this with the premiers.
“As I’ve said all along the prime minister has lost control of the country and the premiers are doing whatever they want to do. I feel sorry for small businesses.”
Ms Hanson went on to say lockdowns were being called “at the drop of a hat”.
“Give people clear direction and what’s going on,” she said.
It came after Mr Morrison explained Australia’s four-step road map out of Covid-19 lockdowns on Friday, where he said Australia had to get to a vaccination target of 70 per cent before restrictions would ease.
He also said premiers had agree to this in principle, with international travel to open after the country had achieved a vaccination target of 80 per cent.
On Saturday, Mr Morrison delivered a pointed reference to wild conspiracy theories during an interview on talkback radio as he pleaded with Australians to follow scientifically supported medical advice – not fake experts on Facebook.
The odd remark comes after the Prime Minister revealed lockdowns would be discouraged and international borders would begin to reopen once 80 per cent of eligible Australians are fully vaccinated against Covid-19.
Morrison said he hoped the agreement on the target would encourage the population to get the jab as vaccine hesitancy persists and disenfranchised citizens take to the streets in anti-lockdown protests.
“By getting vaccinated, you're getting a step closer every single day to getting us back to about as normal as you can be when you’re living with Covid-19,” he told 2GB on Saturday morning.
When discussing the prevailing rate of vaccine hesitancy across the country, Morrison urged Australians to resist following views of conspiracy theorists and to “go and talk to your doctor”.
“If you are concerned, don't talk to Doctor Google, go talk to your doctor,” the Prime Minister said.
“Don’t talk to someone who’s going to tell you you’re going to turn into a magnet or, you know, don’t go on Facebook to listen to people who don’t know what they’re talking about.”
The bizarre magnet reference is likely in relation to the unusual theory among alternative communities who fear the substance of the vaccine, with some even believing it will allow the recipient to connect to the internet.
The theory originated because some mRNA vaccines, a new type of jab used to protect against infectious diseases, include a material called hydrogel, which is used to help disperse the vaccine slowly into the recipient’s cells.
The fear of being a vessel to connect to Wi-Fi is, of course, nonsense and flatly rejected by the federal Health Department.
“Bioengineers have used similar hydrogels for many years in different ways,” the health authority said earlier in the year. “For instance, they’ve used them to help stem cells survive after being put inside our bodies.
“Because of this, some people believe that hydrogels are needed for electronic implants, which can connect to the internet.”
But the Pfizer mRNA vaccine doesn’t even contain hydrogels as a component, instead using a piece of mRNA that is “coated in a lipid (fatty) droplet”.
“The lipid helps the vaccine enter our cells, as the membrane holding our cells together is also made mostly of lipid,” the Department of Health said.
“The vaccine and the membrane can fuse easily, depositing the mRNA inside the cell.”
According to the Centre of Disease Control in the US, no ingredient in any Covid-19 vaccine is capable of producing electromagnetic force – at the injection site or anywhere else in your body.
“COVID-19 vaccines do not contain ingredients that can produce an electromagnetic field at the site of your injection,” official advice states.
“All COVID-19 vaccines are free from metals.”
Morrison said he was ambitious the threshold for vaccinations would be reached by Christmas so the country can attempt to return to normalcy by 2022.
“There’ll be enough vaccines,” he said in regards to 80 per cent of the population being vaccinated by the end of the year.
“There’ll be enough pharmacies, enough GPs, enough clinics, enough of all of that to achieve that.
“So it’s all up to all of us now.”

Realestate.com.au reveals there are just 176 properties for sale on the lower north shore with only 34 of them houses.
Property values rising in outer suburban and regional areas
CoreLogic confirms the Lavender Bay house was purchased in 2013 for $3.5 million under the name of Mr Soriot’s wife. The deal was less than a year after Mr Soriot was named chief executive of the pharmaceutical giant.
It is set to go to auction next month with Stone Real Estate McMahons Point’s Annika Bongiorno and Aaron Bongiorno. No price guide has been made public at this stage.
The listing of the period house comes after the Soriots settled on a nearby mansion last month featuring four bedrooms, a wine cellar, home cinema and gym.
The pandemic has seen Mr Soriot, a French-Australian dual citizen work mostly out of AstraZeneca’s Macquarie Park office instead of its global headquarters in the United Kingdom.
He was a key player in advocating a deal to locally manufacture a Covid-19 vaccine in Australia to ensure the country had vaccination independence from larger countries such as the United States who have slapped export bans on vaccines.
The couple have made cosmetic changes to the property during their time including new flooring and a fresh coat of paint.
The stunning house has an entertainer’s terrace with sweeping water views, a Caesarstone kitchen, a three-car garage and back to base alarm system.
There is also a workshop, designer bathrooms, built-in wardrobes and several character fireplaces.
Modelling by Melbourne’s Doherty Institute revealed hospitalisations dropped by 86 per cent after two does of the Australian-made AstraZeneca vaccination, compared to 87 per cent for Pfizer.

Covid deaths will be inevitable when we open up, so we need to tackle the topic now

Full text: He’s selling us a future vision of freedom that is by no means guaranteed.
He’s also not talking about the risk of increased death, which is inevitable as we open up.
This is wrong. The increased risk of death is a vital piece of information which Morrison should share with the Australian people. We deserve to know the real cost of opening up.
Modelling from the Doherty Institute used to set the new pandemic national plan shows some restrictions will still be needed, even after 80 per cent of the population is vaccinated.
It’s a depressing thought for those of us in Victoria who have already been through five lockdowns.
Without ongoing restrictions, we could have 2000 deaths a year from Covid, the data suggests.
But even with continued restrictions, there will be deaths, and this is something Morrison needs to acknowledge.
Australians will have to get used to the idea that opening up and resuming our lives – even with some restrictions – will lead to Covid deaths.
Chief medical office Professor Paul Kelly flagged this eventuality earlier in the week.
“We do need to accept that there will be cases. We need to accept that there will be hospitalisations, there will be ICU admissions and there will be deaths,” he said.
Deaths vs. Restrictions
It’s what the head of Virgin Australia Jayne Hrdlicka told us back in May, but we weren’t ready to hear it. Hrdlicka was widely castigated for suggesting “some people may die but it will be way smaller than the flu”.
In 2017, 1255 people in Australia died from the flu. Flu kills the very young and the very old, and is more fatal for those with chronic conditions.
The difference with Covid-19 new variants is that younger and healthier people are dying. One of the latest NSW casualties was a man in his 20s who was unvaccinated and died suddenly at home.
Accepting just one death goes against everything Australians believe in but it’s something we have to accept.
While states like Victoria have successfully pursued elimination strategies, the future is suppression. We can’t afford a life of continual lockdowns. As much as we don’t like it, death is the cost of opening up.
The balance between opening up our society and borders will have to be balanced by what people see as an acceptable level of deaths.
Countries such as Britain have 73 per cent vaccination rates and case numbers of 24,000 a day. More than 100 people a day are dying but that is a much lower number than last year thanks to their immunisation rates.
Modelling by Accenture suggests Australians would tolerate an average of 20 Covid-related deaths a day. But that’s 7300 a year – much higher than the numbers who die from the flu.
At this point things are feeling a little grim.
Prime Minister Scott Morrison says he hopes the 70 per cent target of vaccinations will be reached by Christmas, but it’s telling that a timeline hasn’t been set for the 80 per cent target.
People deserve, and need, more certainty than this.
At this point only 41 per cent of people aged over 16 have had their first dose and 19 per cent their second.
We are a long way off 80 per cent. With NSW cases staying high and Queensland now in lockdown, Victoria feels on a knife-edge. We are just a handful of cases away from another devastating and crippling lockdown.
A few things are clear. The government needs to shore up its supply of Pfizer doses, which are supposed to be coming next month. They need a plan to include children aged over 12 in any rollout.
They should also consider Labor’s plan of paying people to get vaccinated — it has worked in other countries so why not here?
And they need to get us used to the idea that with greater freedom comes more death.

Full text: Projections by Dr Chris Billington from Melbourne University show Australia could reach the 70 per cent adult vaccination rate on November 8 and 80 per cent on November 21.
Those milestones were adopted as key triggers for the loosening of restrictions by National Cabinet last Friday.
NSW Premier Gladys Berejiklian has suggested a 50 per cent vaccination rate – about where the US is right now – could be used to trigger some freedoms, but declined to specify what they might be.
Infectious diseases expert Professor Peter Collingnon from the ANU said Ms Berejiklian’s suggestion was “more realistic” than the 70 and 80 per cent vaccination targets, which were an “all or nothing view”.
Restrictions should be “proportional to the risk of spread and the consequences of that spread,” he said, and the turning of the seasons would play a role in that calculation.
“Winter is more of a risk than spring and early summer,” Prof Collingnon said. “Covid-19 can spread in summer, but less readily than in winter.”
vax dates
Other modelling conducted by a team from Sydney University suggests easing restrictions too early or too liberally could be disastrous.
“Our model suggests that re-opening and ceasing lockdowns with under 50 per cent of the population fully vaccinated could generate around 10,000 cases a day across Australia,” team leader Professor Mikhail Prokopenko said.
“This part of the modelling was done on the previous, less contagious strain. The delta strain, as we know, is more contagious, so it could result in even more cases with a premature re-opening.”
Similarly bleak predictions were made in the Doherty Institute modelling used by National Cabinet and released on Tuesday.
The Doherty team found that with a 50 per cent vaccination rate, infections could top 1.1 million and deaths could get to 10,000 within six months.
NED-4305-Vaccine-effectiveness-estimates
Countries such as the US and UK have loosened restrictions at far lower vaccination rates than 70 and 80 per cent, prompting some to call for Australia to follow their lead, but Prof Collingnon said such comparisons were “not legitimate”.
“We don’t want to be compared to a country with a huge death toll,” he said. “The US and UK had uncontrolled spread while we had minimal spread. It’s reasonable to compare us to New Zealand, Japan, South Korea and Singapore.”
With increased supplies of vaccines coming online, Prof Collingnon said he was hopeful Australia could achieve 75 per cent adult vaccination by mid October.
“There’s light at the end of the tunnel,” he said.
NED-4150-Pathway-out-of-pandemic
Dr Billington’s projections of Australia’s vaccination rate is based on supply only, so it doesn’t take into account some of the human factors that could push back herd immunity milestones.
“Hesitancy or slackness certainly could limit the rate of uptake toward the end, but is hard to predict. So this model is very much a case of ‘what’s possible if we don’t have significant hesitancy and people go and get vaccinated when it’s their turn,’” Dr Billington said.
If the government were to include Australians aged 12-16 in the mass vaccine rollout program, the target 80 per cent date could still be reached on December 2, he added.
Nearly 41 per cent of people aged 16 and over have had one dose of vaccine and just over 19 per cent have had two doses, according to government figures.

Full text: The Doherty Institute’s modelling, used by the national cabinet to set its vaccination target for reopening the country, confirms snap lockdowns will be the best way to stop the Delta variant until 70 per cent of Australians over 16 have received both vaccinations.
Once that target is reached, crowd caps at major events and density limits in offices and hospitality venues will still be required – costing the economy $140m a week – and rapid testing, tracing, isolation and quarantine will need to be maintained.
The modelling says if Australia reaches 80 per cent vaccination coverage and these measures are properly implemented, the nation could live a Covid-normal life, with 1160 symptomatic cases over six months and just seven deaths.
But if these containment measures fail – even with four out of five adults vaccinated – the institute predicts Australia would be hit by 230,164 symptomatic infections over a six-month outbreak, with 7699 people admitted to hospital and 996 losing their lives.
Prime Minister Scott Morrison, who released the modelling on Tuesday, said Covid-19 would “never be eliminated” and “common sense precautions” would help Australia live with the virus.
“I have great faith in the Australian people to get this country vaccinated,” he said.
The Pfizer vaccine is expected to be made available to people in their 30s from early September, after the institute identified young adults as the main spreaders of the virus.
The vaccine is expected to be approved for children aged 12 to 15 within weeks, although the institute’s modelling indicated bringing it forward would not have a major effect on reducing transmission of the virus.
Professor Jodie McVernon, from the institute, said immunising young adults was critical.
“They will bring Covid home to their children, they will take it home to their own parents, and this is the group now where we’re proposing the reorientation of the strategy,” she said.
Under the plan, Australians aged 16 to 29 will get their shots from early October.
Living with Covid
One in five Australians aged over 16 is already fully vaccinated, and with one million doses now administered every six days, the government is confident the 70 per cent target will be reached by Christmas.
Health Minister Greg Hunt said the latest research showed 79 per cent intended to be fully vaccinated by then.
The Doherty report urged a “precautionary approach” on setting a national vaccine target, given Australia’s ability to slow transmission of the virus varied across the regions, depending on the effectiveness of health responses and whether people followed ongoing restrictions.
It said further work was needed on localised vaccine targets and restrictions.
Mr Morrison said the baseline restrictions suggested by the institute’s model were not prescriptive and would be debated by the national cabinet.
Treasury modelling found that at a vaccination rate of 50 per cent, the lowest cost strategy to control the virus was strict lockdowns accompanied by ongoing baseline restrictions, which would cost $570m a week.
Low-level restrictions required at a 70 per cent rate would cost $200m a week, or $140m a week to manage the virus with vaccination rates higher than 80 per cent.
Chief medical officer Professor Paul Kelly said the country would need to shift out of the suppression phase once the vaccine rollout moved ahead.
“We do need to accept that there will be cases. We need to accept that there will be hospitalisations, there will be ICU admissions and there will be deaths,” he said.
The institute’s analysis also strongly backed the Melbourne-made AstraZeneca vacc­ine, finding it was 86 per cent effective at reducing hospital admissions and 90 per cent effective at preventing deaths — virtually the same as the Pfizer vaccine.
After Labor proposed a $300 payment to everyone vaccinated before December 1, Mr Morrison said that was a “vote of no confidence” in Australians. “This is a serious public health crisis, it is not a game show,” he said.

50 per cent vaxxed is not enough to safely lift restrictions: Doherty Institute

Full text: Prime Minister Scott Morrison released the modelling the federal government based its plan out of Covid-19 on, but it contained bad news for locked-down Sydneysiders.
NSW Premier Gladys Berejiklian announced on Tuesday the state must administer 6 million vaccinations in less than a month in order to ease greater Sydney’s lockdown by August 28.
The 6 million jabs would mean about 50 per cent of NSW’s eligible population were vaccinated.
“Once you get to 50 per cent vaccination, 60 per cent, 70 per cent, that triggers more freedoms. We can turn this around in four weeks,” Ms Berejiklian said.
But according to the Doherty Institute, this is not even close to where Australia needs to be in order to be safe from the virus.
“At 50 per cent and 60 per cent we anticipate a rapidly growing outbreak that would be difficult to control and would require stringent measures,” Doherty Institute Covid-19 chief Jodie McVernon said.
“To actually control outbreaks all together, we need to reach the dotted line that crosses one at which epidemics do not grow.”
“You can see at 50 or 60 per cent coverage we're still a long way from that line.”
Professor McVernon said the vaccination rate would need to be closer to 70 per cent to keep Australians safe.
“At 60 per cent to 70 per cent, the need to restore stringent measures for the whole of a state will be substantially reduced,” she said.
“At 80 per cent of coverage, we would be more confident that some greater social freedoms might be allowed with that level of immunisation.”
Mr Morrison echoed Professor McVernon, saying death, hospitalisation and infection rates at 80 per cent would be similar to “what you expect to see with something like the flu”.
But chief medical officer Paul Kelly said the modelling didn’t necessarily mean NSW was doomed to remain in lockdown.
“The model is based on a national picture … it will look at more localised effects of various scenarios,” Professor Kelly said.
“What I think we are seeing in Sydney right now is different to what has been modelled.”
NSW recorded 199 new Covid-19 infections on Tuesday, with the Premier warning authorities did not know if the state had reached the worst of the Delta outbreak yet.

Our resilience has silenced Covid prophets of doom

Full text: It takes a Christian with chutzpah to bet on Christmas. But the Prime Minister has set his sights on opening the country in time for Santa. On Friday, he met with the national cabinet to hatch a plot against Covid’s grip on power. Armed with modelling from the Doherty Institute, cabinet set vaccination thresholds for charting a path out of the pandemic. When 70 per cent of the population is fully vaccinated, lockdowns will become less likely, some international arrivals will be permitted and vaccinated residents will enjoy greater freedoms such as reduced quarantine requirements.
At about 80 per cent, lockdowns will be “highly targeted”; vaccinated residents will have greater freedom of movement and be permitted to travel internationally. The travel bubble will be extended to other “safe” countries and inbound citizens who have been fully vaccinated will enjoy reduced requirements for re-entry.
The long-awaited end to Covid winter is in sight. Yet psychologists have warned that mental health can deteriorate as societies move out of pandemics. For The Atlantic, the Covid mind is a tale of two stories. The first ran in July 2020. Jacob Stern marshalled research and experts who warned about an impending mental health disaster. Stern observed that a third of Americans were already feeling severe anxiety. Texts to a federal emergency mental health line had increased 1000 per cent.
Deputy Prime Minister Barnaby Joyce says National Cabinet's 70 per cent vaccine target is achievable by the end of the year as he urged Australians to get the jab.
It was widely believed that people were at risk of post-traumatic stress disorder. There was historical precedent; in the four years following the SARS pandemic, more than 40 per cent of survivors in Hong Kong were found to have a psychiatric illness. There were “delirious patients” in America with “chilling hallucinations”. Stern contended that: “A wave of psychological stress unique in its nature and proportions is bearing down on an already-ramshackle American mental healthcare system.”
A year on, The Atlantic was emerging from dystopia. Psychology professors Lara Aknin, Jamil Zaki and Elizabeth Dunn reported on their efforts to quantify the psychological effects of the pandemic. They examined studies from nearly 100 countries that measured variables such as life satisfaction, anxiety, depression and deaths by suicide.
While there had been an initial and dramatic increase in reported levels of anxiety and depression, including clinically significant forms of psychological distress, recovery began during 2020 “as spring turned to summer”. The researchers found that life satisfaction had remained stable in the year. In some countries, the rate of suicide had declined. The professors cautioned that the studies were limited by methodology, but suggested: “People are more resilient than they themselves realise.”
In Australia, too, researchers have found that, generally, people adapted and found ways to cope with the external shocks brought about by the pandemic. As lead researcher of the Australian Unity Wellbeing Index, Associate Professor Delyse Hutchinson, reported, despite the challenges, personal and national wellbeing scores remained largely within the average range. She attributed it to “the resilience of the Australian community (and) our adaptive capability as a society”.
It is good news for everyone except those seeking to capitalise on Covid-induced psychological distress. Time might heal most wounds produced by the pandemic, but an increase in mental health suffering justifies demands for increased government funding.
However, emerging research indicates that instead of a blanket approach to mental health funding, governments might be better advised to increase funds for specific groups such as the unemployed, people with pre-existing mental health conditions and more serious psychological illness.
The pandemic brought an avalanche of predictions about mental health. The short story was that lockdowns would lead to a mass psychological crisis with long-term effects. In retrospect, it might simply be that, like the rest of society, the media was panicked by the pandemic. But before long, little acts of defiance began appearing on suburban streets like green shoots butting their heads against concrete to greet the sun. Teddy bears were propped up on windowsills to delight children on their Covid-compliant walks. People made friends with neighbours. New communities formed online. And if you tried to buy a breadmaker during lockdown, you soon learned that baking had made a comeback like the 1950s had never gone out of fashion.
Australia’s experience of the pandemic has been relatively benign; we have huddled in the shadow of the beast, not under its scythe. But, like the rest of the world, we have learned human beings are a creative, adaptive and resilient lot. For everyone, there will be a memory from the pandemic of the spirit triumphant. Mine is the moment when tenor Maurizio Marchini took to his balcony to serenade Florence with Puccini’s Nessun Dorma as the pandemic waltzed its danse macabre through the shuttered houses and shattered hospitals of Italy. Nessun dorma: none shall sleep. At last, we can put the prophets of doom on notice. Covid’s days are numbered and Santa Claus is coming to town.

Australia to hit next phase of Covid recovery when 70 per cent vaccinated

Full text: Mr Morrison on Friday evening made the announcement following a marathon meeting with state and territory leaders, where they agreed in principle to targets to return Australia to normalcy.
“We will get to the next phase when Australia reaches 70 per cent of the eligible population who are double dose vaccinated. We will get to phase C when we hit 80 per cent,” he said.
“Now, these are targets for all Australians to achieve. States, territories, working together, communities working together, individuals, GPs, pharmacists. Australia will get this done by working together.
“The targets are there for us all to achieve and for us all to work towards.”
Australia is currently in the first phase, suppression, with the rate of people aged 16 and over who have received both doses sitting around 18 per cent.
It won’t be until the nation, and each state and territory, reaches the 70 per cent vaccination threshold that the country will move into phase B.
That phase will see restrictions such as lockdowns and border controls eased on vaccinated residents.
Lockdowns will only occur in “extreme circumstances.”
“They are less likely - I wish to stress and in targeted cases ... they may be necessary in those circumstances, but they are not something that you would normally expect because of the much higher level of vaccination and protection that exists within the country,” he said.
Inbound passenger caps will be restored to previous levels for unvaccinated returning travellers. A larger cap will be allocated for vaccinated returning travellers.
Mr Morrison remained coy on if Australian could reach phase B by the end of the year, telling reporters it was up to the nation to respond to the challenge he was setting.
“We're not going to set timetables on it. I would hope so but that is entirely up to how the nation responds to this challenge we’re setting for ourselves, for each and every one of us,” he said.
“There will certainly be the supply and the distribution and the opportunity to do that. But whether that is achieved is up to all of us.”
It won’t be until 80 per cent of eligible Australians are vaccinated before the country could move into life without lockdowns.
Phase C would see exemptions from domestic restrictions completely and lift all restrictions on outbound travel for vaccinated residents.
The travel bubble for unrestricted travel could also extend to the Pacific and Singapore.
Caps for returning vaccinated travellers would also be abolished.
The national cabinet agreement is based on data by the Doherty Institute, commissioned by the government to model what would occur when a certain percentage of the population was vaccinated and what impact further outbreaks would have on the health system at that rate.
That data was then considered against Treasury modelling around the cost of lockdowns, providing leaders with an idea of guidelines for trigger points to move to the next phase of the plan.

Targeted Covid-19 lockdowns ‘to run into new year’

Full text: Scenarios prepared by the ­Doherty Institute outlining the optimal vaccine coverage required for Australia to begin opening up have been shared with Treasury officials, who have been tasked with modelling the economic costs of various health outcomes.
The Australian understands Treasury is updating its assumptions on the frequency of lockdowns and other Covid-19 restrictions, which will be provided to national cabinet leaders to balance the health and economic advice.
Ahead of Friday’s national cabinet meeting where state and territory leaders will be briefed on the Doherty Institute’s preliminary findings, the Prime Minister refused to commit to lockdowns ending by the end of the year, ­saying “no one can give those guarantees”.
“The virus is unpredictable and it would be irresponsible to do so,” he said.
After the federal and NSW governments this week announced a $1bn-a-week rescue package for businesses and individuals, Deloitte Access Economics partner Chris Richardson said the climbing costs of lockdown relief and the hit to taxes from a slump in economic activity would send the federal budget backwards.
The Morrison government’s cautious approach comes after countries with high vaccination rates – including Singapore and Israel – were recently forced to reintroduce lockdowns and Covid-19 restrictions in response to new Delta outbreaks.
Previous modelling on the Alpha variant provided to national cabinet earlier this year has been superseded by the Doherty Institute’s work on the Delta variant. Senior government sources said a final decision on Australia’s four-stage plan to reopen the country, which is likely to be finalised in August, would be based on the best, most current, health and economic data.
Mr Morrison said while he was confident the nation could get on top of Covid-19 outbreaks and restrictions by Christmas, targeted lockdowns in “extraordinary circumstances” could not be ruled out even when vaccination rates reached higher levels.
COVID-19 Australia: Cumulative vaccinations by state
On the back of a record day of vaccine delivery, with more than 201,000 jabs administered, Health Minister Greg Hunt said the government’s ambition was to return “as close to normal as possible, as quickly as possible”.
Treasury’s updated forecasts, in line with the Doherty Institute’s vaccination scenarios, follows optimistic assumptions in the May 11 budget that said “localised outbreaks of Covid-19 are ­assumed to occur but are effectively contained”.
“It is assumed there are no extended or sustained state border restrictions in place over the forecast period,” they said.
Ahead of the mid-year economic and fiscal outlook this year, Mr Richardson said astounding improvements in the commonwealth budget since May had now been more than reversed.
“The remarkable improvement in the budget before this hit gave us a lot, but it’s now reached a point where the cost of the support measures and the cost of the weaker economy eating into the tax take have taken back more than that,” he said.
Mr Richardson said the federal government would need to borrow up to an extra $20bn to cover new spending initiatives but the decision to ramp up spending was the correct response, and even an extra $20bn in debt would add only marginally to interest obligations.
Moody’s lead analyst for Australia, Martin Petch, said while the lockdowns would trigger a deterioration in the budget, it was not expected to be “material”.
Latest Department of Finance figures showed by May a $13.9bn improvement in the $161bn forecast deficit for this financial year as the recovery ran ahead of the most optimistic forecasts.

Covid-19 Australia: Scott Morrison reveals vaccination targets to get out of lockdown

Full text: Mr Morrison has revealed 12 million doses of a Covid-19 vaccine have been given after national cabinet met and agreed to a new four-step road map out of the pandemic.
He said one in four people over 50 are fully vaccinated and 40 per cent of those over 70. Of those over 70, 80 per cent have had a first dose.
The plan is based on vaccination targets that each state and territory have to reach together based on recommendations from the Doherty Institute.
Mr Morrison said the states have agreed that “no state...is required to increase restrictions beyond where they are right now”.
He said we are still under phase 1 – suppression – of the four phase roadmap he announced last month.
Australia will stay at that stage until we hit a vaccination target of 70 per cent of eligible people.
He said states can only move to the next stage of Phase B if the whole country reaches that average on a national level, and then that state itself also reaches 70 per cent.
“I believe we can get there by the end of the year to 70 per cent. The UK has got there. Israel has got there,” he said.
“It’s done as a team effort. We are seeing our Olympians show that team spirit over there in Tokyo, and we will hit these targets with what I believe will be a gold medal run to the end of the year.”
“All of Australia has to get there together on average,” he said.
The target needed for the next stage, Phase C, is 80 per cent.
He then said lockdowns in Phase B are less likely, but they are possible.
Mr Morrison said once we get to Phase B, vaccinated people will face fewer restrictions.
“The details of that are still to be worked through,” he said.
“They are still to be determined.
“We’ve established a small working group involving the Northern Territory, Victoria and Tasmania, and they will lead the work on that process.
“So if you get vaccinated, there will be special rules that apply to you. Why? Because if you’re vaccinated, you present less of a public health risk. You are less likely to get the virus. You are less likely to transmit it.”
There will also be a higher arrival cap for vaccinated travellers.
After reaching Phase C, he said Australia will lift all restrictions on out-bound travel for vaccinated Australians and extend the travel bubble for unrestricted travel to new candidate countries.
“There will be a gradual reopening of inward and out-bound international travel with safe countries, safe countries, those that are have the same sort of vaccination levels that Australia has and proportionate quarantine and reduced requirements for fully vaccinated in-bound travellers,” he said.
The final phase does not a vaccination target set at this point. One was not recommended by the Doherty Institute.
“The final phase involves opening international borders, quarantine for high-risk inbound travel only... living with Covid,” he said.
“Because once we get above the 80 per cent, the scientific evidence shows that we’re largely then in a place where Covid can be managed consistent with other infectious diseases and of course, we don’t apply those types of restrictions to the flu or many other things like that.”
He also declined to say how long it will take to reach 70 per cent vaccination when asked if it will be by the end of the year.
“We’re not going to set timetables on it. I would hope so, but that is entirely up to how the nation responds to this challenge,” he said.
Mr Morrison said the government was also making great progress on digital vaccine certificates.
“It already exists for those who are getting vaccinated now but to be able to, in the next phase, and we are only days away from this, for it to be dropped into an Apple wallet or wallet,” he said.
NSW WARNS PROTESTERS AS 170 CASES EMERGE It comes as NSW Premier Gladys Berejiklian has said the Covid-19-plagued state has had 170 new cases as the Delta strain continues to spread.
Ms Berejiklian said there were 42 infectious in the community, with 95,000 people tested in the last 24 hours until 8pm Thursday night.
NSW Police Commissioner Mick Fuller also warned anti-lockdown protesters to not come to the city, where 1000 officers will be ready to meet them.
“Please don’t come into Sydney tomorrow to protest,” he said.
“If you do, you will be met by up to 1000 police who will be ready to deal with you, whether that be via the health orders or other laws.
“We know that this is such an important time for New South Wales in terms of winning the battle against the virus and coming into town to protest is not the answer.”
Ms Berejiklian emphasised people should not do anything illegal and said the numbers will continue to “bounce around”, and stressed people should not mix with other households and to get vaccinated.
She also said another vaccination hub at Qudos Arena at Homebush in Sydney’s west will open from August 9 to vaccinate 20,000 Year 12 school students in the 8 hotspot LGAs over five days.
Of the new cases, 65 were in isolation throughout their infectious period and 10 cases were in isolation for part of their infectious period.
The new figures come as Sydneysiders wake to tougher restrictions, including mandatory masks outdoors in eight local government areas.
A 5km travel limit is also in place for those LGAs.
The southwest and western Sydney remain an area of concern. Of the 170 new cases overnight, 87 were from the southwest and 32 were from western Sydney.
“Do not give those you love the most a death sentence,” she said.
“This Delta strain is contagious, it’s deadly and it’s affecting people of all ages but we also know New South Wales that alongside these restrictions, our biggest weapon against the virus is vaccination.
“Can I please encourage everybody to come forward and get vaccinated. New South Wales has already administered just over 3.6 million jabs.”
Targeted lockdowns will continue in Australia well into 2022, according to advice Treasury is handing to the national cabinet.
Scenarios and modelling prepared by the Doherty Institute reveal the necessary vaccination rates needed to allow Australia to open up, and the economic costs of the diffeent scenarios, The Australian reports.
It’s believed the advice contains assumptions lockdowns and other restrictions will continue past the end of this year.
State and territory leaders will be given the data at national cabinet on Friday afternoon. It comes just days after Prime Minister Scott Morrison assured Australians the country would look much different by Christmas, when the vaccine rollout is estimated to be completed.

NED-3760-NSW’s new Covid restrictions
PM WARNS UNVACCINATED FACE LESS FREEDOMS Aussies who choose not to get a Covid-19 vaccine cannot expect to have the same level of freedom as those protected, Scott Morrison says.
National cabinet will discuss modelling that will determine the country’s next phase on the path to reopening.
The Prime Minister said vaccinated people were less likely to transmit Covid-19, get a serious illness and die from the virus.
“We would have to have more restrictions on people are un-vaccinated because they’re a danger to themselves and others,” Mr Morrison told 3AW.
“These are the things we are still working through now because we are not at that point where we have a high enough vaccination rates across the country that enables those choices to be made.”
Mr Morrison said vaccination rates had to hit certain thresholds - being discussed by leaders - before Australia could enter the next phase.
He expects everyone who wants a vaccine will have access to “two shots” by the end of the year.
“Almost 40 per cent of Australians have now had their first dose,” Mr Morrison said.
“You can get your AstraZeneca second dose between four to 12 weeks and your Pfizer in three weeks.”
TASSIES UNDER 40 CAN GET PFIZER JABS All Tasmanians aged 30-39 will be eligible to book a Pfizer vaccine as early as next week, Premier Peter Gutwein has announced.
“From Monday, vaccination centres will start to take all eligible people over the age of 16 and all eligible people over the age of 30 will be able to book a vaccination and there are spots available in August,” Mr Gutwein said.
Health Secretary Kathrine Morgan-Wicks said Tasmania’s vaccination program was “gathering pace”.
“In our older age groups more than 83% of people aged 70 years and over have received a first dose and more than 45% have been fully vaccinated,” she said.
“Community pharmacies will also be shortly joining in and with an increase of Pfizer available to both the state and our GPs we are gathering pace.
“This is absolutely the right time to introduce our 63,000 30-39-year-olds to our vaccination rollout.”
Ms Morgan-Wicks said they had 11,000 extra appointments had just been added in the last hour.
VICTORIA HAS TWO COVID CASES Victoria has recorded two new locally acquired Covid-19 cases on Friday.
The state’s health department announced three new local infections about 8.30am, but one case was previously revealed on Thursday.
That case was detected in Gippsland on Thursday, but chief health officer Brett Sutton said they had been in quarantine during their entire infectious period.
The health department also confirmed all of the new local cases were linked to existing outbreaks and all were in isolation for 100 per cent of their infectious period.
It comes as health authorities confirmed a recent mystery case – a traffic controller at the Moonee Valley racecourse testing site – had also been linked to Victoria’s outbreak.
But chief health officer Brett Sutton said authorities were still scrambling to confirm how the man contracted the virus.
“Further work is underway to determine how the positive case acquired the virus,” he said in a statement.
Victoria has recorded 208 cases linked to the two outbreaks that jumped the border from Sydney’s deadly Delta cluster – one from a team of Sydney removalists who transited through the state and the other from a family who returned to Melbourne’s north from a NSW red zone.
No new cases were recorded in hotel quarantine, with the number of active cases in Victoria at 200 – down from 205 on Thursday.

QLD CASE HAS EXPERTS WORRIED Queensland health authorities are frantically trying to work out how a high school student contracted Covid-19.
The state’s latest community acquired case is a 17-year-old girl, who became ill on Thursday and returned a positive result later that night.
Chief health officer Jeannette Young said it was a concerning development.
“I’m struggling to see how she acquired it,” Dr Young said.
“We do know that we have had 13 incursions of the virus into Queensland over the last six weeks.
“We know that in any particular outbreak, someone can get infected, not have symptoms and then spread the virus to someone else, which is why it’s critically important that we all remain very cautious until the vast majority of people have been able to be vaccinated.”
It’s believed the Indooroopilly State High School student had been infectious and out in the community since July 27.
She had been at school for two of those days.
Queensland Health notified the campus about midnight on Thursday.
A late-night email was sent shortly after to parents, notifying them the school would be closed for 48 hours so deep cleaning could take place and contact tracers could get on top of the spread.
Health Minister Yvette D’Ath said it was not believed the family, from the Brisbane suburb of Taringa, had been overseas.
“Because this is an unknown, unlinked case at this stage, until we get more information, masks are more important than ever,” she said.
The results of genomic sequencing are expected on Friday afternoon.
At this stage, it is not known what strain of the virus the student has or whether it is linked to any other outbreaks.
Brisbane residents are being urged to monitor the Queensland Health website as exposure sites are added throughout the day.
The latest case comes a day after authorities extended mask wearing in 11 local government areas, including Brisbane, for another seven days.

NEW PFIZER / ASTRAZENECA SAFETY STUDY The AstraZeneca vaccine is no more threatening than the Pfizer alternative and patients are more likely to get blood clots from Covid-19 than the jab, a new study has found.
In an article published in The Lancet this week, scientists said the Oxford-made vaccine had a “similar safety profile” to the Pfizer vaccine.
The study showed patients developed blood clotting conditions after receiving the AstraZeneca Covid-19 vaccine at a “similar” rate to those who had the Pfizer shot.
A team of researchers from the UK, Spain and the Netherlands correlated data from over 1.3 million people vaccinated against Covid in Spain, looking for evidence of blood-clotting conditions that developed after they had their vaccinations, according to a report in Euro News.
“In this study including 1,372,213 people vaccinated against SARS-CoV-2, similar safety profiles were seen for both vaccines,” the researchers wrote in their paper, due to be published in the Lancet medical journal.
The study authors reportedly found that people who contracted coronavirus developed blood clots at a much higher rate than those who had received either the AstraZeneca or Pfizer vaccines.
The not yet peer-reviewed findings come after a difficult period for the AstraZeneca vaccine. In April, the European Medicines Agency (EMA) said there was a “possible link” between the vaccine and “very rare cases of unusual blood clots with low blood platelets”.
Following the discovery, many countries around the world set restrictions on its use.
NED-3619-AstraZeneca blood clots-What we know
AUSTRALIA RECORDS MORE CLOT CASES LINKED TO JAB It comes as Australia recorded six more cases of rare blood clots “likely linked” to the AstraZeneca vaccine.
In it’s weekly safety report, the Therapeutic Goods Administration said one case was “confirmed” in a 74-year-old woman from Victoria.
The other cases, deemed “probable”, were two 61-year-old women from NSW, a 71-year-old man from NSW, a 72-year-old man from Queensland and a 77-year-old man from Victoria.
The latest cases bring the total cases of blood clots in Australia to 90 (54 confirmed, 36 probable) from about 6.3 million doses of the AstraZeneca vaccine administered to date.
In Australia, severe cases of blood clots appear to be more common in women in younger age groups. Nearly half of the cases in women required treatment in intensive care.
Four of the five deaths from blood clots linked to AstraZeneca occurred in women aged 48 (two cases), 52 and 72 years old. The other death was in a 44-year-old man.
Early detection of blood clots may help to prevent more serious complications from developing.
The TGA warns people should seek medical attention if they develop any of the following symptoms after vaccination:
- severe or persistent headache, blurred vision, confusion or seizures;
- shortness of breath, chest pain, leg swelling or persistent abdominal pain;
- unusual skin bruising and/or pinpoint round spots beyond the site of vaccination.
The most common time period for onset of blood clot symptoms is four to 30 days after vaccination.

Full text: The Prime Minister on Friday moved to assure Australians stuck at home that the vaccine rollout was gathering pace, with half a million jabs administered over the previous three days.
After a sluggish start to the rollout, 34.5 per cent of the Australian population aged 16 years and over have now had a first dose, with 12.9 per cent fully vaccinated.
“I want to assure people that the path out of this and the four-step plan that national cabinet agreed some weeks ago is very much on our agenda despite the challenges we are currently facing in NSW and Victoria,” Mr Morrison said.
“Work continues to chart that way out and the vaccination rates we will need to achieve over the course of the rest of this year and next year.”
National cabinet agreed to a four-step blueprint earlier this month for a phased easing of ­restrictions once Australians have met the new vaccine thresholds, which will be set using yet-to-be completed scientific modelling from epidemiologists at the Doherty Institute in ­Melbourne.
Mr Morrison confirmed the leaders had formally switched from an elimination to a suppression strategy with the goal of having as few cases of Covid-19 circulating in the community as possible.
“I do note that both premiers (Victoria and NSW) have made it clear and this is the focus of ­national cabinet, that the target here is to reduce as far as possible to zero the cases that are infectious in the community,” Mr Morrison said.
“This is the challenge both in NSW and Victoria, that we ­reduce those cases that are out there and infectious in the community.
“We have seen that rising and we need to see those come down and so (we are) encouraging people to stay home, to get tested and get vaccinated.”
Mr Morrison also took a crack at Labor leader Anthony Albanese’s proposal to only open the borders once Australia develops domestic mRNA manufacturing, has a national purpose-built quarantine system, and an effective public information campaign.
“Anthony Albanese’s plan (is) to open Australia up in 2023,” the Prime Minister said.
“I don‘t think it’s something that Australians would welcome. It’s either an absurd plan or he doesn’t understand how long it takes to implement that element of what he’s talking about.”
Mr Morrison said state and territory leaders had also discussed the use of pharmacists to ­assist with the administration of jabs once vaccine supplies ­increased.
“We will be seeking over the weeks ahead to bring more pharmacists into the metropolitan program in a limited way at first,” he said.
“We will see pharmacists play an increasing role in the months ahead as the supply increases. There is no point having more points of presence with a static amounts of supply.”
Mr Morrison also confirmed the striking of a long-term ­national cabinet deal on Covid-19 disaster payments following a week of bickering between the states over the equity of commonwealth assistance.
Under the agreement, locked down workers will receive federal support through the Covid-19 ­disaster payment, even where a lockdown has been imposed by a state or territory government for a period of fewer than seven days.

Covid-19 vaccine thresholds set higher here than in US and UK

Author: Shanahan, Dennis

Publication info: The Australian (Online) ; Canberra, A.C.T. [Canberra, A.C.T]. 09 July 2021.

Full text: Scott Morrison and state and territory leaders have agreed to take control of the final decision on the vaccination targets that will be used to ease Covid-19 restrictions on business and reopen the borders under the Prime Minister’s four-step plan.
Mr Morrison told The Weekend Australian: “Only government leaders can balance all the needs and risks for both the economy and the health system.”
The Doherty Institute will provide initial advice on scientific modelling for the setting of vaccine thresholds, a spectrum of risk assessments and the potential impact on state health systems.
The institute will also provide recommendations on tiered vaccine thresholds for cross-demographic groups.
Despite public calls from business leaders and some MPs for relatively low, simple vaccination thresholds to be set under the four-step plan endorsed by national cabinet last week, there will not be a single “magic bullet” number.
The government has sought a range of recommendations from the Doherty Institute that includes a “staircase” approach starting with small, staggered changes building up to the lifting of major restrictions.
The recommendations are also expected to involve thresholds in tiers, perhaps 50 per cent vaccination nationally to stop domestic border closures but 70 per cent before the international border can be opened.
There will also be different thresholds applied to different demographic groups, with a higher threshold of national vaccination required for vulnerable and older groups than for younger people.
The calculations for Australia’s thresholds have to take into account the level of Covid-19 antibodies in the community as a result of people recovering from coronavirus infections as well as from vaccinations.
In the US and Britain, which have experienced a high level of Covid cases, with 29 million and 4.3 million people having recovered respectively, there are almost 10 per cent and 7 per cent of the population with antibodies who have not been vaccinated.
In Australia, with just under 30,000 recovered cases and a population of almost 26 million, like Japan, South Korea and New Zealand, the antibodies level from recovered cases is much less than 1 per cent.
Australia, New Zealand, South Korea and Japan are in the lowest five OECD nations for Covid-19 deaths and also in the lowest five OECD members for vaccination rates.
To offset the lower level of antibodies in the Australian community, the Doherty Institute is also calculating the lower risk of Covid-19 spreading in Australia because the virus is not endemic in the community.
Mr Morrison said on Friday the situation in Britain, Europe and the US was “very different” from Australia but he hoped to move into phase two of the four-step recovery by the end of the year.
The Doherty Institute risk assessment and recommendations on the level of national vaccination required to prevent a new surge of Covid-19 is expected to go to Mr Morrison by the end of July.
The recommendations of the Doherty Institute will be considered by federal and state treasuries and federal and state health departments, but the final decision will be made by government leaders. “We will be informed by the Doherty advice. We will be informed by the economic leaders and we will be informed by the health systems. But the leaders will make the final decision,” Mr Morrison said.

Full text: Isolation orders have been issued for anyone who has been in the Meriton Suites in Sydney’s Waterloo after three cases were linked to party there.
NSW has recorded a surge in Covid-19 cases, with 35 new locally acquired infections detected in the past 24 hours. A further two residents of a Sydney aged care facility have tested positive, as the stalemate over Queensland’s quarantine facility nears its end. Meanwhile a majority of Australians believe people who are fully vaccinated against Covid-19 should be exempt from border restrictions, according to a national survey of attitudes to pandemic responses.
NSW Covid Exposure Sites
Rhiannon Down 11.45pm: 600 nurses in isolation across Sydney
More than 600 health workers across two major Sydney hospitals have been forced into isolation after an unvaccinated student nurse worked shifts while infected with Covid-19, leaving hospitals to grapple with major staffing shortages.
Royal North Shore Hospital has lost 500 staff who are currently in isolation after the 24-year-old worked at the cardiology and general abdominal surgery wards at Royal North Shore from June 24 to 28.
A further 120 staff at Fairfield Hospital have also been forced to self-isolate after the same nurse worked shifts at the hospital’s rehabilitation ward.
NSW Nurses and Midwives Association general secretary Brett Holmes said staff were already battling high levels of “exhaustion” amid widespread worker shortages.
“This is a difficult situation and probably the largest number of staff we’ve seen forced to isolate because of their close contact status in the workplace,” he said.
“It’s a massive challenge for the remaining staff at these two hospitals.
“At Royal North Shore they’ve stopped all but emergency surgery and are diverting some patients to other hospitals.”
Mr Holmes said the public health system was already struggling with workforce issues pre-pandemic and the “regular pool of casual nursing staff has been otherwise absorbed”.
Sydney Adventist Hospital in Wahroonga was also added to the list of exposure late on Monday night.
Rhiannon Down 10.30pm: Kate Middleton forced to isolate
Kate Middletonhas been forced into isolation after she came into contact with a positive COVID-19 case, according to reports.
The Duchess of Cambridge was alerted about the possible exposure on Friday afternoon after spending time at the Wimbledon grand slam and has been in isolation since.
The Duchess is required to spend 10 days in isolation under the current restrictions in the UK, despite being vaccinated against COVID-19.
“Last week The Duchess of Cambridge came into contact with someone who has subsequently tested positive for Covid-19,” Kensington Palace told the UK’s Daily Mail.
“Her Royal Highness is not experiencing any symptoms, but is following all relevant government guidelines and is self-isolating at home.”
Rhiannon Down 9.30pm: NSW add new locations to its exposure sites
A Sydney hospital, pharmacy and several eateries have been added to NSW’s list of exposure sites, after the state recorded 35 cases today.
Patrons of the Bridge of Belfield Pharmacy, Frango Charcoal Chicken in Edmondson Park and Little Hong Kong in Marrickville have been asked to get tested and isolate for 14 days after the venues were listed as close contact exposure sites.
Chemist Warehouse in Hurstville, Hurricane’s Grill in Bondi Beach and Bunnings Kingsgrove have also been added to the list as casual contact sites.
Anyone who visited the Sydney Adventist Hospital in Wahroonga on Monday June 28 from 2pm to 2.15pm has been asked to monitor for symptoms and get tested if they appear.
Olivia Caisley 8.30pm: Businesses shut out of jab data proposal

Rhiannon Down 5.55pm: Queensland reveals new exposure sites
A string of shopping outlets scattered across Brisbane have been added to Queensland’s growing list of exposure sites, after the state recorded four local cases today.
Shoppers at Westfield Garden City in Upper Mount Gravatt have been put on high alert after numerous outlets were added to the list of exposure sites including: Wallace Bishop, the Optus Store, Sushi Hub, Coffee Hit, Robin’s Kitchen, Cinnabon and Woolworths.
The K-mart, JB Hi-Fi and Woolworths at Indooroopilly Shopping Centre have also been identified as hot spot venues during the exposure window listed by Queensland Health.
World Gym Mount Gravatt in MacGregor, Woolworths in the Forest Lake Shopping Centre, IGA New Farm, Night Owl in Kangaroo Point, Target Buranda in Woolloongabba and St Lucia Golf Links have also been added to the list.
Rhiannon Down 5.11pm: Vaccine rollout surpasses 8.2 million
The nation’s vaccine rollout has surpassed 8.2 million doses after 54,106 jabs were administered in the past 24 hours.
Some 4,705,214 jabs have been administered by the federal health system, including 4,260,991 through primary care, and 3,550,259 through the states and territories, according to the latest figures from the Department of Health.
COVID-19 Australia: Cumulative vaccinations by state
Virus plagued NSW continued to lead the pack when it comes to vaccination rates with 13,358 jabs administered in the past 24 hours, bringing its total to 921,659.
Victoria remains on top with 1,166,277 jabs in total, including 11,458 in the past 24 hours.
Only 522 jabs were administered in aged and disability care in the last day bringing the sector’s total to 444,223 jabs.
It comes as Council on the Ageing Chief Executive Ian Yates criticised the government for the low rates of vaccination among aged care workers, after five cases at Baulkham Hills aged care facility were linked to two unvaccinated aged care workers.
Rhiannon Down 4.51pm: Staff, patrons ordered into isolation after Meriton party
Staff and patrons who have been at the Meriton Suites in Waterloo over the span of a week have been urged to get tested and isolate, after it was revealed three Covid cases had been linked to an illegal party at the hotel.
Hundreds of Sydneysiders have been affected by the order.
The gathering, which took place at 8pm on Saturday night when Sydney was in the grips of lockdown, has sparked a major infection scare with anyone who attended the hotel from June 26 to the present implicated as a contact.
“Anyone – including guests, staff and contractors – who was on any level of the Meriton Suites, 30 Danks Street, Waterloo, for any amount of time between 7pm on Saturday 26 June and 8am today (Monday 5 July) must immediately get tested and isolate until you receive further advice from NSW Health,” the health body said.
NSW Health has also added the 827 bus from Liverpool to Elizabeth Hills on Tuesday June 29 departing at 8.30am and 9.05am.
The T5 Cumberland train line from Parramatta Station to Liverpool Station has also been added between 7.23am and 7.49am for that same morning.
Several shopping outlets have also been added as exposure sites including ALDI in Rydalmere as a close contact venue and Pindi Supermarket in Auburn as a casual contact location.
Visitors at soccer stadium Club Marconi in Bossley Park in Sydney’s west have also been put on high alert after the venue’s exposure windows were expanded to include Friday June 25 from 2pm to 8.30pm and Saturday June 26 from 10am to 6pm.
Erin Lyons 4.20pm: Shock staff vaccine confession over aged care outbreak
The corporate leader of an aged care centre in Sydney’s northwest has confessed she has no idea how many of its staff have been vaccinated against Covid-19 in a bombshell admission.
Summit Care Baulkham Hills chief operating officer Michelle Sloane told the media on Monday that she simply “didn’t know”.
When asked if workers had refused the jab she said it was unclear.
“I’m unsure of (that). That I haven’t spoken to each one individually. There is quite a lot of them,” she said
Her admission comes after two more residents at an aged care home in Sydney’s northwest tested positive to Covid-19 as fury grows about why unvaccinated staff were allowed to work there.
“In regards to vaccinated staff, I want to say that up until seven days ago we were unable to insist our staff are vaccinated... the government mandated it on June 28,” she said.
“The law had prevented us until then and in fact they were not even obliged to advise us if they had had it.
“In hospitals there are unvaccinated staff, in every kind of business there are unvaccinated staff. If we said to all of our unvaccinated staff, ‘don’t come to work’ then there’d be no one to care (for the elderly).”

Victoria Laurie 3.10pm: Covid-positive crew member hospitalised from ship off WA
A foreign grain ship off the coast of Geraldton in Western Australia reported last night a single case of Covid-19 among its 22 crew members, and the ship will be directed not to berth when it arrives in the southern port of Kwinana.
Premier Mark McGowan says the ship docked in Geraldton this morning to allow the crew member, who is very ill, to be transported to hospital.
The sick crew member is being transferred to a Perth hospital.
The ship has since departed for Kwinana but he said he has requested that the ship, the Singaporean-flagged MV Emerald Indah, should not be allowed to berth.
Mr McGowan said he felt confident that the Commonwealth will respond to his request. He said the same crisis faced the state government last year when eight ships carrying infected passengers or crew arrived in Australian waters.
He said the ill crew member is being treated by fully-vaccinated staff. The man will be added to tomorrow’s Covid infection figures, but no new cases were recorded in WA overnight.
Given the positive result, Mr McGowan said from midnight tonight virtually all remaining restrictions will be lifted after last week’s five day lockdown. Perth and Peel region residents will no longer have to wear a mask outdoors, but will still wear masks indoors and some restrictions on gatherings will still apply.

Rachel Baxendale 2.10pm: Come home now: Warning to red zone Victorians
Victorian Covid-19 logistics chief Jeroen Weimar has says health authorities cannot guarantee a downgrading of red zone classifications for Sydney and Brisbane anytime soon, and Victorians holidaying in those areas should come home.
Many Victorian families have headed to NSW and Queensland for the school holidays, but as things stand they will be stuck doing a fortnight of home quarantine rather than returning to school and work next Monday.
“At this point in time we’ve seen I think four new community cases in Queensland this morning, 35 cases in Sydney,” Mr Weimar said.
“There’s nothing in those numbers at the moment that makes us think we’re going to reduce those red zones anytime soon. So if you’re a Victorian, if you’re in the red zone areas, and you need to be back for a certain time, the sooner you’re back here, you can at least start your isolation period safely back home.
“Do not presume that we’re going to flick a switch anytime in the next couple of days. We have no desire to retain these red zones any longer than we need to, but ultimately it will be determined on the public health grounds and the risks of sparking any outbreaks back here in Victoria.”

Max Maddison 2.05pm: Pfizer application to vaccinate 12 to 15-year-olds
Health Minister Greg Hunt says an application from Pfizer to vaccinate 12 to 15-year-olds is currently being considered by the Therapeutic Goods Administration, as Australia records a record week of jabs.
Concerns have turned to when younger populations will be able to receive their vaccinations, after several children were infected by the highly contagious delta variant, and while Mr Hunt revealed an application was under consideration, he wouldn’t be drawn on when it would be approved.
“In relation to children, the TGA is currently assessing an application from Pfizer. They are very - whilst they work at the fastest possible pace, they work to the fastest possible safe pace,” Mr Hunt said.
“And so they’re doing that assessment and once they have completed all of their safety assessments, then they’ll make their decision. And so I will respectfully won’t pre-empt that.”
The country, however, recorded a record week of vaccinations, with 880,000 doses, taking Australia’s total over 8.25 million. It was a boost of 100,000 on the previous week, and Mr Hunt said it demonstrated that the “distribution system is working”.

Max Maddison 1.55pm: Hunt shoots down Qld push for Toowoomba quarantine
Federal Health Minister Greg Hunt has shot down a push from the Queensland government for a purpose-built quarantine facility to be constructed in Toowoomba, saying the preferred option remained the Pinkenba base.
“To the first one, the answer is no. That’s not deemed a suitable facility at Toowoomba,” Mr Hunt told a press conference on Monday afternoon.
“And indeed, I have spoken with the local member Garth Hamilton, who has reaffirmed the strong overwhelming view of the local community against it. We’re working very constructively with Queensland.”
Meanwhile, Mt Hunt said all of the Baulkham Hills aged care residents who were infected are asymptomatic, with three of the cases likely to return home this week.
Five residents at the SummitCare at the Baulkham Hills aged care facility tested positive to the virus, as part of the growing Bondi cluster, and the Morrison government has attracted criticism for a perceived failure to vaccinate vulnerable populations.
But four of those residents had been vaccinated, while one remained unvaccinated, Mr Hunt said, but all had been transferred to hospital for observation and isolation, with three of those likely to return home over the coming days.

Rachel Baxendale 1.50pm: ‘Red zone’ Vics caught not quarantining
Nine people who have recently returned from red zones were not at home when Victorian health authorities came knocking on Sunday.
A further six who were attempting to enter Victoria from interstate red zones were turned back at the airport.
Victorian Covid-19 logistics chief Jeroen Weimar said 2300 passengers on 34 flights from red and orange zones had been checked for permits at Melbourne Airport on Sunday.
“Six people did not have the right documentation at the airport and they were sent back to wherever they came from in the first place,” Mr Weimar said.
He said health authorities had conducted 252 home visits on Sunday, 239 of which were to red zone permit holders.
“Unfortunately nine people are under further investigation though our public health teams and Vic Pol for potential breaches of those isolation orders,” Mr Weimar said.
“But again, I’d like to focus on the positive and really, my thanks to everybody for doing the hard yards. I know it’s frustrating when you’re coming back from interstate to have to isolate and to do testing, but this is the only way we can keep you safe and keep the rest of our community safe.”
Mr Weimar said Victoria Police had conducted 1217 checks on the NSW-Victorian border on Sunday, with a total of more than 13,000 checks conducted since NSW was declared a red zone.
On Sunday, two people were fined almost $5,000 and sent back to NSW for attempting to enter Victoria without appropriate documentation. One attempt took place at Cann River, in Victoria’s far east, while the other was at Wodonga in the northeast.

Rachel Baxendale 1.25pm: Vic sticks with bulk of NSW red zones, reprieve for some
Red zone classifications remain in place for Greater Sydney, the NSW Central Coast, Wollongong, Shellharbour and the Blue Mountains in NSW, and three local government areas stretching from Brisbane to the Sunshine Coast in Queensland.
Perth and the Peel Region in WA, Darwin and Alice Springs in the NT, the remainder of southeast Queensland, Townsville, the remainder of NSW and the ACT are classified orange.
Red zone returnees must quarantine at home for 14 days, while those returning from orange zones must get tested and isolate until they receive a negative result.
Acting CHO Dan O’Brien said that since Perth and the Peel Region and Townsville and much of southeast Queensland was downgraded from red to orange on Sunday morning, messages had been sent to 506 people who had returned to Victoria from the WA areas and 3679 who had returned from the Queensland areas, letting them know they were free to leave home quarantine with a negative test.
Associate Professor O’Brien said he knew Victorians who were still in or had recently returned from remaining red zones wanted to know when those classifications were likely to change.
“We have to base these decisions on the epidemiological situation at the time, and we reassess this on a daily basis,” he said.
“It’s too early for us to give that picture with confidence. The risk clearly remains and there are increased public health measures still in place within these areas.
“We will continue to recommend that people do not travel to these areas unless it is essential.”

Jess Malcolm 1.12pm: No new cases in SA, raft of restrictions lifted
South Australian Premier Steven Marshall has announced a raft of restrictions will be eased across the state as no new locally acquired cases were recorded in the past 24 hours.
Last week, the state’s Transition Committee enforced a number of rules including limits of people allowed in pubs and restaurants, bans on dancing and public singing, caps on gathering in private homes and mask wearing.
These will all be removed effectively immediately.
Officials have also eased border restrictions with Victoria by removing the requirement for returning travellers to clear Covid-19 testing upon arrival to South Australia.
Premier Steven Marshall said there will be no change to border restrictions with West Australia, the Northern Territory and Queensland yet as authorities need a few more days to assess the situation.
Mr Marshall said the transition committee will meet again this Thursday to review its border policy, but said officials are “pleased with the way the situation is moving”.
He flagged there would not be a change to the NSW border restrictions for some time, and said the case numbers associated with the outbreak were “worryingly high”.
Rachel Baxendale 1.00pm: 23 active cases in Victoria, bulk in hotel quarantine
Victoria currently has 23 active coronavirus cases, 18 of which are in overseas arrivals in hotel quarantine, with the remaining five locally acquired.
This includes two cases detected in international returned travellers on Sunday.
The state has now had five consecutive days with no new community-acquired cases.
Of the five active community-acquired cases, two are in workers from a dry-cleaning business in bayside Sandringham, one of whom caught the virus at a party in Sydney’s Hoxton Park.
The remaining three cases are in close contacts of Victoria’s earlier Kappa outbreak, including in a family member of a nurse who contracted the virus while treating Covid patients at the Epping Private Hospital in Melbourne’s north.
Of more than 200 primary close contacts linked to the Sandringham workplace, 67 of them, or 32 per cent, had been cleared as of Sunday.
Acting chief health officer Dan O’Brien said all close contacts linked to the Epping Private Hospital outbreak had now been cleared, with six primary close contacts linked to the Tanami mine site in the Northern Territory still isolating.
“Therefore our risk radar is still focused on inbound arrivals from interstate,” Associate Professor O’Brien said.

Jess Malcolm 12.45pm: No new cases in nation’s capital
The ACT has recorded no new locally acquired over overseas acquired cases in the past 24 hours.
There were 410 tests conducted yesterday, and there are currently zero active cases in the state.
The ACT has administered a total of 91,190 vaccinations.
Max Maddison 12.33pm: Pandemic road map ‘marketing spin’: Rex Patrick
Independent Senator Rex Patrick says the Morrison government’s four-stage road map looks like “marketing spin”, as he calls on them to be transparent and “lay everything on the table”.
With another string of lockdowns resulting from breaches in hotel quarantine, Senator Patrick said the federal government had managed to make a “shambles” of vaccination rollout and the hotel quarantine system, which he said was only designed to be a temporary solution.
“The big problem here is we’ve had massive secrecy associated with everything to do with things like quarantine and the vaccine rollout because the Prime Minister decided to call the intergovernmental group, where the premiers meet and national cabinet wrapped a secrecy blanket over it,” Senator Patrick told Sky News on Monday afternoon.
The South Australian Senator also took aim at Scott Morrison’s four-stage road map, saying the plan lacked any tangible targets and consequently, was “very difficult” to understand what the Prime Minister was “trying to achieve”.
“So the difficulty here again is we’ve got a four stage plan that looks like a marketing plan. The government has to open up, it has to be transparent, laying everything out on the table and it is proper to set targets.”

Rachel Baxendale 12.29pm: Acting chief health officer named in Victoria
Victoria has a new acting chief health officer, as Brett Sutton takes leave following the conclusion of his deputy Allen Cheng’s secondment to the state health department.
Infectious diseases physician Daniel O’Brien has been assisting the department with contact tracing as a deputy CHO since January, and is now acting CHO in Professor Sutton’s absence.
Associate Professor O’Brien has until recently been consulting privately in Geelong through the city’s University and St John of God hospitals.
He was admitted to fellowship of the Royal Australian College of Physicians in 1999, having completed his medical degree at the University of Melbourne in 1990 and undertaken infectious diseases medicine residencies at the Royal Melbourne and Royal Darwin hospitals.
Over the weekend, Professor Cheng confirmed he was returning to his role as director of infection prevention and healthcare epidemiology at Alfred Health, with a corresponding research role at Monash University.
Professor Cheng said he was leaving a department which was “much better equipped to handle what will come and will continue to improve how things are done”.
He paid tribute to colleagues including Professor Sutton and highly regarded obstetrician and former Safer Care Victoria CEO Euan Wallace, who was recruited as health department secretary following the resignation of Kym Peake, who was secretary when hotel quarantine leaks and contact tracing failures resulted in Victoria’s second wave of coronavirus last year.
Jess Malcolm 12.09pm: Aged care operator unsure why staff weren’t vaccinated
SummitCare Chief Operating Officer Michelle Sloane says she doesn’t know why two thirds of the staff at the Baulkham Hills aged care facility were not vaccinated.
Speaking from outside the facility now at the centre of an outbreak, Ms Sloane said a lack of mandatory vaccination for aged care staff meant she could not force the staff to get it.
“I’m unsure of that,” she said. “I haven’t spoken to each one individually. There are quite a lot of them.
“I have actually gone around personally and at staff meetings once the vaccine was available and urged all of our staff to have it.
“Clearly I’m extremely disappointed. We didn’t want to be the nursing home that had Covid come in.”
Ms Sloane said apprehension about the safety of the vaccine could account for some of the staff being unvaccinated.
She also confirmed health officials do not know the source of the spread between the residents, but said they are contained to one section of the facility.
There were two new positive cases connected to the outbreak today, one of which was unvaccinated.
Ms Sloane said the woman was not vaccinated as she moved into the facility after the vaccination program had been completed.
“We had been arranging for any remaining residents to receive vaccination and that has come about in-between times,” she said.

Jess Malcolm 11.52am: Vaccine rollout ‘the hunger games’: Hazzard
NSW Health Minister Brad Hazzard says the nation’s vaccination rollout has become “the hunger games” as authorities race to vaccinate as many people as fast as possible.
As NSW battles a surge in cases which has now spiked to 312, Mr Hazzard said the top priority is vaccination and called on the federal government to rollout the Pfizer vaccine to more GPs.
“We will continue to have the hunger games going on here in New South Wales,” he said.
“I think the focus should be at the moment, and the federal government appears to be doing this, to try to roll out as much vaccine as they have available.
“I’d certainly like to see them now roll out and support GPs across the entire state of NSW.
“The GPs themselves indicated that they would like to have more of their numbers actually able to vaccinate and I think at some point we will have to go into a more normalised process of vaccine rollout.”
Mr Hazzard said until the commonwealth effectively ramps up the number of locations to deliver vaccines, the challenges will remain.
Gladys Berejiklian said she will welcome the announcement of federal government vaccination threshold targets guided by the Doherty Institute’s advice, saying her government has been calling for certainty “for some time”.
“It really comes down to what targets we are prepared to set and what the timelines are,” she said. “That is what our citizens want from us.”

Jess Malcolm 11.41pm: Alarm over illegal Sydney party cluster
Health authorities are scrambling to track and trace a number of people who attended an illegal party at the Meriton Suites over the weekend in Sydney.
Officials were alerted to a gathering at the Meriton Suites in Waterloo at 8pm on Saturday night.
Three cases have now tested positive, and officials say they are looking “intensively” at this event with more information set to be provided later today.
“What we are looking at is ascertaining and tracking down everyone who was at that event,” Dr Kerry Chant said.
“What our focus is at the moment is that we are really focused on locking any chains of transmission. Hence why it is so critical that everyone continues to come forward and get tested.”
Premier Gladys Berejiklian says New South Wales has recorded 35 new locally acquired COVID-19 cases with 24 in isolation for their infectious periods. “I foreshadowed a few days ago that the numbers were likely to bounce around and that's what we've seen overnight,” she said. “There were 35 cases of community transmission although 24 of those were in isolation for the entire period, so pleasingly whilst the numbers have gone up today, pleasingly 24 of those 35 were in isolation for that entire period. “Health is obviously more concerned with the seven cases that were in the community during their infectious period for the entire time that we understand they were infectious. “That's what Health will be monitoring in the next few days. “I know everybody is keen to know what's going to happen beyond Friday's lockdown, as am I, but what I can tell you with certainty is that the next couple of days will be absolutely critical in allowing our health experts to collate the data that we've had in the last week and then to present their advice to government.”
Gladys Berejiklian said she was frustrated to see people doing the wrong thing during a difficult time.
“Unfortunately, having a party when you’re not supposed to have a party is not doing the right thing and we know, and that some of the cases today are a result of issues or result of incidents where people have done the wrong thing,” the NSW Premier said.
Extensive testing is now underway around the hotel.
Dr Kerry Chant also confirmed the Rose Bay School student who tested positive for the virus as a close contact of a previously reported case.
“The case is a close contact of another previous case and for the abundance of caution we are not exactly sure about the full infectious period but that person may have been infectious at school and hence the usual process around investigations and calling the close contacts for the child’s year group.”

Jess Malcolm 11.28am: Chant on Sydney lockdown ending, schools returning
Chief Health Officer Kerry Chant has refused to say whether Sydney’s two week lockdown will end this Friday, saying the unfolding situation could change rapidly.
Health authorities will continue to closely analyse the data, but Dr Chant foreshadowed the decision could change in a matter of hours.
“I’m making no comment until I’ve looked at all the data,” she said.
“Every day brings a new set of data and a new set of challenges and what we think in the morning can change in the afternoon.
“I’m really pleased to see that we’ve had some people come forward for testing over the weekend, which has allowed us to link unlinked cases and the more certainty we have that we have tracked down every single case of transmission.”
She was also unable to say whether face-to-face learning will return in NSW schools next Monday, asking people to keep an eye out for regular updates on the government website.
“Too premature to comment, it’s a matter for the government,” she said.
NSW Deputy Commissioner Gary Worboys said police have issued 125 personal infringement notices in the last 24 hours, but has commended Sydneysiders for the overwhelming levels of compliance.
NSW Police received over 1000 calls on Sunday from people reporting potential breaches of stay-at-home restrictions, but police are trying to “strike a balance” between allowing people to exercise whilst also enforcing public health orders.
“There are five million people out and about in Sydney over the weekend doing their recreation and their exercise, I must say that I think Sydney did particularly well in terms of complying with the public health orders,” Commissioner Worboys said.

Max Maddison 11.17am: Road map a ‘plan to have a plan’: Keneally
Opposition home affairs spokeswoman Kristina Keneally says the Morrison government’s failure to procure a sufficient supply of vaccinations means the only option available is lockdown, as she calls for an accelerated rollout of fit-for-purpose quarantine facilities.
With Australia’s vaccination rate languishing at the bottom of the developed nations, pressure has come onto Scott Morrison to solve supply issues, and provide a timeline for when Australia can return to normality.
With concerns the national cabinet’s road map to normality failed to include targets or milestones, Ms Keneally said Mr Morrison had already broken a number of promises, and ignored the recommendations from the national review of hotel quarantine, undertaken by Jane Halton.
“So again we have a Prime Minister who loves an announcement, but he’s so light on the details and is never there for the follow through,” Ms Keneally told Sky News on Monday morning.
With Queensland Premier Annastacia Palaszczuk calling for hotel quarantine system to be abolished, Ms Keneally wouldn’t commit to using the infrastructure to bring home fully vaccinated Australians who were still stranded overseas, but said without more purpose-built facilities Australia would continue to suffer restrictions.
“We heard from Mr Morrison this week there was supposedly a four-stage plan. It’s not a plan, it’s a plan to have a plan,” she said.
“Under that plan, lockdown is supposed to be an option of last resort for millions of Australians today. We know the only option on the table is lockdown, and that is because Mr. Morrison has not secured enough vaccine supply.”

Jess Malcolm 11.03am: Virus surge: NSW records 35 new cases
NSW has recorded a surge in Covid-19 cases, with 35 new locally acquired infections detected in the past 24 hours.
Health authorities are concerned about seven cases who have spent time in the community whilst infectious.
Gladys Berejiklian said the next few days were “critical” in deciding whether the lockdown will end this Friday.
More than 58,000 came forward for testing over the past 24 hours.
NSW Chief Health Officer Kerry Chant has confirmed two new cases have been detected among residents in the SummitCare Baulkham Hills aged care facility which was reported earlier today.
One of the residents is a woman in her 70s who was not vaccinated, as she moved into the facility in mid-May this year.
The other new case is a 70-year-old female resident who was vaccinated.
All five residents have been transferred to Westmead Hospital for further observation, including the wife of one of the cases.
New daily cases in New South Wales
NSW health authorities confirmed 33 cases in today’s numbers are linked to known clusters, and 20 of the cases were known household contacts.
There were also 24 cases in isolation through their infectious period, and four cases in isolation for part of their infectious period.
Dr Chant said today’s numbers highlight the importance of getting to cases quickly, especially due to the high transmissibility of the Delta strain.
There are two cases still under investigation.
NSW Health is currently treating four people in ICU, none of whom are ventilated.

Gladys Berejiklian will provide a Covid-19 update at 11am this morning, alongside Health Minister Brad Hazzard, NSW Chief Health Officer Kerry Chant and NSW Police Deputy Commissioner Gary Worboys.
Officials are expected to announce a further two positive cases associated with the Summit Care aged care home at Baulkham Hills, bringing the total number of infected residents to five.
The state recorded 16 new cases on Sunday, and 31 cases the day before. While the NSW Premier has been warning case numbers could still “bounce around”, officials say figures are trending down signifying the success of the two week lockdown.
Sydney-residents will be anxiously waiting to see if the lockdown scheduled to lift on Friday will be extended, with a decision to be made within days.

Lydia Lynch 10.10am: Four new local cases in Queensland
Four new local cases were detected in Queensland overnight.
Annastacia Palaszczuk said all cases were linked to known clusters and although Monday’s numbers seemed “big” they were not of serious concern.
“We are feeling pretty good about where we are at the moment,” she said.
“It just goes to show those short, sharp lockdowns do work.”
Ms Palaszczuk said more than 92,000 vaccines were administered by Queensland Health last week.
More than 100,000 Queenslanders are on the wait list for Pfizer. Ms Palaszczuk many of those people would need to wait until October until more supplies arrive.

Jess Malcolm 9.46am: New school student case in Sydney’s east
A student at a school in Sydney’s east has tested positive for Covid-19.
The Rose Bay Public School principal has written to members of the school community to inform them of the case, requesting all staff and students to go into isolation.
“All staff and students are asked to self-isolate until you receive further advice,” the email reads.
“NSW Health has requested anyone who has been unwell or if you develop any symptoms such as a fever, cough, sore throat, shortness of breath … to be tested at one of the Covid-19 testing clinics.”
The school has been shut down, with testing and tracing underway for all students and staff.
It is currently school holidays in NSW, but schools are set to reopen next week three days after the Sydney lockdown is scheduled to end.
Health officials said on Sunday the next few days were critical in deciding whether students could return to face-to-face learning.

Jess Malcolm 9.30am: ‘States must honour four-step reopening plan’
Australian Chamber of Commerce and Industry Acting CEO Jenny Lambert says state governments must honour the federal government’s four-step plan to reopen the country for businesses and the economy to recover.
Ms Lambert said the reopening of Australia could be threatened if state premiers decide not to stick with the national consensus of vaccination targets and timelines.
“We pushed really hard for a national framework last year to avoid lockdowns … but then within a week or two some states were ignoring the national hotspot definition again,” she told Sky News.
“We need to make sure we get open and stay open, we need to be mindful that businesses can’t survive forever. We can’t continually go from open to lockdown to open to lockdown.”
Ms Lambert said other public health measures must be used in conjunction with vaccination, but that setting time frames and targets was helpful for business confidence.
“We need to rely on more than just vaccination, we need to use contact tracing, masks and other restrictions as needed.”

Jess Malcolm 9.09am: Police slam NRL players who breached restrictions
NSW Deputy Police Commissioner Gary Worboys has slammed the dozen NRL players who were caught at a house party and breaching Covid-19 rules over the weekend.
Twelve Dragons players have now been given $1000 infringement notices after attending a party hosted by Paul Vaughan and his wife on the NSW South Coast.
Commissioner Worboys said officials were “very disappointed” and insisted they should have acted better as role models to the Illawarra community.
“I think we just shake our heads, really, these are people that are in privileged positions,” he told Sunrise.
“When it came out, they were polite and cooperative with police but I am sure today they would be saying ‘why did we actually go down that track?’”
Commissioner Worboys said 186 infringement notices were given over the weekend, and commended most Sydneysiders for acting responsibility.

Max Maddison 8.58am: We’re hostage to Pfizer supply: Labor
Opposition health spokesman Mark Butler has taken aim at the Morrison government’s Covid-19 reopening plan, saying it lacks “details, time frames and milestones”.
With national cabinet agreeing to a four stage process to resume normality, Mr Butler said vaccination numbers remained “shockingly low”, and pointed to several perceived holes in the road map, saying the nation was still “a long way from where we need to be”.
“Frankly, that was what was completely lacking from the so-called plan that he announced last week: the lack of detail, the lack of time frames and milestones means that everyone is really fumbling their way through this because the Prime Minister is not being clear with us,” Mr Butler told Sky News on Monday morning.
Despite Liberal MP Tim Wilson nominating 60 per cent as threshold for moving past the first stage, Mr Butler declined to provide a figure for reopening, instead saying he would wait to see modelling which will be undertaken by the Doherty Institute.
“Well, it all depends on supply and we’re still hostage to the fact that Scott Morrison was desperately slow in striking deals with vaccine companies last year and we’re still paying the price for that,” he said. “We’re still essentially hostage to Pfizer supply.”

Jess Malcolm 8.52am: Send excess AstraZeneca vaccines overseas: expert
Infectious diseases expert Sanjaya Senanayake says Australia should send excess AstraZeneca vaccine overseas as vaccine hesitancy towards the jab means some of the doses could be wasted.
Professor Senanayake told Sunrise changing medical advice has created some hesitancy towards the vaccine, and is worried some doses may expire before they are used.
“With AstraZeneca the messaging and the changing medical advice with the best of intentions has made it very difficult for the public to understand the risks and benefits are a problem,” he said.
Almost 7,000 Australians under the age of 40 have rushed to get the AstraZeneca jab after Prime Minister Scott Morrison announced they would be able to receive it following a consultation with their GP. The Australian Technical Advisory Group on Immunisation advice still recommends under 40s should wait for the Pfizer vaccine and should only receive the AstraZeneca vaccine as a last resort if they have no other options. However, there is still no fixed date for when the Pfizer vaccine will be available to people under 40. Opposition Leader Anthony Albanese criticised the lack of clarity. “That’s what happens when you think it’s not a race, when you think you can just be complacent and sit back and boast about how well you’re going, about how you’re at the front of the queue,” he said. “Well it is a race, and we’re seeing the consequences of it.”
“We need to vaccinate the world so it is such a shame if we are throwing out doses of AstraZeneca here, we should really make sure it gets sent to countries where people will appreciate it and take it up.”
Australia has a plentiful supply of AstraZeneca as it is manufactured domestically, but the extremely low clotting risk and upgrading medical advice for people aged 60 and over has caused some people to be fearful.
He also said 80 per cent of the population needs to be vaccinated in order to avoid lockdowns and travel restrictions, and said any vaccine hesitancy needs to be addressed as a priority for the commonwealth.

Max Maddison 8.40am: Vaccine push needed in remote communities: Wyatt
Indigenous Australians Minister Ken Wyatt says remote Aboriginal communities have become the victim of Covid-19 conspiracy theories, complacency and clotting fears, as he calls for greater engagement to increase vaccination rates.
While there have been zero deaths so far in remote Indigenous communities, the product of strict government restrictions limiting who can travel there, Mr Wyatt said the success was also breeding a sense that vaccinations weren’t required.
Speaking to ABC Radio National, Mr Wyatt said fears of blood clotting, a notion of complacency, and conspiracy theories being spread on social media were all contributing factors to low vaccination rates, and called for governments to work with Indigenous elders to promote vaccines.

Jess Malcolm 8.53am: Another zero day of local cases in Victoria
Victoria has recorded zero new locally acquired cases, and a further two cases in hotel quarantine.
There were 13,086 vaccine doses administered in the past 24 hours, bringing the total number to 1,166,277.
There were 20,690 tests conducted yesterday.
Max Maddison 8.30am: Liberal MP nominates first vaccination milestone
Federal Liberal MP Tim Wilson has identified a vaccination rate of 60 per cent as the threshold to clear the Morrison government’s first stage of the road map on the return to normality.
After national cabinet agreed to formulate a pathway consisting of four stages, the federal government has come under pressure to specify what level of vaccination coverage would be required to enable the country to ease restrictions and limit the use of lockdowns.
And while NSW Premier Gladys Berejiklian had identified 80 per cent as being sufficient to reopen international borders, the Goldstein MP said the target to clear the first stage would be considerably lower.
“Frankly, if we’re going to move past the first stage, it’s going to be somewhere around 60 per cent,” Mr Wilson told Sky News.
“From there the objective should clearly be that people have a responsibility for themselves, a responsibility to their fellow citizens, and as they meet that threshold then the cost ratio moves in favour of getting vaccinated for those who are more aware.”

Jess Malcolm 8.12am: Council on the Ageing’s fury at low vaccination rate
Council on the Ageing Chief Executive Ian Yates is furious at the low rates of vaccination of aged care workers, calling on the commonwealth government to ensure Pfizer supply is made available to ensure vulnerable residents are protected.
The news comes after a Covid-19 outbreak at a Baulkham Hills aged care facility was sparked by two unvaccinated aged care workers.
Mr Yates said he was angry and concerned, particularly for the infected elderly and their families.
“I do not understand for one minute why anybody working in aged care doesn’t want to be vaccinated,” he told Today.
“If you want to work with the most vulnerable people in this context, the best way to protect them is for you to be vaccinated as well as them to be vaccinated.
“The rollout has been too slow and it needs to be sped up as the greatest priority. We know that aged care residents are vulnerable people in a vulnerable situation and the vast majority, three quarters of the people who have died in Australia from Covid are residents.”
National cabinet last week agreed to mandatory vaccination for aged care workers, including $11 million in grants to allow workers to take time off work for the appointment.
It also set a target of mid-September for all workers to be vaccinated.

Jess Malcolm 7.55am: Pfizer rollout expands as over 500 GPs come online
Over 500 GPs across the country will join the nation’s vaccination rollout and start administering the Pfizer vaccine for people aged 40 to 59 today.
Pfizer was previously restricted to state-run clinics and mass vaccination hubs, but the federal government is hoping to ramp up its vaccination rollout by increasing the locations available to give the jab.
The Pfizer vaccine will be easier to access for many Australians with the rollout being expanded to GPs from today. There will now be 500 GPs across Australia who will be able to administer the Pfizer vaccine to patients aged between 40 and 59. By the end of the month the rollout is expected to expand to include 800 GPs across the country. Previously those who were eligible for Pfizer had to go to a clinic at a hospital or one of the state-run mass vaccination hubs to receive the jab.
Deputy Chief Medical Officer Michael Kidd confirmed on Sunday a further 800 locations are expected to come online later this month, some of which in remote areas to increase the rollout in vulnerable communities.
There is still no exact timeline for when under 40s will be able to receive the Pfizer vaccine but supply is expected to ramp up over the next few months.

Jess Malcolm 7.36am: Sydney aged care cluster grows by two
A further two residents of the Baulkham Hills aged care facility in Sydney have tested positive to Covid-19 overnight, bringing the total number of the cluster up to five.
In a letter sent to its residents overnight, the operator SummitCare confirmed the residents will be transferred to Westmead Hospital as a precaution. Both the cases are not displaying any symptoms and are stable.
The outbreak was sparked after two nurses worked at the facility while infectious, with two thirds of staff not vaccinated.
NSW Deputy Premier John Barilaro says officials are “very concerned” about the vulnerable people in the facility, and took aim at the federal government for its vaccination rollout.
“It’s something that is alarming and yes the federal government set a timeline
of the middle of September for workers to be vaccinated,” he told Sunrise.
“I think that what we have seen overnight and yesterday, it’s a reminder that this class of work, these frontline workers, must have priority and I would encourage those aged care facilities to get out and get vaccinations up before September.”
The aged care home has been shut down for deep cleaning, and mandatory regular testing is underway for all residents and staff.

Jess Malcolm 7.24am: Plan for 1000-room Brisbane facility as stalemate nears end
The Queensland government has drafted the specifications for a quarantine facility at Pinkenba, in the first major step towards getting a purpose-built facility near Brisbane off the ground.
The facility would be built at Damascus Barracks and be able to house 1450 people across 1000 rooms.
It is the preferred site of the federal government, who offered to help pay for the facility last week amid multiple outbreaks across the country.
The state government said it would be able to house 800 people per fortnight as a starting point, which is roughly two Australian government charter flights per week.
The site is roughly an eight minute drive from the Brisbane airport, close to the CBD and close to hospitals.
The news comes as Queensland officials are concerned their hotel quarantine system is “stretched”, and have been calling for a reduction in the number of international arrivals into the country. The cap has now been halved which will come into effect from July 14.

Jess Malcolm 7.05am: Joyce looks to future beyond lockdowns
Deputy Prime Minister Barnaby Joyce says the Covid-19 vaccine should be used to prevent death or serious illness, as even with 90 per cent of people vaccinated Covid-19 will still be circulating in the community.
The Prime Minister outlined a four-step plan to reopen the country after a national cabinet meeting on Friday, where Covid-19 could be treated like other infectious diseases.
Mr Joyce told Sunrise the federal government’s new vaccination target is to get to a state where lockdowns will be avoided and the country can learn to “live with the virus”.
“We have to create a society where we live with the virus like we do with the flu on measles and mumps, we don’t want them but we don’t close down the economy because of them,” he said.
“That’s precisely what we’re doing and I think the states are now coming on board with that idea. That set a nation up in a much stronger place.”

Jess Malcolm 6.46am: NZ travel bubble resumes today for some states
Australians will now be able to enjoy quarantine free travel to New Zealand as the bubble resumes today for residents of some states.
Travellers from South Australia, the ACT, Tasmania and Victoria will be eligible to travel across the Tasman quarantine free.
But these travellers must now provide a negative Covid-19 test before they fly, and must not have been in NSW since June 22 or Queensland, the Northern Territory or Western Australia since June 26.
The bubble was temporarily paused in response to the growing number of cases reported in several states across Australia.
A travel pause remains for WA, NT, NSW and Queensland, which will be reviewed by officials tomorrow.

Jess Malcolm 6.35am: Where the nation’s at with Covid outbreak
A Sydney aged care home has been shutdown after two positive cases of Covid-19 worked whilst infectious. Three aged care residents of Baulkham Hills Summit Care facility have now tested positive to the virus, with a further 13 positive cases recorded in Sunday’s numbers. At least 96 per cent of residents had been vaccinated, but two thirds of the staff were not.
Of the new cases in NSW on Sunday, 14 were linked to known sources and 13 were already in isolation. NSW Health authorities said the next few days were critical to make a decision about whether to lift the citywide lockdown scheduled to end this Friday. Several new exposure sites were added by NSW Health overnight, including multiple supermarkets, cafes, liquor stores and busy bus and train routes.
NSW Health has also reissued an alert for a Virgin flight that left the Gold Coast on June 24 at 1.26pm after multiple people tested positive for the virus. Anyone who was on that flight must isolate for the full 14 days regardless of the result.
Queensland Health authorities are confident their latest outbreaks are now under control, with the state recording two locally acquired cases linked to the Portuguese restaurant cluster. Health authorities listed three new exposure sites overnight in Eumundi, Noosaville and Noosa Heads.
West Australian authorities are optimistic restrictions will be able to be eased further on Tuesday, after the state recorded one new Covid case on Sunday. The new case was the partner of an already announced case, and mandatory mask wearing and limits on large gatherings are on track to be lifted pending zero new cases recorded in the community.
Restrictions in the Northern Territory are also on track to ease this Friday after the state recorded no new cases on Sunday. Health authorities are satisfied there are no mystery cases circulating in the community, with waste water testing in Alice Springs and Greater Darwin showing no traces of the virus. NT Police have issued a $5,000 fine to the mine worker who broke stay-at-home orders and visited a local supermarket.

Stephen Rice 5.52am: Daughter erupts over failure to ensure jabs for carers
Kathie Melocco is furious.
Her 88-year-old father has just tested positive for Covid-19 after being infected in a Sydney aged-care home staffed by workers who still have not been vaccinated.
Her anger is palpable: “What we’re observing is that every damn system we’ve got is breaking down. Where the hell is Scott Morrison?”
Allan Patrick and his wife Long, 87, share a room at the SummitCare aged-care centre in Baulkham Hills. Like most of the other 149 residents, both had been vaccinated with two doses of Pfizer and thought they were safe.
But at least two-thirds of the staff had not been vaccinated – and last week two of them were working at the facility while infectious.
On Saturday, Ms Melocco received a phone call saying her father was one of three residents of the facility who had tested positive, and though not showing any symptoms, was about to be transferred to Westmead Hospital.
“They got as far as the ambulance,” Ms Melocco says. “My sister and I refused to let them take him.”

Stephen Rice 5.44am: Flout mask laws and risk arrest
The NSW government is quietly confident that Sydney’s lockdown can end later this week as planned, but has warned that it will come down hard on “wacko” anti-vax campaigners who flout face mask rules.
NSW recorded 16 new locally acquired cases on Sunday, with 13 of those in isolation while infectious, a result Premier Gladys Berejiklian said was evidence the lockdown – due to end on Friday – was working.
The figures were a significant drop from the 35 cases announced the previous day, with Ms Berejiklian expressing optimism that “we are seeing numbers go the right way”.
“But I do say cautiously that could still bounce around,” she warned. “And we’ve seen in the last few days how easy it is for people to unintentionally do the wrong thing, or intentionally do the wrong thing, and that can result in more cases.”
Evidence of that was plentiful in Sydney at the weekend, with beaches, parks and shops packed with people not observing mask and social distancing rules.

Paige Taylor 5.35am: Support grows for vaccination freedoms
A majority of Australians believe people who are fully vaccinated against Covid-19 should be exempt from border restrictions, according to a national survey of attitudes to pandemic responses.
The survey of 3881 Australians from all states and a range of income brackets found 53.4 per cent want border restrictions to end for those who have been vaccinated. The strongest support was in Victoria, where 60.3 per cent of respondents agreed.
The survey categorised respondents by age and found those who agreed most strongly with exemptions for vaccinated Australians were aged 60 and above – 60.1 per cent were in favour.
The survey by CoreData was commissioned by the West Australian Chamber of Commerce and Industry.
It found nearly twice as many Australians believe that interstate travel restrictions should come to an end once vulnerable people – including all Australians over 70, Indigenous people aged 55 and over and aged-care residents and workers – have had the opportunity to get vaccinated.
The survey asked Australians to respond to the statement: “Once everyone in phase 1A and 1B has had the opportunity to be vaccinated, all interstate borders should be lifted”. The survey found 46.8 per cent agreed while 25.5 per cent were opposed.
The WA Chamber of Commerce said the responses were a strong indication that Australians did not want to be held back by those who opted not to get vaccinations.
Sisters Ashley and Holly Creak, who each graduated from study and entered the workforce during the pandemic, are optimistic Australia is finding a path out.
Holly, 23, hopes vaccination will be her ticket to travel more in her 20s. “I would say that with the vaccine things are looking more hopeful,” she said.
“And I think we’re understanding better ways to handle outbreaks – we’re getting on top of them more quickly and managing them better.”

Covid-19: Half a vaccinated nation is enough for MPs

Full text: National cabinet agreed to a four-step blueprint on Friday for a phased easing of restrictions once Australians have met the new vaccine thresholds, which will be set using scientific modelling from ­epidemiologists at the Doherty ­Institute in Melbourne.
Sydney MP Jason Falinski said the two key trigger points to opening up should be all residents having been offered a jab and half of all adults having received both jabs.
“I think once everyone has had the opportunity to be vaccinated and we reach a threshold of 50 per cent, we should move to a staged opening over three months where restrictions are eased gradually,” he said.
“That would build confidence in the community to ensure the health systems can handle it.”
Health Minister Greg Hunt on Monday said the government would continue to follow the ­advice of medical experts when it came to determining the “magic number” for reopening, but warned that if new more virulent variants emerged those reopening targets may be revised.
“It’s likely that these thresholds will be enduring, but if the medical device changes because of a new strain, because of new learning, then we have to give ourselves the honest position of saying we’ll adapt to the global circumstances and adapt to the medical advice,” he said.
Mr Hunt’s Liberal colleague, Tim Wilson, told Sky News a threshold of 60 per cent would be sufficient to clear the first hurdle.
“Frankly, we’re going to move past the first stage, it’s going to be somewhere around 60 per cent,” Mr Wilson said.
“From there the objective should clearly be that people have a responsibility for themselves, a responsibility to their fellow citizens, and as they meet that threshold then the cost ratio moves in favour of getting vaccinated for those who are more aware.”
Since announcing its path to “normality” the Morrison government has come under pressure to specify what level of vaccination coverage would be required to ­enable the country to ease restrictions and limit the use of lockdowns.
NSW Premier Gladys Berejiklian, who has previously identified a target of 80 per cent as being sufficient to reopen international borders, on Monday said supply ­issues were still hampering the state’s ability to get jabs in arms.
NSW Health Minister Brad Hazzard warned the rollout had become “the hunger games” as authorities raced to vaccinate as many people as fast as possible and as the state’s Covid-19 outbreak surged to 312 cases.
Mr Hazzard said the state’s priority was vaccination as he called on the federal government to rollout more Pfizer doses to more GPs.
“We will continue to have ­effective The Hunger Games going on here in NSW,” he said.
“I think the focus should be at the moment, and the federal government appears to be doing this, to try to roll out as much vaccine as they have available.”
Mr Hazzard said until the federal government effectively ramped up the number of locations to deliver vaccines, the challenges would remain.

Full text: All Queenslanders were out of lockdown at 6pm after the state recorded five new cases. NSW recorded 35 new locally-transmitted cases of Covid-19 in the 24 hours to 8pm yesterday but Premier Gladys Berejiklian says the “green shoots” are there after the majority of new cases were recorded in isolation. Epidemiologists believe there will be sufficient Australians fully vaccinated within the next two months to make lockdowns unnecessary in any state. The news comes as Prime Minister Scott Morrison clinched a deal with premiers to return life to normal by tying the national ­reopening to new vaccination targets.
NSW Covid Exposure Sites
Joseph Lam 11pm: NSW caseload ‘predicted’ despite days of lockdown
Australia recorded at least 48 new Covid-19 cases in the past 24 hours as the country reached a new vaccination tally of 8.12 million doses.
NSW recorded 40 of those new cases – 35 locally-transmitted, five overseas acquired – and Queensland the remaining eight, five of which are local cases.
New South Wales Premier Gladys Berejiklian has reassured residents the state's lockdown will not be extended if "all of us continue to do the right thing". “I anticipate that obviously some time next week we’ll be in a position to tell the community where things are at, it’s a bit too soon at the moment,” she said.
NSW Premier Gladys Berejiklian and chief health officer were largely positive about the new cases which were “as predicted”, saying that the “green shoots” of the lockdown were in place.
The two-week lockdown for Sydney and nearby regions is due to end at midnight on Friday, July 9.
“The green shoots of the lockdown doing what we hoped it would are certainly there. We have not seen a huge surge in cases and we certainly feel through our contact tracing that we are not at stage missing any chains of community transmission,” Ms Berejiklian said.
Despite recording eight new cases in her state, Queensland Premier Annastacia Palaszczuk decided that 6pm Saturday was the right time to lift the Brisbane and the Moreton Bay local-government areas out of the lockdown that had been placed on them since 6pm Tuesday.
Some other parts of eastern Queensland also in lockdown had emerged earlier. The latest advice is here .
Restrictions requiring mask wearing and social distancing continue to apply until Friday July 16 in all local-government areas which went into lockdown — not only Brisbane and Moreton Bay.
“We need everyone to pull together and act cooperatively and put our trust in one another, and really think about the most vulnerable people in our community,” Ms Palaszczuk said as she reminded her state it was “not yet out of the woods”.
Saturday also saw Perth emerge from a four-day lockdown, one that was welcomed by its residents but immediately by some businesses, many of which decided it was not financially viable to operate under temporary measures imposed by Western Australia Premier Mark McGowan.
“Even though we’re out of lockdown, we still need as many Western Australians as possible to get tested. The more people get tested, the more confidence we can have when taking the next steps,” Mr McGowan said.
Cottesloe’s Collins Booksellers co-owner Collene Hansen says Perth’s snap lockdown was a “necessary evil” even though the coronavirus pandemic has wreaked havoc on small businesses across the state. “It’s a really difficult time particularly for small businesses like ours and our casual employees – very, very tough,” she told Sky News. “However, a necessary evil, so for the greater good of the community, we kind of had to do it at this stage.” Ms Hansen, however, said restrictions are not the answer to the ongoing COVID crisis and urged the community to get vaccinated to allow businesses to return to full trading. “Thinking that we can contain a virus and just keep going to these snap lockdowns doesn’t really solve the problem,” she continued. “It would be far better for us to be able to see a much quicker response in terms of vaccination – it would be far better if we could have a more orderly and more timely response to get the population as fully vaccinated as possible. “For us to really get back to full trading, to be in a safer position, we really need to have a far better approach to vaccination.”
The interim rules require masks to be worn, a one person-per-four square metre rule and no more than 20 patrons at indoors and outdoors venues.
On the political front, and despite welcoming the majority of Australia’s international arrivals since the pandemic began, Ms Berejiklian found herself in the firing line from Ms Palaszczuk and Mr McGowan for expressing disappointment over Friday’s national cabinet decision to halve the number of international arrivals into Australia.
Ms Palaszczuk told reporters she and Ms Berejiklian tend to share a different view.
“My view, which is shared by, I think, the majority of the states and territories and I think the commonwealth, is that actually, if you reduce the caps, you reduce the risk,” she said.
Meanwhile Mr McGowan said: “You cannot go into the meeting and agree to something and come out and say you do not agree with it.”
The ACT and Victoria both recorded zero new Covid-19 cases in the 24 hours to Saturday, a figure celebrated by Victoria Chief Health Officer Brett Sutton who took to Twitter to share his excitement: “Crushing it, Victoria.”
Federal Health Minister Greg Hunt welcomed the nation’s new vaccine tally of 8,121,649, expressing relief that Australians continued to come forward despite the Australian Technical Advisory Group on Immunisation changing its recommendation that AstraZeneca be given to those over the age of 60.
“To see the strength of those results, both first doses and second doses, coming forward I think is very heartening for the nation,” he said.
Mr Hunt said Australia was due to receive a further 2.8m vaccine doses this month which would arrive in lots of 300,000, 500,000 and 1m.

A string of businesses in Sydney’s eastern suburbs, inner west and southern suburbs including a Woolworths have been added to increasing number of COVID-19 exposure sites.
NSW Health on Saturday evening issued a public health alert which listed a host of new venues of concern.
They included a Double Bay bakery, a Homebush West Indian restaurant, a Service NSW office at Botany, two Five Dock pharmacies and a Woolworths at Mortdale in southern Sydney.
NSW Health has been releasing new exposure sites multiple times a day since the latest outbreak.
NSW Health Saturday July 3 alert
Dozens of venues across the Greater Sydney area are now included in the still growing list.

The owners of a southern NSW cafe accused of breaching public health orders have been threatened with being shut down.
NSW Police said on Saturday that a show cause notice had been issued for a Jindabyne cafe after the owners allegedly twice broke mask rules within 48 hours.
Police were called to the Snowy Valley Way business on Wednesday after receiving numerous Crime Stoppers reports.
They alleged that the owners – a 32-year-old woman and 33-year-old man – were not wearing masks and they were arrested and charged.

Prime Minister Scott Morrison has defended his announcement regarding access to AstraZeneca for those under the age of 40 following days of confusion from Queensland authorities warning people against taking the AZ jab. "The TGA has approved the use of the AstraZeneca vaccine for those 18 and above. Everything I have said about this is completely consistent with the medical advice that is there," he said. The AZ vaccine is expected to take a back seat over the next few months as increased shipments of Pfizer arrive.
Australia's vaccination rate has risen to 8,121,649 million with Health Minister Greg Hunt revealing a significant proportion of doses received are AstraZeneca jabs with over five million AZ jabs administered to date. "To see the strength of those results – both first doses and second doses coming forward – I think is very heartening," he said. "Very significantly, we are passing five million AstraZeneca vaccinations today and we will have approximately 3.1 million Pfizer vaccinations. "Over 6.27 million Australians have had first doses or 30.4 per cent of the nation and 8.8 per cent of the eligible adult population have had second doses. "We are now at 53.4 per cent of over 50s, 62.4 per cent of over 60s, and 70.5 per cent of over 70s so our most vulnerable, as they get progressively older, have greater and higher vaccination rates."
Joseph Lam 3.40pm: Nation’s tally of first doses passes 8m
More than eight million Australians have now received at least one dose of a Covid-19 vaccine after the nation administered a total of 151,496 doses on Friday.
The new tally, now at 8.12 million, representing nearly one-third of the population, was welcomed by Federal Health Minister Greg Hunt, who said the Australian Technical Advisory Group on Immunisation’s change of age recommendation for the AstraZeneca vaccine had not deterred Australians from coming forward to get vaccinated.
Vaccine doses administered in Australia as of 2 July 2021
“To see the strength of those results, both first doses and second doses, coming forward I think is very heartening for the nation,” he said.
Mr Hunt said Australia was due to receive a further 2.8m vaccines doses this month which would arrive in lots of 300,000, 500,000 and 1m.

Hannah Moore 3pm: ‘We have this trapped’: no new cases in NT
The Northern Territory recorded zero new cases on Saturday.
In a Facebook post, Chief Minister Michael Gunner said it was “brilliant” to see Territorians out and about after lockdowns in the Darwin region and Alice Springs ended.
A concerning cluster related to a worker at the Tanami gold mine appeared to be “trapped”, he said.
“For the second day in a row, there have been zero new positive Covid-19 cases in the Territory, and we remain confident we have this virus trapped,” he said.
”We’ve got more than 2500 test results back in the past 24 hours and all of them were negative.”

South Australia has confirmed a positive Covid case detected in a man who had quarantined in Adelaide after returning from overseas. The man in his 20s returned negative results during his two-week quarantine period but has since returned a weak positive result on his routine Day 17 test. The case is now under investigation but is likely to be recognised as a historical case.
Joseph Lam 1.45pm: National cabinet plans a ‘watershed moment’: AMA
Australia is better placed to calculate an appropriate number of vaccinations which would allow the country to make effective decisions surrounding border closures and lockdowns, says Australian Medical Association vice-president Dr Chris Moy.
“There’s been a lot of work over time to do a lot of this modelling and I think we’re in a much better position now to plug in those numbers and determine that,” he said on Sky News on Saturday.
“There will be a separate number for when we’ll be able to open up the country and for when we’ll be able to travel.”
Prime Minister Scott Morrison has revealed Australia’s path out of lockdowns and closures after today’s national cabinet meeting.
Dr Moy also welcomed the four phase plan out of the pandemic which came out of Friday’s national cabinet, calling it a “watershed moment” for the nation.
“It wasn’t overpromising, it had a lot of caveats, but essentially what it said is that when we get to a point where we get a certain number of people vaccinated, we can stop talking about cases because cases become less relevant,” he said.
“What we have to be able to do is get enough people vaccinated so we have enough protection throughout the community.”

The Top End is enjoying a taste of freedom after no new Covid cases were reported with restrictions in South Australia also minimal despite an entire family testing positive to COVID-19. Chief Minister Michael Gunner issued a stern warning to Territorians as he revealed a number of restrictions would remain in place for the next seven days. "If you break our rules, you get caught, and that's why we will keep some rules and restrictions in place for the next seven days to give us an extra level of protection as we step out of lockdown and get back to normal," he said.
Joseph Lam 1.14pm: McGowan blasts Berejiklian on arrival caps
Mark McGowan says he was surprised to learn NSW Premier Gladys Berejiklian was upset that the number of international arrivals into Australia had been halved.
Providing an update on Perth’s lockdown on Saturday, the WA Premier said leaders can’t fall back on decisions they’ve agreed to.
“Well, (Ms Berejiklian) agreed to it. If she didn’t agree to it, she could have a different approach if she wanted to, but she agreed to it,” he said.
“You cannot go into the meeting and agree to something and come out and say you do not agree with it,” Mr McGowan said. “It is not really the Australian way.”
Mr McGowan said despite the Perth lockdown being lifted on Saturday, a number of restrictions would remain in place until Tuesday morning.
“Even though we’re out of lockdown, we still need as many Western Australians as possible to get tested. The more people get tested, the more confidence we can have when taking the next steps,” he said.
WA recorded no new cases of Covid-19 on Saturday and will look to further ease restrictions early next week.
Mr McGowan called on residents to get vaccinated and to support each other.
“I urge everyone, when you are eligible, book your vaccination. Ultimately, vaccination is the only solution for getting out of the pandemic,” he said.
“It has been a difficult period for many. If you’re able to, please visit a local business and show your support.”

Western Australian Premier Mark McGowan says the state has recorded no new cases of COVID-19 as it enters the first day of relaxed restrictions. Mr McGowan said the state had administered 5,667 vaccinations yesterday over 300,000 shots overall and encouraged everyone to get the jab. “I urge everyone, when you are eligible, book your vaccination. Ultimately, vaccination is the only solution for getting out of the pandemic,” he said. “If you're unwell, get tested and stay at home and, please, when your time comes, get vaccinated.”
Joseph Lam 12.42pm: Most states disagree with NSW on borders: Palaszczuk
Annastacia Palaszczuk says the majority of states don’t agree with NSW Premier Gladys Berejiklian’s view on international arrivals.
Responding to questions on Saturday, the Queensland Premier said halving the number of international arrivals was purely risk related.
“Yeah, we have a bit of a different opinion on that. So, my view, which is shared by, I think, the majority of the states and territories and I think the commonwealth, is that actually, if you reduce the caps, you reduce the risk,” she said.
“And that’s exactly what we’re trying to do here. Like I said, our quarantine is stretched, it’s a pressure cooker. We need to reduce some of that risk.”
Ms Palaszczuk said the federal government’s decision to continue repatriating vulnerable Australians from overseas at Howard Springs was “the perfect, logical answer”.
Queensland supported the idea of home quarantine for vaccinated returned travellers, Ms Palaszczuk said. She also believes that all Australians, either leaving or entering the nation, should be vaccinated,
“I don’t necessarily know if it’s preference, but I still maintain that we should have a situation where Australians leaving should be fully vaccinated, and people coming into Australia should be fully vaccinated,” she said.
“But that’s a federal government issue – they are responsible for the circumstances in which people leave and the circumstances in which people come.”

Queensland Premier Annastacia Palaszczuk has welcomed the national cabinet decision to slash international arrivals by half in a bid to ease pressure on the hotel quarantine system amid the spread of the Delta variant. "So, my view, which is shared by, I think, the majority of the states and territories and I think the commonwealth, is that you actually, if you reduce the caps, you reduce the risk," she said on Saturday. Ms Palaszczuk and Deputy Premier Steven Miles criticised the Commonwealth over the borders and called for the Prime Minister to slash the caps earlier this week. New South Wales Premier Gladys Berejiklian expressed her disappointment over the move given NSW took in 3,010 of the more than 6,000 Australians returning to Australia each week. Ms Palaszczuk, however, welcomed the move by Mr Morrison, praising the Commonwealth's decision to repatriate some Australians themselves to Howard Springs as the "perfect, logical answer". "It's a pressure cooker, we need to reduce some of that risk," the premier said. "I think we just need to get on top of it. We need to lower the potential risk, and I think we'll see a good outcome as more and more Australians get vaccinated towards the end of the year. So, it was a very good meeting."
Queensland Police Deputy Commissioner Steve Gollshewski says 11 penalty infringement notices have been handed out to the public for failure to comply with the mask mandate – to remain in place for the next 13 days. The Deputy Commissioner said 452 masks had been handed out to members of the community including four infringements yesterday for failure to wear masks. "That infringement penalty has now risen to $206 for anyone that fails to wear a mask and does not do so when we give them the opportunity," he said.
Joseph Lam 12.23pm: Three key things that will keep Queensland open
There are but just three things that Queenslanders can do to keep their state from entering another round of lockdown, says the state’s Deputy Premier Steven Miles.
“Masks, QR codes, and testing.”
Mr Miles said it was a “huge relief” to lift the lockdown Saturday evening but residents needed to remain vigilant and be aware a number of public health orders remain.
“It’s important that everyone, particularly in the south-east, goes about as though they could come in contact with the virus. And that’s why those three things are so critical,” he said.
“And if we can keep those up for 13 days, we can avoid another lockdown, hopefully this will be our last one … So wear your mask, sign in with the QR code sign-in app, and get tested if you have any symptoms or concerns at all.”

Joseph Lam 12.14pm: Queensland lockdown to end amid five new cases
Queenslanders in Brisbane and Moreton Bay will emerge from lockdown at 6pm on Saturday after the state recording five new locally-transmitted cases of Covid-19.
Premier Annastacia Palaszczuk said it was good news for those emerging from lockdown but the state was not yet out of the woods.
“We need everyone to pull together and act cooperatively and put our trust in one another, and really think about the most vulnerable people in our community,” she said.
“It is just really important over these next days to really think about, if you’re in the vulnerable category, do you need to go out and about in your community?”
Ms Palaszczuk called for store owners to make sure every customer was checking in before visiting their venues.

New South Wales has recorded 35 cases of COVID-19 overnight with nine of these being infectious while in the community. Premier Gladys Berejiklian said the increase in cases was “predicted” and there is evidence the state’s lockdown is working as planned. “While as predicted the number of cases is going up, we are seeing a greater proportion of those cases in isolation, which is exactly what we want to see,” she said. “The green shoots are there, the green shoots of the lockdown doing what we hoped it would are certainly there. “We haven’t seen a huge surge in cases and we certainly feel through our contact tracing that we are not at this stage missing any chains of community transmission.”
Joseph Lam 11.45am: Berejiklian hints at lockdown date decision
As NSW residents hold out for the lockdown ending as planned next week, NSW Premier Gladys Berejiklian has given a hint as to when the decision will be made.
Answering questions from a reporter, Ms Berejiklian said authorities were on high alert as the virus spread away from central Sydney to the city’s southeast and west.
“Look, obviously the health experts are giving myself and my colleagues advice on a daily basis and we obviously look for those opportunities to assess the situation. I anticipate that obviously some time next week we’ll be in a position to tell the community where things are at … it’s a bit too soon at the moment,” she said.
“We have seen the tide turn, we have seen those green shoots, but I also want to stress in particular on top of what Dr Chant has expressed, we’re seeing the virus, the central focus of the cases now, shift from south-east Sydney to parts of Auburn, south-west and Western Sydney.”
Despite NSW recording its highest number of new Covid-19 cases in a single day during this outbreak, Ms Berejiklian said it wasn’t unexpected.
“The next few days will be telling, but so far I’m relieved that there hasn’t been a huge surge in numbers,” she said.
“I’m also received the tide seems to be shifting in relation to the number of people who have been in isolation that are getting the virus, as opposed to those who have been exposed in the community, and that’s positive news.”
READ MORE: Held hostage by fear and lies
New South Wales Deputy Commissioner Gary Worboys says the police have issues 78 infringement notices for COVID-19 restriction noncompliance in the last 24 hours. “The reports to Crimestoppers continue to come in and have increased over the past few days, the last 24 hours, near 350 reports to Crimestoppers (from) people that are witnessing behaviour that contravenes the public health orders,” he said. Deputy Commissioner Worboys said the police “have always said we will take action on that where we can” and said people must stay in the local government area. “People need to be aware it’s not just a choice about being bored, it’s not then just a choice where you might travel that particular day, be aware of the LGA that you live in, where you intend to go, and what the public health orders say.”
Joseph Lam 11.37am: Lockdown rule breakers receive 78 infringements
Three Sydneysiders who drove more than 200km to the Jenolan Caves because “they were feeling bored” have been fined $1000 each.
The group fined were among 78 NSW residents who received personal infringement notices for refusing to comply with public health orders, said NSW Deputy Commissioner Gary Worboys.
“People need to be aware that it’s not just a choice about being bored, it’s not just a choice where you may travel that particular day, be aware of the LGA you live in, where you intend to go, and what the public health orders say,” he said.
“It is quite clear now that people will report this sort of behaviour to police and we’ll take action.”
Mr Worboys also addressed a cafe in Jindabyne which had defied previous police advice.
“More recently one of the owners of the cafe was arrested and placed on bail conditions for working that cafe outside of the public health orders,” he said.
“That was reported to public health who have issued a show cause notice to the cafe owners as to why they should not be shut down.”
The numbers of people calling police to report potential lockdown breaches had increased, Mr Worboys said.
“In the last 24 hours, nearly 350 reports to Crimestoppers, people that are witnessing behaviour that contravenes the public health orders and reporting that to police. We have always said we will take action on that where we can.”
Joseph Lam 11.26am: ‘You don’t win a war with whacko views’
Brad Hazzard has a strong message for NSW residents who refuse to wear a mask despite public health orders.
“We are deep in a war with this virus. And we can’t win this war unless the community are all with us,” the NSW Health Minister said.
“When you’re in a war, you don’t win it with whacko views.”
Mr Hazzard said it was “unfortunate” that some residents failed to understand the importance of wearing a face mask.
“Unfortunately, we’re seeing some people who think it’s OK not to wear masks. My strong message to the community is, we will only win this war against the virus if people wear masks and follow all the other instructions that we understand will keep us safe,” he said.

Joseph Lam 11.03am: ‘Green shoots’: NSW records 35 cases, most in isolation
NSW recorded 35 new locally transmitted cases of Covid-19 in the 24 hours to 8pm yesterday but Premier Gladys Berejiklian says the “green shoots” are there after the majority of new cases were recorded in isolation.
“While as predicted the number of cases is going up, we are seeing a greater proportion of those cases in isolation, which is exactly what we want to see,” Ms Berejiklian said.
“The green shoots of the lockdown doing what we hoped it would are certainly there.”
NSW chief health officer Dr Kerry Chant echoed Ms Berejiklian’s comments, but also called for residents to minimise their presence in indoor retail settings.
“What we are encouraging you to do is to minimise your retail and shopping, minimise as much as possible your exposure in indoor settings and stay socially distanced,” she said.
“Of the 35 new locally acquired cases, 23 were in isolation throughout their infectious period.
“A further three cases were in isolation for part of their infectious period, and nine cases were infectious in the community. Six cases remain under investigation.”
Twenty-nine of the 35 cases were linked to previous infections. There have been 261 locally acquired cases in NSW since June 16, with 207 of those directly linked to the Bondi cluster.

New South Wales Health Minister Brad Hazzard says it is important to follow health advice, saying “we are deep in a war with this virus”. He said it is not possible to win against the virus unless everybody cooperates, saying “you don't win it with whacko views” after members of the public have refused to wear masks. “My strong message to the community is, we will only win this war against the virus if people wear masks and follow all the other instructions that we understand will keep us safe. “Don't get caught up in the whacko views some are expressing."
Joseph Lam 10.53am: Restrictions ease in WA, but not all businesses reopen
While many West Australians were relieved as Perth emerged from a four-day lockdown on Saturday, not all businesses were in high spirits, many of which will not reopen under the current measures.
Mandatory mask use, a one person per 4-square-metre social distancing rule as well as a 20-patron limit at indoor and outdoor venues was enough to deter a handful of businesses who will not be able to make profit under these rules.
In the CBD, the Gordon St Garage cafe was one business which found it financially unviable to open up over the weekend.
“Unfortunately with the capacity limits we will be closed for the weekend, but we look forward to opening our doors soon as restrictions ease,” they said.
Badlands Bar, a live music venue which opens as late as 2am shared that view.
“With the updated state health advice, unfortunately Badlands will be closed this weekend. Emails will be sent out to all ticket holders with show updates/reschedules and refund options,” they said.
“In the meantime be safe and we’ll see you in a socially distanced mosh pit soon.”
On a brighter note, the Hula Bula Bar will reopen, embracing restrictions and calling for patrons to don their usual attire.
“Get your shirt on, bring a mask and if you look like the guy in the middle bring ID.”
Adrian McMurray 10.39pm: NSW Premier to speak amid lockdown extension fears
Gladys Berejiklian will provide a Covid-19 update at 11am AEST. There are fears the Sydney lockdown will be extended, as residents are told to brace for higher numbers of cases due to a ‘lag time’ in those infected people being detected. You can watch the press conference live at the top of this blog.
Joseph Lam 9.38pm: ‘Crushing it, Victoria’: Sutton’s message of hope
Victoria has recorded zero locally-transmitted Covid-19 cases for the third day in a row on the back of performing 24,247 tests.
The positive news sparked some excitement from the state’s chief health officer Brett Sutton who took to social media to congratulate his state.
“Crushing it, Victoria,” he said.
Overnight Victoria changed its recommendation for travellers entering the state from the Local Government Areas of Alice Springs and Greater Darwin including City of Darwin, Palmerston and Litchfield, which are now considered orange zones.
Travellers entering Victoria from designated orange zones must isolate on arrival, get tested within 72 hours and not leave isolation until a negative test is received.

8.24am: No new Covid-19 cases in Victoria
Victoria recorded no local or overseas cases in the 24 hours to midnight from 24,247 tests. An additional 19,623 vaccine doses were administered yesterday.
national cabinet has agreed to a four-phase plan to reopen the country which will depend on Australians getting vaccinated. There are plans underway for a trial of home quarantine for international arrivals and once Australia reaches phase two, lockdowns will only be imposed in worst-case scenarios. Prime Minister Scott Morrison said once “Australia gets vaccinated, Australia is able to live differently”. “Vaccination means that shorter periods of quarantine is possible,” he said.
Stephen Rice 7am: Tracers struggle to get ahead of NSW outbreak
Health authorities fear the Greater Sydney lockdown may have to be extended as case numbers spiked on Friday, with 31 new cases recorded in NSW, amid concerns contact tracers are only now identifying hot spots that pre-date the lockdown a week ago.
Elsewhere, Queensland’s lockdown was partially lifted after three local cases were detected on Friday, with hard lockdowns extended for 24 hours in Brisbane and Moreton, but lockdowns ended in Western Australia and the Northern Territory.
With at least 13 of the new cases in NSW not in isolation while infectious, Sydneysiders have been told to brace for higher case numbers in the coming days due to the “lag time” until cases are detected.
The new cases – the highest number since the lockdown began – bring the total in the state’s outbreak to 226. Premier Gladys Berejiklian expressed cautious optimism that while there was likely to be an increase over the next few days, “hopefully early next week we should see the impact of the lockdown really turning and having a positive impact”.
Greater Sydney’s lockdown is set to end next Friday with the New South Wales government watching case numbers closely.
Read the full story here.
New South Wales Chief Health Minister Dr Kerry Chant says the state has recorded 35 locally acquired cases of COVID-19 and people should come forward to get tested “at the earliest point" they have symptoms. Dr Chant said there were 56,331 tests yesterday, a drop from the day before, and people should be getting tested so NSW Health can “detect any unrecognised chains of transmission” and move to a COVID-19-free position. “We are finding this virus spread so rapidly in your household that when you test positive, a few days later or even at the same time, we are seeing the rest of the household turn positive,” she said. Dr Chant said authorities "really appreciate the community’s compliance” with COVID-19 restrictions and people trying to maintain social distancing in indoor venues such as shopping centres. “I think the community understands the difference between indoor exposures, not being tempted to have people over to your house, whereas we are giving people a bit of freedom to walk around the block in a household group, go down to the park, stay in the household group.”
Daniel Sankey 6.30am: Host of new venue alerts named in Sydney
Supermarkets, a medial practice and a post office are among a host of new venues named as exposure sites by NSW Health yesterday.
The latest exposure sites, which also include bus trips from Randwick to Maroubra, range from Sydney’s eastern suburbs to Strathfield in the city’s west.

Natasha Robinson 6am: Lockdowns can end in two months: experts
Epidemiologists believe there will be sufficient Australians fully vaccinated within the next two months to make lockdowns unnecessary in any state.
As the number of vaccinations hit a daily record of more than 163,000 on Friday, Deakin University’s chair in epidemiology Catherine Bennett said the proportion of people fully vaccinated to avoid the need for lockdowns would be in the order of 30 per cent – a prospect that was likely to be only a couple of months away.
“Thirty per cent is probably enough that it slows the spread of the virus and means contact tracers should be able to do their job,” she said. “It should mean that we’re less likely to need to go to these extreme measures.”
Once the vaccination rate reached between 50 and 65 per cent of a population, transmission of Covid-19 was significantly slowed, allowing the easing of restrictions and a gradual opening of international borders while keeping mitigation measures such as home quarantine in place.
More than 30 per cent of Australians now have received at least one vaccine dose, with 7,970,153 doses administered. The proportion of the population fully vaccinated is 8.37 per cent, and this will rise quickly within the coming weeks with millions of people scheduled to receive their second AstraZeneca shot.

Olivia Caisley 5.30am: PM’s new vaccine targets unlock path to freedom
Scott Morrison has clinched a deal with premiers to return life to normal by tying the national ­reopening to new vaccination targets, under a plan that will leave potential lockdowns and a ­shuttered international border in place for at least another six months.
National cabinet agreed to a four-step blueprint on Friday for a phased easing of restrictions once Australians have met the new vaccine thresholds, which will be set using scientific modelling from epidemiologists at the Doherty Institute in Melbourne.
Prime Minister Scott Morrison has revealed Australia’s path out of lockdowns and closures after today’s national cabinet meeting.
But, to secure the support of national cabinet, Mr Morrison was forced to accept demands from Labor states to slash the number of international arrivals by 50 per cent, amid concern over the more-infectious Delta strain.
The numbers of foreign arrivals will be cut to 3034 a week from July 14 with no end date in sight, dampening the repatriation hopes of 34,000 Australians stranded overseas and alarming business, which is warning of critical skills shortages driven by a “Fortress Australia” mindset.
The Prime Minister sealed the breakthrough agreement in separate late-night conversations with NSW Premier Gladys ­Berejiklian and her Victorian counterpart Daniel Andrews on Thursday, following a week of political conflict between the states and commonwealth over vaccine supply.
AMA Vice President Dr Chris Moy says discussion will no longer be about the “number of cases” following Prime Minister Scott Morrison’s announcement today, but instead “be about the number of hospitalisations and deaths”.

Greg Brown 5.15am: Slashing international arrivals ‘will hurt economy’
Business groups have criticised national cabinet’s move to temporarily halve the number of international arrivals, warning it will hamper economic growth and exacerbate skills shortages.
Business Council of Australia chief executive Jennifer Westacott said it was “disappointing that international visitor arrivals caps have been slashed”.
“We need to get Australians home and we were already spread too thin regarding skills shortages – now those problems just get worse,” Ms Westacott said.
Under pressure from state premiers over the number of people coming into Australia, Prime Minister Scott Morrison on Friday announced arrivals would be halved to 3000 per week “to reduce the pressure on quarantine facilities, due to the increased risks of the Delta strain of the virus”.
Mr Morrison said the caps would “possibly” be lifted at the beginning of next year, if rising vaccination rates allow for restrictions to be eased under the government’s new four-stage plan.
Sky News host Rita Panahi says the reduction of returning overseas travellers is a “pathetic capitulation” by Prime Minister Scott Morrison which shows “how far Australia is from having a proportional, sane response to COVID-19”.

Full text: New Zealand’s bold call to “go hard and go early” one year ago has been further validated by new modelling suggesting Covid-19 elimination was the best option for the economy and public health.
The new Australian study has offered a glimpse at what New Zealand might have faced in 2020, had it picked trying to live with the virus over opting to wipe it out altogether with hard-line measures such as lockdown.
The study simulated four different responses in the state of Victoria — which has a similar age, population and income structure to New Zealand — then analysed how each of them performed against various health and economic indicators.
“From where I sit, this is possibly the best paper yet to try to integrate the epidemiology and economics, so we can ask what’s best for society,” said lead author Professor Tony Blakely, a Kiwi epidemiologist at the University of Melbourne.
The four modelled responses included “aggressive” and “moderate” elimination — both of which aimed to stamp out the virus altogether, but at different paces.
Blakely described aggressive elimination as “going hard”, and likened it to New Zealand’s rapid, zero-tolerance approach. Moderate elimination was more akin to New South Wales’ method, which Blakely said was “not so aggressive, but getting there all the same”.
The other two strategies — “tight” and “loose” suppression — effectively aimed to minimise spread while living with the virus, and had respective targets of keeping daily cases per million people to between one and five, and five and 25. The study, published online ahead of peer review, also used two different types of models.
One was an “agent-based” model to estimate daily infection rates and the time it took to reduce them across Victoria’s four-stage system, which was similar to New Zealand’s. The other model captured a wider picture, estimating long-term health impacts arising from the virus along with costs to the health system, and to GDP.
The study found that while the number of days in hard lockdown were similar across all four strategies, “aggressive” elimination came with the highest percentage of days, with the lowest level of restrictions.
It also showed the long-term health impacts of aggressive and moderation elimination were similar, and relatively low, but those for tight and loose suppression were nearly eight and 40 times higher, respectively. In terms of virus-related deaths over a year-long period, aggressive and moderate elimination kept mortality numbers to 58 and 64 — while the two suppression approaches came with 483 and 2249 deaths.
The total cost to the economy was estimated to be relatively similar between all strategies, but, from the perspective of health-system related costs, aggressive elimination proved the best option.
For instance, health expenditure costs for the first year came in at $3.7m for aggressive elimination, compared with $117m for loose suppression.
Blakely said those results were relevant to New Zealand, which made for a “fairly good substitute” for the state.
He said while there some uncertainties and overlaps between the four modelled responses, “when you weigh it up across them, the elimination responses are optimal”.
“That’s probably as good as we’re ever going to get to being able to understand what we should have done in 2020,” he said.
“And I think it’s very reassuring for both Australia and New Zealand that we pursued an elimination goal.”
Blakely added that the study also captured possible unintended effects of lockdown, like anxiety and depression, but found these didn’t change the overall conclusions.

Blakely added that the study also captured possible unintended effects of lockdown, like anxiety and depression, but found these didn’t change the overall conclusions.

Full text: New Zealand’s bold call to “go hard and go early” one year ago has been further validated by new modelling suggesting Covid-19 elimination was the best option for the economy and public health.
The new Australian study has offered a glimpse at what New Zealand might have faced in 2020, had it picked trying to live with the virus over opting to wipe it out altogether with hard-line measures such as lockdown.
The study simulated four different responses in the state of Victoria — which has a similar age, population and income structure to New Zealand — then analysed how each of them performed against various health and economic indicators.
“From where I sit, this is possibly the best paper yet to try to integrate the epidemiology and economics, so we can ask what’s best for society,” said lead author Professor Tony Blakely, a Kiwi epidemiologist at the University of Melbourne.
The four modelled responses included “aggressive” and “moderate” elimination — both of which aimed to stamp out the virus altogether, but at different paces.
Blakely described aggressive elimination as “going hard”, and likened it to New Zealand’s rapid, zero-tolerance approach. Moderate elimination was more akin to New South Wales’ method, which Blakely said was “not so aggressive, but getting there all the same”.
The other two strategies — “tight” and “loose” suppression — effectively aimed to minimise spread while living with the virus, and had respective targets of keeping daily cases per million people to between one and five, and five and 25. The study, published online ahead of peer review, also used two different types of models.
One was an “agent-based” model to estimate daily infection rates and the time it took to reduce them across Victoria’s four-stage system, which was similar to New Zealand’s. The other model captured a wider picture, estimating long-term health impacts arising from the virus along with costs to the health system, and to GDP.
The study found that while the number of days in hard lockdown were similar across all four strategies, “aggressive” elimination came with the highest percentage of days, with the lowest level of restrictions.
It also showed the long-term health impacts of aggressive and moderation elimination were similar, and relatively low, but those for tight and loose suppression were nearly eight and 40 times higher, respectively. In terms of virus-related deaths over a year-long period, aggressive and moderate elimination kept mortality numbers to 58 and 64 — while the two suppression approaches came with 483 and 2249 deaths.
The total cost to the economy was estimated to be relatively similar between all strategies, but, from the perspective of health-system related costs, aggressive elimination proved the best option.
For instance, health expenditure costs for the first year came in at $3.7m for aggressive elimination, compared with $117m for loose suppression.
Blakely said those results were relevant to New Zealand, which made for a “fairly good substitute” for the state.
He said while there some uncertainties and overlaps between the four modelled responses, “when you weigh it up across them, the elimination responses are optimal”.
“That’s probably as good as we’re ever going to get to being able to understand what we should have done in 2020,” he said.
“And I think it’s very reassuring for both Australia and New Zealand that we pursued an elimination goal.”
Blakely added that the study also captured possible unintended effects of lockdown, like anxiety and depression, but found these didn’t change the overall conclusions.

Albany Creek State High School What is your vision for your school community in 2021?
As this year’s school captains of Albany Creek State High School, we have many ideas on how we can improve our school community and make our school better for all our peers. School should be a place where students feel inspired to achieve their academic and personal goals. We want Albany Creek to be a place where the aim is to learn and excel, in a safe, understanding, and nurturing environment. One of our goals as a leadership team is to promote a community that allows students to shine in their chosen fields and to set goals to surpass their personal best. We want to provide opportunities and resources to explore career pathways, and to accept all students for who they are as individuals. Building off the success of last year’s student leadership team, we are already working hard to ensure that all these goals are achieved before we graduate. We will make our vision a reality by encouraging participation, inspiring students to try new things, and being the best role models we can be. Most importantly, we will lead Albany Creek State High School with respect, responsibility, and resilience to make our school a better place for all.

Ambrose Treacy College, Indooroopilly What is your vision for your school community in 2021?
As a Catholic school for boys, an important tradition is connecting and building relationships across the Junior, Middle and Senior schools. By building a sense of belonging, our Seniors aim to be authentic, approachable leaders. College Captain, Charlie Neumann has unveiled their vision for 2021 which is centred around inclusivity. Charlie says “Boys are most resilient when they have a sense of being part of a family, having different friendship groups and having adult mentors who connect with them. Our student leadership team has mapped out a plan for the year ahead based around our manta of “BELONG”. I truly believe that our vision is echoed across all aspects of College life. We understand the task ahead of us and respect the commitment required to ensure every boy feels like he belongs to our community. A sense of belonging is integral to our culture and it will lead us all towards a better 2021.”

Ashgrove State School What is your vision for your school community in 2021?
As school leaders in 2021, we will encourage others to find their confidence and strive to be individuals who will listen and proactively act upon the ideas of our school community. We believe in leadership that values compassion, confidence and charisma as well as integrity. We are energetic and confident leaders who are optimistic about the future and are focusing on demonstrating and encouraging resilience, bravery and flexibility.

Australian Christian College, Caboolture What is your vision for your school community in 2021?
Our vision for 2021 is to continue to build the college culture to reflect the likeness of God. Build a sense of community throughout the college (primary and secondary), as well as ultimately encourage and inspire peers to fulfil their purpose.

Earnshaw College, Banyo What is your vision for your school community in 2021?
At Earnshaw State College in 2021, we are very privileged and honoured to be given the opportunity to lead and work together towards making our college the best it can be.
Earnshaw State College’s vision is “Every Student Achieving Success”. As college captains, we want to strengthen this culture of success by working together as a Prep to Year 12 school to lift each other up and prepare today for tomorrow. We believe success involves working hard in class, pushing yourself and taking on new challenges. Success can be academic, sporting, cultural and artistic – we value success and effort in a multitude of fields. An Earnshaw student strives to be their best every day. Taking opportunities is one of the best ways to achieve success. At Earnshaw, a wide range of opportunities are available to each student, from Drama Academy to Dance Academy, from Baseball to Digital Technologies. Seeking out opportunities like these puts you one step closer to achieving success.

Beenleigh State High School, Beenleigh What is your vision for your school community in 2021?
We feel honoured and privileged to be representing Beenleigh State High School as leaders in 2021. After a turbulent 2020, this year we are turning our focus to celebrating the diversity that we as a school, and as a community, pride ourselves on.
2020 brought a very specific type of heartbreak to our school community, as we lost a friend and student who would have beenstanding by our side as a leader today. Nehemiah Faleolo fought hard in his battle against brain cancer, and we plan to honour him by emulating the way he carried himself – with resilience, kindness and positivity.
These attributes are what we want to encourage our junior peers specifically, to embody. As a team we are dedicated to beinga positive influence in our community by inspiring resilience, promoting our high achievers, and showing that you must alwaysstrive for your goals.
Our leadership team wants to enhance our connections with the community. Whilst we already take part in various events, andattend leadership conferences that push us to achieve in all realms of schooling, we want to provide all students with thatopportunity.
This year, we want to leave a mark; for ourselves, for our friend, Nehemiah, and for our school. We want our community toknow us as leaders who have a genuine interest in making our school community one that we are all proud of.
In the words of Nehemiah, we will be standing strong as the leaders of Beenleigh SHS.

Bracken Ridge State High School What is your vision for your school community in 2021?
At Bracken Ridge State High the little things matter.
2021 is a year for passionate engagement, expanded opportunities and working together to bring out the best in each other. We passionately believe that while there is accomplishment and pride in being the best, sustained excellence comes from always being involved and doing your best.
Our school community is focused on improving the little things, as we know that these things all combine to have a large impact on our school, the environment and our community. This year we plan to build on our strong community connections to provide purpose in our school and community projects.
At our school, leadership is not a rank or position, it is a choice. The choice to look after the person to the left and the person to the right of us. I know we all love winning and the feeling of accomplishment that comes with it, but sometimes leadership requires us to detach ourselves from our personal feelings about a situation and look at challenges from other people’s perspectives. It is in this moment that we see how little things can make a difference for everyone.

Bray Park State High School What is your vision for your school community in 2021?
It is an incredible honour and privilege being elected as Bray Park State High School’s 2021 school leaders. As the new 2021 student leaders, our priority this year will be to ensure students feel encouraged and supported in their schooling journey to reach their full potential whilst continuing to make Bray Park a safe, respectful, and welcoming learning environment. We desire to keep the Bray Park legacy that continues to develop with every single student who walks through those gates. We want to make sure that every student from Year 7 to 12, can pursue what they want to do in their futures. If we are able to make one person smile, encourage our fellow students to work hard and overall enjoy life, then we will be more than satisfied with the impression we have left on Bray Park. We are extremely thankful for the ongoing effort and support from our teachers and staff as none of this would be possible without them.

Bribie Island State High School What is your vision for your school community in 2021?
Bribie Island State High School is a place where students understand the importance of respect. It is a place where students can show their initiative when undertaking responsibilities. It is a place where students can discover new knowledge in the classroom environment. It is a place where pupils unite as a collective student body. These reasons are why I believe it issuch an honour to be elected as a school captain for 2021. My role centres on encouraging students to reach their full potential, to not settle for anything less than their best and to become part of a high school community that provides a strong senseof belonging and connectedness.
- Jeremy Jenkins
I am honoured to be one of the school captains for 2021. This is an exciting opportunity to challenge myself as a leader, develop crucial communication skills and positively impact the school community. My educational journey at Bribie Island State High School has been very rewarding. Moving into my last year, I hope to embody the student voice and contribute to our dynamic school culture. From my perspective, the most positive aspect of being a student leader is collaborating with others, to fostera welcoming learning environment for all.

Brisbane Bayside State College, Wynnum West What is your vision for your school community in 2021?
In our final year at Brisbane Bayside State College, we as students who have been recognised as leaders, want to uplift the community after the events of 2020. We acknowledge our time to make an impact is finite, so we would like to use every day to ensure we are supporting and connecting with our peers and community after a disconnected year.
We know a few words of inspiration won’t drastically change things for the better, so we are making a commitment to take action each day to support and inspire.
Our vision is to give everyone an opportunity to prosper and to allow our Bayside community to unite through social clubs, extracurricular events, sport, academia and day to day routines.
We endeavor to facilitate opportunities for success, understanding that success looks different for everyone, we will aspire together.
We know that all members of our school are different and it matters deeply to us that Baysiders feel welcomed, safe and wanted in their community. As the 2021 leaders of Brisbane Bayside State College, we pledge to make our goals and vision come to life. Dare to be Wise.

Brisbane Boys’ College, Toowong What is your vision for your school community in 2021?
The Brisbane Boys’ College student theme for 2021 is ‘Belong’, which we believe encapsulates a key element of our BBC spirit.
To belong is to feel more than just accepted, it’s a feeling of attachment, support, pride and love. We want every boy to wake up and want to come to BBC, to feel a part of our community each and every time he puts on his uniform, raises his boater and sees his mates.
BBC is a community that celebrates achievements, restores confidence, supports through challenges and embraces a spirit that sets us apart from all other schools.
In support of our 2021 theme, all students in the Junior, Middle and Senior School wear lapel badges as a visual reminder that they have a special place in our College community, and all have a role to play in ensuring that our culture and spirit provides a place of belonging for all boys.
We want our College to be defined by a brotherhood that is so unified, that the silent character of our boys is deafening.
- Mason Black (College Captain), Matthew Bennett (College Vice Captain) and Nicholas Munro (College Vice Captain)

Brisbane Girls Grammar School, Spring Hill What is your vision for your school community in 2021?
Sisterhood. Love. Gratitude. They are words that are so frequently used in today’s society, but what do they truly represent? To us, these three words have come to epitomise the spirit and culture that we nurture at Brisbane Girls Grammar School.
The Grammar sisterhood is already well-established, but this year, we hope to explore how this driving force makes our school culture so special. We proudly recognise Brisbane Girls Grammar School as a sub-section of young individuals in modern society. And in doing so, we steered beyond gendered connotations and instead chose to redefine ‘sisterhood’ as the solidarity of people based on shared conditions, experiences, and a sense of belonging. This idea guided our 2021 vision and eventually formed the basis our school motto: “When the sisterhood unites, the royal blue shines bright”.
We envision the sisterhood to take shape in a community where every student feels genuinely supported, appreciated, and at ease in their own skin, allowing each of us to contribute uniquely to the royal blue of our school. The phrase ‘royal blue’ has developed to represent this unity and symbolises the identity we share in our love for this School and our community.
Making an analogical leap, we are reminded of the term ‘phosphorescence’— a sustained emittance of light after the absorption of energy, or ‘the light within’ according to Australian author, Dr Julia Baird. We aspire to inspire our ‘sisters’ to bephosphorescent and shine with a radiant quality, achieving their full potential, brilliantly and uniquely.
- Sophie McLeod and Victoria Chen

Brisbane Grammar School, Spring Hill What is your vision for your school community in 2021?
The Class of 2021’s vision, “Belong to the Blue”, stems from our strong sense of community at Brisbane Grammar School. We aim to redefine how we perceive our collective identity by fostering inclusive and respectful relationships. Our differences are celebrated and protected, with the recognition that we do not have to be the same for all of us to belong.
We may live in divisive times, but we are united in the light dark blue.
Belong to the Blue is a means for each boy to find purpose through engagement and pride, and in doing so, unites us all.

As a school captain it is important, for not only me but my fellow student leaders and SRC members, to be representing students’ voices and help get their ideas and aspirations through – making a change to the school and our school community for the better. To do this, communication will be important between staff members and fellow students. Achieving this will help to create an environment where students feel safe, accepted and most importantly, driven to succeed.

It is with a mindset of community connection and self-reflection that Nick, Maddie and the Year 12 Prefects take into 2021.
“We are part of a community and it is important we remain connected and supportive of all students.

Clontarf Beach State School, Clontarf What is your vision for your school community in 2021?
Our vision is that Clontarf Beach State School becomes a role model for other schools. We value being supportive of each otherand inclusive. As captains, we see it as our responsibility to lead the school to become a bully-free zone where students include each other when playing and learning. The organisation of different activities throughout the year, including more sporting activities to help students with teamwork, and to be healthy and active, will help with this. Fundraising events will be organised to buy more equipment. We aim to leave this school with children showing more care for not just each otherbut the broader community. This will be accomplished by having more fundraisers for charities and by taking responsibility for areas around the school community, such as cleaning up the school grounds and the beach. We look forward to the challenges of 2021 in making Clontarf Beach State School the school everyone looks up to. We are, as always, Clontarf Stars!

Further to this, we want to encourage everyone to push past their own comfort zones, embrace support networks and create a positive legacy for future leaders to build upon.
Leadership is not beyond anyone. A leader is not only someone who receives a badged position, but anyone who takes a leap of faith to pursue opportunities that are presented to them. For those who have the opportunity to undertake a leadership position this year or in the future, we encourage you all to step out of your comfort zone. You have nothing to lose and everything to gain.
The year 2020 highlighted the importance of maintaining physical and mental health as well as healthy relationships with people we care about. So, in 2021 we would like to place a great importance on ensuring we are taking care of ourselves and our peers.
We are honoured to be leading the charge in our school’s community. We will focus on nurturing the limitless potential of our young minds, readying us for the outside world and also paving the path for “Future You”.

All four students are excited to take on their demanding and rewarding roles for 2021.

They are particularly focused on making sure that all students feel welcome and a part of the Deception Bay North State School Community. Running the whole school assembly each week is nerve wracking still but they have already mastered raising and lowering the flags each day.

Flagstone State Community College
My name is Ryan Porter and I am one of the 2021 captains for Flagstone State Community College. My motivation for becoming a leader has always been to help students and to be a role model for positive change. Hence a main goal of mine for 2021 is to open a room during lunchbreaks where all students are welcome to come along and participate in games, conversations etc. to make their schooling experience just that little bit better. A main goal for the entire captaincy team for 2021 is that of conveying our new vision; PRIDE where we have chosen key aspects from the previous captaincy team’s vision and aim to convey the aspects of being respectful, inspired, determined and equitable each term. I hope that being a captain during 2021 builds my leadership capabilities which will help me in my future endeavours to become a mechanical engineer in the Australian Defence Force.
- Ryan Porter, Captain
My name is Emily Maltby, and I’m one of Flagstone State Community College’s two captains for 2021. I went for a captaincy position because I wanted to have an active role in the college community that would allow me to leave a lasting effect on the college.
I’m passionate about having an impact and being a captain is a great opportunity to create positive change throughout the college. My main goals as a leader are to increase participation in college events and help others to be more motivated in their studies and goals. As well as this, I hope to help make Flagstone a more accepting and equitable place. In general, my aspirations at the moment involve completing Year 12 and maintaining my current level of academic achievement throughout the next year. After school, I hope to go to university, and I would like to pursue a career in research or mathematics.
- Emily Maltby, Captain
My name is Kheanne Toney and I am the Vice-Captain for Flagstone State Community College 2021.
What motivated me to become a leader was more than having a badge or a fancy title but having the chance to make a positive influence on students. As a leader I wanted to be more involved in organising college activities and events in all categories such as sport and the arts. In addition, I wanted to be a leader as I believe I would be a good fit for the role due to my leadership and teamwork skills. My goals for 2021 as a leader is to be a role model to the lower grades and help spread the new acronym created by myself and the other captains ‘RIDE to PRIDE’. P – Proud. R – Respect. I – Inspired. D – Determined. E – Equitable. The aim of this acronym is to focus on a letter for each term and be “Proud” to be a Flagstone student throughout the entire year. After school, I am wanting to go to university and study education to become a primary school teacher.
- Kheanne Toney, Vice-Captain



My name is Jet-li Iefata, the Vice-Captain for 2021. My motivation to become Vice-Captain came from my parents, and teachers.
I am aiming for something that we can all be proud of and to be a voice and make a change in the college community. My goals for next year are to support and help the other leaders accomplish their goals and to make people feel welcomed and feel like they belong to the college community. This will hopefully be through the special events the college holds, through the creative arts, indigenous and sport areas. I also want to help others find a passion that makes them unique and find who they are. After high school, I don’t plan on university or TAFE. I prefer to continue and grow my love for travelling and music and do what makes me happy, work hard, make money, and use that wisely and eventually invest in my own company.
- Jet-Li Iefata, Vice-Captain

As young leaders in our global world we find it our duty to encourage our peers to involve themselves in the happenings of our community and find small ways to help improve things for the better.

Iona College, Lindum What is your vision for your school community in 2021?
Iona College, a Catholic school in the Oblate religious tradition, focuses on educating and empowering young men to dare to make a positive, spiritual and practical difference throughout their lives and the lives of others. This year Iona has challenged every Ionian to ‘Let Your Light Shine’. The 2021 theme invites, challenges, compels and implores us to shine brightly. We invite our community to do their best, to be their best and to achieve their potential so that we all benefit as individuals, as a College and as a community.
Thomas Waters, Co-College Captain
For me, the best aspect of being an Ionian is being given the opportunity to make a difference, both within our school and in the wider community. It is through this spirit that the idea of Iona not being the best school in the community, but the best school for the community was born.
Each one of us has unique strengths we should use to commit to serving our community, because when we work together, our light shines brighter.
Hamish Colbert, Co-College Captain
Servant leadership is about random acts of kindness and the gifts you give without expecting anything in return. If we all play our role, go the extra mile and show respect, we will grow as individuals, and we as a collective will prosper.
Every one of us has the ability to live, to learn, to lead, and to serve, and in doing so, our community will be stronger than ever.

Kedron State High School What is your vision for your school community in 2021?
As school captains of Kedron State High School, we envision a collective sense of resilience and unity within our school community. 2020 was an unforgettable year. COVID-19 prevented us from working together as a whole school through extra-curricular activities and community events, which have traditionally brought us together. In these times, we can always rely on what we call “The Kedron Way”.
“The Kedron Way” is more than an attitude, or path, but rather a belief that participation - whether that is on the sporting field, in the classroom, or behind a music stand - is essential to building a friendly and welcoming school culture. We do not want 2020 to be remembered as the year of the COVID-19 pandemic, but rather have 2021 be remembered as the year we prospered together.

We want to inspire the College Community to act with compassion, be courageous and kind in both word and deed, and be fearless in spreading hope and love.
“At Lourdes Hill, we are fortunate because our College has a happy, calm, and positive attitude to learning. Everyone is given the space to be themselves. This balanced approach creates an atmosphere ideal for students to learn and be the best they can be in order to achieve their goals.
We believe every student has the capacity to make a difference and create a better world.
And, as leaders, our vision for 2021 is for all students to ‘step forward and shine’.”

MacGregor State High School What is your vision for your school community in 2021?
Student leadership at Macgregor State High School enables voice and agency to empower students to be creative, take risks and have a positive impact. Our Student Leadership Team is comprised of students from Years 7 to 12. These leaders represent their cohort and an academic, cultural or sporting facet of the school. In 2021, we will seek to consolidate the legacy of our 2020 Student Leadership Team. As a team, they did extraordinary work in strengthening and unifying our school culture in ways that epitomised our school values. We admire their significant influence and the humility they exhibited in their leadership, and hope to continue this progress throughout the year. Our vision for 2021 is based on the notion of “Impact”. This theme was chosen through an extensive collaborative and design process with our year level leaders from Years 8 to 12. Students shared ideas and through a voting process as a Student Leadership Team, we narrowed the emphasis to “Impact”. In 2021, we want to have a meaningful impact at MacGregor, in order to continue the legacy of student leadership at our school. We will continue to create opportunities for our Student Leadership Team to contribute to our culture in alignment with our values of respect, integrity and diversity, as our community strive to be The Best We Can Be.

Marist College Ashgrove What is your vision for your school community in 2021?
The Marist College Ashgrove student leadership team for 2021 looked at the year that had been. We looked at the year thatwas like no other. The year that pushed us to our limits. And in doing so we decided that “REVIVE” will be the theme for 2021.The word revival means “an improvement in the condition, strength or fortunes of someone or something. It is “an instance of something becoming popular, active or important again.” Revive is a verb, a doing thing, a tangible way of showing thatMarist College Ashgrove men are men of courage and men of hope.
Although we do not know what 2021 holds with regard to COVID, let us revive and rebuild, let us take the good humour, theresilience and the brotherhood anew into 2021.

Marsden State High School I am the third of four children and am working towards going to university in America to pursue my passion for football (soccer) while also receiving an education.
I was shy as a child and a fairly slow learner during my primary years. I had to work hard to understand simple concepts and if it wasn’t for my teachers and my mum’s help and support in making sure I was understanding my schoolwork, I would have never reached my full potential. This has taught me that I have to work hard if I want to succeed and to not just do a task half-heartedly. I now choose to push myself in all aspects of my life and through my passion for sport and the support of my coaches and teachers, my confidence has grown dramatically. This year, I am studying mathematic methods, general English, biology, psychology, physical education and football recreation. I hope to use my love for science and sport to study exercise science or become an Occupational Therapist. I also want to push myself in my football to see how far I can get in my sport. These goals keep me motivated to work hard in my academics, sport and to also pursue leadership positions so I can reach my full potential. I not only want to make myself proud but also show my parents, teachers and coaches who have supported me along the way how thankful I am for what they have done for me. I am extremely excited to be part of the Commonwealth Bank mentoring program throughout 2021.

My name is Elenoa Tuihalangingie. I am of Tongan heritage and am the second youngest of six children. I will be the first to go through to university.
In primary school, I became a part of the school council and was observing from afar. My role as a leader started off slowly with some unwanted distractions that followed me as I entered the gates of Marsden State High School. At that point, I did not really like attending school and it wasn’t my main focus. But I met teachers who listened to me and I moved ahead, making new friends before I started to focus on myself, my wellbeing and my future. This year, I am studying mathematics B, English, business, legal studies, certificate ll in tourism and drama. I am an outgoing person who loves to meet and get to know new people. I am beyond excited to be a part of the Commonwealth Bank mentoring program and can’t wait to see what the future has in store.
- Elenoa Tuihalangingie
I am a 17-year-old who is constantly striving to be the best version of myself. I like getting out of my comfort zone and exploring new things.
I am a people person; I really enjoy the company of others. I am a very outgoing and friendly person, who loves to meet new people. Leadership has always been a big part of my life, whether that’s at home, in my friends’ group or when I had my first official title as class captain in grade 5. I was a year 10 and year 11 advocate and was part of the Make a Difference program at Marsden High which really pushed my boundaries and extended my leadership skills. Teaching has always been a vision that I have looked towards and after doing work experience at the primary school and an M-line, which placed me in a year 7 class, my passion for teaching grew and was further nurtured by my teachers who always make me feel supported at school. I want to be that teacher that I always looked up to, to kids in the future, which is pushing me to want to lead a path of secondary education in university. Throughout year 11, I have shifted a few subjects until I found what was right for me and am now continuing an upward climb to achieve my goals, studying the subjects, chemistry, biology, business, general mathematics and English. I am looking forward and really appreciate being given the opportunity to be a part of the Commonwealth Bank mentoring program in 2021.

Kason is the eldest of two children and will be the first in his family to graduate from high school.
His leadership journey first began in year 6 where he found his passion and skill in leading a large group of people, becoming school captain at Burrowes State School. Kason continues to improve his leadership skills and activities such as participating in team sports and casual work, throughout his journey at school, through primary and secondary. Kason always loved the environment of school, learning new things and aspects of life on a daily basis, even when many students around him did not feel the same way about school. He was inspired to become school captain at Marsden by his experience at primary school, then through seeing the school captains at Marsden doing their duties and inspiring other students, which motivated him to do the same.

Milton State School What is your vision for your school community in 2021?
Our Vision for the school year of 2021 is a sustainable, smart, inclusive, creative, and happy school environment. We love having a fun and inclusive learning system especially when learning gets tough for students.
At Milton State School, we believe student opinion is crucial for successful learning. Students learn better when they are engaged and interested. We would love to see student opinions being included in indoor and outdoor learning.
We believe that outdoor learning is greatly beneficial for those who are not great learners. Fresh Air, space and a change of environment are good for the body and mind and will help the brain focus on learning activities. We would love to see classes learning outside more often and getting the fresh air and space that they need.
Finally, we’d love to see Milton come together to recover from the Covid pandemic. Recovery would include organising more clubs, and social and sporting events.

As leaders of the Moreton Bay College community, we strive to generate a vision for both our school and wider community that exists not only within our time as leaders but sustains in word and deed for years to come.
Indeed, at its heart, our ambitions for 2021 are to foster a sense of belonging, culture and inclusivity at the Bay, ensuring MBC is a place where individuals feel seen, heard and valued.
Furthermore, not only do we hope to create an environment that encourages our students to be the best versions of themselves, but we wish to enrich our community through emboldening students to act authentically; to own their individuality.
This vision, reflective of the central beliefs and values that underpin the Moreton Bay College spirit, is embodied pertinently in our 2021 Senior Legacy, ‘Together we Stride; Power of the Pride’.
However, we feel it is imperative that whilst we look towards our future, we acknowledge and take notice of the struggles and hurdles we as a community have overcome in the past year. In doing so, our vision, at its core, remains fundamentally linked to enhancing the spirit in our community.”

Northside Christian College, Everton Park What is your vision for your school community in 2021?
The vision for the Senior School leadership team at Northside Christian College is, “No matter what, people matter!”
“When people see that they matter to us, they begin to realise they matter to Jesus, and when they realise that they matterto Jesus, Jesus begins to matter to them. Every day, we each have an opportunity to make a difference in someone’s life. We may never realise the impact our words and actions have on others.
The challenge from Luke 2:32 is that it’s easy to love our friends, but it is much harder to love those who aren’t. The typeof love that Jesus exemplifies is unconditional and freely given. Our desire is that during this year we would look at removingsome of the conditions that stop us from loving others, as “No matter what, people matter!”
We run events because people matter. We can have a positive impact in our community so that every single person can feel valued.We don’t want to focus on the what, but the why: people. We want to make the most of the opportunities around us, and as wework together, we can show people that they matter to God, because in the end that is all that matters.

Ormiston College What is your vision for your school community in 2021?
The annual Prefect’s Investiture and Junior School Student Leaders Induction at Ormiston College is a significant tradition shared by the entire student body, members of staff and invited guests. Not only does it bring together all year levels, it allows the entire school community to unite in understanding and celebrating the importance of leadership and responsibility.
An Ormiston College education looks to inspire a strong work-ethic that will successfully lead to lifelong learning: it requires its students to be responsible individuals by always showing consideration to others; moreover, it provides many opportunities from Prep through to Year 12 for its students to develop leadership skills.
Following their official induction, this year’s Captains, Charlotte Lane and Sam Dench took to the podium to inspire their fellow students to create a year of unforgettable memories and everlasting connections.
In her speech Charlotte asserted, “Commit to all areas of your school life and demonstrate pride in doing so. This year we aim to foster the connection in what unites us as a College. Connecting with your friends, peers, teachers and co-curricular teams is what will make this year like no other.”
Sam followed, directing his address to the Year 12 students, he said, “Build connections, build relationships and build friendships. Not only do these friendships give you the opportunity to lean on each other, they also make the tough times a little easier. So, as we count down the days together between now and the end, we look forward to working alongside you and we encourage you to make the most of all the co-curricular activities run by the Leadership Committees and build those everlasting connections.”
A meaningful conclusion to an annual tradition that involves the whole student body and unites the entire Ormiston College community. All attendees left the event with pride and confidence in the leaders of 2021.

Parklands Christian College, Park Ridge What is your vision for your school community in 2021?
This year, our leadership team came up with a word for our school to focus on for 2021 - ‘bridge’. Last year was a difficult year for many within our community. Due to the pandemic, we became a divided nation and school; effecting the connection and sense of school community. We want to bridge the gaps within our community - to reconnect and unite together in a new fashion that will make 2021 a unique and memorable year. Though COVID-19 still effects us, our dedication to serving the community will persist. We want to leave a legacy of connection that continues from generation to generation. We want to be known as Christ centred leaders that put the students at Parklands first.
Recently, our team had the opportunity to develop our vision and skills for the year at the Compass Conference for student leaders. During those few days we met many other leaders around the state that shared our vision for the new year. We learnt valuable lessons and skills that helped us expand our perspective and develop our yearning for connection. The conference encompassed the importance of telling our stories to influence our peers. We recognise that everyone has their own story, and it is important to make school a place of story telling. It is our hope and prayer as College Captains that our community hear our story and work towards our vision of bridging the gaps in society.

Queensland Academies Creative Industries Campus (QACI) What is your vision for your school community in 2021?
Our school is a learning environment that allows all students who come here to thrive and be their authentic self. This positive and open-minded ideology is something I would like to perpetuate this year at QACI through engaging with many opportunities in local community groups and within our school. This year for QACI is a year of perseverance and excitement as we bounce back from 2020.
- Aarya Dath, Student Director for Positivity
As the director for Creativity, Activity and Service (CAS), I envision a school community where all students work together to improve both our own lifestyles and our broader community. CAS is based around the idea that when we are all creative, active and help others, we can all grow as learners. I am a firm believer in this philosophy, and I hope to share this value with the school community by running community outreach events and encouraging students to reach their full potential as community members.
- Adam Charters, Student Director for CAS (Creativity, Activity & Service)
As Persistence Director at QACI in 2021, my vision for the school community this year is to continue demonstrating the importance of persistence through my actions. Persistence is the ability to follow through on a goal even when faced with adversity. The value of this was demonstrated both last year during lockdown and currently as we still face many challenges from Covid-19. In my role as student director my goal is to encourage the QACI community to persist and stay strong throughout the year as we face current and future obstacles. My vision is to see the community continuously persist and understand the importance of this QACI pillar in achieving their goals while also maintaining a positive outlook on life.
- Chiara Du Plessis, Student Director for Persistence
What makes QACI so special to us all is our tight-knit community and nurturing culture. As one of the 2021 Student Directors, my vision is to ensure that these values live on and that we continue to foster a welcoming and motivating environment for everyone. At QACI, whenever I’ve undertaken challenges or left my comfort zone, I’ve never felt I was on my own. This year, I hope to bring that same support and encouragement to others in my community as they progress through their QACI journey.
- Elizabeth Pico Gonzalez, Student Director for Passion
As a part of the Student Director team, we will be organising many fundraising events to advocate for social justice issues whilst simultaneously preserving the supportive school culture of QACI that we hold dear to our hearts. I hope to improve the lives of others on a local and global scale, any little way we can. My personal goals as a Student Director are to be a supportive friend to my peers, help them achieve their personal best by informing them of school policies, and in a friendly manner, remind them to remain mentally flexible as we head into the final years of our schooling in a wonderfully complex and forever evolving world!
- Morgan Lee, Student Director for Preparedness
It can be deduced that not only was the year of 2020 a crazy year in terms of worldly events, but additionally a stressful and difficult time for students across the globe. Nonetheless, I know that although it was tough, students found what they hold most important in life whether it be personal, work or life related goals. Taking what we’ve learnt from 2020, I believe that Queensland’s 2021 school community is stronger than ever. My vision for this year seeks to take on all the challenges and opportunities presented to students with an attitude that strives to achieve our highest goals.
- Riley Brooker, Student Director for Pride
I want school to be a place where students feel emotionally comfortable and confident; a place where they find openness to be who they are as young people. Schools should focus on embedding a nourishing environment where students are able to express their thoughts, ideas and capabilities. I think school should focus strongly on facilitating and supporting the student’s strengths to be a kind and nurturing human being. So, my vision for this year is to help make school a place that young people want to attend every day, where they are constantly engaged, excited, challenged, and guided.
- Surya Sharma-Brymer, Student Director for Principled

Queensland Academy for Science, Mathematics & Technology, Toowong What is your vision for your school community in 2021?
This year is a momentous one for our Academy, as it is the first time we are hosting a full Year 7-12 cohort. I am very excited to work alongside my fellow leaders in serving our school community and uniting the Academy, whilst pushing towards our own goals. It is an honour to represent our student body, promote agency, and build upon QASMT’s high performing legacy.
- Grace Terec, Year 12

It is my hope that as student leaders we can create transparency between the students and community, and encourage every individual to become a leader in their own right. I hope that as leaders we not only represent the ideals of the Academy, but use our shared experiences to foster a community of understanding, empathy and diversity. As a school leader, I believe we should broaden our horizons and recognise each and every student’s achievements - no matter how big or small.
- Annabelle Green, Year 12

Change is a part of everybody’s lives, but it has especially been part of ours in the last few years. Putting aside the pandemic, QASMT has experienced massive changes, including adding three new year levels, and two new buildings. Because of this, we need leadership and student agency, so that we can provide stability to students and allow their voices to be heard. We are looking forward to promoting these core values in the year ahead.
- Josh Waghorn, Year 9
This year, I strive to learn how the Academy community can become more united and when we do make mistakes, that we learn and grow in a positive way. I want there to be a strong sense of community in our Academy and for everyone to feel comfortable in sharing their opinions, thoughts and ideas to student leaders. I also want the student leaders to reflect on previously held, leadership-led events and activities, and identify the aspects that could have gone better. Reflecting on the event, taking responsibility and developing new strategies for how we run future events, are all part of my vision for 2021.
- Georgia Tan, Year 9

Ivy wants to be remembered as an enthusiastic School Captain.

Redcliffe State High School What is your vision for your school community in 2021?
Our vision for our school in 2021 is to become more inclusive. Our major goals include increasing participation in school-based clubs and increasing the inclusivity between all grades and genders. This could be incorporated into both the rugby league and girls sport and fitness excellence programs, as our school prides itself in achieving exceptional sporting performances.
The Interact Club and Student Council are two of our clubs that will be joining together this year in the hopes to have more students helping with the volunteer work and fundraising activities that our students strive to complete. This year we will have the Senior Executive and Junior Leaders work more closely with these clubs to create bigger fundraisers and raise more money for the charities we volunteer our time for. These clubs promote good relationships between students from all grades, also improving the communication between year levels within the school.
We would like to make this year the year to introduce an Inclusivity Week where we have a new activity each day that students from all grades can interact with. For example, one day of the week we could have a stand where students write ideas on how to be more inclusive on pieces of paper. Some of these responses can be shared amongst each grade on the year-level assemblies to promote inclusivity within the school.
This is only the start to a long list of ideas we have for 2021.

Redeemer Lutheran College, Rochedale What is your vision for your school community in 2021?
Our vision for the Redeemer community in 2021 is to establish culture through connection. This year, in conjunction with our College’s theme of Living Hope, we aim to grow in community, by making valuable connections within the wider school environment. As we are all stronger together, we aim to encourage a community of service and engagement, with our hope anchored in Christ. We would like to continue the legacy of previous College leaders, by placing people over projects. Throughout our limited time at Redeemer, we will strive to create a legacy, not promoting our names, but rather a culture of positivity and a willingness to engage in student life. We aim to lead Redeemer as a whole, creating connections between the Junior and Senior Schools, and between all year levels. By establishing personal relationships, we wish to foster a safe and welcoming environment and to form genuine, caring friendships. Last year’s College Captains met every challenge they faced with unrelenting optimism, and this year we aim to do the same, as we look towards the hope of the year ahead. We strive to place quality over quantity, by shaping lasting relationships and supporting others to do the same. By encouraging our College’s core values of being curious, courageous, and Christ-led, we want our actions to speak louder than our words, as we strive to achieve these goals.

As Captains and Vice Captains of Sheldon College, we know that we must make every moment this year count following the previously unprecedented year. We are striving to bring back the things that make our community who we are, along with new initiatives. In 2021 we endeavour to increase school spirit through involvement in the areas of sport, the Arts, academia, along with community engagement, thereby creating a lasting impact on the College.
The House Cup Initiative is a way of unifying the entire College Community, by involving competitions between spirit houses in sporting, academic and cultural senses.

Smaller events, such as 3v3 basketball or paper plane competitions at lunch will also contribute, whilst also giving our prefects an opportunity to lead within their own faculties.
Charity initiatives are a valuable opportunity for us as a College to get involved with the broader community, whilst also cultivating relationships both within the College and outside. The Buddy Reading Program, Rosie’s, Clean Up Australia Day, and each individual charity event from each year level of our College, are all initiatives we wish to develop to create a lasting impact on not only our College, but on the wider community as well.

Sherwood State School What is your vision for your school community in 2021?
Our vision for 2021 is having more community events, moreinteraction between the year six students and our younger grades and making our school more environmentally friendly. A way we would demonstrate some of the community events is school discos where we can all have a fun time and come together as a school community. We could also have fetes and other fundraising events to support our school and raise money for some of the items that the
school has been needing. This year we were hoping to have more interaction between the year
sixes and our younger grades. Whether that be implementing a prep buddy system or having sports captains do some activities down on the oval with the preps and younger grades. By doing this we hope demonstrate the school expectations we have here at Sherwood to teach the little kids how to be great leader for the future so Sherwood can keep evolving and become a better learning space. To make Sherwood a cleaner, greener place to be. We will
implement this by putting more recycling and general waste bins around the school to stop kids from littering. We also aspire to introduce compost bins to Sherwood as well as the containers for change programme. This is our vision for 2021 and we hope that it will make Sherwood a better place to be.

We are both so excited to see the changes that our leadership journey will bring to the St Aidan’s community.

St Benedict’s College, Mango Hill What is your vision for your school community in 2021?
This week the College celebrated their 2021 College Opening Mass. They commissioned their Year 12 College Leaders, inducted Year 12 Leaders to their final Senior Year, and inducted all Year 11 students into their Senior Years by presenting them their Senior Ties. They also took the opportunity to commission the College Leadership Team and Staff to their educational vocation for 2021. All students pledged their commitment to serve the College and to strive to reach their fullest potential.
This year the College theme is “Presence and Possibilities”. Their Benedictine spirituality reminds them to look for Godin all things – when they find the Presence of God, they can sit in God’s presence and listen for where they are called – being open to the possibilities that are placed before them. They have chosen as their image – the “Compass” because it symbolises the many paths or direction that they may take. A Compass can help the Community find our way and it ensures we don’t gooff track.
In 2021 they stand together as a Community imbued with our values and priorities, ensuring that the year results in all that is good and successful and continues to be a true reflection of their College Mission.
There is no doubt this will be a year filled with exciting learning opportunities and engaging activities for students whoare being encouraged to be present and enhance strong connections with each other and within the community as they navigate the many possibilities ahead.

Martin Luther King once said that a leader is ‘moulder’: a person that has the ability to make change in any form. We, asleaders, have the tools to enact such change and will work hard in 2021 to demonstrate, promote, encourage and create a positive College community that will leave a lasting impression for all.
We cannot wait to all work together to achieve this.

“Even though last year held many challenges for Nudgee College, it’s inspiring to see how eager we are to get back to normal.

St Patrick’s College, Shornliffe What is your vision for your school community in 2021?
Leadership at St Patrick’s College comes with great responsibility and learning. Our leadership journey started at our Senior Student Induction liturgy on the last day of Term 3 last year. Our senior cohort has chosen 5 powerful words as our motto throughout our time as leaders at St Patrick’s. These words are … Commit, Serve, Inspire, Together … Brothers!
Student leadership at our College is considered the responsibility of all, not just those elected to College Leadership positions. Therefore, every one of our peers is committed to be a servant leader, one who will serve our community and inspire the wholestudent body to follow our example. We believe that our strength lies within our diversity and inclusion of all. We are committed to working together as a Band of Brothers to build the capacity of each other and all members of the St Patrick’s community. It is our genuine hope that by the end of 2020, each of us have learned more about ourselves through the leadership opportunities that are given to us throughout the year.
We would also like to wish the very best to Year 12 students (and leaders) in all schools.
Let us all hope that it is a year that we can all remember fondly.

St Paul’s School, Bald Hills What is your vision for your school community in 2021?
Don’t Hold Back! For some, this may remind you of a Jeep advertising campaign, but at St Paul’s, the student leadership teamhave embraced this as our School theme and vision for 2021.
Every year at St. Paul’s, the leadership team create a school theme to represent our legacy for the ongoing year. After COVID-19,we decided to use our theme as an empowering motto to get everyone back into the school routine in a unified and enthusiastic manner. Every student, right from Pre-Prep to Year 12 is encouraged to put themselves out there and get involved.
For example, this was perfectly seen during our Valentine’s Day event. A small idea to sell personalised roses was amplified,with all school leadership portfolios working together as one, with profits going towards our School Production. The theme nicely tied into some of our School’s realms of thinking, such as ‘Openness to Experience’ and ‘Tolerance for Ambiguity’.
Our goal is to continue to build a strong sense of community throughout the entire school using our theme. We want every student to reach their full potential and we will be doing all we can to get alongside one another and demonstrate a heartfor servant leadership.
As a school we want 2021 to be an opportunity to establish a new ongoing culture of resilience and teamwork with everyoneprepared to not hold back.

St Peters Lutheran College, Indooroopilly What is your vision for your school community in 2021?
Unity after hardship — it’s a vision so fitting for leaders on the recovering side of a global pandemic. The 2021 Captains at St Peters Indooroopilly plan to move into a phase of leadership characterised by oneness; one College body, working together to serve the wider community.
“Through COVID we didn’t have much interaction with the community outside St Peters,” Vice Captain, Jake Harford, shared. “It meant that we weren’t able to help out when it was most needed. This year, we want to change that. We want to help the community around us bounce back, and we want the whole College to get involved.”
More to that, the Captains want to unite the Year Levels.
“Our vision is to have everyone excited to come to school every day,” College Captain, Maddie Rushmore said. “We’re so lucky to go to such an amazing school and we have so many opportunities available to us. We just really want to encourage people to make the most of them and give things a go — get involved and develop inter-Year Level relationships.”
Plans for that are well underway, and the Captains have gone above and beyond in their first efforts. From sacrificing holiday time to welcome new students on their Orientation Day; to travelling to the Sunshine Coast to help out on Year 7 Camp, there’s not much these Captains won’t do to achieve their vision.
Best of luck 2021 Captains. You are going to achieve great things!

St Rita’s College Clayfield What is your vision for your school community in 2021?
This year, St Rita’s College’s pillar is Hospitality and we aim to embrace every student at St Rita’s like family at our ‘heaven on a hill’. Our theme for 2021 is “hands of hospitality”, encouraging students to recognise their power to positively impact our community. Each Term will target a specific aspect of hospitality, promotedby an accompanying hand symbol.
Term 1 is Welcoming Spirit, represented by a waving hand. By bringing together the College as a community and promoting spirit, a welcoming and hospitable environment will be created by and for everyone.
The focus for Term 2 is on Welcoming Self, represented by love heart hands to emphasise the mental health of students. This is all about self-compassion, self-love and being hospitable to ourselves.
And finally, we will Welcome Others in Term 3, represented by the peace sign. To spread hospitality outside of the College, members of the wider community will be welcomed and treated with hospitality.
Community spirit and passion is so important in order for students to respect and support one another. We want to ensure that everyone feels included and encouraged to try their best at all they can. One way we will acknowledge this is through ourpeer-nominated “hospi-pal” awards, to acknowledge superstars who make our school a better place, regardless of how big or small their acts are. Hospitality is about reaching out a hand for those in need. We want this idea to flourish in 2021 by encouraging and recognising these acts.

Stretton State College What is your vision for your school community in 2021?
A leader is someone who listens and understands the needs of the people, giving them a voice to be heard. As a College Captain of 2021, it is my duty to communicate with students and teachers in order to bring everyone closer together as a community. I look forward to collaborating with my fellow Captains and School Leaders in making Stretton State College the best school it’s ever been.
- Jerry Li
Captaincy is not defined by the figure speaking on assembly; it is not defined by a badge. A true leader is characterised by their SPIRIT, purpose, and teamwork.
- Serena Huang
Being a leader, is more than being the person with the badge. It is about making connections, helping others, and being the voice for people. While having the badge does make it easier to create change, leadership is not defined by this, everyone has the opportunity to lead in their own way.
- Isaac Miles
Our vision for this year is to be approachable and include everyone’s ideas and thoughts. I see leadership like a race not finishing first but staying behind and helping everyone cross the line. We want everyone to feel like they belong at our school and see the senses of community that our school lives up to. Our goal for this year leave behind a legacy of mate ship, inclusivity, and kindness.
- Eloise Butler

Sunnybank State High School What is your vision for your school community in 2021?
Our primary goal for the Sunnybank SHS School community in 2021 is to continue to facilitate an environment that is inclusive of everyone. For us to achieve this, our leadership team will strive to organise more events that are inclusive of all year levels. We will maintain a close relationship with the junior students; even after the Orientation Buddy program has occurred, our senior leaders will continue to value and build on inter year level friendships. We hope to grow this by encouraging students to get involved in year level events, maintain a close partnership with their Year Level Coordinator, and encourage participation in whole school activities such as sporting carnivals. We will also value our community engagement and are committed to continuing our connections with community which includes our Wednesday activities down at the Sunnybank Special School and our annual STEM challenge with local primary schools. Several members of our leadership team are also applying for Youth Parliament as they wish to be involved and make real changes to the community around us. However, most of all our vision for this year is one of all-inclusive fun and long lasting memories.

- Ben Southam, Captain
As Vice-Captain at Trinity College, it’s truly been one of the best learning experiences thus far. I’ve done nothing like this before, and I can say that I’ve become less anxious than I was at the very beginning from when we started at the start of term 4. I feel like it’s because the trinity family allows me to feel accepted and unafraid to voice my opinion, especially the staff. The role Maiella and I have been given pushes us to work even harder than ever before, and with the Trinity Leadership team by our sides, it feels like anything is possible. At events like the school barbecues,and swimming carnival - our leadership skills are shown to develop and allows us to recognise we are all in this together.”
- Junior Sakoonchai, Vice-Captain.

Windaroo Valley State High School
What is your vision for your school community in 2021?
The Leadership Vision created by our 2021 student leadership focusses on two key aspects this year:
- Visual presence throughout the school
- Community/school involvement
The student leaders will endeavour to be visually present throughout the school community. The aim is for all students in the school to easily recognise the student leaders. The team has identified that being approachable and supportive are critical components to ensure the school culture is inclusive.
The second part is student involvement across the school. The 2021 student leaders believe they can have a significant impact both in school and community through their involvement in events that promote connectedness. Our leaders will seek feedback from students in all year levels on ways to embed activities within the House Cup framework. The objective will be to identify activities that encourage participation by all students.

Albany Creek State High School What is your vision for your school community in 2021?
As this year’s school captains of Albany Creek State High School, we have many ideas on how we can improve our school community and make our school better for all our peers. School should be a place where students feel inspired to achieve their academic and personal goals. We want Albany Creek to be a place where the aim is to learn and excel, in a safe, understanding, and nurturing environment. One of our goals as a leadership team is to promote a community that allows students to shine in their chosen fields and to set goals to surpass their personal best. We want to provide opportunities and resources to explore career pathways, and to accept all students for who they are as individuals. Building off the success of last year’s student leadership team, we are already working hard to ensure that all these goals are achieved before we graduate. We will make our vision a reality by encouraging participation, inspiring students to try new things, and being the best role models we can be. Most importantly, we will lead Albany Creek State High School with respect, responsibility, and resilience to make our school a better place for all.

Ambrose Treacy College, Indooroopilly What is your vision for your school community in 2021?
As a Catholic school for boys, an important tradition is connecting and building relationships across the Junior, Middle and Senior schools. By building a sense of belonging, our Seniors aim to be authentic, approachable leaders. College Captain, Charlie Neumann has unveiled their vision for 2021 which is centred around inclusivity. Charlie says “Boys are most resilient when they have a sense of being part of a family, having different friendship groups and having adult mentors who connect with them. Our student leadership team has mapped out a plan for the year ahead based around our manta of “BELONG”. I truly believe that our vision is echoed across all aspects of College life. We understand the task ahead of us and respect the commitment required to ensure every boy feels like he belongs to our community. A sense of belonging is integral to our culture and it will lead us all towards a better 2021.”

Ashgrove State School What is your vision for your school community in 2021?
As school leaders in 2021, we will encourage others to find their confidence and strive to be individuals who will listen and proactively act upon the ideas of our school community. We believe in leadership that values compassion, confidence and charisma as well as integrity. We are energetic and confident leaders who are optimistic about the future and are focusing on demonstrating and encouraging resilience, bravery and flexibility.

Australian Christian College, Caboolture What is your vision for your school community in 2021?
Our vision for 2021 is to continue to build the college culture to reflect the likeness of God. Build a sense of community throughout the college (primary and secondary), as well as ultimately encourage and inspire peers to fulfil their purpose.

Earnshaw College, Banyo What is your vision for your school community in 2021?
At Earnshaw State College in 2021, we are very privileged and honoured to be given the opportunity to lead and work together towards making our college the best it can be.
Earnshaw State College’s vision is “Every Student Achieving Success”. As college captains, we want to strengthen this culture of success by working together as a Prep to Year 12 school to lift each other up and prepare today for tomorrow. We believe success involves working hard in class, pushing yourself and taking on new challenges. Success can be academic, sporting, cultural and artistic – we value success and effort in a multitude of fields. An Earnshaw student strives to be their best every day. Taking opportunities is one of the best ways to achieve success. At Earnshaw, a wide range of opportunities are available to each student, from Drama Academy to Dance Academy, from Baseball to Digital Technologies. Seeking out opportunities like these puts you one step closer to achieving success.

Beenleigh State High School, Beenleigh What is your vision for your school community in 2021?
We feel honoured and privileged to be representing Beenleigh State High School as leaders in 2021. After a turbulent 2020, this year we are turning our focus to celebrating the diversity that we as a school, and as a community, pride ourselves on.
2020 brought a very specific type of heartbreak to our school community, as we lost a friend and student who would have beenstanding by our side as a leader today. Nehemiah Faleolo fought hard in his battle against brain cancer, and we plan to honour him by emulating the way he carried himself – with resilience, kindness and positivity.
These attributes are what we want to encourage our junior peers specifically, to embody. As a team we are dedicated to beinga positive influence in our community by inspiring resilience, promoting our high achievers, and showing that you must alwaysstrive for your goals.
Our leadership team wants to enhance our connections with the community. Whilst we already take part in various events, andattend leadership conferences that push us to achieve in all realms of schooling, we want to provide all students with thatopportunity.
This year, we want to leave a mark; for ourselves, for our friend, Nehemiah, and for our school. We want our community toknow us as leaders who have a genuine interest in making our school community one that we are all proud of.
In the words of Nehemiah, we will be standing strong as the leaders of Beenleigh SHS.
- Phoenix Tulimaiau and Tyrone Torralba

Bracken Ridge State High School What is your vision for your school community in 2021?
At Bracken Ridge State High the little things matter.
2021 is a year for passionate engagement, expanded opportunities and working together to bring out the best in each other. We passionately believe that while there is accomplishment and pride in being the best, sustained excellence comes from always being involved and doing your best.
Our school community is focused on improving the little things, as we know that these things all combine to have a large impact on our school, the environment and our community. This year we plan to build on our strong community connections to provide purpose in our school and community projects.
At our school, leadership is not a rank or position, it is a choice. The choice to look after the person to the left and the person to the right of us. I know we all love winning and the feeling of accomplishment that comes with it, but sometimes leadership requires us to detach ourselves from our personal feelings about a situation and look at challenges from other people’s perspectives. It is in this moment that we see how little things can make a difference for everyone.

Bray Park State High School What is your vision for your school community in 2021?
It is an incredible honour and privilege being elected as Bray Park State High School’s 2021 school leaders. As the new 2021 student leaders, our priority this year will be to ensure students feel encouraged and supported in their schooling journey to reach their full potential whilst continuing to make Bray Park a safe, respectful, and welcoming learning environment. We desire to keep the Bray Park legacy that continues to develop with every single student who walks through those gates. We want to make sure that every student from Year 7 to 12, can pursue what they want to do in their futures. If we are able to make one person smile, encourage our fellow students to work hard and overall enjoy life, then we will be more than satisfied with the impression we have left on Bray Park. We are extremely thankful for the ongoing effort and support from our teachers and staff as none of this would be possible without them.

Bribie Island State High School What is your vision for your school community in 2021?
Bribie Island State High School is a place where students understand the importance of respect. It is a place where students can show their initiative when undertaking responsibilities. It is a place where students can discover new knowledge in the classroom environment. It is a place where pupils unite as a collective student body. These reasons are why I believe it issuch an honour to be elected as a school captain for 2021. My role centres on encouraging students to reach their full potential, to not settle for anything less than their best and to become part of a high school community that provides a strong senseof belonging and connectedness.
- Jeremy Jenkins
I am honoured to be one of the school captains for 2021. This is an exciting opportunity to challenge myself as a leader, develop crucial communication skills and positively impact the school community. My educational journey at Bribie Island State High School has been very rewarding. Moving into my last year, I hope to embody the student voice and contribute to our dynamic school culture. From my perspective, the most positive aspect of being a student leader is collaborating with others, to fostera welcoming learning environment for all.
- Olivia D’Rozario

Brisbane Bayside State College, Wynnum West What is your vision for your school community in 2021?
In our final year at Brisbane Bayside State College, we as students who have been recognised as leaders, want to uplift the community after the events of 2020. We acknowledge our time to make an impact is finite, so we would like to use every day to ensure we are supporting and connecting with our peers and community after a disconnected year.
We know a few words of inspiration won’t drastically change things for the better, so we are making a commitment to take action each day to support and inspire.
Our vision is to give everyone an opportunity to prosper and to allow our Bayside community to unite through social clubs, extracurricular events, sport, academia and day to day routines.
We endeavor to facilitate opportunities for success, understanding that success looks different for everyone, we will aspire together.
We know that all members of our school are different and it matters deeply to us that Baysiders feel welcomed, safe and wanted in their community. As the 2021 leaders of Brisbane Bayside State College, we pledge to make our goals and vision come to life. Dare to be Wise.

Brisbane Boys’ College, Toowong What is your vision for your school community in 2021?
The Brisbane Boys’ College student theme for 2021 is ‘Belong’, which we believe encapsulates a key element of our BBC spirit.
To belong is to feel more than just accepted, it’s a feeling of attachment, support, pride and love. We want every boy to wake up and want to come to BBC, to feel a part of our community each and every time he puts on his uniform, raises his boater and sees his mates.
BBC is a community that celebrates achievements, restores confidence, supports through challenges and embraces a spirit that sets us apart from all other schools.
In support of our 2021 theme, all students in the Junior, Middle and Senior School wear lapel badges as a visual reminder that they have a special place in our College community, and all have a role to play in ensuring that our culture and spirit provides a place of belonging for all boys.
We want our College to be defined by a brotherhood that is so unified, that the silent character of our boys is deafening.
- Mason Black (College Captain), Matthew Bennett (College Vice Captain) and Nicholas Munro (College Vice Captain)

Brisbane Girls Grammar School, Spring Hill What is your vision for your school community in 2021?
Sisterhood. Love. Gratitude. They are words that are so frequently used in today’s society, but what do they truly represent? To us, these three words have come to epitomise the spirit and culture that we nurture at Brisbane Girls Grammar School.
The Grammar sisterhood is already well-established, but this year, we hope to explore how this driving force makes our school culture so special. We proudly recognise Brisbane Girls Grammar School as a sub-section of young individuals in modern society. And in doing so, we steered beyond gendered connotations and instead chose to redefine ‘sisterhood’ as the solidarity of people based on shared conditions, experiences, and a sense of belonging. This idea guided our 2021 vision and eventually formed the basis our school motto: “When the sisterhood unites, the royal blue shines bright”.
We envision the sisterhood to take shape in a community where every student feels genuinely supported, appreciated, and at ease in their own skin, allowing each of us to contribute uniquely to the royal blue of our school. The phrase ‘royal blue’ has developed to represent this unity and symbolises the identity we share in our love for this School and our community.
Making an analogical leap, we are reminded of the term ‘phosphorescence’— a sustained emittance of light after the absorption of energy, or ‘the light within’ according to Australian author, Dr Julia Baird. We aspire to inspire our ‘sisters’ to bephosphorescent and shine with a radiant quality, achieving their full potential, brilliantly and uniquely.
- Sophie McLeod and Victoria Chen

Brisbane Grammar School, Spring Hill What is your vision for your school community in 2021?
The Class of 2021’s vision, “Belong to the Blue”, stems from our strong sense of community at Brisbane Grammar School. We aim to redefine how we perceive our collective identity by fostering inclusive and respectful relationships. Our differences are celebrated and protected, with the recognition that we do not have to be the same for all of us to belong.
We may live in divisive times, but we are united in the light dark blue.
Belong to the Blue is a means for each boy to find purpose through engagement and pride, and in doing so, unites us all.

I look forward to promoting Innovation, Inspiration, and Inclusion among the student body.

As someone who is passionate about learning and believes that STEM education is the key to our future, I want to encourage all students to believe in their capability this year.
- Jazmin
I have always been very passionate about inclusivity and supporting the LGBTIQ+ community. In 2021, I would like to strengthen Brisbane SDE’s inclusivity, with a focus on the Inclusion and Student Support (ISS) program and connecting students who are on a Variable Progression Rate (VPR) program. I hope through sharing my experiences I can empower others to follow their dreams too.
- Madi
As a school captain it is important, for not only me but my fellow student leaders and SRC members, to be representing students’ voices and help get their ideas and aspirations through – making a change to the school and our school community for the better. To do this, communication will be important between staff members and fellow students. Achieving this will help to create an environment where students feel safe, accepted and most importantly, driven to succeed.

We would also like to start a ‘Trash Tidy Tuesday’ where students collect rubbish for rewards. Lucky last, we would also start games at play breaks so kids don’t have to sit down lonely and sad. They can have fun instead.

Canterbury College, Waterford What is your vision for your school community in 2021?
It is with a mindset of community connection and self-reflection that Nick, Maddie and the Year 12 Prefects take into 2021.
“We are part of a community and it is important we remain connected and supportive of all students. We will all have successes and we will all have our downfalls, however we will grow from both of these experiences. We will learn and adapt to what we can do well and what we can improve on,” Maddie said to assembled staff, students and parents in a speech recently.
At the same event, Nick spoke about the student leadership team’s plans to work with both the Junior and Secondary Schools to bring their own ideas to fruition, as well as work on bettering themselves.
“We need to be learning from mistakes, operating outside of comfort zones and trying our best to become a better person, abetter friend, a better carer, or a better leader.”
Head of Secondary School Mrs Rebecca Adamson is full of praise for the captains. “Nick and Maddie have led Canterbury students into 2021 with mission and community a significant component of their interactions with others. Their focus on being inclusive and ensuring students are able to connect and contribute is outstanding. They are passionate about developing Canterbury’s understanding of what pride in your school looks like.”
“We wish Nick, Maddie and the Year 12 cohort every success as they create their legacy as the 2021 seniors of Canterbury College.”
- Nicholas Murphy and Madeleine MacKenzie

Canterbury College, Waterford What is your vision for your school community in 2021?
The Canterbury Junior School Captains have many ideas for making their mark in 2021.
A key aim is to support and encourage their fellow students to pursue some of the varied cocurricular activities available at Canterbury. This could be taking up a sport, or playing an instrument, singing in a choir or joining a robotics club.
Isabella explains, “We will lead from the front by participating in cocurricular activities ourselves, demonstrating the Canterbury Values of Respect, Integrity, Community, Scholarship, Compassion and Social Responsibility both on and off campus. We will have a positive mindset and attitude towards learning and others.”

“We will do our part to ensure all students feel safe, empowered and included.”
Head of Junior School, Mr Bill Garland is looking forward to working with the Junior School leaders, led by the Captains.
“They are terrific group and will do well to inspire their peers and lead by example.”
“We will instill in them the notion of servant leadership and provide them many opportunities to lead, guide and serve all members of our community. I am looking forward to a number of leadership days, where they will work with student leaders from other schools and other year levels. This will be a great opportunity for them to work alongside our Year 9 and Year 12 Captains to drive initiatives across our College.”

You have nothing to lose and everything to gain.
The year 2020 highlighted the importance of maintaining physical and mental health as well as healthy relationships with people we care about. So, in 2021 we would like to place a great importance on ensuring we are taking care of ourselves and our peers.
We are honoured to be leading the charge in our school’s community. We will focus on nurturing the limitless potential of our young minds, readying us for the outside world and also paving the path for “Future You”.

Flagstone State Community College
My name is Ryan Porter and I am one of the 2021 captains for Flagstone State Community College. My motivation for becoming a leader has always been to help students and to be a role model for positive change. Hence a main goal of mine for 2021 is to open a room during lunchbreaks where all students are welcome to come along and participate in games, conversations etc. to make their schooling experience just that little bit better. A main goal for the entire captaincy team for 2021 is that of conveying our new vision; PRIDE where we have chosen key aspects from the previous captaincy team’s vision and aim to convey the aspects of being respectful, inspired, determined and equitable each term. I hope that being a captain during 2021 builds my leadership capabilities which will help me in my future endeavours to become a mechanical engineer in the Australian Defence Force.
- Ryan Porter, Captain
My name is Emily Maltby, and I’m one of Flagstone State Community College’s two captains for 2021. I went for a captaincy position because I wanted to have an active role in the college community that would allow me to leave a lasting effect on the college.
I’m passionate about having an impact and being a captain is a great opportunity to create positive change throughout the college. My main goals as a leader are to increase participation in college events and help others to be more motivated in their studies and goals. As well as this, I hope to help make Flagstone a more accepting and equitable place. In general, my aspirations at the moment involve completing Year 12 and maintaining my current level of academic achievement throughout the next year. After school, I hope to go to university, and I would like to pursue a career in research or mathematics.
- Emily Maltby, Captain
My name is Kheanne Toney and I am the Vice-Captain for Flagstone State Community College 2021.
What motivated me to become a leader was more than having a badge or a fancy title but having the chance to make a positive influence on students. As a leader I wanted to be more involved in organising college activities and events in all categories such as sport and the arts. In addition, I wanted to be a leader as I believe I would be a good fit for the role due to my leadership and teamwork skills. My goals for 2021 as a leader is to be a role model to the lower grades and help spread the new acronym created by myself and the other captains ‘RIDE to PRIDE’. P – Proud. R – Respect. I – Inspired. D – Determined. E – Equitable. The aim of this acronym is to focus on a letter for each term and be “Proud” to be a Flagstone student throughout the entire year. After school, I am wanting to go to university and study education to become a primary school teacher.
- Kheanne Toney, Vice-Captain



My name is Jet-li Iefata, the Vice-Captain for 2021. My motivation to become Vice-Captain came from my parents, and teachers.
I am aiming for something that we can all be proud of and to be a voice and make a change in the college community. My goals for next year are to support and help the other leaders accomplish their goals and to make people feel welcomed and feel like they belong to the college community. This will hopefully be through the special events the college holds, through the creative arts, indigenous and sport areas. I also want to help others find a passion that makes them unique and find who they are. After high school, I don’t plan on university or TAFE. I prefer to continue and grow my love for travelling and music and do what makes me happy, work hard, make money, and use that wisely and eventually invest in my own company.
- Jet-Li Iefata, Vice-Captain

We invite our community to do their best, to be their best and to achieve their potential so that we all benefit as individuals, as a College and as a community.
Thomas Waters, Co-College Captain
For me, the best aspect of being an Ionian is being given the opportunity to make a difference, both within our school and in the wider community. It is through this spirit that the idea of Iona not being the best school in the community, but the best school for the community was born.
Each one of us has unique strengths we should use to commit to serving our community, because when we work together, our light shines brighter.
Hamish Colbert, Co-College Captain
Servant leadership is about random acts of kindness and the gifts you give without expecting anything in return. If we all play our role, go the extra mile and show respect, we will grow as individuals, and we as a collective will prosper.

Kedron State High School What is your vision for your school community in 2021?
As school captains of Kedron State High School, we envision a collective sense of resilience and unity within our school community. 2020 was an unforgettable year. COVID-19 prevented us from working together as a whole school through extra-curricular activities and community events, which have traditionally brought us together. In these times, we can always rely on what we call “The Kedron Way”.
“The Kedron Way” is more than an attitude, or path, but rather a belief that participation - whether that is on the sporting field, in the classroom, or behind a music stand - is essential to building a friendly and welcoming school culture. We do not want 2020 to be remembered as the year of the COVID-19 pandemic, but rather have 2021 be remembered as the year we prospered together.

Marsden State High School I am the third of four children and am working towards going to university in America to pursue my passion for football (soccer) while also receiving an education.
I was shy as a child and a fairly slow learner during my primary years. I had to work hard to understand simple concepts and if it wasn’t for my teachers and my mum’s help and support in making sure I was understanding my schoolwork, I would have never reached my full potential. This has taught me that I have to work hard if I want to succeed and to not just do a task half-heartedly. I now choose to push myself in all aspects of my life and through my passion for sport and the support of my coaches and teachers, my confidence has grown dramatically. This year, I am studying mathematic methods, general English, biology, psychology, physical education and football recreation. I hope to use my love for science and sport to study exercise science or become an Occupational Therapist. I also want to push myself in my football to see how far I can get in my sport. These goals keep me motivated to work hard in my academics, sport and to also pursue leadership positions so I can reach my full potential. I not only want to make myself proud but also show my parents, teachers and coaches who have supported me along the way how thankful I am for what they have done for me. I am extremely excited to be part of the Commonwealth Bank mentoring program throughout 2021.

My name is Elenoa Tuihalangingie. I am of Tongan heritage and am the second youngest of six children. I will be the first to go through to university.
In primary school, I became a part of the school council and was observing from afar. My role as a leader started off slowly with some unwanted distractions that followed me as I entered the gates of Marsden State High School. At that point, I did not really like attending school and it wasn’t my main focus. But I met teachers who listened to me and I moved ahead, making new friends before I started to focus on myself, my wellbeing and my future. This year, I am studying mathematics B, English, business, legal studies, certificate ll in tourism and drama. I am an outgoing person who loves to meet and get to know new people. I am beyond excited to be a part of the Commonwealth Bank mentoring program and can’t wait to see what the future has in store.
- Elenoa Tuihalangingie
I am a 17-year-old who is constantly striving to be the best version of myself. I like getting out of my comfort zone and exploring new things.
I am a people person; I really enjoy the company of others. I am a very outgoing and friendly person, who loves to meet new people. Leadership has always been a big part of my life, whether that’s at home, in my friends’ group or when I had my first official title as class captain in grade 5. I was a year 10 and year 11 advocate and was part of the Make a Difference program at Marsden High which really pushed my boundaries and extended my leadership skills. Teaching has always been a vision that I have looked towards and after doing work experience at the primary school and an M-line, which placed me in a year 7 class, my passion for teaching grew and was further nurtured by my teachers who always make me feel supported at school. I want to be that teacher that I always looked up to, to kids in the future, which is pushing me to want to lead a path of secondary education in university. Throughout year 11, I have shifted a few subjects until I found what was right for me and am now continuing an upward climb to achieve my goals, studying the subjects, chemistry, biology, business, general mathematics and English. I am looking forward and really appreciate being given the opportunity to be a part of the Commonwealth Bank mentoring program in 2021.

Kason is the eldest of two children and will be the first in his family to graduate from high school.
His leadership journey first began in year 6 where he found his passion and skill in leading a large group of people, becoming school captain at Burrowes State School. Kason continues to improve his leadership skills and activities such as participating in team sports and casual work, throughout his journey at school, through primary and secondary. Kason always loved the environment of school, learning new things and aspects of life on a daily basis, even when many students around him did not feel the same way about school. He was inspired to become school captain at Marsden by his experience at primary school, then through seeing the school captains at Marsden doing their duties and inspiring other students, which motivated him to do the same.

Milton State School What is your vision for your school community in 2021?
Our Vision for the school year of 2021 is a sustainable, smart, inclusive, creative, and happy school environment. We love having a fun and inclusive learning system especially when learning gets tough for students.
At Milton State School, we believe student opinion is crucial for successful learning. Students learn better when they are engaged and interested. We would love to see student opinions being included in indoor and outdoor learning.
We believe that outdoor learning is greatly beneficial for those who are not great learners. Fresh Air, space and a change of environment are good for the body and mind and will help the brain focus on learning activities. We would love to see classes learning outside more often and getting the fresh air and space that they need.
Finally, we’d love to see Milton come together to recover from the Covid pandemic. Recovery would include organising more clubs, and social and sporting events.

As leaders of the Moreton Bay College community, we strive to generate a vision for both our school and wider community that exists not only within our time as leaders but sustains in word and deed for years to come.
Indeed, at its heart, our ambitions for 2021 are to foster a sense of belonging, culture and inclusivity at the Bay, ensuring MBC is a place where individuals feel seen, heard and valued.
Furthermore, not only do we hope to create an environment that encourages our students to be the best versions of themselves, but we wish to enrich our community through emboldening students to act authentically; to own their individuality.
This vision, reflective of the central beliefs and values that underpin the Moreton Bay College spirit, is embodied pertinently in our 2021 Senior Legacy, ‘Together we Stride; Power of the Pride’.
However, we feel it is imperative that whilst we look towards our future, we acknowledge and take notice of the struggles and hurdles we as a community have overcome in the past year. In doing so, our vision, at its core, remains fundamentally linked to enhancing the spirit in our community.”

Northside Christian College, Everton Park What is your vision for your school community in 2021?
The vision for the Senior School leadership team at Northside Christian College is, “No matter what, people matter!”
“When people see that they matter to us, they begin to realise they matter to Jesus, and when they realise that they matterto Jesus, Jesus begins to matter to them. Every day, we each have an opportunity to make a difference in someone’s life. We may never realise the impact our words and actions have on others.
The challenge from Luke 2:32 is that it’s easy to love our friends, but it is much harder to love those who aren’t. The typeof love that Jesus exemplifies is unconditional and freely given. Our desire is that during this year we would look at removingsome of the conditions that stop us from loving others, as “No matter what, people matter!”
We run events because people matter. We can have a positive impact in our community so that every single person can feel valued.We don’t want to focus on the what, but the why: people. We want to make the most of the opportunities around us, and as wework together, we can show people that they matter to God, because in the end that is all that matters.

Parklands Christian College, Park Ridge What is your vision for your school community in 2021?
This year, our leadership team came up with a word for our school to focus on for 2021 - ‘bridge’. Last year was a difficult year for many within our community. Due to the pandemic, we became a divided nation and school; effecting the connection and sense of school community. We want to bridge the gaps within our community - to reconnect and unite together in a new fashion that will make 2021 a unique and memorable year. Though COVID-19 still effects us, our dedication to serving the community will persist. We want to leave a legacy of connection that continues from generation to generation. We want to be known as Christ centred leaders that put the students at Parklands first.
Recently, our team had the opportunity to develop our vision and skills for the year at the Compass Conference for student leaders. During those few days we met many other leaders around the state that shared our vision for the new year. We learnt valuable lessons and skills that helped us expand our perspective and develop our yearning for connection. The conference encompassed the importance of telling our stories to influence our peers. We recognise that everyone has their own story, and it is important to make school a place of story telling. It is our hope and prayer as College Captains that our community hear our story and work towards our vision of bridging the gaps in society.

Our school is a learning environment that allows all students who come here to thrive and be their authentic self. This positive and open-minded ideology is something I would like to perpetuate this year at QACI through engaging with many opportunities in local community groups and within our school. This year for QACI is a year of perseverance and excitement as we bounce back from 2020.
- Aarya Dath, Student Director for Positivity
As the director for Creativity, Activity and Service (CAS), I envision a school community where all students work together to improve both our own lifestyles and our broader community. CAS is based around the idea that when we are all creative, active and help others, we can all grow as learners. I am a firm believer in this philosophy, and I hope to share this value with the school community by running community outreach events and encouraging students to reach their full potential as community members.
- Adam Charters, Student Director for CAS (Creativity, Activity & Service)
As Persistence Director at QACI in 2021, my vision for the school community this year is to continue demonstrating the importance of persistence through my actions. Persistence is the ability to follow through on a goal even when faced with adversity. The value of this was demonstrated both last year during lockdown and currently as we still face many challenges from Covid-19. In my role as student director my goal is to encourage the QACI community to persist and stay strong throughout the year as we face current and future obstacles. My vision is to see the community continuously persist and understand the importance of this QACI pillar in achieving their goals while also maintaining a positive outlook on life.
- Chiara Du Plessis, Student Director for Persistence
What makes QACI so special to us all is our tight-knit community and nurturing culture. As one of the 2021 Student Directors, my vision is to ensure that these values live on and that we continue to foster a welcoming and motivating environment for everyone. At QACI, whenever I’ve undertaken challenges or left my comfort zone, I’ve never felt I was on my own. This year, I hope to bring that same support and encouragement to others in my community as they progress through their QACI journey.
- Elizabeth Pico Gonzalez, Student Director for Passion
As a part of the Student Director team, we will be organising many fundraising events to advocate for social justice issues whilst simultaneously preserving the supportive school culture of QACI that we hold dear to our hearts. I hope to improve the lives of others on a local and global scale, any little way we can. My personal goals as a Student Director are to be a supportive friend to my peers, help them achieve their personal best by informing them of school policies, and in a friendly manner, remind them to remain mentally flexible as we head into the final years of our schooling in a wonderfully complex and forever evolving world!
- Morgan Lee, Student Director for Preparedness
It can be deduced that not only was the year of 2020 a crazy year in terms of worldly events, but additionally a stressful and difficult time for students across the globe. Nonetheless, I know that although it was tough, students found what they hold most important in life whether it be personal, work or life related goals. Taking what we’ve learnt from 2020, I believe that Queensland’s 2021 school community is stronger than ever. My vision for this year seeks to take on all the challenges and opportunities presented to students with an attitude that strives to achieve our highest goals.
- Riley Brooker, Student Director for Pride
I want school to be a place where students feel emotionally comfortable and confident; a place where they find openness to be who they are as young people. Schools should focus on embedding a nourishing environment where students are able to express their thoughts, ideas and capabilities. I think school should focus strongly on facilitating and supporting the student’s strengths to be a kind and nurturing human being. So, my vision for this year is to help make school a place that young people want to attend every day, where they are constantly engaged, excited, challenged, and guided.
- Surya Sharma-Brymer, Student Director for Principled
Queensland Academy for Science, Mathematics & Technology
What is your vision for your school community in 2021?
This year is a momentous one for our Academy, as it is the first time we are hosting a full Year 7-12 cohort. I am very excited to work alongside my fellow leaders in serving our school community and uniting the Academy, whilst pushing towards our own goals. It is an honour to represent our student body, promote agency, and build upon QASMT’s high performing legacy.
- Grace Terec, Year 12

It is my hope that as student leaders we can create transparency between the students and community, and encourage every individual to become a leader in their own right. I hope that as leaders we not only represent the ideals of the Academy, but use our shared experiences to foster a community of understanding, empathy and diversity. As a school leader, I believe we should broaden our horizons and recognise each and every student’s achievements - no matter how big or small.
- Annabelle Green, Year 12

Change is a part of everybody’s lives, but it has especially been part of ours in the last few years. Putting aside the pandemic, QASMT has experienced massive changes, including adding three new year levels, and two new buildings. Because of this, we need leadership and student agency, so that we can provide stability to students and allow their voices to be heard. We are looking forward to promoting these core values in the year ahead.
- Josh Waghorn, Year 9
This year, I strive to learn how the Academy community can become more united and when we do make mistakes, that we learn and grow in a positive way. I want there to be a strong sense of community in our Academy and for everyone to feel comfortable in sharing their opinions, thoughts and ideas to student leaders. I also want the student leaders to reflect on previously held, leadership-led events and activities, and identify the aspects that could have gone better. Reflecting on the event, taking responsibility and developing new strategies for how we run future events, are all part of my vision for 2021.
- Georgia Tan, Year 9

Our vision for our school in 2021 is to become more inclusive. Our major goals include increasing participation in school-based clubs and increasing the inclusivity between all grades and genders. This could be incorporated into both the rugby league and girls sport and fitness excellence programs, as our school prides itself in achieving exceptional sporting performances.
The Interact Club and Student Council are two of our clubs that will be joining together this year in the hopes to have more students helping with the volunteer work and fundraising activities that our students strive to complete. This year we will have the Senior Executive and Junior Leaders work more closely with these clubs to create bigger fundraisers and raise more money for the charities we volunteer our time for. These clubs promote good relationships between students from all grades, also improving the communication between year levels within the school.
We would like to make this year the year to introduce an Inclusivity Week where we have a new activity each day that students from all grades can interact with. For example, one day of the week we could have a stand where students write ideas on how to be more inclusive on pieces of paper. Some of these responses can be shared amongst each grade on the year-level assemblies to promote inclusivity within the school.
This is only the start to a long list of ideas we have for 2021.

We aim to lead Redeemer as a whole, creating connections between the Junior and Senior Schools, and between all year levels. By establishing personal relationships, we wish to foster a safe and welcoming environment and to form genuine, caring friendships.

We strive to place quality over quantity, by shaping lasting relationships and supporting others to do the same. By encouraging our College’s core values of being curious, courageous, and Christ-led, we want our actions to speak louder than our words, as we strive to achieve these goals.

As Captains and Vice Captains of Sheldon College, we know that we must make every moment this year count following the previously unprecedented year. We are striving to bring back the things that make our community who we are, along with new initiatives. In 2021 we endeavour to increase school spirit through involvement in the areas of sport, the Arts, academia, along with community engagement, thereby creating a lasting impact on the College.
The House Cup Initiative is a way of unifying the entire College Community, by involving competitions between spirit houses in sporting, academic and cultural senses. Our sports carnivals, Maths and Dance competitions are among many events which contribute to the Cup. Smaller events, such as 3v3 basketball or paper plane competitions at lunch will also contribute, whilst also giving our prefects an opportunity to lead within their own faculties.
Charity initiatives are a valuable opportunity for us as a College to get involved with the broader community, whilst also cultivating relationships both within the College and outside. The Buddy Reading Program, Rosie’s, Clean Up Australia Day, and each individual charity event from each year level of our College, are all initiatives we wish to develop to create a lasting impact on not only our College, but on the wider community as well.

Sherwood State School What is your vision for your school community in 2021?
Our vision for 2021 is having more community events, moreinteraction between the year six students and our younger grades and making our school more environmentally friendly. A way we would demonstrate some of the community events is school discos where we can all have a fun time and come together as a school community. We could also have fetes and other fundraising events to support our school and raise money for some of the items that the
school has been needing. This year we were hoping to have more interaction between the year
sixes and our younger grades. Whether that be implementing a prep buddy system or having sports captains do some activities down on the oval with the preps and younger grades. By doing this we hope demonstrate the school expectations we have here at Sherwood to teach the little kids how to be great leader for the future so Sherwood can keep evolving and become a better learning space. To make Sherwood a cleaner, greener place to be. We will
implement this by putting more recycling and general waste bins around the school to stop kids from littering. We also aspire to introduce compost bins to Sherwood as well as the containers for change programme. This is our vision for 2021 and we hope that it will make Sherwood a better place to be.

St Benedict’s College, Mango Hill What is your vision for your school community in 2021?
This week the College celebrated their 2021 College Opening Mass. They commissioned their Year 12 College Leaders, inducted Year 12 Leaders to their final Senior Year, and inducted all Year 11 students into their Senior Years by presenting them their Senior Ties. They also took the opportunity to commission the College Leadership Team and Staff to their educational vocation for 2021. All students pledged their commitment to serve the College and to strive to reach their fullest potential.
This year the College theme is “Presence and Possibilities”. Their Benedictine spirituality reminds them to look for Godin all things – when they find the Presence of God, they can sit in God’s presence and listen for where they are called – being open to the possibilities that are placed before them. They have chosen as their image – the “Compass” because it symbolises the many paths or direction that they may take. A Compass can help the Community find our way and it ensures we don’t gooff track.
In 2021 they stand together as a Community imbued with our values and priorities, ensuring that the year results in all that is good and successful and continues to be a true reflection of their College Mission.
There is no doubt this will be a year filled with exciting learning opportunities and engaging activities for students whoare being encouraged to be present and enhance strong connections with each other and within the community as they navigate the many possibilities ahead.

Martin Luther King once said that a leader is ‘moulder’: a person that has the ability to make change in any form. We, asleaders, have the tools to enact such change and will work hard in 2021 to demonstrate, promote, encourage and create a positive College community that will leave a lasting impression for all.
We cannot wait to all work together to achieve this.

St Joseph’s Nudgee College, Boondall What is your vision for your school community in 2021?
“Even though last year held many challenges for Nudgee College, it’s inspiring to see how eager we are to get back to normal. Our vision for 2021 is very much the same as Br Ambrose Treacy’s when he established the College - to foster an educational institution founded on faith, formation and opportunity for young men. Throughout our time as Nudgee Men, we have been blessed to be a part of the boys in blue-and-white. As leaders of this great College community, we are striving to carry on the traditions and culture that has made Nudgee College.

One small act alone cannot change the world, however, many small actions together, canmake dreams a reality.

St Patrick’s College, Shornliffe What is your vision for your school community in 2021?
Leadership at St Patrick’s College comes with great responsibility and learning. Our leadership journey started at our Senior Student Induction liturgy on the last day of Term 3 last year. Our senior cohort has chosen 5 powerful words as our motto throughout our time as leaders at St Patrick’s. These words are … Commit, Serve, Inspire, Together … Brothers!
Student leadership at our College is considered the responsibility of all, not just those elected to College Leadership positions. Therefore, every one of our peers is committed to be a servant leader, one who will serve our community and inspire the wholestudent body to follow our example. We believe that our strength lies within our diversity and inclusion of all. We are committed to working together as a Band of Brothers to build the capacity of each other and all members of the St Patrick’s community. It is our genuine hope that by the end of 2020, each of us have learned more about ourselves through the leadership opportunities that are given to us throughout the year.
We would also like to wish the very best to Year 12 students (and leaders) in all schools.
Let us all hope that it is a year that we can all remember fondly.

St Paul’s School, Bald Hills What is your vision for your school community in 2021?
Don’t Hold Back! For some, this may remind you of a Jeep advertising campaign, but at St Paul’s, the student leadership teamhave embraced this as our School theme and vision for 2021.
Every year at St. Paul’s, the leadership team create a school theme to represent our legacy for the ongoing year. After COVID-19,we decided to use our theme as an empowering motto to get everyone back into the school routine in a unified and enthusiastic manner. Every student, right from Pre-Prep to Year 12 is encouraged to put themselves out there and get involved.
For example, this was perfectly seen during our Valentine’s Day event. A small idea to sell personalised roses was amplified,with all school leadership portfolios working together as one, with profits going towards our School Production. The theme nicely tied into some of our School’s realms of thinking, such as ‘Openness to Experience’ and ‘Tolerance for Ambiguity’.
Our goal is to continue to build a strong sense of community throughout the entire school using our theme. We want every student to reach their full potential and we will be doing all we can to get alongside one another and demonstrate a heartfor servant leadership.
As a school we want 2021 to be an opportunity to establish a new ongoing culture of resilience and teamwork with everyoneprepared to not hold back.

St Peters Lutheran College, Indooroopilly What is your vision for your school community in 2021?
Unity after hardship — it’s a vision so fitting for leaders on the recovering side of a global pandemic. The 2021 Captains at St Peters Indooroopilly plan to move into a phase of leadership characterised by oneness; one College body, working together to serve the wider community.
“Through COVID we didn’t have much interaction with the community outside St Peters,” Vice Captain, Jake Harford, shared. “It meant that we weren’t able to help out when it was most needed. This year, we want to change that. We want to help the community around us bounce back, and we want the whole College to get involved.”
More to that, the Captains want to unite the Year Levels.
“Our vision is to have everyone excited to come to school every day,” College Captain, Maddie Rushmore said. “We’re so lucky to go to such an amazing school and we have so many opportunities available to us. We just really want to encourage people to make the most of them and give things a go — get involved and develop inter-Year Level relationships.”
Plans for that are well underway, and the Captains have gone above and beyond in their first efforts. From sacrificing holiday time to welcome new students on their Orientation Day; to travelling to the Sunshine Coast to help out on Year 7 Camp, there’s not much these Captains won’t do to achieve their vision.
Best of luck 2021 Captains. You are going to achieve great things!

St Rita’s College Clayfield What is your vision for your school community in 2021?
This year, St Rita’s College’s pillar is Hospitality and we aim to embrace every student at St Rita’s like family at our ‘heaven on a hill’. Our theme for 2021 is “hands of hospitality”, encouraging students to recognise their power to positively impact our community. Each Term will target a specific aspect of hospitality, promotedby an accompanying hand symbol.
Term 1 is Welcoming Spirit, represented by a waving hand. By bringing together the College as a community and promoting spirit, a welcoming and hospitable environment will be created by and for everyone.
The focus for Term 2 is on Welcoming Self, represented by love heart hands to emphasise the mental health of students. This is all about self-compassion, self-love and being hospitable to ourselves.
And finally, we will Welcome Others in Term 3, represented by the peace sign. To spread hospitality outside of the College, members of the wider community will be welcomed and treated with hospitality.
Community spirit and passion is so important in order for students to respect and support one another. We want to ensure that everyone feels included and encouraged to try their best at all they can. One way we will acknowledge this is through ourpeer-nominated “hospi-pal” awards, to acknowledge superstars who make our school a better place, regardless of how big or small their acts are. Hospitality is about reaching out a hand for those in need. We want this idea to flourish in 2021 by encouraging and recognising these acts.

Stretton State College What is your vision for your school community in 2021?
A leader is someone who listens and understands the needs of the people, giving them a voice to be heard. As a College Captain of 2021, it is my duty to communicate with students and teachers in order to bring everyone closer together as a community. I look forward to collaborating with my fellow Captains and School Leaders in making Stretton State College the best school it’s ever been.
- Jerry Li
Captaincy is not defined by the figure speaking on assembly; it is not defined by a badge. A true leader is characterised by their SPIRIT, purpose, and teamwork.
- Serena Huang
Being a leader, is more than being the person with the badge. It is about making connections, helping others, and being the voice for people. While having the badge does make it easier to create change, leadership is not defined by this, everyone has the opportunity to lead in their own way.
- Isaac Miles
Our vision for this year is to be approachable and include everyone’s ideas and thoughts. I see leadership like a race not finishing first but staying behind and helping everyone cross the line. We want everyone to feel like they belong at our school and see the senses of community that our school lives up to. Our goal for this year leave behind a legacy of mate ship, inclusivity, and kindness.
- Eloise Butler

Sunnybank State High School What is your vision for your school community in 2021?
Our primary goal for the Sunnybank SHS School community in 2021 is to continue to facilitate an environment that is inclusive of everyone. For us to achieve this, our leadership team will strive to organise more events that are inclusive of all year levels. We will maintain a close relationship with the junior students; even after the Orientation Buddy program has occurred, our senior leaders will continue to value and build on inter year level friendships. We hope to grow this by encouraging students to get involved in year level events, maintain a close partnership with their Year Level Coordinator, and encourage participation in whole school activities such as sporting carnivals. We will also value our community engagement and are committed to continuing our connections with community which includes our Wednesday activities down at the Sunnybank Special School and our annual STEM challenge with local primary schools. Several members of our leadership team are also applying for Youth Parliament as they wish to be involved and make real changes to the community around us. However, most of all our vision for this year is one of all-inclusive fun and long lasting memories.

As a leader of Trinity College, we strive to increase participation across the whole of the school community to embrace our family spirit.
- Ben Southam, Captain
As Vice-Captain at Trinity College, it’s truly been one of the best learning experiences thus far. I’ve done nothing like this before, and I can say that I’ve become less anxious than I was at the very beginning from when we started at the start of term 4. I feel like it’s because the trinity family allows me to feel accepted and unafraid to voice my opinion, especially the staff. The role Maiella and I have been given pushes us to work even harder than ever before, and with the Trinity Leadership team by our sides, it feels like anything is possible. At events like the school barbecues,and swimming carnival - our leadership skills are shown to develop and allows us to recognise we are all in this together.”
- Junior Sakoonchai, Vice-Captain.

Windaroo Valley State High School
What is your vision for your school community in 2021?
The Leadership Vision created by our 2021 student leadership focusses on two key aspects this year:
- Visual presence throughout the school
- Community/school involvement
The student leaders will endeavour to be visually present throughout the school community. The aim is for all students in the school to easily recognise the student leaders. The team has identified that being approachable and supportive are critical components to ensure the school culture is inclusive.
The second part is student involvement across the school. The 2021 student leaders believe they can have a significant impact both in school and community through their involvement in events that promote connectedness. Our leaders will seek feedback from students in all year levels on ways to embed activities within the House Cup framework. The objective will be to identify activities that encourage participation by all students.

Woodridge State High School What is your vision for your school community in 2021?
Our vision for 2021 is demonstrate, promote and encourage participation in a positive school environment. We intend to be powerful role models for our peers each and every day while maintaining an inclusive community. We are empowered, resilient and world changing!

Wynnum State High School What is your vision for your school community in 2021?

Always remember, We’re Wynnum and We’re PROUD.

Full text: His debut season for Souths was ruined by a hamstring injury last August, but Mitchell has made a full recovery and returns to non-restricted training next week.
He will continue his quest to be a fullback, with the ex-Test centre still intent on making the No.1 jersey his own.
Coach Wayne Bennett resisted calls to move the powerhouse back to the centres last year in a show of faith rewarded by a string of top-shelf performances prior to his season-ending injury.

WIGHTON’S LINK TO SUPERCARS STAR Supercars star Dave Reynolds has ruled out taking up a job swap offer made by his future brother in-law Jack Wighton.
“I think he is pretty keen to get in a race car,” the Bathurst-winning Supercars driver said of the Dally M-winning NRL star.
“But I have no ambition whatsoever to run on to a rugby league field. I reckon Jack has at least 30kg on me and, apparently, he is one of the smaller guys.
“He kindly offered to invite Josh Papalii round and get him to run at me but I politely declined.”
Reynolds and Wighton have become a cross-code odd couple with the high-profile pair brought together by their partners, sisters Tahan and Monisha Lew Fatt. Reynolds met Wighton in 2017 when the Raiders star began dating his partner and Tahan’s sister.
“I had no idea at all who he was at first,” Reynolds said.
“They told me he was a Raiders player but that didn’t mean a lot to me given I wasn’t much of an NRL fan. I started watching him and turns out he was a pretty big deal.”
Reynolds made the trip from Melbourne to Canberra to spend Christmas with Wighton and his young family.
“It is the first time we have gotten to spend some real time together,” Reynolds said.
“Our schedules mean we don’t get a lot of time to hang out so it was great. I didn’t really like going to the pub with him though because I was turned into a phone holder.
“All I did was take pictures for all his fans. No one had a clue who I was. I was turned into a photo bitch while he got the red carpet.”
Wighton has no qualms about admitting he is a Dave Reynolds fan.
“He is an awesome guy,” Wighton said. “And a freak at what he does, too. I don’t know how he would go running into Josh Papalii — probably about as good as I would go in a race car.”
Wighton and Reynolds spent New Year’s Eve comparing notes about their respective sports.
“It is really interesting to hear what he does and how he prepares,” Wighton said.
“He is a very laid-back guy but is certainly very serious about what he does.”
Reynolds said his sport could learn from the NRL.
“I have actually become a big rugby league fan and it is the only non-motorsport sport I watch,” Reynolds said.
“And I think we could really take some things from rugby league. We compared notes and we are a bit backwards in our sport in terms of how the drivers get treated.
“Finding out about their union and pay modelling was a real eye-opener. It is completely different to how we operate and far more professional. I think my sport would 100 per cent learn from the NRL.”
Reynolds is adamant he will be on the grid for the Supercars opener in Bathurst on February 26, despite not having a deal to drive after quitting Erebus Motorsport.
“I am effectively unemployed,” Reynolds said. “But it won’t be for long.”
Reynolds also expects to be a father before the season opener, with his partner due in early February.
Check out all the latest NRL chatter and more in Australia’s hottest sport gossip column.
SAINT Ajinkya Rahane for restoring a nation’s pride. Thrown into the fire when he was appointed to replace dad-to-be Virat Kohli as India captain in the wake of the nation’s worst defeat, Rahane redeemed his country with a stunning eight-wicket win over Australia. Piling on the runs with the bat, Rahane was also impeccable with his field placements and decision-making.

SINNER The NRL for giving Brent Naden a one-month backdated ban for testing positive to an illicit drug. Found guilty of using cocaine in the aftermath of the Panthers’ grand final loss to Melbourne, the backdated ban means Naden will not miss a day of pre-season training. He has effectively escaped punishment in a move that sends a poor message to generation next.
SHOOSH Which high-profile NRL back is rated as a 50/50 chance to rejoin his club for the remainder of the pre-season? The former Origin player has been struggling to deal with a number of personal matters.
SPOTTED Beau Ryan enjoying five-star digs at Gerringong in a cliffside mansion known as the “Bunker House”. Built by his mate Neil Hipwell of Instagram-famous building company Future Flip, Ryan was one of several Range Rover-driving guests to visit the fast-becoming-famous south coast house over the festive break. Wallabies legend John Eales was spotted a stone’s throw away in Gerroa playing tennis with Aussie popstar Guy Sebastian.

SPOTTED Bulldogs recruit Luke Thompson getting his first real taste of the Aussie summer on a beach break in Port Stephens. We are hoping some of his Dogs teammates tipped the English enforcer up about wearing sunscreen. Thompson has shrugged off the homesickness of late last year after being reunited with his long-term partner. We are hearing he is in a good place and ready to deliver on his much-hyped potential.
SPOTTED Ryan Walkinshaw was also getting his first Oz tan, with the English owner of Walkinshaw Andretti United unable to spend the festive season with his UK-based family because of COVID-19. He’s been stuck in Australia since February and is fast losing his English accent. Aside from running one of Supercars’ best teams, Walkinshaw has also added caravan company New Age Caravans to a business stable that also includes the iconic HSV.

SPOTTED Keeping the English theme going, a bevy of Pommies were spotted at Ricky Stuart’s Canberra home on Christmas Day. Known to be a father-like figure as well as a coach, Stuart invited all the English Canberra players to his home for a Christmas Day feast. We would hate to be paying the food bill given the size of the guests, which included giant backrower Elliott Whitehead.

U-TURN FOR SUPERCARS COVERAGE V8 Supercars look set to make a stunning U-turn by reinstating Mark Larkham to its commentary team.
Axed in a mind-boggling decision in December as part of a commentary team shake-up, Larkham is almost certain to be offered a new deal after a backlash — that included a petition to have him reinstated. The Sunday Telegraph can reveal the sport is set to approach Larkham with a new contract after being presented with a petition that contained more than 20,000 signatures demanding his return to trackside reporting.
Admitting he was “gobsmacked” after Supercars Media told him he had lost his job as part of a shake-up that also claimed Greg Murphy, the pit lane reporter was set to be replaced by former children’s entertainer Charli Robinson.
The proposed move caused an unprecedented uproar that is almost certain to save Larkham’s career.
It is understood Supercars chief executive officer Sean Seamer will have the final say on the commentary team, with the line-up to be decided by the end of this month.
Next season’s Supercar coverage will be split between Fox Sports and Channel 7.

RACY GRACIE ... YOU BETCHA Former Supercars racer turned porn star Renee Gracie has now become a professional punter, the busty bombshell linking with a global gambling website.
Having made the bold and super controversial switch from the rumble of a V8 to the adult entertainment industry last year, Gracie recently started working for betting website brazino777.com.
More than 100,000 punters viewed the first video she recorded for the online casino platform, in which Gracie wore a sparkling bikini in the post that — unsurprisingly — went viral.
PRAYERS Our thoughts go out to our former marathon swim champion Susie Maroney following the passing of her mother, Pauline. Maroney is doing it tough after losing her biggest supporter and best friend.

Full text: His debut season for Souths was ruined by a hamstring injury last August, but Mitchell has made a full recovery and returns to non-restricted training next week.
He will continue his quest to be a fullback, with the ex-Test centre still intent on making the No.1 jersey his own.
Coach Wayne Bennett resisted calls to move the powerhouse back to the centres last year in a show of faith rewarded by a string of top-shelf performances prior to his season-ending injury.
WIGHTON’S LINK TO SUPERCARS STAR
Supercars star Dave Reynolds has ruled out taking up a job swap offer made by his future brother in-law Jack Wighton.
“I think he is pretty keen to get in a race car,” the Bathurst-winning Supercars driver said of the Dally M-winning NRL star.
“But I have no ambition whatsoever to run on to a rugby league field. I reckon Jack has at least 30kg on me and, apparently, he is one of the smaller guys.
“He kindly offered to invite Josh Papalii round and get him to run at me but I politely declined.”
Reynolds and Wighton have become a cross-code odd couple with the high-profile pair brought together by their partners, sisters Tahan and Monisha Lew Fatt. Reynolds met Wighton in 2017 when the Raiders star began dating his partner and Tahan’s sister.
“I had no idea at all who he was at first,” Reynolds said.
“They told me he was a Raiders player but that didn’t mean a lot to me given I wasn’t much of an NRL fan. I started watching him and turns out he was a pretty big deal.”
Reynolds made the trip from Melbourne to Canberra to spend Christmas with Wighton and his young family.
“It is the first time we have gotten to spend some real time together,” Reynolds said.
“Our schedules mean we don’t get a lot of time to hang out so it was great. I didn’t really like going to the pub with him though because I was turned into a phone holder.
“All I did was take pictures for all his fans. No one had a clue who I was. I was turned into a photo bitch while he got the red carpet.”
Wighton has no qualms about admitting he is a Dave Reynolds fan.
“He is an awesome guy,” Wighton said. “And a freak at what he does, too. I don’t know how he would go running into Josh Papalii — probably about as good as I would go in a race car.”
Wighton and Reynolds spent New Year’s Eve comparing notes about their respective sports.
“It is really interesting to hear what he does and how he prepares,” Wighton said.
“He is a very laid-back guy but is certainly very serious about what he does.”
Reynolds said his sport could learn from the NRL.
“I have actually become a big rugby league fan and it is the only non-motorsport sport I watch,” Reynolds said.
“And I think we could really take some things from rugby league. We compared notes and we are a bit backwards in our sport in terms of how the drivers get treated.
“Finding out about their union and pay modelling was a real eye-opener. It is completely different to how we operate and far more professional. I think my sport would 100 per cent learn from the NRL.”
Reynolds is adamant he will be on the grid for the Supercars opener in Bathurst on February 26, despite not having a deal to drive after quitting Erebus Motorsport.
“I am effectively unemployed,” Reynolds said. “But it won’t be for long.”
Reynolds also expects to be a father before the season opener, with his partner due in early February.

SAINT
Ajinkya Rahane for restoring a nation’s pride. Thrown into the fire when he was appointed to replace dad-to-be Virat Kohli as India captain in the wake of the nation’s worst defeat, Rahane redeemed his country with a stunning eight-wicket win over Australia. Piling on the runs with the bat, Rahane was also impeccable with his field placements and decision-making.
SINNER
The NRL for giving Brent Naden a one-month backdated ban for testing positive to an illicit drug. Found guilty of using cocaine in the aftermath of the Panthers’ grand final loss to Melbourne, the backdated ban means Naden will not miss a day of pre-season training. He has effectively escaped punishment in a move that sends a poor message to generation next.
SHOOSH
Which high-profile NRL back is rated as a 50/50 chance to rejoin his club for the remainder of the pre-season? The former Origin player has been struggling to deal with a number of personal matters.
SPOTTED
Beau Ryan enjoying five-star digs at Gerringong in a cliffside mansion known as the “Bunker House”. Built by his mate Neil Hipwell of Instagram-famous building company Future Flip, Ryan was one of several Range Rover-driving guests to visit the fast-becoming-famous south coast house over the festive break. Wallabies legend John Eales was spotted a stone’s throw away in Gerroa playing tennis with Aussie popstar Guy Sebastian.
SPOTTED
Bulldogs recruit Luke Thompson getting his first real taste of the Aussie summer on a beach break in Port Stephens. We are hoping some of his Dogs teammates tipped the English enforcer up about wearing sunscreen. Thompson has shrugged off the homesickness of late last year after being reunited with his long-term partner. We are hearing he is in a good place and ready to deliver on his much-hyped potential.
SPOTTED
Ryan Walkinshaw was also getting his first Oz tan, with the English owner of Walkinshaw Andretti United unable to spend the festive season with his UK-based family because of COVID-19. He’s been stuck in Australia since February and is fast losing his English accent. Aside from running one of Supercars’ best teams, Walkinshaw has also added caravan company New Age Caravans to a business stable that also includes the iconic HSV.
SPOTTED
Keeping the English theme going, a bevy of Pommies were spotted at Ricky Stuart’s Canberra home on Christmas Day. Known to be a father-like figure as well as a coach, Stuart invited all the English Canberra players to his home for a Christmas Day feast. We would hate to be paying the food bill given the size of the guests, which included giant backrower Elliott Whitehead.
U-TURN FOR SUPERCARS COVERAGE
V8 Supercars look set to make a stunning U-turn by reinstating Mark Larkham to its commentary team.
Axed in a mind-boggling decision in December as part of a commentary team shake-up, Larkham is almost certain to be offered a new deal after a backlash — that included a petition to have him reinstated. The Sunday Telegraph can reveal the sport is set to approach Larkham with a new contract after being presented with a petition that contained more than 20,000 signatures demanding his return to trackside reporting.
Admitting he was “gobsmacked” after Supercars Media told him he had lost his job as part of a shake-up that also claimed Greg Murphy, the pit lane reporter was set to be replaced by former children’s entertainer Charli Robinson.
The proposed move caused an unprecedented uproar that is almost certain to save Larkham’s career.
It is understood Supercars chief executive officer Sean Seamer will have the final say on the commentary team, with the line-up to be decided by the end of this month.
Next season’s Supercar coverage will be split between Fox Sports and Channel 7.
RACY GRACIE ... YOU BETCHA
Former Supercars racer turned porn star Renee Gracie has now become a professional punter, the busty bombshell linking with a global gambling website.
Having made the bold and super controversial switch from the rumble of a V8 to the adult entertainment industry last year, Gracie recently started working for betting website brazino777.com.
More than 100,000 punters viewed the first video she recorded for the online casino platform, in which Gracie wore a sparkling bikini in the post that — unsurprisingly — went viral.
PRAYERS
Our thoughts go out to our former marathon swim champion Susie Maroney following the after passing of her mother, Pauline. Maroney is doing it tough after losing her biggest supporter and best friend.

Full text: One of the new cases in today’s figures is a child who tested positive after the 8pm cut-off period but was announced on Friday.
They are linked to Paddington Alimentari deli and cafe. NSW Premier Gladys Berejiklian said nearly 40,000 tests were conducted on Christmas Day.
It came after the state recorded seven new local cases on Christmas Day following a record turnout for testing.
Ms Berejiklian said the ninth case, which has not been directly linked to the Avalon cluster, could be a false positive or an old infection.
Four people from the Christmas Day figures were linked to the northern beaches cluster will three were under investigation.
Six of the seven people were already in isolation.
Almost 70,000 tests were carried out in that 24-hour period. The Avalon cluster now stands at 127 cases.
Speaking at a press conference on Boxing Day, Ms Berejiklian said that restrictions both in the Northern Beaches and Greater Sydney would revert back to what they were before December 23.
She said there was one difference compared to the stay at home rules prior to Christmas.
Those in the northern part of the Northern Beaches – north of the Narrabeen Bridge – are allowed to have five people at an outdoor gathering but not allowed to have anyone at indoor gatherings.
Those in the southern part of the Northern Beaches are allowed to have 10 people at an outdoor gathering.
Those in Greater Sydney also revert back to the rules of December 23, with no more than 10 people allowed in a household.
Ms Berejiklian said people from the northern part of the Northern Beaches should not go to the southern part and vice versa, “unless you absolutely have to”.
“If you’re in Greater Sydney, do not go to the Northern Beaches,” she said.
The restrictions will last until midnight on December 30, leaving the possibility open for restrictions to change for New Year’s Eve.
“In the next few days we’ll let people know what New Year’s Eve looks like,” Ms Berejiklian said.
It came as a leading epidemiologist has rejected calls for the COVID-19 vaccine rollout to be accelerated in Australia, despite the emergence of more contagious mutant virus strains overseas and the latest outbreak in Sydney’s Northern Beaches.
Jodie McVernon, director of epidemiology at Melbourne’s Peter Doherty Institute for Infection and Immunity, said there was no need “to press the red emergency button” and bring forward distribution of the jab from March, The Australian reports.
Her position – as an expert member of the council of chief health officers that delivers high-level scientific advice to Scott Morrison and the premiers – is at odds with Anthony Albanese who urged the Prime Minister to make the vaccine available as soon as January, when some or all of the three overseas formulations ordered by the government are expected to be approved.
Meanwhile, Queensland and South Australia are on alert after new COVID-19 cases linked to Sydney’s northern beaches outbreak were confirmed on Christmas Eve.
In Queensland, a man in his 40s who had travelled to the northern beaches before returning was among two new cases linked to the Sydney outbreak.
NED-1859 State of our borders
The other was a woman in her 20s who arrived in Cairns on a superyacht that sailed from the Maldives. She is in isolation. The six crew members have remained on the yacht and are being tested.
“I am concerned we do have the virus now in Queensland,” Queensland’s chief health officer Dr Jeanette Young said.
“I have seen the positive sewage results and we have seen people return from the Northern Beaches and Sydney.”
Queensland Premier Annastacia Palaszczuk today announced two more cases, albeit in hotel quarantine.
Ms Palaszczuk posted that there were no “locally acquired” COVID-19 cases with both new positive tests from two travellers who returned from overseas and are in mandatory hotel quarantine.
In South Australia, a man in his 20 tested positive after flying from Darwin to Sydney Airport and then catching a regional flight to Wodonga before driving to Maitland on the Yorke Peninsula. He is no longer considered infectious. Another case yesterday was a returned overseas traveller.
It comes as the Northern Territory removed the majority of Greater Sydney as a coronavirus hotspot meaning people won’t have to quarantine when arriving.
NT’s Acting Chief Minister Nicole Manison made the announcement effective Thursday.
“The Greater Sydney area, including the Blue Mountains along with the Central Coast, will be removed effective immediately,” she said.
She added the list of hotspot suburbs in the northern beaches area, which will be defined by suburb and postcode, will be listed on the state’s coronavirus website.

MORE CASES IN NSW Berejiklian announced nine new cases of community transmission in NSW on Thursday, with two still under investigation, bringing the total number of cases to 104. Seven of the nine new cases were linked to the Northern Beaches cluster.
Six cases are still under investigation in NSW, including two people who are employed as patient-transport workers.
Dr Kerry Chant said all people on-board a Qantas flight from Darwin to Sydney on December 17 have been considered close contacts to a passenger with COVID-19 and have been asked to self-isolate.
A Qantas crew member contracted COVID-19 who was on-board the flight subsequently tested positive. She said they are investigating another potential case but the current data is preliminary. Everyone who was on-board will be tested.
She said the passenger on the Darwin-Sydney Qantas flight is a South Australia resident who initially tested negative in NSW.
“We’re just trying to work at the nature of that test result whether it is a false positive or it is an old infection, it is very scant information,” she said.
Victorians have also been advised to not “hug and kiss” anyone from NSW.
Victoria’s COVID testing program commander Jeroen Weimar asked people to show some discretion in their Christmas cuddling.
“If you’ve been to NSW in the last 10 days or you’re spending time with people you know have come back from NSW, I would encourage you – let’s not hug and kiss right this moment in time,” he said.

HOW VACCINE WILL BE DELIVERED IN AUSTRALIA The COVID-19 vaccine will be trucked around Australia in “super eskies with dry ice” but there will be no shortcuts to getting Aussies the jab, Health Minister Greg Hunt warned.
The federal government has signed a distribution deal with DHL and Linfox to assist the rollout of more than 117 million vaccine doses.
Mr Hunt said “super eskies”, purpose-built dry ice containers, would be used to transport the Pfizer vaccine at -70C.
The Therapeutic Goods Association (TGA) is expected to green-light a vaccine in January, with Australians to receive their first jabs in March.
The UK and US have both issued emergency approvals for the Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine as they face spiralling outbreaks. The US recorded 3401 coronavirus deaths on Wednesday, while 744 Britons lost their lives.
But with Australia having the virus under relative control, Mr Hunt insisted there was no need for it to follow suit.
“The public doesn’t want to see corners cut. They want to see that we are thoroughly assessing, but we’re doing it at a record speed in an utterly comprehensive way,” he told 2GB Radio on Thursday.
The two-dose vaccine would be rolled out in monthly rounds, the first focusing on the elderly, health workers and medical workers.
Subsequent rounds would work down the age groups, as young people were less likely to suffer severe impacts from the virus, with the process expected to be completed by October, Mr Hunt said.
“Here we are likely to get a higher take-up of the vaccine than in many other countries because we are a great vaccination nation. But we are because people have complete confidence in the world class leadership and quality of our medical regulator,” he said.

QANTAS PLAN TO SAVE TRAVEL Qantas and Japan Airlines want to form a partnership that will see the two airlines co-ordinate schedules and airfares, and share revenue in a deal that will lock up 70 per cent of the travel market between the two countries.
Qantas CEO Alan Joyce said the joint venture would open up new routes between Australia and Japan and boost travel between the two countries – which was surging in both directions before the pandemic – hit back faster when international borders reopen.
But the deal, which was announced on Wednesday, will come under close scrutiny from the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission, due to the fact that there was only one other airline group flying directly between the two countries.
Qantas and its cheaper arm Jetstar had an almost 60 per cent share of the Australia-Japan market in 2019, while Japan Airlines (JAL) had 10 per cent. All Nippon Airways (ANA) had an 8 per cent share.
But in its application to the ACCC, Qantas argued that Virgin has said it intends to eventually fly to Japan, while ANA was a “particularly aggressive and effective competitor”.
Qantas also argued that Singapore Airlines and Cathay Pacific would also compete in the market.
“The (joint venture) is inherently geared to maximise consumer interest,” the submission says. “It will deliver greater public benefits faster and with more certainty than a future without it, in an intensely competitive market.”
Qantas said the venture would encourage the two airlines to “expand rather than restrict capacity and to invest in an improved product offering which is likely to stimulate innovation and price competition from others”.
Qantas said it expected the ACCC to make a decision within six months and that the joint venture could start around July 2021 when it expects international travel will resume.
Mr Joyce said that if approved, the joint venture would be a “win for our customers, a win for trade and a win for the one million people who work in tourism across Australia”.
“Around half a million people visited Australia from Japan in 2019. We want to see that tourism resume and grow even further by making it easier for Japanese travellers to visit,” Mr Joyce said.
“It also helps us diversify our portfolio of joint businesses among Australia’s key trading partners.”

CHRISTMAS TOURISM BLOW Tourism spending over the holidays will come close to halving due to border restrictions states imposed on NSW after a COVID-19 outbreak on the northern beaches, the tourism and aviation industries have cautioned.
Between Christmas Eve and January 11, Australians are expected to spend $2.98b less than the annual average of about $5.5b, as families put holiday plans on hold and airlines cancel dozens of flights a day in response to travel restrictions.
The modelling was compiled by economic consultants at Stafford Strategy and commissioned by the Tourism and Transport Forum, which represents the country’s major hotel chains, airlines and tourist attractions, reports The Australian.
Margy Osmond, the forum’s chief executive, said border restrictions meant the Morrison government would need to “think very seriously about something that looks and sounds like an extension of JobKeeper” for the industry.
It comes as the worsening stoush between Gladys Berejiklian and Annastacia Palaszczuk went up a notch after the NSW Premier on Tuesday accused other state leaders of causing unnecessary “suffering” by shutting borders despite the low number of new coronavirus cases linked to the northern beaches cluster.
On Wednesday, the Queensland Premier said it was “a bit rich” for Ms Berejiklian to point the finger at Queensland and Victoria for the border closures.
“If there hadn’t been the cluster outbreak in the northern beaches, no one would have had to take these measures and everybody would have been seeing their family and friends,” Ms Palaszczuk said.
She also said that her state didn’t want “lifestyle compromised”.
“If we had community transmission like they’ve got in Sydney, that could have broader implications across our tourism sector,” she said.
“I don’t want to see the Gold Coast, Cairns or the Whitsundays go into lockdowns that we are seeing in other parts of the world.”
There were eight new locally acquired cases recorded in NSW in the 24 hours to 8pm on Tuesday. Health authorities eased restrictions in the southern half of the northern beaches, allowing people to leave home to visit the homes of others who lived in the zone.
Despite the lower infection numbers, Queensland and the ACT have indicated there will be no change to their border restrictions until after New Year’s Eve.

SYDNEY’S COVID CHRISTMAS REVEALED Sydneysiders will be allowed to have Christmas with up to 10 family and friends at home under new coronavirus restrictions announced on Tuesday.
NSW Premier Gladys Berejiklian announced “modest changes” to Sydney’s coronavirus restrictions over the Christmas period.
From Christmas Eve until Boxing Day residents in greater Sydney will be able to have 10 people over to their home plus children aged under 12.
After Boxing Day the restrictions will revert back to 10 people in a home including children under 12.
Residents in the northern region of the northern beaches can have five other people from the same region in their homes.
Residents in the southern region of the northern beaches will be able to have 10 people in their homes. They cannot leave the area but people will be able to visit from greater Sydney.
The restrictions would revert back to the current lockdown provisions on December 27.
Ms Berejiklian said the decision facing her was such a difficult one with Christmas just days away.
“If it wasn’t this time of year, the decision would be much easier,” she said.
“It’s not just to look at the health impacts, but societal impacts, what it means for the greater population.
“You have to assess the medical risk against the risk of other things that will harm the community.”
NED-2961-NSW-Restrictions-Ramp-Up

‘SYDNEY IS RIGHT ON THE EDGE’ The NSW Government may regret not enforcing a short sharp lockdown in response to the latest COVID outbreak and its citizens might end up paying for delayed action with a long lockdown similar to Victoria’s, The Australian Medical Association’s vice president Dr Chris Moy has warned.
“It’s fair to say that the situation in Sydney is right on the edge in Christmas,” Dr Moy told News Corp.
“On the plus side is great contact tracing, that QR codes have helped, and that most cases are linked and localised to Northern Beaches, and no one is turning in hospital up really sick from COVID,” he said.
However he warned “gaping holes in information regarding the initial source of the infection” and the possibility that there are other chains of infection propagating unchecked now was deeply concerning.
The border closures by other states is an indication of their level of worry, and it is likely that states such as SA would have gone for a quick lockdown as they did recently and which proved effective, he said.
“This “hard and fast” or “pay now” approach worked in SA in contrast to the lesson of Victoria which “paid later” in that the failure early decisive action cost them a prolonged lockdown,” he said.
“One remains hopeful that the better systems in NSW will work, but there is some chance that control will be lost across greater Sydney and there will be Christmas regrets about not making a more decisive call,” he said.
It comes as Prime Minister Scott Morrison warned COVID-19 outbreaks will “continue to occur”, as he urged those who had been to Sydney’s northern beaches recently to isolate no matter where they are in Australia.
“The outbreaks are things that are going to continue to occur and while great care is taken all around the country, then we can never fully rule out that an outbreak might occur at some point in time,” Mr Morrison said.
“In this case [the case of the Northern Beaches outbreak], what we are seeing is both great co-operation, as we have seen in other places before, but the geography I have to tell you is helping this as well.
“Those of you who know Sydney well know that the peninsula is a very cohesive community that tends to keep to itself … and that is certainly I think assisting in making sure that the Avalon [in the Northern Beaches] outbreak is staying exactly where it is.”
Mr Morrison said no matter where people were in the country, the “rules about isolation apply equally to you as they do to those of your neighbours who are back in Avalon and the Northern Beaches right now”.
OUTRAGE AT FAKE DETAILS FOR CONTACT TRACING NSW Health Minister Brad Hazzard slammed those recording fake contact details on QR code forms.
“What we are finding is that some of the visitors to various venues still think that it is funny to be caught putting in there that you’re Donald Duck or Mickey Mouse or a false phone number,” Mr Hazzard said.
“That must stop. This is a worldwide COVID pandemic. And thinking it’s smart to call yourself Donald Duck or Mickey Mouse is about as stupid as it gets.”
Ms Berejiklian said it was vital that all venues had QR codes in place, or at the very least, “really good record keeping”.
“We’re asking everybody … do not let anyone physically into your premises … do not let anyone into your door unless you have a good record of what time people came in and what time they left,” she said.
“Otherwise, Health [contact tracers] can’t do their job and we risk Christmas and the New Year period if we don’t do the right thing.”

Anyone from the rest of NSW are in the “green zone” and can enter without restrictions.
Police have established checkpoints at certain locations along the Victorian-New South Wales border and will check permits to ensure that people hold a valid permit.
This includes residents of Victoria.

From 11:59pm 18 December you must wear a fitted face mask when you are in an airport terminal. It is strongly recommended that you wear a face mask while on your flight or if travelling to Victoria by bus or train.
While you are in Victoria restrictions apply to you. Restrictions are enforced by Victoria Police and you can be fined.

SOUTH AUSTRALIA South Australia also closed its border with Greater Sydney.
If you travelled to South Australia from Northern Beaches Council (NSW) local government area or the suburbs of Cronulla, Lane Cove, Turramurra, Woolloomooloo, Lavendar Bay or Penrith between 11 December 2020 and 12:01 am 21 December:
*You are required to self-quarantine for 14 days commencing on the last day you were in one of the above locations.
*You must get a COVID-19 test immediately within 24 hours (or as soon as possible), on day 5, and day 12.
*You may self-quarantine at a suitable location where you can be isolated. This requires complete separation from others in the household and if this is not suitable, then alternative accommodation will need to be arranged.
If you arrived from other locations in New South Wales on or after 17 December:
*You are not required to self-quarantine.
*You must get a COVID-19 test immediately within 24 hours, on day 5, and day 12 (Day 1 is considered 20 December) (unless you have symptoms, in which case you must self-isolate).
Travel inside South Australia
*Travel within most of South Australia is unrestricted, although people are advised to avoid unnecessary travel.
Some restrictions are currently in place in Aboriginal communities.
All travellers coming to South Australia are required to complete a Cross Border Travel Registration.

QUEENSLAND Greater Sydney has been deemed a hotspot by the Queensland government.
Premier Palaszczuk asked any Queenslanders currently in Sydney to return home immediately, and any Queenslanders who recently returned from Greater Sydney to present for COVID-19 testing immediately, and could be required to quarantine.
These rules apply to visitors and returning Queensland residents.
Anyone can enter Queensland without a border pass, unless they have been in a COVID-19 hotspot, New South Wales or overseas in the last 14 days.
Currently, specific parts of New South Wales are designated COVID-19 hot spots, and restrictions are also in place for anyone wanting to travel into Queensland from anywhere in New South Wales.
If you have been in a hotspot within the last 14 days or since the hotspot was declared (whichever is shorter), you are no longer able to quarantine in Queensland and will be turned away at our border — unless you are exempt under the definitions within the Border Direction, which include:
*you’re a Queensland resident or are moving to Queensland
*to fulfil shared parenting and child contact arrangements
*obtain essential health care, or as a support person to a person obtaining essential health care.
If you’ve been in a COVID hotspot:
After 1am AEST Tuesday 22 December, Queensland residents who have been in a declared hotspot (currently Greater Sydney) since 11 December:
*must apply for a Queensland Border Declaration Pass before entering Queensland.
*can only enter Queensland by air and will be directed to quarantine in government arranged accommodation.

NORTHERN TERRITORY There are strict border controls in place for all arrivals to the Territory, including returning Territorians.
All arrivals to the Northern Territory (NT) must:
*fill in a Border Entry Form
*complete 14 days of mandatory supervised quarantine at your own expense*, if you have recently been in an active declared COVID-19 hot spot. This includes children returning from a hotspot.
The Northern Territory has declared the Northern Beaches local government area a hotspot.
Anyone planning to come have been advised to cancel their travel. Those who have been in the Northern Beaches in the 14 days before they arrive must enter supervised quarantine, in either Alice Springs or Darwin, and pay $2500 per person.

TASMANIA Tasmania has also declared the Northern Beaches local government area a hotspot. People from this area are not permitted to enter Tasmania.
Anyone who is already in Tasmania and has been in the Northern Beaches on or after December 11 must immediately self-isolate.

ACT The ACT has no border restrictions but those who were in the Northern Beaches area from December 11 need to immediately self-isolate and get tested.

WESTERN AUSTRALIA Western Australia reinstated its hard border as of Sunday night for NSW. No one can travel there unless they are one of the following:
* active military personnel
* a Commonwealth MP
* a senior government official
* anyone who works in transport, freight and logistics
* anyone given approval by the state emergency co-ordinator
* those who have a compassionate reason – including those who travelled recently and need to return
Each person’s case here will be reviewed on a case-by-case basis.
Those who were in NSW since December 11 and arrive must go into hotel quarantine for 14 days.
Those already in WA but came from NSW since December 11 must get tested and self-isolate until they get a negative result.
From 12.01am, Friday 25, December, travel from South Australia into Western Australia will be classified as ‘very low risk’, subject to no further outbreaks.
Travellers will be subject to certain conditions including the mandatory completion of a G2G registration and health screening upon arrival.
Anyone entering WA from SA prior to 12.01am, Friday, 25 December must undertake and complete their 14-days of self-quarantine.

Full text: There were 9403 people tested for COVID-19 in the past 24 hours.
It comes as the state’s COVID-free status could continue into the new year, experts say.
After reaching the milestone of 28 consecutive days of no new cases on Friday, Chief Health Officer Brett Sutton is confident the state has no active transmission.
The 28-day streak is considered the benchmark for having eliminated COVID-19 from the community.
Professor Sutton wrote on Twitter that was “rightly worthy of celebration”.
But he cautioned: “We have to maintain alertness. Not fear, but a precautionary approach and readiness to respond.”
University of Melbourne epidemiologist Tony Blakely said the chance of a new community case popping up got lower each day.
“Once we start doing the quarantine again it goes up a little bit. But I think the chance of us having another outbreak before New Year is quite small,” he said.
Professor Blakely, who helped provide modelling for the state government’s road map, said he was “pleasantly surprised” Victoria reached the 28-day mark.
“After we got to zero on the first day I really thought there’d be some more days with a handful of cases but the fact we stayed at zero for 28 days without having some hiccups is just extraordinary.”
University of South Australia epidemiologist and former World Health Organisation adviser Professor Adrian Esterman said there was “pretty much no chance” Victoria had any undetected community cases.
“The joker in the pack is the quarantine hotels, so until we sort them out there is simply no guarantee we won’t have another outbreak,” he said. International flights are due to return to Melbourne on December 7.
Professor Blakely said he was hopeful the hotel quarantine program would be improved but he warned it would not be 100 per cent risk-free.
“It’s not impossible it will sneak out again,” he said.
Premier Daniel Andrews said the 28-day milestone was something “all Victorians should be fundamentally proud of”.
“Public health experts have laid out a public health response, the success of which is undeniable and a great credit to the Victorian community,” he said.
Excited Victorians marked the occasion by getting out and about enjoying Friday’s warm weather.
David and Emi Anderson and their children Esan, 7, and Caia, 5, and grandma Noriko Tsuchiya, went out for lunch and a boat ride on the Yarra to celebrate.
“Compared to how it’s going in other places in the world obviously we are lucky and quiet thankful we have gone so far so well,” Mr Anderson said.
Mrs Anderson said she was excited to be able to celebrate Christmas normally next month and to say goodbye to home schooling.
Port Melbourne resident Bernadette Sait went into the city for lunch and said she was happy to visit her favourite bar.
“It’s so hard to see how many shops in the city are actually empty, let’s hope we’re all back in the city they can restart again.”
Hospitality worker Dejka Stanojkovic, who lost his job during the pandemic and was out in Southbank on Friday distributing resumes, said it was good to see the city come back to life.
“Now everybody is happy and everything is OK. life continues,” he said.
SA RECORDS TWO NEW CASES
South Australia has recorded two new COVID-19 infections linked to the state’s Parafield cluster.
Saturday’s figures brings the state’s total number of cases to 561 since the pandemic began.
The new cases, both of which have been isolating, bring the Parafield cluster to 33 cases.
There are now 19 active case across SA.
A permit is required to enter Victoria from South Australia unless an exemption applies.

RULES DRAWN UP FOR QUARANTINE 2.0
UP to a dozen hotels are preparing for international travellers who will begin to arrive in Victoria when the rejigged quarantine scheme starts in December.
Workers who have close contact with returned travellers will be tested daily to try to avoid coronavirus leaching out into the community and sparking a third wave.
Passengers are due to start arriving on December 7.
The Herald Sun can reveal most hotels being prepared for quarantine are in the CBD. Some nearer the airport are expected to be “hot hotels” for COVID-positive patients.
Premier Daniel Andrews said hotel staff would be unable to work multiple jobs.
“There will be no second or third jobs,” he said, adding that details of a testing regime were being finalised.
“We will advance contact trace anyone who works in the system so we know who they are (and) who you can reasonably expect them to be in close contact with,” he said.
“We will try to minimise the crossover between our workforce and those who work, for instance, in aged care.”

Elimination: How Victoria made it

Full text: It has, at times, seemed like a Herculean task but it looks like we have beaten the virus for now.
The working definition for when a state or territory has achieved elimination of community transmission of SARS-CoV-2 is 28 days with no mystery cases (cases without a known source).
Victoria should achieve this today , with not only no mystery cases but no cases at all since October 29. NSW achieved it on Monday, with its last mystery case on October 24.
This success is a testament to two determined approaches of different styles - showing there are multiple valid ways to deal with COVID-19. NSW did it steady, not locking down too much, and relying on contact tracing (and luck). Victoria did it more aggressively, using stringent lockdowns and a road map with data-driven triggers to release (and luck). There are lessons from this.
First, elimination is achievable. Early models and experts saying it was not possible were misled by pandemic influenza plans and models that do not model individuals - eventually, one infected person can become zero infected persons, not some fraction of a person (which is what a lot of standard models assume).
Second, in Victoria the leadership of CHOs Sutton and Cheng has been exemplary - as has that of Premier Andrews to deliver on the scientific advice. Not perfect - but perfection is not achievable in fast-moving, new and complex circumstances. On a more personal-professional note, it became clear that while we were asked by the Victorian Department of Health and Human Services to model the chance of going back into lockdown by Christmas for various strategies, what it was really interested in was getting to zero. But it could not say that explicitly in a politically and scientifically difficult environment (e. g. federal advice that we have to live with the virus, other advice that elimination was not possible). While myself and colleagues advocated for elimination in July before Victorian case numbers went up to the 500s a day, I "lost the faith" at times that we could eliminate from such a peak with such a long lockdown required. To their credit, Sutton and Cheng kept their eye on the prize.
Third, elimination is not forever. It will get back in. Quarantine can never be 100 per cent perfect, and the risk is greater again when returnees are returning from high-infection countries in the northern hemisphere. We will have to stamp it out again, using some mix of approaches demonstrated by NZ, Queensland, NSW - and now in real time South Australia. But we now have high-quality surveillance, testing and contract tracing that can keep us up with, and hopefully just ahead of, the virus. Moreover, it seems the timeline we have to play this game is diminishing as vaccine progress is excellent.
Fourth, money is not everything - or at least often misdirected. Australia has invested hundreds of millions in treatment trials - with no results. It is hard to know which research to invest taxpayers' money in at the outset, but the hegemony of existing institutions and a biomedical paradigm in cornering resources must be pointed out. Critical vaccine development aside, it has been epidemiology, non-pharmaceutical measures and shoe-leather contact tracing that has been the most useful medical activity.
In the modelling space I am most familiar with, the institutions receiving multimillion-dollar per annum contracts to deliver preparedness and advice to policy in the event of a pandemic did deliver wide-ranging advice on many issues - but were also unable to deliver on the critical task of modelling how policy responses play out as future infection rates and probabilities of elimination.
Fifth, Australia is the land of tortuous data access. As a recently arrived Kiwi, I am staggered at how hard it is to access data. For example, even though I am one of the four modellers who worked with Vic DHHS to model response options in June and July, I am still waiting to get rather innocuous daily counts of COVID cases for other research. No criticism of individuals or separate institutions - let me repeat that to my colleagues in Vic DHHS, no criticism of individuals. Rather the system of ethics, state-federal machinations and data access is tortuous, Byzantine and crippling. And breeds a lack of collaboration in research - if you are lucky enough to have secured data access, do not give up your competitive advantage and collaborate with others.
All power to the Productivity Commission and Data Commissioner as they try to sort out this mess.
Sixth, there are grounds for repatriating Australian citizens. But if coming from high-infection countries, it is a risk. Declaring my interest as an academic, it is curious to note that potential international students largely come from countries with 0.1 per cent to 0.01 per cent of the COVID-19 infection rates of the UK, US and continental Europe. The risk of kickstarting the multibillion-dollar international student business for semester one next year is less than the risk of bringing Aussies home for Christmas. We need a more rational border policy.

TARGETS CAN BE FLEXIBLE

Full text: THE threshold for reopening Melbourne may be eased amid mounting concerns that the Andrews government’s coronavirus targets are too ­cautious and unreasonable.
Premier Daniel Andrews on Saturday conceded the expectation for Melbourne to drop below five coronavirus cases per day before he lifts stage four restrictions may be ­watered down, or scrapped.
Although Victoria’s Chief Health Officer, Professor Brett Sutton, said the target was “within our grasp”, he also warned a decision may have to be made to reopen the city before all community transmissions were eliminated.
The concessions came after one of the experts whose ­research was used by the government to justify the continued stage four lockdown said the target of fewer than five daily cases was too tough.
As revealed by the Herald Sun on Saturday, University of Melbourne professorial fellow in epidemiology Tony Blakely — who co-authored the modelling Mr Andrews relied on to extend the lockdown — said the target to release Melbourne from stage four was “too stringent”.
The road map released by Mr Andrews last Sunday demands an average of fewer than five daily coronavirus cases across two weeks, and a maximum of five mystery cases in 14 days, before curfews and stay-at-home orders are dropped.
Victoria is on track to meet the average of fewer than five daily cases by October 26, but Prof Blakely said he would have aimed on an average of 10 cases a day, which would have slightly increased the risk of a third wave — from 3 per cent to 10 per cent.
Metropolitan Melbourne’s 14-day coronavirus daily case average has dropped to 61.6 on Saturday, while regional ­Victoria’s hit 4.3.
On Saturday Mr Andrews said his public health team recommended the target, which he and his cabinet endorsed.
However, the Premier appeared to step away from the strict target as well as his reliance on modelling, saying the targets were being constantly reviewed as new information flowed in.
“This is not an academic exercise, this is life, it is real and we have to lock in some settings and then push to achieve those targets,” he said.
“On the issue of the achievability or otherwise, we look at putting the data in every single day, we keep running the models we will see how things unfold day-to-day, week-to-week and we will use common sense.
“If it became clear that the tail of the second wave was more stubborn than even the most rigorous modelling tells us, then of course we would look at that.
“We have at no point said these are stone tablets and can never be changed.” Speaking after Prof Blakely’s comments were published, Prof Sutton said the targets ­demanded under the government’s road map were meant as a “general movements in those directions” and “some very strong indicative numbers” to give the public an idea of what was required.
He said further revisions of the modelling driving the targets were occurring daily “We are at a point now where we are at 30-odd cases a day, so it is within our grasp,” Prof Sutton said. “We will be realistic about how it is tracking. We won’t just say, ‘The modelling tells us this and we will move at this point’.
“If we get to the point where it is clear that it is not possible to get to (a rate of) no community transmission, we will make a call on that.
“And it is also possible that we will get to a point where the numbers are higher but we will investigate those numbers, see where they are occurring, why they are occurring and how they are occurring, and make a judgment about whether five is the appropriate target or if it is 10 cases a day but eight of them are in aged care.” Prof Sutton said the University of Melbourne modelling was a significant and “core” ­element to deciding Victoria’s way out of COVID-19 lockdown. However it was only one of several factors used in the formation of policies.
“There have been lots of other inputs, and of course it has been experience of watching the numbers,” Prof Sutton said.

Full text: What’s next for the nation if the new lockdown doesn’t work? You need to think of COVID-19 as a bushfire to understand what’s happening in locked-down Victoria. CSIRO health and biosecurity director Rob Grenfell is trying to provide some context to an emergency that has lethally put paid to any complacency about Australia being the lucky country when it comes to coronavirus.
The first wave of infections, back in February and March, when the curve here looked as if it could be trending in the ominous direction of stricken Italy and Spain, hit in a single front of international visitors and locals returning from abroad. “We were able to douse that down and suppress it,” Grenfell says, speaking from his retreat outside Melbourne.
“But the embers were still glowing and when the wind changed from the roaring northerly to the sou’wester buster, as it always does in bushfire season in this country, we ended up with spot fires all over the place.
“Instead of fighting the fire on one front with a focused effort, we had to spread all of our active units across all of those many outbreaks, which spread our public health capabilities to the maximum limit. That’s where we are today.” As daily numbers yo-yoed this week from bad to worse and back to unacceptably high — 439 new cases on Tuesday, 725 on Wednesday, 471 on Thursday, 450 on Friday — and with stage-four restrictions in force in Melbourne, the questions bedevilling the nation’s second most populous state continued to pile up.
Why was Victoria hit so hard when NSW can hold the spread of COVID to a manageable 10 to 20 cases most days and Queensland routinely posts none? Why didn’t the stage-three restrictions that worked a treat in April do the job second time around? And what’s next if the social killjoy and economically ruinous stage-four lockdown in Melbourne doesn’t work?
Some answers can be gleaned from the overseas experience. The Victorian capital’s 8pm curfew is unprecedented in this country but China and Italy went further in restricting the movement of people, and have largely tamped down any resurgence of the virus. Daily cases in Italy, ravaged by more than 35,000 COVID deaths, now average around 200 and China’s running tally is well below 50 — though doubt persists about Beijing’s reporting.
New Zealanders gave up skiing, shopping and nearly all their takeaway food options to comply with Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern’s ambitious strategy to eliminate the disease. The country’s latest case count: zero.
Taiwan, Hong Kong, Singapore and South Korea put everyone testing positive to the virus into supervised care whether they are symptomatic or not, something Australia has mostly baulked at. (Conscious of the vulner­ability of its big indigenous population, the Northern Territory sends people straight to hospital.) Should we be looking to their example to contain the conflagration in and to Victoria?
Grenfell cautions that overseas lessons, while valuable, don’t necessarily translate. The Australian bush burns in a particular way, after all. Singapore-based infectious disease expert Dale Fisher argues that this country made a serious mistake in isolating suspected and known COVID carriers in the home, pointing to the revelation this week that a quarter of those in Melbourne were out at the time police or army personnel checked on them.
“I’m much more of a believer in supervision because I don’t trust 100 per cent of people to do the right thing,” says the expatriate Australian, who visited ground zero in Wuhan for the World Health Organisation at the height of the initial China outbreak in February.
Grenfell says he is not sure Australians would wear that. In his younger days as a GP, he treated aged TB survivors who had been sent to a state sanatorium, sometimes for years. “It was horrible,” he recalls. The circumstances are different with COVID-19, of course. But no response can work without community buy-in. “Singaporeans are much more accepting of government and control than Australians are,” he insists.
Leaving aside the politically charged issue of the hotel quarantine bungles that seem to have uncorked the virus after it was initially bottled up in Melbourne, Grenfell says Australia has well-earned license to “put ourselves in a very high tier in terms of the response”. The travails of his home state were completely and utterly predictable, he maintains.
The basic reproduction number of SARS-CoV-2, the novel coronavirus that causes COVID-19, tops out at five, on par with smallpox, meaning one infectious person can spread the disease to up to five others in the absence of public health intervention. In US hot zones the R-0 averages 2.5.
In Victoria last month, when infections were doubling every five days according to modelling for this newspaper by University of NSW mathematical biologist Deborah Cromer, the rate was 1.75. Stage-three restrictions in Melbourne drove this down to an R-0 of just over 1, but the volume of virus circulating in the community meant new case numbers were still on track to double every 16 days, in line with leaked Victorian government modelling obtained by political editor Dennis Shanahan forecasting a peak next week of the daily tally at 1100.
“Where we are sitting now in Victoria is certainly a solid effort to suppress the virus down to controllable levels,” Grenfell says. “Stage three has certainly been successful … if it hadn’t happened we would have had upwards of 20,000 (daily new) cases already. The problem is we are still bouncing around at a level that is unacceptable.” As the blame game rages on, Grenfell says it is worth remembering who brought COVID-19 into the country in the first place: foreign tourists and largely well-heeled Australians returning from holidays or cruises abroad. Expanding on the bushfire analogy, he says the virus exploited weaknesses in the population and social fabric to surge again piecemeal, like an ember attack.
There’s no mystery to this. “If we look at the populations that have had spread in them … it’s casual workers in aged-care centres working between facilities, casual workers in security businesses working between companies or agencies, transport workers, meatworkers employed in difficult work settings,” Grenfell says. “That’s a reflection of our social practices. The virus has found which parts in our community are the ones that are going to spread it and has maximised its opportunities in that setting.” Infectious diseases modeller Jodie McVernon, professor and director of epidemiology at the University of Melbourne’s Peter Doherty Institute for Infection and Immunity, says it is one thing to ask the infected members of an affluent household to limit themselves to using one of their three bathrooms and quite another to expect social distancing in a two-bedroom housing commission flat occupied by a family of 10.
“The ability to manage infection spread within households, the ability for people to work from home or say they are not coming to work if they are sick is very, very different,” she says.
“This is something that has been seen globally: the infection moves from advantaged people who travelled and imported it from their interesting holidays and work trips to less advantaged people … leading to much more intense transmission waves.” From his vantage point in Singapore, Fisher says it is evident Victoria wasn’t ready to open up when the original restrictions came off in May-June, under pressure from the federal government and business to get the economy moving.
“You shouldn’t reopen because you want to or because the economics demands it,” he says. “You should reopen because you are ready to. The question is whether Victoria ever knew what ready was, that’s what you have to ask.” Fisher is not impressed by the smaller states and territories trumpeting their low case numbers. A nought on the daily count doesn’t equate to job done well, he says. NSW, given its population, is the standout jurisdiction in Australia because so far it has succeeded in managing low-level but still menacing community transmission, with 11 new cases reported on Friday. South Korea is another success story, highlighting the importance of fast, nimble and closely co-ordinated control structures.
“The South Koreans constantly rumble along at 20 to 40 cases a day,” Fisher says. “They have had to tweak their social restrictions up and down a few times as we had to here in Singapore, but they are living with the virus.
“That’s the key phrase at the moment: you have got to learn how to live with this virus. The vaccine may not be the fairytale we all hope it will be and people who are closing borders and hoping for that day will, I suspect, be disappointed.” Embattled Victorian Premier Daniel Andrews set the hares running when he suggested the stage-four lockdown could be tightened further, though technically there is no stage five. What could this look like? University of Melbourne professor of epidemiology Tony Blakely told the Herald Sun the partial shutdown of construction sites would become complete, takeaway food and delivery ser­vices banned and supermarket visits limited to once a week per household. The current 5km “bubble” imposed on essential travel outside the home would shrink to 1km, radically changing how people lived.
Victoria’s Deputy Chief Health Officer Allen Cheng, standing in for CHO Brett Sutton, whose haggard features reflect the personal toll on decision-makers, said on Thursday the case load should trend down from next week. Re-emerging after two days off, Sutton on Friday welcomed the apparent stabilisation of numbers in the 400 to 500 range. “I do expect that within 14 days of a really significant intervention we will see a fall,” he said, referencing the restrictions that came into force from midnight Wednesday.
Michael Asten, a retired professor of geophysics with Monash University, has crunched the numbers from Italy, France and Britain to show that infections peak at 0.01 per cent of the population. “The evidence suggests we might be at that point,” he tells Inquirer.
Not before time. The revelation that more than a quarter of Friday’s new infections were of healthcare workers vividly underlines the pressure bearing down on the hospital system and other state services. “The issue is we can’t keep holding at this level … you can’t tread water forever,” McVernon says. “You have to get the level down to a much lower daily case number to then drive it down further.” World-best practice suggests that the stage-four restrictions in Victoria should work, Grenfell says. But the stark reality is that the big-stick approach must work because, in the absence of a vaccine, there’s a limit to what more can be done. “You have to ask yourself would the gain in going to any further draconian measures actually be worth it?” he asks. “I think they would be more destructive than helpful.”

Full text: Economists don’t know much about epidemiology, but they know quite a bit about the pitfalls of statistics in general and modelling in particular — learned from years of unhappy experience.
Modelling is an inexact science, and is sometimes misused in the policy process. This experience is relevant to the policy response to COVID-19.
Three or four decades ago, smart young economists were building large-scale models to mimic the interactions of the macro-economy. The promise was that if enough detail and data could be incorporated, the model would give an accurate representation of how the real economy worked. The model would tell policymakers what to do.
In practice, these large-scale macro-models never played a central role in policymaking. They were, at most, debating tools in the policy argument.
It’s not just that reality is very complex. After all, weather forecasting has improved spectacularly thanks to large-scale computer modelling. Unlike the physics of weather, the economy is evolving over time and doesn’t obey fixed rules. Consumers and investors aren’t robots, always behaving completely rationally and consistently over time.
Large “black box” models were relegated to the backrooms. Attention shifted to smaller models where the key relationships are transparent and can be understood intuitively, even by non-­experts. The models provide just one input into the broader policy debate.
Contrast this with the role that epidemiological modelling has played in the policy response to COVID-19. Whereas politicians are never heard to say that they are closely following the expert advice based on scientific economic modelling, the epidemiology models seem to be driving policy, with the politicians reluctant to add their overlay. Australia went into strong containment when the Imperial College model and the Doherty model foretold an overwhelming of intensive-care facilities. The model said that this could be averted only by the restrictions we still have in place. Now we are looking towards easing, based largely on the virus reproduction rate R (effective reproduction number) being clearly below 1, again based on the latest scientific modelling.
These models, however, have many of the same weaknesses as economic models, with the same temptations to use models as a debating tool to support a favoured argument.
As with economic modellers, epidemiologists can’t re-run a real-life episode multiple times to get a sound estimate of the parameters that determine how a disease develops or how the hospital system copes. The science of the disease may be less changeable than economic behaviour, but the critical value of the reproduction rate R will depend on how the public behaves in response to the containment measures, and their own evolving perceptions of the risks.
The critical issue now is how R will change in response to eased restrictions: in this, there is little statistical guidance. The apparently low community transmission value of R, even before the restrictions were tightened in the second half of March, might suggest that R will still be below the critical value of 1, even with all restrictions lifted except border controls. But this figure is based on a tiny sample.
In short, epidemiology models and economic models are both subject to the same “radical uncertainty” that Mervyn King and John Kay describe in their recent book, where the mathematical probabilities are unknown, the input data are uncertain and the behavioural relationships are unstable. How will R behave as the restrictions are lifted? This depends mainly on how people behave, and the honest answer is “no one knows”. It depends on trial and error, not a model.
What are the lessons here? Use small models that focus on a few critical parameters, and run multiple simulations to test how sensitive the results are to changing parameters. These simulations should be intuitive enough so that the non-expert policymakers can make their own judgments about the validity of the parameters, and add their political overlay.
Why not make this decision process more transparent, with all its uncertainties and competing views? Openness fosters trust. Earlier publication of the initial Doherty modelling, with its dramatic mortality predictions, could have drawn out how dependent these predictions were on the ­assumed parameter values.
Australia seems to be on a good path, especially compared with overseas experience, thanks largely to strong and timely epidemiology advice. This kind of success will leave the policymakers and their expert advisers open to the usual criticism of successful pre-emptive policies: the critics assert afterwards that the measures were too restrictive, even unnecessary. If the public feel informed during the decision process and can understand its logic, with all the uncertainties, they will more readily accept that it was better to err on the side of caution than to follow the early insouciance of Italy, Spain, the UK, Sweden and the US.
R is now well below 1; the number of new cases is tiny; and the low rate of positive testing, ­focused as it is on the most likely cases, strongly suggests that there is an even lower rate in the community at large. If effective eradication is achieved and main­tained, Australia can quickly get back to a semblance of normality — probably with border controls, limits on crowds and elderly isolation with particular attention to aged care. Delay imposes a huge cost on the economy. We should start this easing process now.Stephen Grenville is a non-resident fellow at the Lowy Institute and former deputy governor at the Reserve Bank

Full text: This is crunch time … how individual Australians behave in the coming weeks will be a matter of life and death on the grand scale
Australia stands at a critical point in the management of the coronavirus pandemic. Cases have begun to grow exponentially and, unless the tide is slowed, we could have tens of thousands of cases within weeks. It was at this point in Italy’s crisis that the COVID-19 juggernaut got away from authorities there and began pushing the country’s hospitals to the brink of collapse.
Within the next two weeks, we will know whether the government’s advice against large gatherings of people, the closing of the borders and compulsory isolation of citizens returning from overseas, and the actions of workplaces and individuals to place distance between employees, family and friends, have had their desired ­effect in slowing the growth in ­infections.
“We’re probably where Italy was 20 days ago,” says Raina Macintyre, the head of the biosecurity program at the University of NSW’s Kirby Institute. “We’re very much on the upward part of the curve. Things are going to get a lot worse, a lot faster now.
“Whether we get as bad as Italy depends on how we handle the ­response from here on and how much we manage to reduce ­contact between people with the measures we’re undertaking.” Hospitals are preparing to double­ the number of the nation’s 2229 intensive care unit beds. Elect­ive surgery lists are being cancelled, operating theatres and wards are being co-opted and converted to new ICU spaces, and health authorities are urgently trying to secure more ventilators.
Under the government’s best-case-scenario modelling, 20 per cent of the population would be infecte­d with COVID-19, but even that optimistic projection would mean hospitals could run out of the ventilators needed to support the breathing of critically ill ­patients.
To prevent hospitals being overwhelmed, governments are aiming to slow the rate of infection to manageable levels. Whether this will be achieved will boil down to the actions of individuals, says the director of epidemiology at Melbourne’s Doherty Institute, Jodie McVernon.
“I think we’re at a critical stage right now,” McVernon says. “We need to do whatever we can do to protect the people we love.
“The measures that are being recommended by governments and mandated by governments must be enacted by individuals and workplaces and communities. And that’s how they’re going to work or not work.
“Unless society takes this responsi­bility seriously and starts thinking about how they can ­reduce their risk to others, then the measures being taken by governments won’t work.
“We need to think carefully about non-essential activities. Don’t throw that party. See your family, see your loved ones, bond with them, but do it in smaller numbers. Maintain really strong social contacts with your elderly, but don’t send sick children around there.” University of Melbourne epidemiologist Tony Blakely has modelled the potential spread of coronavirus in Australia and his projections are terrifying. If the disease were allowed to spread ­unchecked, it would devastate ­society.
“Put it this way, the modelling I have done suggests that if you just let it rip you could get as high as 400,000 to 600,000 cases a day at one point in Australia,” Blakely says. “There’s no way we can let it get that high. That would be abso­lute carnage.” But the trade-off of “flattening the curve” is a longer epidemic, says McVernon. “If we do this ­distancing well, this is the hard story, this epidemic will go on and on and on at a low level,” she says.
“But the point of that is to make sure that people who need medical care for all sorts of things, including COVID-19, will have access to a functioning health system, and our society can continue.
“So that’s the imperative, and that’s the responsibility on every Australian.” The chances of Australia moving­ to lock down society, similar­ to measures being taken in Italy, France and Spain, grows higher every day, says Blakely. But will our government seriously consider banning people from going to restaurants, cafes and pubs?
“If you’d asked me that question a few months ago, I would have said no way,” Blakely says. “As of today, yes, I can see it happening­. These are extraordinary times.” The commonwealth’s Deputy Chief Health Officer, Paul Kelly, said this week he was confident the extraordinary measures enacted by the federal government to close the borders and force people returning­ from overseas into a two-week quarantine, as well as rigorous contact tracing of infected cases by state health authorities, would prove effective in slowing the rate of transmission.
“All of these measures we’ve introduced over the past week will start to decrease that curve,” Kelly said. “I’m very confident that will happen.
“When will it actually start to decrease? I don’t have a crystal ball. But in the meantime, we’re looking to find our cases, get them to stay at home, to find their contacts­ and to flatten the curve.” The government has emphasised that it wants to make the measures it is introducing to slow the infection rate “scaleable”, so that as cases increase, mitigation measures will get stricter.
Blakely says if cases are able to be managed over the longer term, eventually sufficient herd immunity will develop in the community. That may even happen before a vaccine is available.
“We’re at about the right point, I think, on the intensity of the interventions we’re doing right now,” he says.
“In a couple of weeks’ time, with both more knowledge of what’s working elsewhere, but also as the case load starts to pick up, we’ll need to turn on more ­interventions to try and slow the increasing rate of that curve.
“Turning more interventions on now may simply just shift the peak out further into the future, and mean that society’s got to ­tolerate these impositions for longer. It’s a very delicate ­balancing act.” Mandated measures to flatten the curve will be reviewed constantly, and they may be able to be adjusted according to the load on the health system, Blakely says.
“There is another approach which is getting mooted in the UK, which has a reasonable amount of good sense behind it, which is where you say: OK, the canary in the coalmine here is going to be the number of people admitted each day to ICU. That might be 100 people.
“So once you’ve got 100 people a day that are getting admitted into ICU you say, OK, this is going too high, and you crash back into containment or suppression so everybody goes into lockdown for a week or whatever it is. And then once you’ve got it back down to only 50 people that are going into ICU, you then relax back a bit.
“So there may be this on-off, on-off way of managing it rather than just a set of rules that we put in place and hold in place for a ­couple of months. There may be this thing whereby we actually develo­p these sentinel indicators, like the number of people going to ICU each day, and adjust our action­s accordingly.” However severe the restrictions on daily life become, the governmen­t has made it clear that people should be prepared for at least six months of life being radicall­y different. That’s likely to change our society in profound ways.
“We’re going to have new norms out of this,” Blakely says. “This is a major shock to society, but there’s going to be innovation that comes out of this.“We’re seeing a massive shock to the system that will see us ­behaving quite differently in the long term.”

“So there may be this on-off, on-off way of managing it rather than just a set of rules that we put in place and hold in place for a ­couple of months. There may be this thing whereby we actually develo­p these sentinel indicators, like the number of people going to ICU each day, and adjust our action­s accordingly.” However severe the restrictions on daily life become, the governmen­t has made it clear that people should be prepared for at least six months of life being radicall­y different. That’s likely to change our society in profound ways.
“We’re going to have new norms out of this,” Blakely says. “This is a major shock to society, but there’s going to be innovation that comes out of this.“We’re seeing a massive shock to the system that will see us ­behaving quite differently in the long term.”
