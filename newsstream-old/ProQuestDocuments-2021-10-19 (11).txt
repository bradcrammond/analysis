Full text: Lockdown restrictions will be eased sooner than expected and Victorians could be granted additional freedoms from next weekend, with Premier Daniel Andrews set to outline an updated reopening plan today.
Changes to home gatherings and travel limits are among those being considered.
Three senior cabinet ministers, speaking to The Sunday Age on the condition of anonymity, confirmed cabinet had been asked to tick off on the additional freedoms, which were originally set to be banned until 80 per cent of the state's population aged 16 and over had received both vaccine doses.
"We've been wondering what else we could do to bring forward some freedoms earlier," one minister said.
Victoria recorded 1993 new cases of COVID-19 yesterday and seven deaths, including a 15-year-old girl. State COVID-19 response commander Jeroen Weimar confirmed the daily caseload was "slightly ahead" of the numbers predicted by the Burnet Institute's modelling, a situation he described as a "cause for concern".
However, Victoria's soaring vaccination rate has driven the early easing of restrictions.
More than 88 per cent of the state's population aged 16 and over have received one dose, and 65 per cent are double-dosed.
The state is scheduled to hit its 70 per cent double-dose threshold as early as Friday, four days ahead of schedule, triggering the reopening of outdoor dining and hairdressers for fully vaccinated customers. The curfew will be lifted and weddings and funerals will be permitted but capped at 50.
The Premier is set to outline the new plan today following a meeting of his eight-member COVID-19 Crisis Council of Cabinet late last night. Meanwhile, government officials faced sustained questioning about a change to border rules which will allow
fully vaccinated people from
NSW to travel anywhere in Victoria while Melbourne residents remain confined to a 15-kilometre travel limit.
With no government minister fronting the media yesterday, Mr Weimar was forced to defend the border change which will allow double-dosed travellers from "red zones", such as Sydney, quarantine-free entry into Victoria from Wednesday if they return a negative COVID-19 test.
"What we've tried to do is to normalise the situation between with NSW and Victoria that really opens up future opportunities to allow easier travel between NSW and Victoria as the situation, from an epidemiological point of view, starts to become broadly similar," Mr Weimar said.
Travellers from NSW will still have to follow Victorian COVID-19 restrictions on their arrival. Mr Weimar said the testing and vaccination rules would ensure travellers "present no greater threat than the rest of us do".
"I think this is just a sensible way of allowing some of the Victorians [in NSW] to come back more easily, and to allow those who've got critical business to do here in Victoria to do so as well."
For the third day in the row, the number of COVID-19 cases in Victoria hovered around 2000, with household transmission to blame. "We've seen very consistently over the last eight weeks, around half of the cases on each particular day are within existing households and half are new households," Mr Weimar said.
"Although we are not seeing those big super-spreading events we've seen in earlier outbreaks, what we are seeing is this slow rolling set of outbreaks as transmission goes from one house to the next."
While the number of hospitalisations and ICU admissions due to COVID-19 was below modelling predictions, Mr Weimar said the number of patients seeking hospital treatment for COVID-19 had jumped by "about 100" in 24 hours which health authorities attributed to a significant rise in cases 10 days earlier.
"That is typically how long it takes for the numbers to feed through," Mr Weimar said.
Health authorities will conduct as many as 500 workplace site inspections each day after the state government's vaccine mandate kicked in on Friday requiring Victoria's 1.25 million authorised workers to prove they have received at least one dose of a vaccine or show proof of a booking within the next week.
Mr Weimar said the government would enforce the rules. "You should expect to be challenged and to be able to demonstrate that you've got controls in place that demonstrates your staff are appropriately vaccinated," he said.

Full text: Tasmania must reject the federal government's national plan for reopening the country and take the most cautious approach possible due to recent overseas evidence of the transmissibility of Delta, a health policy analyst believes.
And even when state borders fully reopen - either in December or early 2022 - mask mandates and restrictions would likely still apply to prevent extreme pressure being placed on Tasmania's health system.
Martyn Goddard released analysis on Tuesday into the latest overseas data on the effectiveness of vaccines to prevent Delta transmissibility, claiming that while the vaccines were effective at preventing serious illness, they were not entirely effective at slowing the spread.
He found that modelling relied upon by the Doherty Institute in informing the federal government's reopening plan was already out of date, and that vaccination targets of 70 and 80 per cent were far too low.
Mr Goddard's analysis found that Tasmania would be in trouble even with the state government's ambitious target of 90 per cent double-dose vaccination for all people eligible over the age of 16 by December should COVID be allowed to spread, given the large numbers of unvaccinated people still in the community at that level.
He commended the government on having more ambitious vaccination targets than the federal government, but warned Tasmanians that life was unlikely to return to normal any time soon.
"Once we start to open up, it will not be as free as it is now, that's the price we're going to have to pay," Mr Goddard said.
While Victoria, NSW and ACT might want borders reopened at 80 per cent, Mr Goddard said this would be unfair on states that have gone without COVID spread for much of the past 18 months.
"What the federal government is wanting states like Western Australia and Tasmania to do is, in my view, insane," he said.
With 90 per cent of eligible Tasmanians vaccinated, there would still be 116,000 unvaccinated, with children 15 and under not included in the government's figures.
Economist Saul Eslake agreed with Mr Goddard's analysis, and urged the Tasmanian Government to only reopen when modelling showed it was absolutely safe to do so.
"I think it would be better in the medium to longer run to wait until we have reached levels of vaccination that the serious modelling tells us is safe, and minimises the risk of going back into recurring lockdowns, than to go earlier than that and run the risk," he said.
Tasmania has not had community transmission since May last year, when the North-West outbreak caused the closure of two hospitals.
Mr Eslake said the evidence from the United Kingdom and Israel showed that opening up the economy too soon could have dire consequences for health systems, costing the state more in the long run.
"There is a sound argument that Tasmania needs to be more careful than other jurisdictions might be able to be given the inadequacies of our health system," he said.
The pair were eager to urge all Tasmanians to get vaccinated as the greatest defence against COVID.
"You can't rely on somebody else getting vaccinated to protect you," Mr Goddard said. "You've got to do it yourself. You've got to protect yourself, you've got to take responsibility to get vaccinated and it's really important to do it now."
Professor Raina MacIntyre from the University of NSW's Kirby Institute is preparing Tasmania-specific modelling to guide the government's opening plan, expected to be released within two weeks.
Director of Public Health Mark Veitch said the latest data - including the transmissibility of the Delta strain among the vaccinated - will be factored in.
Health Minister Jeremy Rockliff welcomed Mr Goddard's input, and said the health and safety of Tasmanians would be the main priority in developing a reopening plan.

What QLD already knows about its Delta surge hospital capacity

Full text: As the battle of Queensland’s borders has reached new extremes, amid accusations of extortion, unfair treatment and politicians “desperate for a fight”, hospitals in Townsville, Cairns, Mackay and Mount Isa sounded separate “code yellow” capacity alarms.
The Australian reports Australian College for Emergency Medicine president John Bonning said the declaration of four code yellows in one day was “unprecedented”.
Prime Minister Scott Morrison accused the state government of extortion, after the Premier linked the state border reopening to getting more hospital funding.
But state Health Minister Yvette D’Ath said Queensland was being unfairly targeted, as other states had made the same request for funds, and the state needed the money for the hospitals to cope with a surge in cases in the event of a Delta-strain Covid outbreak.
It is despite assurances being made to the Commonwealth, and publicly at a press conference on Sunday, the Queensland’s hospital system was ready.
Federal Health Department secretary Brendan Murphy said all states and territories had been working with the Commonwealth on health system capacity plans for once the country starts to open up again,
He said the states “all feel comfortable that they have well advanced plans to deal with the predicted modelled Covid that will occur in the national plan from the Doherty modelling”.
“Essentially what it‘s showing, using the Doherty modelling of the 70 and 80 per cent fully vaccinated rates with various scenarios and the states and territories predicted hospital demand, it’s showing that we can cope with the predicted demand on our health system,” Dr Murphy said.
Mr Morrison on Tuesday morning described the Queensland Government linking reopening borders to hospital funding as “ransom and to seek to extort from them money on the basis of COVID”.
“I mean to suggest that they’re not going to open the borders unless I send them cash. How else would you like me to call it,” he told the Today show.
When asked to respond to the Prime Minister’s claims, Premier Annastacia Palaszczuk said “I don’t believe that no, not at all”.
“These are pressures that are being felt right around the country,” she said.
“We want to make sure that our hospitals are getting ready.”
Federal Health Minister Greg Hunt said there was already an ongoing, uncapped 50/50 split of all Covid-related hospital expenses and the private hospital guarantee which provides more beds and nurses to deal with a surge.
“You get the feeling sometimes that people are desperate for a fight. They cannot complain about vaccines. So now they’re trying to create a diversion,” he said.
“Right now, the focus of the Queensland Government shouldn’t be about fighting, but it should be encouraging people to say now’s the moment to come forward to be vaccinated.”
Ms D’Ath said Mr Morrison was targeting Queensland despite every state and territory leader signing the three letters calling for extra support.
“This isn’t just about Queensland,” she said.

EARLIER
MORE than ten southern Gold Coast businesses have been named as new exposure sites after a confirmed Covid case visited the area in recent days.
Queensland has recorded two new local Covid cases and two overseas-acquired cases detected in hotel quarantine on Saturday.
NSW recorded 813 cases and 10 deaths in the same time period.
Queensland Premier Annastacia Palaszczuk revealed on Friday a man - linked to the Eaton’s Hill aviation cluster - had spent time in the Kirra area since September 25 while holidaying with his family, moving about the community while unknowingly infected.
His two children have now tested positive as well.
Chief health officer Jeannette Young said: “We’re double checking there weren’t any other venues they attended.
For rolling coverage watch Sky News Australia on Foxtel or visit www.skynews.com.au.
“But now every single day that we don’t have community transmission is another day that more than 50,000 Queenslanders have the opportunity to get vaccinated.
“We have plenty of vaccine.”
The cases were detected in home quarantine, however authorities are still looking at whether they spent any time in the community.
Meanwhile, the state government is still refusing to say if the border will open when 80 per cent of the population is vaccinated.
“I have said continuously around the 80 per cent threshold that the Doherty Institute modelling is not just about percentage,” Ms D’Ath said.
“It’s also … the number of outbreaks you’ve got.”
Greenmount Surf Club and popular eatery Kirramisu Café and Restaurant have been listed among 11 exposure sites in the border community.

South Gold Coast venue reveals exposure site status October 1, 2021
A GOLD Coast Surf Club feared to be an exposure site after a confirmed Covid case visited late last week has been given the all-clear by health authorities.
Surf Life Saving Queensland released a statement late Friday afternoon, revealing Kirra Surf Club officials had been informed by Queensland Health it was not an exposure site.
It comes after a Covid-positive man visiting from Brisbane spent four days moving about the Kirra area while unknowingly infected.
Queensland Premier Annastacia Palaszczuk revealed earlier today the case was linked to the Eatons Hill aviation cluster detailed earlier this week.
The man stayed at the iconic Kirra Beach Resort with his wife and two children and they visited North Kirra Surf Life Saving Club, Kirra Surf Club, Timezone at Coolangatta, Woolworths at The Strand shopping complex, as well as cafes in the area.
No further Kirra sites have been added to Queensland Health’s exposure sites at this time.

New Covid cases travelled to southern Gold Coast October 1, 2021
QUEENSLAND has recorded two new local Covid-19 cases, but the southeast has dodged a lockdown for now despite concerns about exposure sites on the southern Gold Coast.
Premier Annastacia Palaszczuk revealed the two new locally acquired cases and one new overseas case at a press conference at Brisbane just after 10am on Friday morning.

She said one local case was linked to the Eatons Hill aviation cluster detailed earlier this week and that the person had spent four days on the southern Coast on holidays from September 25.
He stayed at the iconic Kirra Beach Resort with his wife and two children and they visited North Kirra Surf Life Saving Club, Kirra Surf Club, Timezone at Coolangatta, Woolworths at The Strand shopping complex, as well as cafes in the area.
Specific dates, times and locations will be posted on the Queensland Health website soon.
“Anyone who has been to any of those venues or in that part of the Gold Coast over the past week and has any symptoms it’s important, now is the time to really please come forward and get tested,” Dr Young said.
NED-2822-GCB-APP
The second local case, a man who travels the east coast relocating animals, became infected in New South Wales and was in the southern Coast community for one day on September 29.
Dr Young said that case was not of particular concern.
“I don’t think he’s a risk,” she said.
Ms Palaszczuk said the new overseas case became infected in Egypt and was detected in hotel quarantine.
No mystery cases have emerged, which would have been a likely trigger for a snap lockdown.
“It’s encouraging news today that we don’t have unlinked community transmission and we have high levels of testing,” Ms Palaszczuk said.
“If the advice is to go into lockdown, we will go into lockdown.
“The fundamental reason we’re not in lock down is because we don’t have any seeding or unlinked community transmission."
Ms Palaszczuk said 19,764 tests had been undertaken in the previous 24 hours, which gave the government “an additional level of confidence”.
There was 22 coronavirus cases active in the community on Friday.

Health Minister Yvette D’Ath said compared to the situation ahead of the previous lockdown related to the Indooroopilly cluster, Queensland’s vaccination rate was now 20 per cent higher, and 4.8 million doses of the Covid vaccine had been administered across the state.
She urged everyone to get a vaccine, even those on holidays, saying they shouldn’t wait for appointments but should instead get a jab “today”.
“Please don’t wait, we want people to come out and get vaccinated,” she said.
Ms D’Ath said with walk-ins were available at every Queensland Health vaccination centre. She urged people to get their vaccine ahead of scheduled appointments, even if it was only days away.

On Thursday Queensland Police stopped more than 14,600 vehicles at the border and more than 100 were refused entry because they did not have the proper exemptions to enter Queensland.
Officers also handed out 67 masks.
Meanwhile, Victoria has 1143 new local cases and three deaths, it was announced on Friday, while NSW recorded 864 new cases and 15 deaths
Queensland has recorded 2039 cases in total since the pandemic began, seven people with the virus have died and 2005 patients have recovered.
On Thursday, Ms Palaszczuk warned the state is in a “critical” period to stop the spread of the Delta variant of the virus throughout Queensland.
Queensland Stage 2 restrictions reintroduced 30/9/21
Locally acquired cases have been spreading across the Coast, Brisbane, Moreton Bay and Townsville, but contact tracers have pinpointed their origins within a day.
A lockdown has been avoided partially due to rising vaccination rates and the use of face masks.
Late on Thursday, it was reported 52 people had been forced into home quarantine after a 14-year-old girl attending a bronze medallion course at Southport Surf Life Saving Club tested positive.
The girl was one of six new cases of Covid recorded in Queensland on Thursday, which came after a Biggera Waters resident and a Gaven resident both tested positive.
The trio of new cases resulted in the publication of new exposure sites across the Coast.
The Queensland government has urged the community to continue to social distance.
Anyone who is unwell, or displaying even the mildest coronavirus symptoms, should stay home and immediately phone their GP or 13 HEALTH (13 43 25 84) to arrange a test.

Full text: Daniel Andrews has pledged to find “a way to push through and get this place open”, despite a massive surge in Victoria’s Covid case numbers that saw Wednesday’s record of 950 swamped by 1438 new cases on Thursday.
While the Victorian Premier refused to rule out having to revise his reopening road map should a further escalation in cases overwhelm the state’s already struggling health system, he vowed that Victoria was “not turning back” in seeking to reopen as scheduled when the 70 and 80 per cent vaccination targets were met.
Mr Andrews attributed at least 500 extra cases in Thursday’s number to illegal household gatherings held on the AFL grand final long weekend, maintaining that while he was “not trying to blame anyone”, case numbers “go up faster if people are out visiting each other in their homes”.
Asked whether he could rule out having to revise his road map should the health system become swamped, he said: “I have never ruled that out. There is no crystal ball with this.” However, he said there was “no turning back now” in terms of the state moving towards reopening. “We are finding a way to push through and get this place open. We’ve got to do it,” he said.
The increase in cases came as the major supermarkets pleaded with the Andrews government to revise isolation protocol for fully vaccinated casual contacts of Covid cases, warning the furloughing of staff could see dozens of stores forced to close as early as this weekend.
Business groups, meanwhile, called on the government to honour its road map, saying a lockdown-battered Victoria needed hope and certainty to recover.
Opposition Leader Matthew Guy called on Mr Andrews to take responsibility for the state’s health system already being in crisis — with widespread ambulance ramping at major hospitals as well as waiting times of up to 12 minutes for triple-0 calls to be answered earlier this week.
“The Premier has been in his job for seven years. He was the health minister for four years as well. For 11 of the last 15 years, he is the person who’s run the health system in Victoria,” Mr Guy said.
“We’ve all known this moment would come to reopen and there would be more cases. If our hospital system is not ready now, questions need to be asked why?” The Burnet Institute modelling on which the Andrews government has based its reopening road map predicts hospitalisations will peak at between 1950 and 4400, including between 462 and 953 ­patients in ICU.
On Thursday, 398 people were in Victorian hospitals with coronavirus; 83 were in intensive care, of whom 57 were on ventilators.
Covid logistics chief Jeroen Weimar on Thursday warned that if the jump in case numbers proved to be a trend, “we will jump to the worst of those Burnet predictions”.
While Victoria’s case numbers have outstripped those of NSW on a per capita basis, slightly higher vaccination rates in Victoria now compared with the NSW peak on September 11 appear to correlate with fewer deaths and hospitalisations. Victoria’s 1438 cases on Thursday are the per capita equivalent of 1758 cases in NSW, compared with the actual peak in NSW on September 11 of 1599 local cases.
At the time, NSW had a single-dose vaccination rate of 78.1 per cent, with 45.6 per cent fully vaccinated, compared with Victoria’s rate on Thursday of 80.1 per cent single and 49.8 double-dosed.
There had been 170 deaths in the NSW outbreak to September 11, compared with 41 in Victoria as of Thursday. These included five deaths reported on Thursday, all in Melbourne’s north.

Full text: A FORMAL complaint alleging Premier Annastacia Palaszczuk misled parliament on Covid-19 pandemic modelling has been tossed out by the Speaker, who savaged the Opposition for taking the issue to the media.
The LNP last week formally asked Speaker Curtis Pitt to refer the Premier to the Ethics Committee, alleging she had deliberately ­misled parliament by relying on extrapolated worst-case scenario Doherty Institute modelling to claim 2240 ­people would die a month if the state opened up at 70 per cent fully vaccinated. Mr Pitt, in parliament on Wednesday, dismissed the complaint as “not meritorious”. “I have decided to dismiss the matter without further inquiry and I will not be referring it to the Ethics Committee nor publishing any further correspondence,” he said.

State on edge as lockdown looms

Full text: SOUTH East Queensland is on the brink of another lockdown as the list of exposure sites from two mystery outbreaks grows and authorities warn a spike in cases could force swift action.
Tough mask mandates have already been reinstated in Brisbane and Moreton Bay in response to an unvaccinated truck driver testing positive after he was infectious in the community for eight days, and a vaccinated aviation worker also contracting the virus.
Chief health officer Dr Jeannette Young said “large numbers” of cases in the coming days could trigger a lockdown – the first since July 31 when six community cases were deemed enough to warrant stay-at-home orders.
“Of course, I always consider a lockdown, and then I work through what we need to do, at this stage I do not think a lockdown is warranted, that could change,” she said.
“I do have a reasonable level of concern. I’m really, really, very comforted by the fact that people do know how to respond and respond very, very quickly.” Infectious disease expert Paul Griffin – who investigated the Prince Charles Hospital outbreak – said he would be convinced a lockdown was “unavoidable” if there were a high number of exposure sites and close contacts, plus more unlinked or mystery cases.
On Tuesday night, more than a dozen exposure sites were listed on Queensland Health’s website, including the Adalong Guesthouse where the truckie stayed while infectious along with 25 other people, who were bussed out of the accommodation about 6pm Tuesday.
The fresh scare was sparked late Monday night when Queensland Health revealed a man who works for an aviation training site tested positive – despite not travelling interstate or overseas – and had been in the community, including at a childcare centre. Hours later, it emerged his wife had also tested positive, but authorities were more worried about an unrelated truck driver who stayed at three locations in Brisbane, including the guesthouse where bathrooms are shared.
Dr Young said it was not known how the truckie or the aviation worker contracted the virus, but she said the aviation worker likely had contact with international pilots through his job.
A returned traveller from Timor-Leste also tested positive five days after completing her 14 days in hotel quarantine, but authorities are looking at whether this could be “light shedding”, as opposed to being a new case.
Dr Griffin said Queenslanders could not assume our run of luck would continue, especially as it is one of the lowest vaccinated states in the country so “most susceptible to a delta outbreak”.
“These new cases present some concern, particularly the truck driver, who stayed at multiple temporary accommodation sites, his case presents some very concerning features,” he said.
“The truck driver’s situation of spending a long time in the community while ­infectious, the likelihood of a high number of close contacts means this must be taken very seriously.
“There are a number of factors which would convince me a lockdown would become unavoidable including a high number of exposure sites and close contacts, as well as unlinked or mystery cases.” Visitors have been restricted at aged-care facilities, hospitals, prisons and disability services facilities in the Brisbane and the Moreton Bay local government areas.
And just days after mask restrictions eased, people in those two LGAs are now required to wear them at all times while inside, including sitting down. Masks do not need to be worn when eating and drinking.
Premier Annastacia Palaszczuk also announced unvaccinated freight workers would be banned from entering Queensland from October 15. With seven Covid-positive truckies entering Queensland since August 24 – including Tuesday’s case – Ms Palaszczuk declared all drivers must have at least one vaccination by October 15 or they will not be allowed in. Drivers must then have received or have a booking for their second dose by November 15.
Under the new mandate, drivers must receive a negative test seven days before ­entering Queensland – removing the requirement for a test within 72 hours. The state has already established a roadside vaccination facility at John Flynn Private Hospital at Tugun and will add a second clinic at Goondiwindi Showgrounds from 6am to 10pm each day.
Transport Workers’ Union national secretary Michael Kaine backed the move, but said it was vital the roadside hubs were effective.
Queenslanders have again been urged to get vaccinated with the mass hub at Boondall in Brisbane’s north now accepting daily walk-ins.
Dr Young said she was still waiting to see specific Doherty Institute modelling before making border decisions.
It comes after Ms Palaszczuk called on Prime Minister Scott Morrison to release “revised Doherty modelling” ahead of Friday’s national cabinet, which she said she needed before making decisions. It’s understood national cabinet has been advised they can expect to see three other pieces of modelling from ­Doherty. Mr Morrison’s office said Ms Palaszczuk already had modelling around how cases would grow if the ­country opened up amid interstate outbreaks.
South East’s mystery outbreak CASE 1 Female traveller from overseas tested positive five days after leaving hotel quarantine. She travelled from Delhi to Timor-Leste and tested negative three times while in quarantine. Authorities are determining whether the case is light shedding or a new case.
CASES 2-3 Male from Eatons Hill who works at an aviation training site. It’s not known where the man contracted the virus, but he’s likely had contact with international pilots or staff. His wife has also tested positive. Their child has so far tested negative.
CASE 4 Male truck driver. The man was unknowingly infectious in the community for eight days. He stayed at the Metropolitan in Spring Hill, The Royal Albert in Spring Hill and the Adalong Guesthouse in South Brisbane.
EXPOSURE SITES THU, SEP 23: Mother Duck Childcare & Kindergarten Eatons Hill, 7.25am-8am Casual contact FRI, SEP 24: McDonald’s Albany Creek Drive-Thru, 5.05am-5.10am Low-risk contact Seats ‘R’ Us, Ipswich Rd, Rocklea, 11.15am-11.45am Close contact Freedom Furniture, Zillmere Rd, Aspley, 4.40pm-5pm Casual contact Adalong Student Guesthouse, 12.45pm-11.59pm Close contact Woolworths, Southpoint Metro, 2.30pm-3.45pm Casual contact SAT, SEP 25: Adalong Student Guesthouse, 12am-11.59pm Close contact Woolworths, Southpoint Metro, 1.20pm-2pm Casual contact SUN, SEP 26: Adalong Student Guesthouse, 12am-11.59pm Close contact McDonald’s South Bank, 11.15pm-11.50pm Close contact Mater Public Hospital, South Brisbane, Emergency Department, including outside ambulance bay area, 7.30pm-10.50pm Casual contact Adalong Student Guesthouse, 12am-11.59pm Close contact MON , SEP 27: Adalong Student Guesthouse, 12am-11.59pm Close contact Locations listed previously: FRI, SEP 17 Qantas flight QF516 Sydney to Brisbane, 10.06am-11.12am Close contact Brisbane Airport Domestic Terminal, 11.25am-12.57pm Low-risk contact Jetstar flight JQ484 Newcastle to Brisbane, 3.54pm-4.45pm Close contact Brisbane Airport Domestic Terminal, various locations, 3pm-9pm, Casual, close and low-risk contacts

Full text: SOUTH East Queensland is on the brink of another lockdown as the list of exposure sites from two mystery outbreaks grows and authorities warn a spike in cases could force swift action.
Tough mask mandates have already been reinstated in Brisbane and Moreton Bay in response to an unvaccinated truck driver testing positive after he was infectious in the community for eight days, and a vaccinated aviation worker also contracting the virus.
Chief health officer Dr Jeannette Young said “large numbers” of cases in the coming days could trigger a lockdown – the first since July 31 when six community cases were deemed enough to warrant stay-at-home orders.
“Of course, I always consider a lockdown, and then I work through what we need to do, at this stage I do not think a lockdown is warranted, that could change,” she said.
“I do have a reasonable level of concern. I’m really, really, very comforted by the fact that people do know how to respond and respond very, very quickly.” Infectious disease expert Paul Griffin – who investigated the Prince Charles Hospital outbreak – said he would be convinced a lockdown was “unavoidable” if there were a high number of exposure sites and close contacts, plus more unlinked or mystery cases.
On Tuesday night, more than a dozen exposure sites were listed on Queensland Health’s website, including the Adalong Guesthouse where the truckie stayed while infectious along with 25 other people, who were bussed out of the accommodation about 6pm Tuesday.
The fresh scare was sparked late Monday night when Queensland Health revealed a man who works for an aviation training site tested positive – despite not travelling interstate or overseas – and had been in the community, including at a childcare centre. Hours later, it emerged his wife had also tested positive, but authorities were more worried about an unrelated truck driver who stayed at three locations in Brisbane, including the guesthouse where bathrooms are shared.
Dr Young said it was not known how the truckie or the aviation worker contracted the virus, but she said the aviation worker likely had contact with international pilots through his job.
A returned traveller from Timor-Leste also tested positive five days after completing her 14 days in hotel quarantine, but authorities are looking at whether this could be “light shedding”, as opposed to being a new case.
Dr Griffin said Queenslanders could not assume our run of luck would continue, especially as it is one of the lowest vaccinated states in the country so “most susceptible to a delta outbreak”.
“These new cases present some concern, particularly the truck driver, who stayed at multiple temporary accommodation sites, his case presents some very concerning features,” he said.
“The truck driver’s situation of spending a long time in the community while ­infectious, the likelihood of a high number of close contacts means this must be taken very seriously.
“There are a number of factors which would convince me a lockdown would become unavoidable including a high number of exposure sites and close contacts, as well as unlinked or mystery cases.” Visitors have been restricted at aged-care facilities, hospitals, prisons and disability services facilities in the Brisbane and the Moreton Bay local government areas.
And just days after mask restrictions eased, people in those two LGAs are now required to wear them at all times while inside, including sitting down. Masks do not need to be worn when eating and drinking.
Premier Annastacia Palaszczuk also announced unvaccinated freight workers would be banned from entering Queensland from October 15. With seven Covid-positive truckies entering Queensland since August 24 – including Tuesday’s case – Ms Palaszczuk declared all drivers must have at least one vaccination by October 15 or they will not be allowed in. Drivers must then have received or have a booking for their second dose by November 15.
Under the new mandate, drivers must receive a negative test seven days before ­entering Queensland – removing the requirement for a test within 72 hours. The state has already established a roadside vaccination facility at John Flynn Private Hospital at Tugun and will add a second clinic at Goondiwindi Showgrounds from 6am to 10pm each day.
Transport Workers’ Union national secretary Michael Kaine backed the move, but said it was vital the roadside hubs were effective.
Queenslanders have again been urged to get vaccinated with the mass hub at Boondall in Brisbane’s north now accepting daily walk-ins.
Dr Young said she was still waiting to see specific Doherty Institute modelling before making border decisions.
It comes after Ms Palaszczuk called on Prime Minister Scott Morrison to release “revised Doherty modelling” ahead of Friday’s national cabinet, which she said she needed before making decisions. It’s understood national cabinet has been advised they can expect to see three other pieces of modelling from ­Doherty. Mr Morrison’s office said Ms Palaszczuk already had modelling around how cases would grow if the ­country opened up amid interstate outbreaks.
South East’s mystery outbreak CASE 1 Female traveller from overseas tested positive five days after leaving hotel quarantine. She travelled from Delhi to Timor-Leste and tested negative three times while in quarantine. Authorities are determining whether the case is light shedding or a new case.
CASES 2-3 Male from Eatons Hill who works at an aviation training site. It’s not known where the man contracted the virus, but he’s likely had contact with international pilots or staff. His wife has also tested positive. Their child has so far tested negative.

Epidemiologists reveal when Victoria’s case numbers peak

Full text: When will Victoria’s case numbers peak? Leading epidemiologists believe Victoria could hit 2000 reported cases per day by mid-October before numbers plateau or drop.
Deakin University epidemiology chair Professor Catherine Bennett estimated a higher spike and said the state could reach 3000 cases per day in four weeks’ time.
What do the numbers tell us about the outbreaks in Victoria vs NSW Victoria’s Reff number, the figure that indicates how many people are being infected by each positive case on average, has dropped steadily over the past week and now sits at 1.25.
Experts warn the state may experience a rise in cases following recent protests across Melbourne.
Former World Health Organisation epidemiologist Professor Adrian Esterman said it was still difficult to predict whether Victoria’s cases would peak and fall in the same way as NSW.
Prof Bennett said cases were still trending downwards overall.
What will happen with hospitals and ICU? Experts say Victorians’ chances of being admitted to hospital are smaller than during the second wave, when four out of every 100 people with Covid were in intensive care.
Infectious diseases physician Professor Peter Collignon said Victoria should follow NSW, with case numbers increasing without a large spike in the number of people in hospital or on ventilators.
Prof Bennett said that in relative terms, Victoria had more people in intensive care but people were less likely to be hospitalised than in NSW.
How is Victoria performing against the state’s modelling? Prof Collignon said the prediction that Victoria would reach 1400-2900 cases between October 19-31 was “a bit too pessimistic” because it did not account for improved vaccination across hot spots and warmer weather.
But Prof Esterman said the Burnet modelling provided a “clear warning” against easing restrictions too soon.
National – 2021 – Covid Vaccination Stats

Why did NSW cases start to fall and stabilise? Cases began to drop in NSW nearly three weeks ago when about 42 per cent of the state’s eligible adult population had received both doses of a vaccine.
Prof Bennet said Victoria was on track for a similar drop in cases but NSW had turned the corner sooner because they began targeting hotspots with vaccination efforts earlier.
Prof Collignon said Victoria was already seeing vaccines drive down case numbers.

Full text: Unvaccinated people will be permitted to re-enter the economy in the lead-up to Christmas, with the state’s crisis cabinet expected to set a date for their return participation instead of indexing it to a vaccination benchmark.
Officials are now working on three “road maps” for NSW’s exit from lockdown, including for unvaccinated residents, although ­discussions remain ongoing as to how the state will accommodate them and when this should occur.
The first road map is expected to take effect on October 11 once the state reaches its first benchmark of 70 per cent vaccination coverage; this will see a significant easing of restrictions applying to restaurants, retailers and other industry groups, allowing them to recommence trade.
A second plan will ease restrictions further once 80 per cent coverage is achieved; it is mooted to take effect from October 25, according to an official familiar with the matter, who said the third plan for unvaccinated residents remained a work in progress.
The NSW crisis cabinet discussed unvaccinated residents on Friday and reached a consensus that they should be permitted to participate in the economy later this year, most likely before Christmas, the official said. This would coincide with vaccination rates reaching statewide double-dosage targets of 90 per cent, they added.
Central to discussions was the need to minimise the impact of a predicted jump in Covid-19 caseloads, which are forecast to overrun the health system in coming weeks and potentially overwhelm intensive care units.
On Sunday, the state had 961 fresh cases of the virus in the 24 hours to 8pm on Saturday and nine deaths among people in their 40s, 60s, 70s and 80s, eight of whom were unvaccinated; the ninth had one vaccine dose.
Modelling by the Burnet Institute for the NSW government during late August predicted a surge in hospitalisations during the latter half of October and first two weeks of November.
On the day the modelling was released – September 6 – 177 people were in ICUs receiving treatment for Covid-19. The institute’s forecasts predicted ICU admissions peaking at 560 Covid-19 cases, most likely during November, at which time they would overwhelm the hospital system.
Figures released on Sunday by NSW Health showed 1146 Covid-19 patients were being treated in hospital, with 222 people in intensive care.
At a press briefing on Sunday, Premier Gladys Berejiklian spoke optimistically about the outlook for NSW over coming months but conceded case numbers would spike as restrictions were eased.
She said residents considering intrastate travel during November and December could be assured their plans would not need to be put in jeopardy by the pandemic response, although some regions could return to lockdown if health officials deemed it necessary.
“It is safe to book for Christmas,” she said. “Definitely look at November as a month when you can start planning a trip that you may not have been able to have within NSW for a very long time. Talks are continuing in relation to NSW regions with lower-than-expected vaccination rates, amid calls from some MPs to restrict travel to those areas until coverage has improved. The Premier said her preference was that the entire state open at the same time.

Staffing tight as hospitals brace for hit

Full text: Nurses treating COVID-19 patients at one of western Sydney's busiest hospitals say staffing levels are unsafe, in a dispute that will continue to be heard by the NSW Industrial Relations Commission later this month.
The NSW Nurses and Midwives Association appeared before the commission on Thursday after filing a dispute with Western Sydney Local Health District over staffing at Westmead Hospital's COVID-19 ward.
While the union agreed the workload monitoring system used to staff hospitals, known as "nursing hours per patient day", was being met, it said this was a minimum level and other hospitals were using higher ratios to staff their wards.
The union's public health manager Michael Whaites said caring for suspected or positive COVID-19 patients was a demanding job and the hospital was relying heavily on "assistants in nursing" to staff wards.
"Our members have highlighted repeated incidences of Code Blue [medical emergency] episodes occurring on COVID-19 wards, often with staffing ratios of one registered nurse to seven patients, or one [registered nurse] and one assistant in nursing caring for eight patients," Mr Whaites said. "We're aware other major hospitals provide staffing ratios on their COVID-19 wards ranging from 1:2 patients and 1:3 patients, and staffing is based on bed numbers, rather than occupancy levels."
Mr Whaites said there was concern about "possible compromised care" for COVID-19 patients, who have higher needs and can deteriorate rapidly.
A Western Sydney Local Health District spokesperson did not answer questions directly about staff to patient ratios and the use of assistants in nursing in place of registered nurses.
"In order to provide safe and high quality care to our patients and protect staff wellbeing, our models have evolved as the COVID-19 pandemic has progressed," the spokesperson said.
"Staffing is frequently monitored and we continue to adapt in response to patient demand.
"[District] management and staff will continue to work together to ensure the safety of patients and our staff. It is our utmost priority."
NSW reported 935 new local coronavirus cases yesterday, the state's lowest daily figure since August 27. However, Premier Gladys Berejiklian said government and health officials were not ready to make the call that case numbers had passed their peak.
"You never know with COVID; it's insidious," she said, noting superspreading events could cause the state "easily to go back to those 1500 numbers we were seeing a couple of weeks ago".
Modelling by the Burnet Institute released last month indicated the worst impact of the pandemic on the state's hospital system was set to be seen in October.
The Premier said that although hospitalisations were trending slightly below what was predicted, the number of people in intensive care continued to be above projected rates. There were 1207 COVID-19 cases admitted to hospital yesterday.Ms Berejiklian stressed the plan that health experts had devised for the state's hospital system to survive the wave of hospitalisations depended on the system being "technically overwhelmed in some ways" and would result in the system operating in a way it had not seen before, including prioritising space in hospitals for COVID wards and intensive care units.

Road map gives hope and pause for thought

Full text: If there is one word to describe Victoria's new road map out of lockdown 6.0 it would be cautious. That should hardly surprise anyone. For the past 18 months, at almost every turn, when a balance needed to be found between taking conservative steps out of lockdown or going faster, and taking more risk, Premier Daniel Andrews has chosen the path of caution.
This approach has frustrated many: parents wanting to get their children back to school, businesses wanting to open their doors, families wanting to come together. And, as the lockdowns have multiplied, the frustration has grown. Lockdown fatigue has set in.
The new road map does give some light at the end of a long tunnel but, as the Burnet Institute modelling makes clear, there are some tough days ahead for the health system and for those who find themselves needing care.
Deaths from the Delta variant are expected to peak at around 2200 in January. On Sunday, the toll stood at 831. That is sobering. And it's not just the death toll that is a red flag. According to the modelling, even without any easing of restrictions, there is some risk of the health system being overwhelmed.
That means anyone who wants to go to hospital, for whatever reason, will face a system in crisis. It's a dire situation that has played out in many countries and has often been the heartbreaking underbelly of what it really means to "learn to live" with COVID-19.
The positive side of the road map is that, particularly for those fully vaccinated, it will equate to a gradual falling away of the restrictions that have shaped so much of our lives. It will be an enormous relief to many to return to some form of normality and underlines how crucial it is for Victorians to get vaccinated now.
The speed at which we come out of lockdown is sure to be much debated. Hardly surprising, but compared to New South Wales, except for students returning to face-to-face learning, the Victorian government has set a slower pace to opening up. At the 70 per cent double-dose target, a Sydney pub or restaurant will be allowed to reopen with a limited number of fully vaccinated people inside and outside. At a similar venue in Melbourne, patrons will only be allowed outdoors.
Such differences go to the broader issue that, for all the talk by political leaders of following the health advice, that advice has not been uniform. And it's the Premier and his or her senior team of ministers and advisers that must weigh up the competing interests to make a final judgment on the way forward. These are difficult calculations.
As Victoria goes through the next fraught stage of this pandemic, it will require more than ever a pact between the government and the community that is built on trust and a judgment of competence. No doubt, that pact has frayed in recent times. As the pressure has built on families, individuals and businesses, so the fractures within the community have become more evident.
While there may be a best-case scenario as we navigate the next few months, few will come away unscathed. When the pandemic first struck, few could have imagined the travails ahead. This new road map out of lockdown at least gives us a better picture of what to expect in coming months. It should give us all pause for thought, too. Like never before, all of our actions have consequences.

Victoria hanging on vaccinations

Full text: VICTORIANS will still be living under tough restrictions even after 80 per cent of the state is fully vaccinated.
The state’s freedom plan has been dubbed a “road map of roadblocks”, with Melbourne’s lockdown to continue until at least October 26 but some restrictions flagged to ease earlier in regional areas.
Under the long-awaited plan, unveiled by Premier Daniel Andrews on Sunday, Victoria will only begin to open gradually once restrictions in metropolitan Melbourne and regional Victoria align at 80 per cent vaccination coverage – expected to be November 5.
And in a further blow, people in NSW will be able to visit family and friends in their homes at 70 per cent double dose, while Victorians must reach 80 per cent to do so. Mr Andrews insisted his plan was about opening the state up.
“Make no mistake, we are opening up … and there will be no turning back,” he said.
“We have got to normalise this, we have got to pass through and beyond this pandemic. We cannot permanently suppress this virus.” The Burnet Institute modelling that drove the road map predicted the state’s case numbers would peak at 4500 on December 15, with Covid-related deaths to hit 2200 by January. Mr Andrews said a “catastrophic” number of people would become very ill if the state opened too soon.
“These are sobering numbers,” he said. “The notion of opening this place up very quickly at 70 per cent or 60 per cent, or today, simply cannot be done.” NSW used the same modelling but allowed more freedoms at 70 per cent, as Victoria waits to reach 80 per cent.
Sydney’s Everest horse race will be run in front of up to 5000 fans, while Victoria’s spring racing carnival is not guaranteed a crowd, despite Victoria on Sunday recording 507 new Covid-19 cases and one death, while NSW had 1083 cases and 13 deaths.
Victorian Chamber of Commerce and Industry chief executive Paul Guerra questioned the “fundamentally different” plan for each state.
“Every Victorian business was looking for a path to prosperity but what we got delivered was a road map of roadblocks,” Mr Guerra said. Chief health officer Professor Brett Sutton said the map provided a “tightrope between ensuring our health system is not overwhelmed (and protecting) us from those other harms … from lockdown”.

CREDLIN CALLS IT RIGHT ON GLADYS

Full text: Many journalists reporting on Covid-19 in Australia apply different standards to different premiers, depending on the party in government.
It’s not about former Labor prime minister Kevin Rudd’s Twitter obsession with the idea News Corp runs a protection racket for the Berejiklian Coalition government in NSW. Quite the reverse actually.
Look how Berejiklian was slammed by the ABC, the Nine tabloids, Guardian Australia and news.com.au when she said on September 10 that she would no longer be attending all daily 11am Covid-19 press conferences. Patricia Karvelas on RN Drive spoke for many when interviewing former health bureaucrat Jane Halton that night: “Full disclosure. I have been very critical of that (decision). It’s a very important accountability measure for journalists, particularly as cases are rising.” Yet I have seen and heard little comment from journalists about Victorian Premier Daniel Andrews no longer attending daily pressers more than about half the time. Victoria’s daily briefings are often led by state Health Minister Martin Foley.
Berejiklian said she had other work to do. Fair enough, but just before a forecast peak in infections it looked to some like she was dodging scrutiny. NSW has in fact continued daily live press conferences rather than the health video Berejiklian had flagged. The briefings have been fronted by health officials and Health Minister Brad Hazzard. Yet Berejiklian did front about half of last week’s pressers.
Some Victorian reporters believe Andrews is trying to distance himself from Covid and lockdowns in the lead-up to the November 2022 state election. Whatever the strategy, he is being judged less harshly than Berejiklian for taking a similar approach.
Worse has been the media pile-on suggesting Berejiklian has let the case numbers in NSW get out of control. The numbers are not out of control – lockdowns are working and so is vaccination. There was every sign last week that NSW cases had peaked, but the premier was too cautious to claim it.
Warnings from Sydney University modelling, published by the ABC on August 26, of 6000 NSW cases a day by early October have never looked like materialising. The same modelling claimed NSW would face 40,000 cases a day when lockdown restrictions are lifted.
Any outlandish prediction of failure in NSW always gets a run in some parts of the media. In fact Berejiklian really is leading the way for Australia, her hand forced by the infectiousness of the Delta variant. As she told Peta Credlin on Wednesday night on Sky News, it was no surprise Delta took off first in Sydney given the city took more returning travellers than all the other states combined.
Yet many journalists, and particularly those at the ABC with safe, government-guaranteed pay packets, criticised the NSW approach throughout the first month of the present outbreak. They were sure Berejiklian was not locking down hard enough and had not locked down sooner.
She had tried to confine the lockdown to the city’s CBD, eastern and southern suburbs, which were the first areas affected when the virus was spread by an unvaccinated airport driver. The same strategy had worked in January on Sydney’s northern beaches. But the increased infectiousness of Delta forced Berejiklian to lock down all of Greater Sydney, the Blue Mountains, the Illawarra and the Central Coast on June 26.
Too many reporters in the weeks after that decision eagerly repeated Andrews’ self-serving lines about Sydney needing a Melbourne-style “ring of steel”. Andrews knew, these reporters believed, because his government had been the only one in the world to have defeated Delta during the state’s fifth outbreak. Except that may not be correct.
As Credlin said last week, that outbreak was largely the Kappa variant, with few Delta cases. Given Victoria’s sixth lockdown came on August 5 and lockdown five ended on July 27 it seems likely there were undetected Delta cases in the community at the end of the fifth lockdown, and Victoria had probably not “defeated Delta”.
That sort of free pass for a Labor leader is par for the course in much of the media these days. More surprising has been the tick given to Andrews for now taking the same line as NSW on vaccination being the way out of lockdown. Victoria has learned NSW was correct when Berejiklian said lockdowns and contact tracing could not defeat a variant twice as infectious as previous strains.
When Berejiklian in late July said her focus was moving from case numbers to vaccination, many at the ABC, led by health editor Norman Swan on News Breakfast on August 3, suggested she was planning a dangerous experiment on her citizens. Yet there was no such criticism about Andrews when he – correctly in my view – made the same vaccine calculation a few weeks later.
Swan was wrong. Last Tuesday on ABC’s 7.30 he reported on the opening up of Denmark at 74 per cent full vaccination. Turns out NSW was not conducting a world-first experiment. Denmark has been doing what Berejiklian plans to. Imagine that: a state health department with experts who know what’s happening in the rest of the world.
More worrying has been the failure until last week of much of the media to notice Victoria’s outbreak has been growing faster than the spread in NSW. Earlier this month, Credlin on Sky News and in her column in the News Corp Sunday newspapers nailed the issue.
Said Credlin last week of her September 3 story: “I looked at the two data sets out of day 30. What struck me was that Victoria’s new cases at 208 were over double where NSW was (on day 30) at 97.” Testing on day 30 in NSW was at 77,587 compared with 48,572 in Victoria. “The numbers for day 37 got worse in comparative terms,” Credlin said. “In NSW, Day 37 … saw 136 cases, 86,620 tests. In Victoria … new cases were 334 (so now almost triple), and half the tests of NSW at 42,998. Worse still were the vaccination rates – NSW 124,645 (day 37), 85,605 Victoria.” By last Friday, Victoria’s relative performance was deteriorating further. New cases in Victoria on day 44 new totalled 511, compared with 172 on day 44 in NSW. Equivalent day 44 testing rates stood at 95,446 (NSW) and 55,476 (Vic).
“The actual gap (between outbreak numbers) has significantly widened between days 30, 37 and 44,” Credlin said on Friday.
The Nine papers picked up the Victorian angle in a piece by Caitlin Fitzsimmons on September 12. Fran Kelly followed on RN Breakfast the next day, interviewing Victorian epidemiologist Tony Blakely. Yet The Age back on August 25 had actually reported Deakin University epidemiologist Catherine Bennett and University of South Australia’s Adrian Esterman saying Victoria’s virus reproduction rate was higher than that in NSW.
Many journalists who bag Berejiklian, especially on Twitter, continue to operate as if the only KPI a premier should meet is Covid zero. They are about to learn Berejiklian is right. We need to learn to live with the virus, and vaccination is the pathway. Even Andrews has seen the light. Unless WA and Queensland plan to keep their borders closed forever, their health systems are going to have to deal with outbreaks when NSW and Victoria open and international travel resumes.

Full text: It was Daniel Andrews’s big day out but Scott Morrison won’t like the detail in the road map modelling.
It shows anywhere between 1455 and 3152 virus deaths in Victoria in the last half of the year and that number potentially soaring by the end of January 31.
These estimates exclude the 820 who died in Victoria in the 2020 second wave. Let’s assume the Burnet Institute’s most conservative estimate of 1455 fatalities by December 31 is right rather than the more pessimistic 3152.
Either way, you would still have a lot of people checking out two years into a pandemic that has witnessed mixed policy responses federally and from the states.
Remember, a federal election is due by May 2022 and the last thing the Prime Minister needs is to saddle up for a campaign lined with coffins.
While Morrison will like the fact Victoria is welded on to opening up, he will be quietly hoping the Burnet Institute’s case and fatality numbers are wildly inflated.
Which they may prove to be.
Although the Burnet numbers overshadowed his road map launch, the Victorian Premier had a Road to Damascus moment on Sunday.
Not only is he now sold on progressively ending the lockdown, he’s denying he ever was a Covid-zero zealot.
Andrews has always presented as a member of the Covid-zero club even if he had his own interpretation of what that meant.
The important development to start the week is that even suppressing the virus to nominal numbers is out of the question.
This is, and has been for a while, a commonsense position.
It left Andrews insisting: “We are opening this place up.” This is a big step forward from where the Victorian government has been throughout the pandemic and Andrews was emphatic in his warnings to the unvaccinated.
Indeed, he is blunt about the prospects of those who avoid the vaccine, making clear that failing to get the jabs will expose people to the strong possibility of illness.
Only 1 per cent of people in hospital in Victoria with the virus is fully vaccinated, the rest having no protection or just the one dose.
By vowing to open up, Andrews has given the Victorian community an opportunity to breathe and plan for the future.
It is not too much to say that the community has been choking under the weight of hundreds of days of lockdowns, which lost their sheen roughly five days in.
The road map, while not binding, offers millions of people the opportunity to dream of a largely normal Christmas.
We will see, of course … and we will remind the Burnet Institute if it has got things right or wrong.
The slow pace of reopening has outraged the hospitality sectors and there will be many others who will feel the same way.
You can’t blame businesses for wanting a decent run at Christmas or for being victim of the pandemic’s whims. Unfortunately, like everywhere else in the world, it is Delta that has won.

Full text: VICTORIANS will still live under tough restrictions even after 80 per cent of the state is fully vaccinated.
The state’s plan has been dubbed a “road map of roadblocks”, with Melbourne’s lockdown to continue for another five weeks to October 26, when 70 per cent of Victorians aged 16 and over are fully vaccinated, taking Melbourne’s time in hard lockdown to a world record 267 days since the start of the pandemic.
Daniel Andrews on Sunday unveiled the long-awaited plan to freedom, which will delay the reopening of classrooms for most students, force retailers to operate outdoors and limit pubs and cafes to “restrictive” customer caps.
The state will only begin to open gradually once restrictions in metropolitan Melbourne and regional Victoria align at 80 per cent vaccination coverage – expected to be November 5. And in a further blow, people in NSW will be able to visit family and friends in their home at 70 per cent double dose, while Victorians will have to reach 80 per cent to do the same.
Most freedoms will only be available to people who are fully vaccinated and those without the jab will face much tougher restrictions into the foreseeable future.
Despite a widespread backlash against his overly-cautious road map, the Premier insisted his plan was about opening the state up and hoped homes could have as many 30 visitors in time for Christmas.
“Make no mistake, we are opening up, no doubt about that, and there will be no turning back,” he said.
“We have got to normalise this, we have got to pass through and beyond this pandemic. We cannot permanently suppress this virus.” The road map didn’t detail when masks could be removed indoors or whether packed crowds could return for the Boxing Day Test.
The Burnet Institute modelling – which drove the road map – predicted the state’s case numbers would peak at 4500 on December 15, with total Covid-19 related deaths to reach 2200 by January.
Mr Andrews said a “catastrophic” number of people would become very ill if the state opened too soon.
“These are sobering numbers,” he said. “The notion of opening this place up very quickly at 70 per cent or 60 per cent, or today, simply cannot be done.” NSW used the same modelling but allowed more freedoms at 70 per cent, while Victoria waits to reach 80 per cent. Sydney’s Everest race will be in front of up to 5000 fans, while the Spring Racing Carnival is not guaranteed a crowd, despite Victoria on Sunday recording 507 new Covid-19 cases and one death, while NSW had 1083 cases and 13 deaths.
Lord Mayor Sally Capp said Victorian traders would be “looking longingly” at the “more generous freedoms” given to NSW, while opposition leader Matthew Guy said the measures appeared to be “too harsh for too long”.
“To have no real path back in any meaningful time … is unfathomable for many families in this state,” Mr Guy said.
Victorian Chamber of Commerce and Industry chief executive Paul Guerra questioned the “fundamentally different” plan for each state.
“Every Victorian business was looking for a path to prosperity but what we got delivered was a road map of roadblocks,” Mr Guerra said.
“We need a path out of this and today’s announcement has not given the clarity, the certainty or the hope we need to get out of the current situation.” A supercharged vaccination program would be the only way to end lockdown early, but the Premier warned Australia’s Pfizer supply was “uncertain” next month.
Victorian nurses’ union boss Lisa Fitzpatrick welcomed the road map. “We are reassured the road map can be paused to prevent Covid patients overwhelming our health system and our workforce so that we are not making impossible decisions about who gets a hospital bed,” she said.
Chief health officer Professor Brett Sutton said the road map provided an “awful but balanced tightrope” between “ensuring our health system is not overwhelmed (and protecting) us from those other harms that come from lockdown”.
Melbourne theatre producer and artist Katie Rowe said her sector faced a more uncertain future. “I think it won’t be until 2022 when things properly start, which is devastating,” she said.

Why we have to get to 90 per cent

Full text: EXPERTS warn we must push on to a 90 per cent vaccination rate for Covid-19 and not settle for 70 and 80 per cent targets set out in the national plan.
Doherty Institute modelling shows that, even with 80 per cent of the eligible population fully vaccinated, there will still be an estimated 9669 hospital admissions, 2075 in ICU and 1281 deaths, including 29 children, in the first six months out of lockdown with established community transmission of the Delta strain.
Additional, updated modelling shows the importance of maintaining track, trace isolation and quarantine (TTIQ).
With optimal “gold standard” TTIQ at 80 per cent vaccination, deaths are predicted to drop back substantially, with zero deaths in children.
Professor Terry Nolan, paediatrician and head of the Vaccine and Immunisation Research Group at the Doherty Institute, said we needed to aim higher than 80 per cent.
“People, including governments, need to raise their ­ambitions. For children we have got used to aiming for 95 per cent (vaccination rate for all vaccines). Ninety per cent is what the real target should be; 80 per cent is an artificial number in the sense it is the minimum threshold, in all the assumptions, to have some sort of reasonably tolerable impact on the health system and the number of deaths that will ­appear on the front pages of the newspapers,” he said.
“The NSW Premier (Gladys Berejiklian) has started to introduce the 90 per cent words ... 80 per cent is a reasonable enough target but, given Delta, it’s not going to be enough.
“When you remove the gloss, even at 80 per cent you are still just scraping the bar without having very severe public health measures.
“And there is a big caveat that says this assumption only works if you have contract track and trace, isolation and quarantine and you cannot have that if the system is swamped with big numbers.
“We are talking hundreds, maybe thousands of deaths.” Professor Mary-Louise Mc­Laws, adviser to the World Health Organisation, said the Doherty model underestimates the worst-case scenario because it was modelled on the Alpha strain.
“The Doherty report has to be adjusted for what is happening now,” she said. “(At 80 per cent) the community needs to brace itself for more deaths, absolutely.” Children aged 12-15 have now been approved for vaccination as of last Monday. According to NSW Health there are currently five children aged under 18 in ICU, two of those under the age of nine.
“Why wouldn’t you vaccinate children who can be protected from a vaccinatable disease? We need to aim for 95 per cent,” she said.
A recent survey by the Australian National University found 94 per cent of over-18s were willing to get vaccinated. Your questions about vaccinations answered in our covid liftout inside

Disability advocates say jab rate must rise

Full text: Australians with disabilities could be placed at risk by plans to ease coronavirus restrictions in coming months unless the rate of vaccination in the sector rises significantly, advocates warn.
People with Disability Australia (PWDA), along with other disability organisations, say they are still waiting for a clear plan and targets to ensure priority groups are vaccinated - including people with disability and chronic medical conditions - before plans to open up are implemented.
Only 38 per cent of eligible National Disability Insurance Scheme participants nationwide have had two doses. About 56.4 per cent have received one dose.
For NDIS participants in shared residential accommodation, 72.2 per cent have received one dose and 61.7 per cent have received two doses.
Medical evidence suggests people with disabilities are more likely to become severely unwell or die from COVID-19.
A plea from the peak organisation for people with disabilities follows a coalition of disability representative organisation's 11-point plan last month, calling for disabled and other clinically vulnerable groups to be prioritised.
"We are waiting for a plan, for double-vaccination twin-targets, for access to and adequate supply of vaccines and for certainty that we will be safe," PWDA president Samantha Connor said.
The sector has faced challenges to large-scale vaccination such as differing age groups, capacity and functioning, and the additional time needed to ensure informed consent or appropriate decision-making for individuals before vaccine delivery.
More than 115,000 of the 450,000 NDIS participants have been vaccinated since early June, with all NDIS participants aged over 16 years and their carers made eligible for the COVID-19 vaccine in June.
Opposition NDIS spokesman Bill Shorten said the Morrison government had "as little as eight weeks" to vaccinate all Australians living with disabilities. He said Labor did not want any delays to the lockdowns ending, so health authorities must accelerate the vaccine rollout to people with disabilities.
"Australia is predicted to open as early as November as the nation's two most populous states, NSW and Victoria, race to get their residents fully vaccinated," Mr Shorten said. "Australians living with disabilities are terrified they will get sick or die if they are not vaccinated by the time the nation reaches the Doherty Institute modelling targets the government is using to open the nation."

Why this Delta outbreak got away

Full text: When Victoria's final doughnut day was announced on August 4, the outbreak that would end the state's "COVID zero" ambitions had already taken hold. A passenger likely infected with the virus had boarded the 412 bus from West Footscray Station in the pre-dawn gloom. Further west, the infection was already spreading at an indoor shopping mall in Caroline Springs.
So, how did the virus get here? One possibility is that the infections were a consequence of a new introduction of the Delta strain with NSW origins, which took root within just a few weeks, The Sunday Age can reveal.
Dr Norelle Sherry, a genomics expert with the Doherty Institute, said analysis of samples indicated there was "most likely" another introduction of the virus, separate to older outbreaks.
"Then from there, there was this kind of slow explosion of cases," she said. "It's all been transmitted locally over a fairly short period of time."
Another theory is that it is not a new source of infection, but a subtle change in genomics that occurred locally as the virus moved from one person to the next, potentially stemming back to an illegal visit to Coles in early July by someone meant to be isolating.
Either way, each theory helps explain why the current outbreak became the one that got away. Given the infectious variant has proven almost uncontrollable given any head start, experts say an element of good fortune is always required to bring any Delta outbreak to heel.
Meanwhile, epidemiologists say Victoria could be within weeks of turning the third wave around, if vaccinations continue to increase and if most continue to abide by COVID restrictions. The alternative could be daily cases in their thousands.
Movement trends show the resolve of Victorians to stay at home is waning, and the public is being urged to find more of what it has given after more than 220 days of lockdown to keep increasing case numbers in check.
"It's either fear or frustration that people have at the moment," said Professor Catherine Bennett. "I think we have to somehow meld that fear and frustration into just bloody minded determination."
Victoria's final doughnut day - August4 - started with the news that the state had reported its first day of no locally acquired cases since July 12. But the celebrations didn't last 24 hours, interrupted by the announcement of a positive case in a teacher at Al-Taqwa College in Melbourne's west.
Of most concern, the source of her infection wasn't clear and, by the next day, Victoria was in lockdown again, after more mystery cases appeared, including a factory worker living in Maribyrnong, who had no obvious links to the school teacher.
Since then, the outbreak has continued to bubble away in the west and taken hold in the northern suburbs, where it has been exploiting key known vulnerabilities to the virus: lower levels of vaccination, a younger and more mobile population, bigger families and people with jobs that mean they cannot stay at home.
More than 70 per cent of yesterday's 450 cases were recorded in this area of the city. In Hume, where there were 166 daily cases reported, less than 48.2 per cent of people had received a single dose of vaccine as of last Sunday. In Moreland, where 88 daily cases were announced, 54.7 per cent of the population had received one dose.
The rates were well below the national average at the time, of just over 63 per cent.
"It is quite challenging for people who are less socio-economically advantaged who have to continue working in the community during a lockdown," said Associate Professor James Wood, a mathematician at UNSW's School of Public Health and Community Medicine.
Those who have been analysing movement data say there has been a moderate drop in compliance with public health orders, but they say this should not entirely be blamed for Victoria's inability to contain the outbreak.
Professor James McCaw, who has provided modelling to the federal government throughout the pandemic, said the level of compliance and restrictions in place now would have been enough to contain the outbreak for previous strains of coronavirus.
"I think this is one where we weren't lucky enough to notice it really early. And once there's a certain number of people in the community, Delta can be constrained, but actually getting rid [of it] is not impossible ... but it's very, very difficult [for a big diverse cities like Melbourne or Sydney]."
Analysis of movement trends by The Sunday Age shows there has been a moderate increase in lockdown movement when you compare Victoria's second wave to the third.
Movement for retail and recreation travel dipped 63 per cent below usual activity on August 9 last year - when Victoria recorded 394 cases. On August 29, when the state saw 92 infections, the same measure of movement was only down 51 per cent.
University of Melbourne scientific modeller Jason Thompson, who has tracked mobility and movement in Victoria throughout its lockdowns, estimates movement was higher by between 10 and 15 per cent in Victoria, compared to August last year.
But he said to blame the rapid spread on an increase in people moving around would be too simplistic. "This all comes down to things that are being raised across Australia about who's going to be left behind in this vaccination race," he said.
Western suburbs general practitioner Hanna El-Khoury said more than 50 of his patients had tested positive to coronavirus in the latest outbreak. He said while it may appear to an outsider that infections were escalating in the north and west due to people illegally mingling, the reality was different.
In the past three days, Dr El-Khoury has provided telehealth appointments to three families in Altona North, where there are almost 130 active cases. Each of the families had eight to 10 members who all tested positive to the virus while living under the same roof.
"That's 30 new cases in a day that when you look at it closely are just three families," he said. "And we are seeing this pattern every day."
Professor Bennett said the early signs were that the Delta outbreaks in NSW and Victoria could be controlled, aided by experienced contact tracing teams in both states.
But the head of epidemiology at Deakin University said the incubation period of Delta was two-days shorter than previous strains, causing the virus to skip ahead of officials.
"They were the two days we needed," she said.
The state's latest wave of infections started when Melbourne was further along with its vaccination rollout than Sydney - prompting a number of experts to predict that cases should peak below NSW, now reporting around 1500 cases each day.
"I'd be very surprised if the numbers in Melbourne got to the same level as we are seeing here in NSW," said Associate Professor Wood. "It might continue to rise for a little bit until over the next few weeks until Victoria catches up with its vaccine coverage."
Professor McCaw is also hopeful that Victoria could follow soon after, saying while the situation was still "highly uncertain", his team's estimates show there is a 75 per cent chance Victoria's wave could peak within the next three weeks.
The alternative is that numbers will continue to increase - meaning Victoria is heading into a crucial period that could determine if the worst will be soon over, or there will be escalating numbers and more sick young Victorians in hospital.
Victoria's reproduction rate - which estimates the average number of cases each person passes the virus on to - sits at about 1.5, and Professor Bennett said, while more vaccinations would bring that down, improved compliance could mean Victoria's third wave was flattened faster.
She said the infectiousness of the Delta strain meant it was now much harder to get away with little departures from public health orders, like having a maskless conversation outdoors.
"If everybody just held their breath for two weeks, did bigger shops less often; if everyone just pulled it in that little bit, it would work a little bit better," Professor Bennett said.
"It just might be that thing where we found that last bit of lockdown in us that will put us in a better position to never have a lockdown again."

Full text: The announcement of eased restrictions in Sydney for the fully vaccinated after the state reaches 70 per cent is welcome. It recognises that a differentiated approach to individual risk is available along the way to high vaccination coverage, and further incentivises vaccination. It should also assuage concerns about the risks posed by COVID transmission beyond 80 per cent vaccination coverage: there will be no "letting it rip".
There is a world of complexity and nuance between "letting it rip" and a blunt "one size fits all" approach to restrictions. This is the world Australian jurisdictions must inhabit to optimise public health - mental and social, as well physical. We need to grasp that moving into that world requires us to differentiate between the vaccinated and unvaccinated in the risk they pose.
The national plan for reopening, informed by the Doherty Institute modelling, was supposed to resolve intractable disagreement between Australia's governments about how we do it. It sought to broker a balance between well-founded concerns about the potential harms caused by COVID to human health, and the harms caused by restrictions: societal and psychological isolation, mental health consequences, fractures between communities and jurisdictions, and separation of families. However, rather than reconciling opposed camps, the plan has generated further polarisation. Various modelling has been used, often selectively, to shore up contrasting positions on the way forward, or the way out.
That the targets have generated so much heat is because they fail to account for what must be an ongoing conversation about nuanced strategies before reaching those targets, and long after. To be proportionate, restrictions on individual rights must account for a clear difference in the risk posed by the vaccinated and the unvaccinated. German courts, for instance, have forced governments to lift restrictions on the fully vaccinated and the recovered, following evidence that their contribution to community transmission is extremely low.
There is nothing magical about the targets of 70 and 80 per cent for full vaccination. They were to facilitate modelling, not mark a British-style "freedom day". Some basic principles in assessing risk underpin that modelling, and must hold as Australia proceeds. First, vaccine coverage is the bedrock. It can reduce the risk of infection (by 60 to 80 per cent) and hospitalisation (90 per cent or higher).
Second, outdoor settings represent a small, possibly minuscule, contribution to transmission. Even after 80 per cent coverage, we need to curtail transmission indoors - including with improved ventilation.
Third, even in settings with high vaccine coverage, there will be diverse outcomes for different populations. This will be of concern if uptake is lower among more vulnerable populations.
Finally, the approach to risk and easing must be consistent across the board - not just in spheres where there is popular or economic pressure. The latest NSW COVID surveillance report with data to August 21 showed that, in the prior four weeks, there were 10,242 local and 62 overseas cases, a ratio of 165 to one. The continued enforcement of hotel quarantine and low arrival caps - without differentiating between the vaccination status of arrivals - makes no sense. That such low arrival caps have been maintained for so long speaks to the lack of political agitation for the rights of stranded Australians rather than any compelling epidemiological justification. A complaint against Australia has been brought before the UN Human Rights Committee for a breach of the right to return home. An adverse decision seems increasingly likely.
International arrival caps into Sydney could be immediately increased several-fold, with home quarantine as for the thousands caught up in community exposures. Overseas cases would continue to be genomically sequenced to monitor for new variants. Vaccination status could also be used to lift mobility across borders, initially between NSW and Victoria where "returning to zero" is no longer possible. They are likely to adopt a less risk-averse approach than those maintaining zero transmission. We should be optimistic about vaccine uptake. We have attained 90 per cent first-dose coverage among Australians older than 70 and this is feasible among other cohorts. Australia should aspire to the vaccination coverage reached in Singapore (79 per cent) or Denmark (73 per cent) rather than Britain (65 per cent), Israel (61 per cent) or the US (54 per cent). Singapore and Denmark have slowly eased restrictions, had widespread access to innovative strategies such as rapid antigen testing, and kept schools open.
This week Denmark declared COVID no longer a "socially critical disease" and is removing all restrictions including internal vaccine passports. As a population of 5.8 million, with seven-day average cases at 600 a day and deaths at one per day, it says some restrictions could be re-imposed if required. Yet life in Denmark is moving "beyond COVID". As Australia moves on from its doughnut obsession, we could do worse than be more Danish.

Trust the science and get vaccinated now

Full text: COVID-19 vaccination data shows that the West and North-West of Tasmania are nearly 10% behind the rest of the state on both first and second doses.
Despite the overall Tasmanian figures, too many people in the vulnerable priority categories are yet to be able to access vaccination.
These Tasmanians are dangerously exposed to this third wave of COVID-19 because Scott Morrison has presided over the slowest vaccine rollout in the developed world.
A recent survey showed 55% of Tasmanians said low vaccination rates were due to the flawed rollout.
Mr Morrison had two jobs this year: a speedy vaccine rollout and fit-for-purpose quarantine.
He has failed on both counts and vulnerable Tasmanians are at risk.
In term of vaccines, Australia does not have enough back-up options, there is no capacity to manufacture mRNA vaccinations onshore, and there is not enough supply, so the PM is begging and borrowing from other countries.
Tasmanians are now deeply worried that, as NSW and Victoria "learn to live with COVID", the Delta variant will make it to our shores.
We see Scott Morrison playing politics, picking and choosing which state or territory he backs, instead of working constructively, listening to each state's genuine concerns and delivering a realistic plan.
Will Mr Morrison continue to push for restrictions to be lifted, even if tracing and other systems are not operating at best practice?
Because if they're not, the Doherty Institute modelling shows thousands more people will be put in hospital, and hundreds will die.
And can the Tasmanian hospital system cope with an outbreak? We have heard from many respected voices saying it cannot, and we don't have the staff to manage a major outbreak.
Scott Morrison should front up and explain what his targets are for case numbers and outline a plan to parents because our children are fast becoming the front line in this fight.
And the Gutwein government should be upfront about what level of COVID cases our system can cope with. Surely, they have done the modelling?
Despite the obstacles, I urge every Tasmanian to trust the science and get vaccinated as soon as you can.

Fear, suspicion add to stress of aiding nation's most vulnerable

Full text: The COVID-19 national plan appears too broad to take in Top End demographic nuances, writes Zach Hope.
More trouble at home, says Ray, a young Aboriginal man affiliated with the Judas Priest mob, one of the many gangs from Wadeye named for the metal bands who first captivated the community decades ago on late night ABC music program Rage.
Ray and a dozen or so extended family, mostly women and children, are taking refuge in Darwin, a six-hour drive from Wadeye on the wretched Port Keats Road, and today they're in a northern suburbs park with swings for the kids and shade for the sitting.
But only Ray and a young woman stay to answer questions about how this pandemic has affected them. The rest have shot up the road - scared, Ray says later, that this approaching white stranger was about to force them to get the needle.
Through broken English, Ray says he's already twice-dosed with Pfizer, courtesy of a recent stint in jail. The shy young woman is yet to have her first, even though she is every government's priority.
Both want to know the same thing: "Where does it come from?"
The Northern Territory government will not release the vaccination rates for Wadeye or any remote community, preferring to bundle the numbers into broader regions that incorporate whiter, larger and better-vaccinated towns.
The best the public can know about vaccinations in Wadeye, also called Port Keats, is the first dose rate for the broad "Top End" region (excluding Darwin) is 52 per cent. But even this is fraught. Federal government calculations, which tally the administered shots using Medicare information, put the same region at only 26 per cent for first doses.
The maths discrepancy alone could be cause for alarm, given these numbers are supposed to inform such important decisions as "opening up", and given the Territory has diseases Third World nations have defeated.
Doherty Institute modelling - taken up by state and territory leaders in their disintegrating compact to transition to living with the virus at 70 to 80 per cent double-dose vaccinations rates of those aged 16 plus - does not investigate what opening up means for Australia's sickest and most health illiterate populations.
Says doctor Jason Agostino of the National Aboriginal Community Controlled Health Organisation: "[One question] is about whether 80 per cent of 16 and over is appropriate [for opening up], and the answer is 'no'."
Just as broad geographic groupings can mask vaccination realities within individual communities, so can national or statewide tallies mask low doses in sub-populations, including those living with disabilities, mental health conditions or in very remote locations, Agostino says.
Aboriginal Medical Services Alliance Northern Territory chief executive John Paterson believes 70 to 80 per cent may be acceptable in an imaginary homogenous and healthy Australia but "could be devastating for Aboriginal communities".
The Doherty Institute is doing work on specific groups now and will report to national cabinet.
But the situation in the far-western NSW town of Wilcannia, described by a local health service as an unfolding "humanitarian crisis", is an emerging preview of what can happen when COVID-19 gets into overcrowded communities whose majority are statistically sick.
Wilcannia is about 60 per cent Aboriginal. Wadeye and most other remote NT communities are closer to 90 per cent.
As big businesses and federal Treasurer Josh Frydenberg beat the drum for reopening in line with the "very clear [national] plan", Paterson says the conversation ignores "extreme and worsening" staff shortages in remote communities; poor access to vaccines compared with large centres; frighteningly high rates of chronic disease in Aboriginal communities; and low vaccine take-up rates.
To protect against needless deaths once Australians are allowed freedoms to move around, public health measures - contact tracing, isolation and social distancing - need to continue to some extent.
But how to self-isolate if 15 or more other people are living in the same three-bedroom house, Paterson says.
Consider that a typical remote community - and there are more than 70 in the Territory - may have only one store from which to buy groceries.
How to feed people if the store becomes an exposure site and needs to close, even for a day?
How to move people and where to put them? The NSW government has started pushing motorhomes into Wilcannia. But what of the many Territory communities such as Wadeye, cut off in the fast-approaching wet season? The Territory government would not detail such contingency plans.
Chief Minister Michael Gunner has asked the Doherty Institute to do more "Territory specific" work, particularly taking into account its young and vulnerable cohort.
Wadeye has a median age of 25, compared with 38 on Sydney's north shore. Even if the community achieves an 80 per cent vaccination rate of over 16s, half of the population will still be without a single dose.
Across the wider Aboriginal population, Agostino says calculating 80 per cent of over 12s still only makes about 60 per cent of the whole.
Paterson says until vaccines are approved for all children, "these 70 to 80 per cent targets will be dangerous for our people".
Maningrida elder Charlie Gunabarra, also a chairperson for Mala'la Health Services, says his Arnhem Land community is a vaccine success story. While the government will not provide figures, Gunabarra says more than 1300 of the community's 3500 people got their Pfizer jabs in the first four days of vaccinations alone.
"Some of them run away into the bush, hiding, and I said, 'you can hide, but that thing will get to you. It's invisible'. But most of them came," he says.
Gunabarra has fought vaccine lies carried into the crowded public housing blocks on social media and the lips of misinformed or mischievous visitors.
One rumour was that the vaccine could make you explode, Gunabarra says.
"I said, 'hang on, if you want me to prove it [is safe], I'll be the first person to get the vaccine'.
"Everyone was watching me. I got that one and everybody was just looking: 'is he going to fall? Is he going to collapse?'. But then I put my finger up. I said 'Good' and everybody got into line."
Prime Minister Scott Morrison acknowledged the complexities in remote communities last month when he said some would require a "very bespoke approach" while Australia moved through the phases of reopening.
Bespoke is easier said than done, according to Olga Havnen, chief executive of Darwin's Danila Dilba Health Service until July this year.
Havnen says about a third of the Territory's remote Aboriginal population is on the move at any given time. It could be ceremony. Funerals are far too common. People could be moving to outstations, she says.
Others, such as the fully vaccinated Joyce Lalara from Groote Eylandt, who has Machado-Joseph disease, have come to Darwin accommodation for an arranged break from community life.
An infection in Darwin or Alice Springs - imported, say, from a vaccinated and healthy Bondi vacationer making good on open borders - can spread rapidly no matter the distance to unvaccinated and unhealthy communities.
Havnen says: "The pattern of mobility is not an aberration. And it's something that's not factored into any kind of planning, as far as I can tell, in terms of government responses.
"The fact that it has been studiously ignored is unacceptable."
Another issue, she says, is that governments have tried to centralise communications instead of letting organisations on the ground tailor the right message, from the right people, in the right languages.
"It's the arrogance of bloody bureaucrats, who know nothing, not wanting to trust us to do a job that we know we can do really well," she says.
Despite the vaccine turnouts in Maningrida, Gunabarra says too many people will continue to refuse.
"I'm worried. Other mob, too, they're worried," he says.
"People have got to be careful who they're inviting from Darwin, especially long grass (homeless) people.
"And people come from down south, sitting with Aboriginal mob smoking, drinking, ganja - whatever - that really worries me. The people sneaking in. I'm sure they'll be caught, but once it's spread it's spread."

Full text: A YOUNG Brisbane child has tested positive to Covid-19, forcing a southeast primary school into quarantine and placing restrictions on certain aged-care facilities, hospitals and disability services.
The four-year-old girl is a close contact of a 46-year-old Logan truck driver who triggered an alert this week.
Contact tracers were on Friday night scrambling to get in touch with those impacted and testing results will determine whether another lockdown is required.
Meanwhile, Queensland could remain an isolated kingdom with Scott Morrison confirming there may be a future in which states like NSW open international borders and others remain cut off.
The Prime Minister painted the fractured picture after a fortnight of hesitation by Premier Annastacia Palaszczuk to remain committed to the national plan informed by Doherty modelling of case numbers once vaccination levels reach 80 per cent and restrictions are relaxed, making it clear the rest of the nation wouldn’t wait.
But after loud criticism of her use of worst-case scenario modelling to highlight death numbers and concerns around sick children that haven’t been backed by medical professionals, a more measured Ms Palaszczuk backed a more “constructive debate” going forward and finally apologised over her government’s decision to allow in an NRL entourage while borders were closed to returning Queenslanders.
It came before the national cabinet meeting where further Doherty Institute modelling, focused on reopening with the current case numbers in NSW, was presented.
The details of the updated modelling are expected to be made public next week. It is understood there was further discussion about what public health measures could be removed once vaccination rates hit the 70 per cent and 80 per cent milestones, but no final decisions were made.
Earlier Mr Morrison confirmed international borders would open for states that reached 80 per cent vaccination, if they wanted it, without waiting for those jurisdictions lagging behind.
“The national plan (for reopening) sets that out very clearly,” he said. Under the national plan, all restrictions on outbound travel are lifted for vaccinated Australians and travel bubbles will be expanded to countries such as Singapore and the Pacific Islands, pending agreements being struck, once 80 per cent vaccination rates are hit.
Queensland has the second-lowest vaccination levels, at 32.9 per cent double doses and 51.6 per cent single dose.
Meanwhile, three days after it was revealed exemptions had been granted for NRL players’ families, and following days of sustained criticism, the Premier conceded she was wrong. “It was not the right thing to do when we had the pause (on hotel quarantine),” she said. “It shouldn’t have happened … I extend my apologies to the public about that.”

In a highly charged parliamentary performance, Ms Palaszczuk relied on a single graph to warn that: “Doherty Institute modelling predicts that even with 70 per cent of the population vaccinated, 80 people will die each day from Covid once the outbreak reaches six months after it started – that is 2240 who will die each month.” But her claims of mass deaths under the national plan were blasted as “false, misleading and wrong” by federal Health Minister Greg Hunt, who said “with optimal public health measures and no lockdowns” the Doherty modelling actually forecast just 13 deaths over six months.

Full text: Federal Treasurer Josh Frydenberg has accused the Queensland premier of denying reality after she declared border restrictions could remain until all children are vaccinated against Covid-19.
Annastacia Palaszczuk has exposed a new division in the national reopening plan, which is linked to vaccination coverage targets of 70 and 80 per cent.
The Queensland Labor leader is pledging to retain her hardline approach despite other states conceding eliminating coronavirus will be impossible.
Palaszczuk called for more research about vaccinating children under 12, a practice yet to be approved anywhere in the world.
Frydenberg said her claim that children would be vulnerable if the virus circulated in Queensland didn't stack up.
"It's a desperate denial of the reality and is not based on the medical advice," he told the Seven Network yesterday.
"The medical advice is that the illnesses in kids are much less severe than what we see in adults."
Children aged 12 to 15 were added to the rollout last week following advice from the expert immunisation panel.
Victoria, which recorded 176 new cases yesterday, has dumped its goal of returning to zero cases but lockdown will continue while vaccination rates rise.
NSW Premier Gladys Berejiklian continues to dangle the prospect of increased freedoms when vaccination targets are reached even with more than 1000 new infections a day.
The stance of Australia's most populous state is now at odds with Covid-free jurisdictions, which have given soaring support to governments that eliminated the disease.
Queensland has recorded two new local cases in truck drivers in as many days.
Palaszczuk doubled down on her concerns about unvaccinated children, pointing to rising infection numbers around the world.
Australia has more than 19,000 active cases, including 18,000 in NSW and more than 800 in Victoria.
There are almost 1000 people in NSW hospitals, with 150 in intensive care.
Australian Medical Association president Omar Khorshid warned the health system will not cope with rising cases when the nation reopens.
"We must urgently prepare our health system before opening up and to do that we need new modelling based on our hospitals' ability to cope with the associated increase in caseload," he said.
Epidemiologist Tony Blakely said Victoria's case numbers would likely peak at 2000 cases a day in October. NSW case numbers are heading in a similar direction. "Elimination of Covid is over," Blakely told the ABC.
"Yes, we now are living with the virus - I think people would have seen that coming for a week or so."
Australia has fully vaccinated 35.7 per cent of the population aged 16 and over, while 59.6 per cent have received one dose.

Full text: Federal Treasurer Josh Frydenberg has accused the Queensland premier of denying reality after she declared border restrictions could remain until all children are vaccinated against Covid-19.
Annastacia Palaszczuk has exposed a new division in the national reopening plan, which is linked to vaccination coverage targets of 70 and 80 per cent.
The Queensland Labor leader is pledging to retain her hardline approach despite other states conceding eliminating coronavirus will be impossible.
Palaszczuk called for more research about vaccinating children under 12, a practice yet to be approved anywhere in the world.
Frydenberg said her claim that children would be vulnerable if the virus circulated in Queensland didn't stack up.
"It's a desperate denial of the reality and is not based on the medical advice," he told the Seven Network yesterday.
"The medical advice is that the illnesses in kids are much less severe than what we see in adults."
Children aged 12 to 15 were added to the rollout last week following advice from the expert immunisation panel.
Victoria, which recorded 176 new cases yesterday, has dumped its goal of returning to zero cases but lockdown will continue while vaccination rates rise.
NSW Premier Gladys Berejiklian continues to dangle the prospect of increased freedoms when vaccination targets are reached even with more than 1000 new infections a day.
The stance of Australia's most populous state is now at odds with Covid-free jurisdictions, which have given soaring support to governments that eliminated the disease.
Queensland has recorded two new local cases in truck drivers in as many days.
Palaszczuk doubled down on her concerns about unvaccinated children, pointing to rising infection numbers around the world.
Australia has more than 19,000 active cases, including 18,000 in NSW and more than 800 in Victoria.
There are almost 1000 people in NSW hospitals, with 150 in intensive care.
Australian Medical Association president Omar Khorshid warned the health system will not cope with rising cases when the nation reopens.
"We must urgently prepare our health system before opening up and to do that we need new modelling based on our hospitals' ability to cope with the associated increase in caseload," he said.
Epidemiologist Tony Blakely said Victoria's case numbers would likely peak at 2000 cases a day in October. NSW case numbers are heading in a similar direction. "Elimination of Covid is over," Blakely told the ABC.
"Yes, we now are living with the virus - I think people would have seen that coming for a week or so."
Australia has fully vaccinated 35.7 per cent of the population aged 16 and over, while 59.6 per cent have received one dose.

Full text: Palaszczuk ‘scaremongering’ over kids’ welfare PREMIER Annastacia Palaszczuk has been accused of “scaremongering” by political foes and lacking common sense by “appalled” top doctors as she seized on children’s welfare as the reason she still can’t lay out a plan for reopening.
Ms Palaszczuk (inset) on Wednesday appealed to parents, grandparents, aunts and uncles as she declared the fate of children was “the most serious issue that our country will face” and opening up would be exposing the most vulnerable.
After committing to a ­national cabinet plan to relax restrictions last month, the Premier said she now needed extra Doherty Institute modelling to show how children would fare before she could tell Queenslanders what life would look like when vaccination rates reached 80 per cent.
“Unless there is an answer on how these young people are going to be vaccinated, you are putting the most vulnerable population at risk,” she said. “So anyone who has grandchildren, or young children, or nephews or nieces know how that plays on people’s minds – what’s going to happen to the children?” But the comments were questioned by health experts, who said that keeping borders shut to protect children was “not sensible”.
Veteran pediatrician and vaccine expert Professor ­Robert Booy, also a member of the national Immunisation Coalition, said the Premier needed to use her common sense in her decision as children were not at high risk. ­Professor Booy, who described himself as a “devout Queenslander”, said he was “appalled” by the Premier’s stance.
“I have been a pediatrician and have worked in the promotion of vaccinations for decades”, Professor Booy said. “If I thought young children needed urgent vaccination, I would say so. Keeping borders shut because of the children is not a sensible measure.” He said that young children would not be vaccinated until next year and Ms Palaszczuk did not need to wait for new modelling.
“We know from international data ... that unless they have existing chronic conditions they are not at high risk,” he said.
Pediatrician Professor Fiona Russell of the Murdoch Children’s Research Institute said children exhibited similar flu-like symptoms to adults, but few had become seriously ill, even with the Delta strain.
“What we do know is that Covid in kids is nothing like what occurs in adults,” she said.
Opposition Leader David Crisafulli on Wednesday night called on Ms Palaszczuk to back her concerns with evidence as the business community again cried out for some certainty.
“If the Premier is now walking away from the national agreement that she signed up to based on the ­Doherty modelling, then she needs to release the health advice driving that new direction and release to Queenslanders what her new plan is,” he said.
That modelling shows an estimated 25 children under 16 would die over six months, 93 would need ICU and 135,408 would become infected should restrictions ease when 80 per cent of adults are vaccinated and measures such as contact tracing and quarantine were only partially working.
But if control measures were working well, no child aged under 16 would die from Covid-19, one would need the ICU and 687 would become infected.
Treasurer Josh Frydenberg said it would be “ludicrous” if the rest of Australia was able to “travel to Canada before Cairns” and if Ms Palaszczuk didn’t stick to the national plan, “businesses will close … jobs will be lost”.
Home Affairs Minister Karen Andrews slammed Ms Palaszczuk for using “every available opportunity” to shut the state down, for “scaremongering” and for recent statements that have “quite frankly not made a lot of sense”. “The ... Premier is quite clearly doubling down on her ‘Let’s keep Queensland closed’ (rhetoric) and the federal government is of the view that Queensland should be open,” she said. Deputy Premier Steven Miles said Ms Palaszczuk’s comments did not necessarily mean children would have to be vaccinated before Queensland opened up, but he ­cautioned that if restrictions were lifted once adults were vaccinated “then the only place for the virus to move around rapidly would be amongst children”, the unvaccinated and the vulnerable.

Chastened by the Delta strain, Australia's two biggest states have officially abandoned any pretenses of Covid-zero. Lockdowns are now a waiting game as the population limps to 70 and 80 per cent vaccination, outlined by the Doherty Institute as triggers for reopening.
A three-month lockdown in 2020 taught Victorian Premier Daniel Andrews to go hard and go early, in a bid to eradicate the virus. But as he announced another 120 locally acquired cases on Wednesday, he conceded that game was over.
"We have thrown everything at this, but it is now clear to us that we are not going to drive these numbers down. They are instead going to increase," he told reporters.
Victoria has now joined NSW in tethering its hopes to the Doherty targets, spruiked by Premier Gladys Berejiklian as a ticket to normality.

Two die as state plots path out of lockdown

Full text: The state government has abandoned its COVID-zero strategy and is set to announce a modest easing of restrictions despite two COVID deaths being reported yesterday - the first in Victoria this year.
Conceding the mental health effects of the latest lockdown had been "bloody tough", Premier Daniel Andrews and senior ministers were in briefings with Chief Health Officer Brett Sutton last night.
The development came as Victoria recorded its first COVID-19 deaths since November 30. Two women, one aged 49 from Northcote and the other in her 60s from Hume, died in their homes.
The state recorded 76 new cases yesterday but Mr Andrews said he understood Victoria could not continue its lockdown endlessly.
"I know that as strong, as tough and as resilient as the people of Victoria are, we're all tired," he said.
Epidemiologists have warned that the state is unlikely to ever achieve COVID-zero given the transmissibility of the Delta variant, but said daily community transmission cases must remain below 100 and ideally only "a few dozen a day".
Schools will not be allowed to reopen under the latest changes, but Mr Andrews said he would outline a plan today for senior students to return to the classroom.
Senior government sources previously told The Age ministers should consider reopening playgrounds and allowing year 12 students back into the classroom as extinguishing the current Delta outbreak was looking highly unlikely.
Deakin University chair in epidemiology Catherine Bennett predicted the first restrictions to ease would be less-risky measures, such as lifting the curfew and allowing people more time to exercise outdoors. In the coming weeks, she expected a soft opening for some businesses that might allow some people to sit outdoors at cafes.
Although the Victorian government has officially shifted its tough stance on eliminating the virus, Mr Andrews yesterday stressed the aim remained to drive case numbers as low as possible and "close to zero" to ensure the state's hospitals were not overwhelmed.
"This is bloody tough; no one is pretending otherwise," he said.
"[Today], we'll announce thresholds, low numbers we think we can contain. We'll always push to get as low as we possibly can, but if, despite our best efforts, zero is not something that we can achieve, I make two points: it can't be much more than zero and secondly, we are better off for having chased zero, otherwise it finishes up thousands of cases."
Professor Sutton and his public health team spent yesterday afternoon finalising the road map for COVID-19 restrictions until Victoria hits its vaccination targets and determining the "sweet spot" of tolerable case thresholds that need to be reached before an easing of lockdown rules.
The government's eight senior ministers, including the Premier, met last night to decide on the settings. The wider cabinet is expected to sign off on the new rules and path to reopening this morning.
In NSW, the government has already promised to allow fully vaccinated people living outside areas of concern to meet up to four people from other households outdoors. Those living in hotspot areas will be able to gather outdoors for recreation as well as exercise.
James McCaw, an epidemiologist and mathematical biologist with the University of Melbourne who provided modelling on the pandemic to the federal government, said it was impossible to determine a magic number that would be achievable to maintain long-term. However, to manage cases effectively, Professor McCaw said, Victoria could not go beyond a threshold of 100 cases a day.
Epidemiologist Nancy Baxter said Victoria should be aiming for as low as it can go within a double-digit threshold and argued that 50 or 100 new daily cases was still far too high.
Victoria had roughly 40 new cases who were infectious in the community, a figure Professor Baxter said was very concerning.
Asked about what restrictions the government could safely ease, she said allowing people to exercise for longer outdoors and slightly increasing the five-kilometre radius could be done without the risk of a huge surge in cases.
However, she suspected the government might also opt to allow families back into playgrounds.
"It is more risky, but from a mental health perspective it is something that's quite important."
The Premier would not be drawn on which restrictions would be eased but stressed that today would not be "Freedom Day" and that any easing of the rules would be modest and cautious.
Last week, he said he did not favour an option put forward by University of Melbourne epidemiologist Tony Blakely to move to a lighter lockdown with slightly more freedoms in acknowledgement of the difficulty of reaching zero.
Under Professor Blakely's suggestion, strict rules would remain but more time would be allowed outside, the travel limit would become 10 kilometres, some retail could open and essential sectors such as construction could return to greater operating capacity.
However, as Victoria struggles to crush the latest Delta outbreak despite entering into a tough lockdown at the earliest possible time, government MPs have increasingly turned their attention to tweaking the harsh restrictions to ease the mental burden on Victorians who have endured more than 200 days in lockdown.
Of yesterday's 76 new COVID-19 cases, 45 are linked to existing outbreaks and 36 were in isolation for their entire infectious period.
Professor Bennett said while the goal should be to keep new infections in the double digits, even chasing a daily figure of 20 new cases a day would probably be unachievable in the long term.
"It's about trying to keep a lid on it, keep the cases numbers where they are or even less," she said.

Full text: REOPENING Australia with thousands of Covid-19 cases active in the community will not lead to more deaths over six months than waiting for virus numbers to be contained at low numbers, updated modelling by the Doherty Institute has found.
The updated modelling, which will be discussed on Friday at a meeting of the national cabinet, conducted analysis of three different scenarios over a 180-day period based on Covid case numbers in the tens, hundreds and thousands and found no material difference in fatality rates.
The latest modelling, already provided to state and territory leaders on Wednesday, comes as Prime Minister Scott Morrison seeks to hold the Premiers to the national cabinet agreement for restrictions to be eased at vaccination rates of 70-80 per cent.
The new analysis will quell concerns from state leaders about the NSW outbreak by suggesting the spiralling number of infections does not present an obstacle to proceeding with the national cabinet’s four-step reopening strategy.
It comes as Victorian health authorities aren’t ruling out easing restrictions in less than a week, despite ­reporting the biggest spike in cases in almost a year.
Victoria recorded 80 new cases on Thursday, which is the highest daily number since September 2 last year, when 110 cases were reported.
Daniel Andrews wouldn’t confirm if lockdown would end on Thursday. “It’s too early for us to say … every day’s data tells you a different picture. The rules will be on for as long as they serve a useful purpose,” the Premier said.
One of the key restrictions some experts have flagged could be eased first is the controversial playground ban.
Chief health officer Brett Sutton on Thursday said an investigation into playground transmission was ­inconclusive.
“We don’t get a definitive answer,” he said “We don’t have an alternative explanation and that becomes a working hypothesis.” Just 39 of Thursday’s cases were in isolation for their infectious period, with contact tracers investigating the source of 13 further mystery cases.
Prof Sutton said the virus had moved “silently and with stealth” across the state.
“The fight is still on … clearly today is a challenging day, and the numbers aren’t going in the direction that we would like them to,” he said.
“What’s become apparent in recent weeks is that maybe three-quarters of transmission occurs without symptoms or before you’ve developed symptoms,” Prof Sutton said.
Meanwhile, new health department data provided to the Herald Sun revealed in the past week, only 40 per cent of symptomatic people got tested.
It prompted the Premier to lash the “selfish behaviour” of Victorians. “Don’t, for heaven’s sake, as some have, wait eight days, and literally infect everyone you come anywhere near in that eight-day period,” he said, adding it was evident illegal home visits were still a source of transmission.
“Please don’t be visiting friends, please don’t be visiting family, because the visitor that no one knows about is the coronavirus.
“You are taking it with you to the people you love. Don’t act in a selfish and irresponsible way.
“Stay at home, or you will spread this virus.” It comes as NSW will allow gatherings of up to five people outdoors from September 13. Meanwhile, returning Victorians who have completed their two-week quarantine interstate will now need to complete a mandatory day-17 test.
Mr Andrews also said on Thursday he hadn’t given up on a Victorian grand final. “It’s going to be incredibly difficult for us to have major events any time soon … but no decision has been made,” he said.

Victorians asked to 'make best choices'

Full text: Premier Daniel Andrews has warned strict lockdown measures will stay in place as long as Victorians continue to visit friends and family and wait days to get tested for coronavirus.
Mr Andrews' stern message yesterday, directed particularly at young Victorians, came as fully vaccinated people in NSW were promised outdoor gatherings with up to four friends by September 13, even though the state hit a record 1029 new COVID-19 cases.
"The longer people break the rules, the longer these rules will be on," Mr Andrews said.
While 80 new locally acquired cases were recorded yesterday - the highest daily total since the 86 recorded on September 1 last year - Chief Health Officer Brett Sutton said it was too early to discuss whether the lockdown would continue in its current form beyond its planned end date next week.
It's also still uncertain if the state's schools will return to face-to-face learning before holidays begin on September 18.
More than half of the new cases were not isolating throughout their infectious period and the source of 13 remains unknown.
New data released by the state Health Department found 60 per cent of symptomatic cases had not been tested as soon as they developed symptoms.
Mr Andrews said some Victorians, particularly those in younger cohorts, were both neglecting to get tested and making visits to other people's homes.
He could not say, however, how many of this week's cases had occurred due to gatherings that were in breach of health orders.
"The fact of the matter is if these rules that are on now are followed, they'll work. And that's why I'm appealing to everybody to make the best choices you possibly can," The Premier said.
"I don't know that there's too many more levers to pull."
In a sign of the difficulties underpinning Victoria's push to reduce community transmission to zero, Professor Sutton revealed three-quarters of infections in recent weeks have been passed on either asymptomatically or before the first case experienced symptoms.
NSW Premier Gladys Berejiklian stuck to her promise of easing restrictions for the fully vaccinated once NSW hit 6 million jabs. Lockdown was extended in NSW regional areas, but outdoor gatherings up to five will be allowed outside western Sydney local government areas from September 13.
Mr Andrews declined to comment on NSW's decision. "The NSW government will get their own health advice and they'll make decisions. Hopefully all those decisions are consistent with the national plan," he said.
States and territories have agreed to suppress cases as much as possible until they hit the 70 and 80 per cent vaccination targets. National cabinet will meet today to discuss making 12- to 15-year-olds eligible for vaccination, as well as vaccine passports and what restrictions will apply to unvaccinated people once Australia starts to reopen.
Following clarification from the Doherty Institute this week that Australia's reopening plan could proceed even with hundreds of cases per day, Professor Sutton said Victoria remained committed to the national aggressive suppression strategy.
"If we can get to zero, fantastic. But if that is not attainable, we're still not going to let it run.
"We're still not going to allow thousands upon thousands of cases to emerge because we know that the restrictions hold that in check." Asked if he would consider a "lockdown lite" to lessen the mental health burden on Victorians until the state hit 70 per cent full vaccination - likely in November - the Chief Health Officer said it was possible.
"Of course, we would consider all options if we can understand the modelling, know what it means and be confident that it'll keep a cap on transmission," Professor Sutton said.
Mr Andrews said he could not offer guidance on when Victorian schools would return.
He instead pointed to plans to offer a vaccine dose to year 11 and 12 students before the first VCE exam in just over two months and suggested they would be invited to priority lanes at many of the state's 55 vaccination hubs.
"Home-schooling is tough. Absolutely it's tough. What's even harder than that - the notion that I would ignore any advice, open the schools, have the kids back there, bring it home ... that's not better. I don't want to see kids in hospital, I just don't."
Opposition Leader Michael O'Brien criticised the Premier for "lecturing" Victorians and called for him to offer hope in the form of reversing restrictions such as the ban on playgrounds.
Mr O'Brien said Mr Andrews should replicate NSW in easing restrictions for vaccinated people before national targets are reached. "If NSW is able to give their people a little bit of leeway, a little bit of a reward for the great effort they've done in getting vaccination rates up, it'd be great to think Victoria could look forward to the same thing," he said.
Burnet Institute epidemiologist Brendan Crabb said Victoria could still return to zero community transmission, framing the lockdown as a tough measure that could allow a higher quality of life later in the year. He said Sydney probably had too many cases to return to zero at any point.
"There's no COVID-zero life for NSW for the foreseeable future. Just less and less lockdown," Professor Crabb said.
"But for [Victoria] if we do get back to zero, then we will have a more open life like South Australia and Queensland and Tasmania and Western Australia have. That's why we've got to give it a go."

Problems not over when we get to 80pc

Full text: This week may be a real turning point in the politics and management of Covid in Australia. For the first time, the desire to reclaim the normal freedoms of life began to compete seriously against the desire to avoid disease and death by Covid. For the first time Scott Morrison seemed to apply a bit of pressure to the opposition and even to the states.
Opposition to lockdowns and a desire for an instant return to the full freedoms of pre-Covid life have always been there on the fringe. But this week it became mainstream.
This is for two reasons. Lockdowns have gone on so long that the damage they inflict has become more intense and widely recognised. More important, the late but rapid uptake of vaccination offers a real chance “to live with” Covid.
However, here are two unassailable facts and one fearless prediction. Nobody knows how this is going to play out, medically or politically. But it will certainly involve a lot of death, more than we are accustomed to dealing with.
And here’s the fearless prediction: every single prediction you hear or read (except this one?) will turn out to be wrong or radically incomplete.
No one will get everything they want. Very few Covid polemicists acknowledge facts inconvenient to their case. Thus, the love of liberty is a righteous sentiment. But you must never break a valid law, you must be governed by common sense and you must recognise that liberties conflict. Thus it is a liberty that no one be forced to take a vaccine. But it is also a liberty that workers are able to go to workplaces that don’t place their health at unnecessary risk. That might mean their employer requiring everyone to be vaccinated.
Living with the virus is a slippery concept. If we had decided last year to live with the virus we would have had Covid mortality rates comparable with other OECD countries.
According to federal Health Minister Greg Hunt, at the OECD average that would be 30,000 dead Australians. US or British death rates would have been nearer to 45,000.
Because we are an island we had the option of isolating and keeping deaths very low. But you cannot live like that forever. And the Delta variant is so much more contagious than the original virus that we can longer maintain that isolation.
Now vaccines give us a way of moving out of that phase in relative safety by international standards. But that safety is extremely relative and is safety only by international standards. NSW Premier Gladys Berejiklian has long proposed that lockdowns can end definitively when we get to 80 per cent of eligible adults vaccinated. It will be really hard work to get to 80 per cent, but it’s a good figure and should be achievable in a nation with as much education, health infrastructure and native good sense as Australia.
But don’t think our problems are over when we get to 80 per cent. That 80 per cent of eligible adults equates to only 62 per cent of the total population. There are about 26 million Australians, so 62 per cent is a touch over 16 million. That leaves 10 million Australians who will be unvac­cinated even if we reach 80 per cent.
Nobody could respect the Doherty Institute more than I do, but its modelling, which is actually pretty cautious, necessarily based on all kinds of assumptions about things we cannot forecast, and also requires near perfect public health management by federal and state authorities, says opening up then might be safe.
But you know, that modelling could turn out to be as mistaken as every other prediction about this virus. We could easily face a devastating pandemic of the unvaccinated, as in the US. Don’t get me wrong. I certainly support more or less full opening up when we get to that vaccination level because lockdowns cannot go on forever. Premiers who continue to imply that we can live forever with almost no Covid deaths are dishonest or foolish or irresponsible or all three.
But opening up, even with 80 per cent of adults vaccinated, could be tough and tragic, and could involve a lot of death – far, far more than even the worst flu season. Nothing has been sillier through the entire course of the pandemic than the idea that Covid is just like a bad flu. The Economist magazine updated its estimate of global Covid deaths, based on calculations of excess mortality reports and some other inputs. Its estimate is that nine million to 18 million people have died worldwide from Covid. Nobody knows how many people died from the Spanish flu a century ago, but consensus estimates range from 25 million to 50 million.
Given that Covid has years to run, it is approaching the same league as the Spanish flu and, in numerical if not proportionate terms, may well turn out to have a bigger death toll.
Nor do we know how the virus will continue to mutate. The high school orthodox version of mutation is that a disease becomes more contagious but less deadly so that it doesn’t kill off its hosts and has more bodies to inhabit. However, like many high school orthodoxies, it just ain’t so. Smallpox killed a third of the people it infected and it lasted for thousands of years without ever becoming mild.
The Delta variant is a little more deadly, a little more able to evade vaccines and natural immunities, and a little more likely to hit young people, than the other variants. But its biggest evolutionary innovation is that it is wildly more contagious.
Lethality, transmissibility and vaccine evasiveness are always the three key questions about mutations. There may be some kind of in-built biological limit to how radically Covid can mutate, but we don’t know. Measles, polio and other diseases mutate quite a bit but haven’t been able to defeat vaccines. Our Covid vaccines are brilliantly good and the mRNA technology means they can be changed quickly to target new variants. But there is no guarantee Covid won’t mutate in a way that significantly smashes through the vaccines.
The evidence from Israel is that vaccine immunity significantly reduces in less than a year but can be restored with booster shots. So we will certainly need booster shots and might need them more than once a year.
NSW has 113 Covid patients in intensive care. That’s equivalent to two big hospital ICUs. Indeed two big hospitals, Westmead and Blacktown, have refused to take any more Covid patients for 24 hours. With 10 million unvaccinated Australians, and a new variant just a fraction more vaccine evasive, and with early vaccine recipients finding their immunity fading, you could imagine 500, or 1000, people in ICU beds in NSW, even with 80 per cent vaccinated.
Then you confront the health system being overwhelmed. Whatever we’ve said about no more lockdowns, any government will respond to that situation with tough restrictions, whether they’re called lockdown or something else. The debate this week has been realistic and good, but don’t for a moment think that anything is settled.

Full text: Just when all the voices merged together and the noise level mushroomed past 10, there was a clear, calm voice and, temporarily, order was restored.
Well, for a few hours last night anyway.
Happily that voice came not from politicians or shouty journalists but rather from scientists - the Doherty Institute, specifically.
The institute's website tells us it is officially called The Peter Doherty Institute for Infection and Immunity. It is a joint venture between the University of Melbourne and the Royal Melbourne Hospital. The federal government has used its modelling to inform Australia's pathway out of the pandemic, and to determine when lockdown restrictions should be eased in line with the nation's vaccination rate.
In plain and easily digestible language it offered pandemic rationale that politicians have struggled to deliver - with any sense of authority anyway.
You can read the full statement here but if that's a stretch how about these two paragraphs - one from the top of the statement, the other from the tail:
"There is light at the end of the tunnel - once we achieve 70%-80% vaccination we will see less transmission of COVID-19 and fewer people with severe illness, and therefore fewer hospitalisations and deaths. COVID-19 won't go away but it will be easier to control in the future."
And: "We are moving towards better control of COVID-19 and a more stable future. We encourage everyone to stay vigilant, get vaccinated if you are eligible and take care of each other as we transition to living with COVID-19."
Of course, that moment of stillness did not last long. Today Greens leader Adam Bandt wrote to Prime Minister Scott Morrison requesting national cabinet includes the whole population in reopening targets. It's an argument many have floated in recent days.
Mr Bandt said the exclusion of under-16s meant the target could be met when 65 per cent of the entire population was vaccinated.
While the government expects advice from the Australian Technical Advisory Group on Immunisation on vaccinations for children aged 12 to 15 to drop on Friday, there's good news for Victorians aged over 16: the 16 to 39-year-olds will be able to book to receive the Pfizer jab at one of the state's 55 hubs from 7am tomorrow.
Not so much joy for the national disability sector though as just over 26% of 265,000-plus NDIS participants aged 16 or older have been double-dosed. These stats come as the virus spreads into disability sectors in Canberra and Newcastle and Pfizer vaccinations open up to children with disability as young as 12.
"We've still got a way to go, but we are picking up the pace very rapidly," Senator Reynolds said today.
Let's return to the Doherty Institute for some reassurance. A team of modellers is "working through issues specific to the states and territories, specific populations, and high risk settings" last night's statement read.
Essentially, the scientists have our back. Phew.

Full text: Groundhog day has to end AS community patience is stretched, a huge financial cost endured, compliance tested and mental health issues rise, the end to what seems an endless cycle of lockdowns is a pressing necessity.
Australia, for economic, educational, social and psychological reasons simply has to move beyond the blunt, simplistic and destructive lockdown response to the pandemic.
Getting there demands the coming weeks and months be used to turbocharge the nation’s mass-vaccination rollout while doing everything we can to curb the spread of Covid in the community.
While Australia has been setting new records in vaccine uptake — 1.8 million doses administered in the past week — there continues to be gaping holes in the program, particularly for frontline staff including in health and aged care sectors and a lack of prioritisation for teachers.
Yesterday, Prime Minister Scott Morrison looked to further advance the understanding of and support for the state-federal “agreed” plan to move out of hibernation — a staged end to lockdowns off the back of first 70 per cent adult vaccination coverage and then 80 per cent.
“This groundhog day has to end,” the PM said, arguing the Doherty Institute modelling which sets out the national road map found the costs of lockdowns outweighed their benefit once 70 per cent vaccine coverage had been reached. On current projections, both these targets are set to be realised by year’s end — the 70 per cent trigger by November or earlier and 80 per cent by December.
But the public, straining to move beyond lockdowns now, needs to redouble efforts to get vaccinated — whether it be AstraZeneca with GP consultation, Pfizer or, in coming months Moderna — as soon as they can. In that sense, individual Australians do hold significant power to help define how quickly lockdowns can end, through continued responsible action to stop Covid spread, immediate testing upon any symptoms and presenting to GPs, pharmacists and state or Commonwealth clinics for their jab.
Australians, particularly Victorians who by Friday will overtake London in the longest lockdown stakes with 207 days of numbing containment, have endured too much over the past 18 months to now lose our fight as the vaccine light on the horizon draws closer.
What will make those steps toward greater freedom both safer and sooner is ensuring compliance in the lockdown we are now suffering actually brings case loads back down.
The four-stage Doherty model underlines the need for lower case loads to protect hospital and intensive care capacity as the transition beyond lockdown occurs.
The PM yesterday called on Australians to move past fear and a singular focus on daily infection numbers — whether that be worrying spread in Victoria and the Australian Capital Territory or the rampant levels in NSW — to embrace the national reopening road map.
Yet already, potholes have begun to appear as politics gets in the way. West Australian Premier Mark McGowan has insisted his Covid-free (at present) state would make its own decisions on reopening domestic borders regardless of national vaccination rates. Mr McGowan is one of many who have accused NSW of failing to handle its Delta outbreak that has twice seeded outbreaks in Victoria, in Queensland, the ACT and even New Zealand.
Queensland Deputy Premier Steven Miles went further, saying the northern state border may remain closed to NSW even when vaccination rates reached 80 per cent if case numbers were still high.
Partisan and state disunity makes the plan B “softer” lockdown option raised by epidemiologist Tony Blakely (opposite column) all the more worthy of debate.
Afghan fight was right HEARTFELT words were spoken yesterday in federal parliament as the Prime Minister, Opposition Leader and others reflected on the righteous reasons for Australia’s participation in the war in Afghanistan.
Given the collapse of the Afghan National Army, handing power back to a brutal Taliban regime after the departure of US and allied troops, the words of politicians, although sincere, can provide only so much comfort to Australia’s 39,000 defence personnel who served and, particularly, to the families of the 41 who died. Scott Morrison and Anthony Albanese gave voice to the valid cause of our longest conflict, first to deprive al-Qaeda of a base of operations and then to rebuild in the name of freedom and stability, paying homage to our men and women in uniform who toiled to that end and to help keep Australians safer in the age of terror. But it was Opposition deputy Richard Marles who identified just how much Afghanistan had progressed in the 20 years Australian troops worked to build that hope, particularly for Afghan girls and a new generation. From previous outright bans on education for females under Taliban rule, just over 40 per cent of eligible Afghan girls were attending school in recent times, a symbol of hard-won gains towards some level of equality. Tragically, the prospects of retaining even that progress is now remote.

NSW surge threatens Victoria's zero target

Full text: A surge in COVID-19 cases in NSW and predictions that the daily number could soon pass 2000 have raised fears that no matter how hard Victoria locks down, driving transmission to zero and keeping it there might be impossible with cross-border seeding events seemingly inevitable.
NSW hit a daily high of 633 cases yesterday and Premier Gladys Berejiklian said her state had not "seen the worst of it", with modelling suggesting it may hit 2200 cases a day if the current rate of infection does not decline.
Ms Berejiklian revealed the state's COVID-19 reproduction number was now 1.3, meaning every 10 people who have the virus will spread it to 13 others.
Victoria's fight to bring its own outbreak to zero remains in the balance following 24 new infections yesterday, including several homeless people in St Kilda.
Professor James McCaw, an epidemiologist and mathematical biologist with the University of Melbourne who advises the federal government, said cases in NSW will probably continue to rise in the next two weeks, with the possibility of daily numbers reaching the thousands within the next month.
"Cases are continuing to rise fairly rapidly. I wouldn't be surprised if we have well over 1000, perhaps up to 2000 cases within a month. However, it could go lower too," he said.
NSW authorities are yet to link almost 4000 mystery cases to their source, which Professor McCaw said he was "deeply concerned" about. Compliance with the state's lockdown rules is also proving a problem, with 736 penalty notices handed to people on Tuesday.
Transmission in NSW is accelerating towards Victoria's daily record of 725 cases (later revised down to 687) on August 5 last year.
The source of Victoria's new infections was unknown for four cases, while six were not isolating for all of their infectious period. COVID-19 response commander Jeroen Weimar said: "There are clearly a number of chains of transmission that we do not yet have full pictures of."
Confronted by a more infectious strain and less compliance than last year, Premier Daniel Andrews tightened Melbourne's lockdown on Monday. In line with the national strategy, he is pushing to eliminate community transmission in order to reopen Victoria and avoid replicating what could be months of lockdown in NSW.
Professor Maximilian de Courten, a public health expert with Victoria University's Mitchell Institute, warned it could be a futile task, particularly in light of the forecasts around NSW's cases.
"It's a numbers game and, absolutely, the more cases in NSW, the higher risk to other states like Victoria," he said. "Some modelling suggests even if we get down to zero and open up, the virus will break through in four to six weeks, causing a lockdown. That may be even faster with cases so high. It's this yo-yo lockdown situation that nobody wanted."
Rules around Victoria's border with NSW are tighter than at any point since the pandemic began: Victorian residents can only return home with a rare exemption, non-essential travel within towns in the border bubble has been banned and industries such as freight must adhere to regulations such as drivers getting tested every three days.
Nonetheless, since removalists from Sydney sparked Victoria's fifth lockdown last month, two women were able to board a flight from Sydney last week before being intercepted at Melbourne Airport. They were moved into hotel quarantine where they later tested positive.
New Zealand Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern revealed yesterday that her country's growing cluster was linked to Sydney, though did not go into detail.
Professor de Courten said leak-proof borders were not possible.
"If we can't always keep this virus inside quarantine hotels with trained staff, it's impossible to think we can prevent it jumping over the border."
Under Australia's reopening targets at 70 and 80 per cent vaccination, case numbers across the country must be at or close to zero - illustrating the nationwide headache caused by NSW's ballooning cases. Amid suggestions from some federal government MPs that NSW will never reach zero community transmission, Burnet Institute infectious diseases expert Suman Majumdar said: "COVID-zero won't be forever, but it's what's required now.
"Until we get very high levels of vaccination, lockdown is still going to be a key feature of our response. Why? Because lockdowns are needed to protect our health system, let alone control the virus," he said.
Among cases with an unknown source in Victoria are a St Kilda sex worker who recently spent time in a boarding house.
Mr Weimar said yesterday that two people who had tested positive in the St Kilda area are homeless. He said he believed the sex worker who tested positive, as well as one of her acquaintances, was detected because of an emergency department presentation.
Leaders in the sector say the state's homeless hotel program is operating during lockdowns but with significantly fewer sites than in last year's second lockdown.
Youth Projects chief executive Ben Vasiliou said there were concerns among sector leaders that Melbourne's homeless community was at significant risk and that if more positive cases were returned today, increased support to quarantine them would be required.
"This is moving very, very quickly," he said.
Victoria will receive 175,000 extra Pfizer vaccine doses out of the 1 million sourced from Poland starting this weekend. Mr Foley said they would probably be given to essential workers and areas particularly affected by outbreaks.
Victorian Transport Association chief executive Peter Anderson, who represents the state's 165,000 professional freight workers, said drivers had not yet been prioritised for vaccine access despite 15,000 truckloads crossing the Victoria-NSW border every day.
"We are advocating for drivers to get vaccinated as soon as possible but some are not eligible for the recommended vaccine and for many it's hard to physically get in front of a doctor when you are either driving or managing fatigue full-time," Mr Anderson said.

Full text: Australia’s hopes of sticking by a national plan at 70-80 per cent vaccination to open the economy, the internal borders and ease restrictions are being torn apart.
The premiers continue to run their agendas. And the premiers are divided. On a bleak Sunday NSW Premier Gladys Berejiklian admitted reality, saying it was “not possible” to eliminate Covid cases, while West Australian Premier Mark McGowan boasted that even at 80 per cent vaccination, his goal would still be “zero” cases and he would attempt to achieve that.
Sydney and Perth are divided by more than the Nullarbor; they have different Covid experiences and have conflicting views on the national cabinet opening-up strategy that Scott Morrison worked long and hard to secure.
Berejiklian’s aim is to find a “normal” life by vaccination – living with the virus, its cases and its deaths, restoring freedoms and economic life. Yet McGowan’s post-vaccination goal is a virus free utopia, guaranteed to be wildly popular in the West.
The biggest threat to Morrison’s 70-80 per cent nationwide strategy is Berejiklian’s inability to contain the Delta variant. If NSW still has hundreds of cases when it reaches the 70 per cent vaccine threshold other premiers will simply refuse to open in unison with NSW. Any national reopening strategy will be fatally compromised. A chaotic situation will unfold.
Beyond the NSW problem is the opposing problem of McGowan’s contradictory vision. McGowan, like all three ALP premiers, attacks Berejiklian’s lockdown as too weak and says her remarks about opening threaten the national cabinet decision. Yet it is McGowan who trashes the spirit and purpose of the national cabinet agenda while upholding its letter.
The entire purpose of the four stage 70-80 per cent vaccination plan, based on Doherty Institute modelling, is to move Australia as one nation across all states and territories into an easing of restrictions, lockdowns and closed borders by accepting that Covid cases will exist but that hospitalisation and deaths can be managed as the nation learns to live with the virus.
This is Morrison’s mantra. It is what the Doherty modelling sought to achieve. Yet McGowan in his SkyNews interview on Sunday had different goals. He will remain a zero-Covid premier despite any 80 per cent stellar vaccine rate, ready to resort to whatever powers are needed from lockdowns to border closures because the West “can’t run the risk” of being infiltrated by Delta.
McGowan will be cheered at home. But for most states, NSW being the most obvious, total elimination is not tenable. Berejiklian intends significant easing at the 70 per cent and 80 per cent thresholds. That means living with cases in the community and seeking a return to some form of freedom normality.
If McGowan is serious, then Australia risks a “two nation” fate divided by the Nullarbor, with contested methods of coping with Covid in late 2021 and possibly running far into 2022.
When pressed about fighting Covid, McGowan said “some” measures “might ease” in WA at the high vaccination levels. This premier is not for turning.
Reinforcing the west’s separate path is its dismal vaccination rate. On first jabs NSW scores 51 per cent compared with WA’s 41.6 per cent, while on both jabs NSW rates at 26.5 per cent compared with WA at 22.5 per cent.
The West’s figures are alarming in their own right, suggesting a distinct lack of urgency.
They are doubly alarming because the national cabinet plan says the transition from one stage to the next depends upon two conditions: the vaccination target being reached nationally and in each jurisdiction. There seems no escape. The premiers are running the show with likely alarming consequences for our unity, our cohesion and our national economy.

Full text: Australia’s hopes of sticking by a national plan at 70-80 per cent vaccination to open the economy, the internal borders and ease restrictions are being torn apart.

Full text: LIVING with Covid-19 long term will require an ongoing ­national contact tracing and testing plan as medical experts focus on emerging new treatments, amid hopes that one day there will be a simple pill to fight the virus.
Two additional deputy chief health officers have been appointed to help the commonwealth – former Queensland deputy chief health officer Sonya Bennett will oversee a ­national strategy for contact tracing, while GP Steph Davis will focus on mental health and vaccine modelling.
Dr Davis said even when Australia reached vaccination rates of 70 and 80 per cent, modelling by the Doherty Institute showed an ongoing testing and tracing capacity would be needed to live with the virus.
“All of that is going to be going for a while to make sure that we can keep the virus at (manageable) levels,” she said.
Chief medical officer Paul Kelly was hopeful a super-effective treatment for Covid-19 would be developed.
“The real game-changer for this will be when we have a ­normal pill like we do for … influenza … to give people early in the illness or even indeed to prevent illness,” he said.
“That pill does not exist at the moment in the world.” Professor Kelly said that as soon as ­medicines were developed and “shown to be useful” in treating Covid-19, health officials would work to make them available in Australia.
Professor Kelly will also meet with health experts on Monday to develop clinical guidance for use of a new monoclonal antibody drug, Sotrovimab, which Australia has purchased for use treating Covid-19 pending Therapeutic Goods Administration (TGA) approval.
“I’m starting a process this week with clinical colleagues to look at clinical guidelines,” Professor Kelly said. “This medicine is not for everybody, it is an antibody (that) will be mostly aimed at people that are not vaccinated, it will be mostly for people who are at highest risk of severe disease, and it needs to be given early in the treatment.”

Full text: iT is an irrefutable fact that the way out of the coronavirus pandemic is to rely on modern science and get vaccinated.
Depending on your personal circumstances – namely your age, your medical history and, currently, where you live – the path to inoculation looks a little different.
In Adelaide, for those under 40, it isn’t necessarily a straightforward process. Presently, people in this cohort can access an AstraZeneca jab following consultation with, and clearance from, a medical professional. The other option is to wait for a Pfizer jab, an option which rests on dose availability.
Prominent young South Australian businesspeople are today uniting to call on their peers to prioritise getting vaccinated.
They are also rightly urging authorities to pre-empt the inevitable surge in under-40s opting for the Pfizer vaccine when it becomes available to them.
A pre-registration system is an excellent suggestion to allow young people to signal their intent to be part of the solution and join the queue to be immunised against Covid-19. So, too, are calls for a workplace inoculation program or a targeted campaign to reach young people and reinforce the importance of being vaccinated – even if you consider yourself fit and healthy.
As more than 15 million Australians endure lockdowns while we enjoy freedoms and minimal restrictions, it’s important we don’t take the foot off the pedal when it comes to ensuring as many South Australians as possible are protected against this insidious virus.
Interstate, particularly in Queensland and NSW, the incidence of young people having contracted the highly infectious Delta variant of Covid-19 – and needing hospitalisation – is a wake-up call.
Further to this, Doherty Institute modelling shows deaths and hospitalisations would be nearly halved under a strategy to vaccinate all adults, as opposed to older people first.
While individual circumstances will vary and supply issues will dominate the timeline for some, just a glance beyond our borders proves there is no room for complacency or hesitancy. Responsibility for all editorial comment is taken by The Editor, Jessica Leo-Kelton, 31 Waymouth St, Adelaide, 5000

The comments by chief medical officer Paul Kelly (pictured) came as national cabinet signed off on Australia’s pathway to living with Covid-19, based on vaccination rates.
Prime Minister Scott Morrison and state and territory leaders stopped short, however, of committing to laws that would allow employers to make the jab compulsory across the board.
Queensland recorded 10 new locally acquired cases of coronavirus on Friday, bringing the current Delta strain cluster to a total of 89 infections.
Of the new cases, only two had been in the community for a single day. Professor Kelly, emerging from a meeting of national cabinet, said he was “much less concerned” about South East Queensland’s outbreak than he was about the growing crisis in NSW and the mystery cases impacting Victoria.
“Most of the cases (in Queensland) are being diagnosed whilst in quarantine and not infectious in the community and that control seems to be working,” Professor Kelly said.
He warned, particularly in the case of NSW, that Covid-19 had become a “pandemic of the unvaccinated”.
National cabinet has also signed off to the blueprint – based on Doherty Institute modelling – that will result in Australia “living with the virus” and limiting lockdowns to isolated occasions once 70 per cent of the community is vaccinated.
“Today it was confirmed and fully agreed that the national plan, that pathway to the position where we live with this virus,” Mr Morrison said.
He said while employers could make a “reasonable directive” for employees to get vaccinated, any direction would have to be “consistent with the law”.
Mr Morrison flagged particular scenarios where employers could mandate vaccinations for staff, including airline workers who can come into contact with people carrying the virus.
Other sectors could include people who work with the vulnerable – such as in aged care – and people who have public-facing roles, like retail, supermarkets and essential occupations.
“But ultimately employers need to consider these matters and make their own decisions remembering we do not have a mandatory vaccination policy in this country,” he said.
National cabinet also discussed the use of rapid antigen tests, with Mr Morrison signalling the tests were not appropriate while the country was still in the suppression stage of its Covid-19 response. Countries such as Singapore have rolled out at-home rapid antigen test kits so people can tests themselves for Covid-19, but Mr Morrison said at this stage it was vital health authorities were able to pick up all positive cases and deal with contact tracing.

Full text: Epidemiologists advising governments say Victorians will endure more frequent lockdowns until the end of the year because of Sydney's outbreak and the high infectiousness of the COVID-19 Delta variant.
Modelling by the Doherty Institute suggests lockdowns are needed about 40 per cent of the time while less than half of Australians remain vaccinated. By Thursday, 21.38 per cent of Australians aged over 16 were fully vaccinated.
This model assumes light restrictions and low levels of virus circulating when emerging from lockdown. However, it does not account for periods of virus elimination and could overestimate lockdown time.
Modelling by the University of Melbourne suggested Melbourne could expect to spend about a quarter of the year in lockdown. That modelling could underestimate the time as it was not based on the Delta variant.
The University of Melbourne's Jason Thompson said: "If your strategy is 'go hard, go early', but you can't control the incursions, you're going to be doing it a lot."

Full text: The COVID-19 fate of Australia's children is in the hands, or arms, of their parents.
"By vaccinating parents, you protect children," Doherty Institute director of epidemiology Jodie McVernon told reporters yesterday.
Professor McVernon identified young adults as peak transmitters, but said the modelling showed vaccinating children is "not an efficient strategy" at this stage of the pandemic. The research commissioned by the federal government is based on patterns from the past 18 months of coronavirus in an Australian population aged 16 and above.
The full technical report included some work on targeting 12 to 15-year-olds, but showed the reduction of transmission would be close to zero.
"I am a parent, I was a paediatrician before I was a public health doctor," Professor McVernon said.
"Children are very important. So a strategy that protects them as well as elders in the population and the working-age people we believe to be the best strategy at this time."
Prime Minister Scott Morrison acknowledged public health tools have been blunted by the more virulent Delta strain.
He said the virus would continue to evolve and the work on the best response "will never stop".
Professor McVernon said research over the next six months would look at the best approaches for children, balancing their health and education needs.
Data suggests children and adolescents are less likely to catch the virus and play a smaller role in transmission, but the evidence of the past 18 months does not reflect the impact of the Delta strain.
The Pfizer vaccine has been approved for use in children aged 12 to 15.

‘Let it rip’ would kill thousands

Full text: AUSTRALIA needs 70 per cent of under 60s and a whopping 95 per cent of seniors vaccinated to re-open safely and avoid thousands of deaths under an otherwise doomsday “let it rip” scenario, one of the nation’s leading research institutes has found.
Even then, face masks and some restrictions on gatherings would need to be reintroduced during danger periods to keep Covid-19 deaths below the annual flu toll, says Melbourne’s Burnet Institute.
Scott Morrison will discuss vax targets with state leaders on Friday in an effort to reach a consensus on how to ease restrictions, prevent lockdowns and reopen borders.
The Burnet’s modelling projects that about 3000 Victorians would die from the virus each year if Australia was to “let it rip” and abandon all measures completely. Because vaccines do not offer 100 per cent protection, Burnet’s head of modelling Dr Nick Scott said it was not yet possible to have open borders, no restrictions and no deaths at the same time. “Once we get high vaccine coverage we don’t need to just keep pulling out the lockdown as soon as we get a few cases.”

Border rules tighten in staged path to freedom

Full text: The Andrews government will tighten border controls as the state prepares to exit its fifth lockdown while keeping strict public health rules.
Victorians in NSW will be locked out for weeks, and the public health team is focused on ensuring the thousands of workers who cross the border each day pose minimal risk of spawning another COVID-19 outbreak and further lockdowns.
Other restrictions are expected to return to settings in force when Victoria emerged from its fourth lockdown in June, when schools reopened, home visits were still banned, hospitality businesses were limited to 100 patrons, masks were required inside and outdoors, and a 25-kilometre travel limit applied.
A government source, speaking anonymously to detail the plans, said the government would tighten the rules around border crossing for permitted workers and establish additional testing requirements in coming days. "It's all about protecting [against] further incursions," the source said.
The government's senior ministers were meeting late last night to finalise rules for the expected easing of restrictions at midnight. Any unexpected cases that were not in isolation for their infectious period could thwart the plan to end the strict lockdown, which had been extended by a week.
The strong clamps on activity, designed to limit social interaction while allowing business to reopen, are expected to run for a week before easing further if daily cases continue to dip.
Senior cabinet ministers were also weighing up whether to allow spectators at AFL matches this week, with one government source tipping fans would be barred until at least the following weekend, when Chief Health Officer Brett Sutton may have greater confidence the outbreak is controlled.
Public health officials are more concerned than ever about mass gatherings at sporting events after two significant outbreaks at the MCG and AAMI Park, where outdoor transmission is believed to have occurred.
Health Minister Martin Foley said the government was "on track" to lift the lockdown and he expected a "careful, staged" return of schooling would be part of the public health advice underpinning the easing of restrictions.
Mr Foley said the outbreaks at Trinity and Bacchus Marsh grammar schools were evidence that schools were risky sites in terms of transmission and he flagged Education Department plans to alter the logistical operation of schools to mitigate the risk.
Other settings when the state exited the fourth lockdown included the resumption of outdoor community sports. Some restaurants and pubs chose not to open at that time because operating under a 50-person indoor cap was not viable. Gyms remained closed and funerals and weddings were capped at 10 and 50 people respectively.
The 11 COVID-19 cases recorded in Victoria yesterday were all isolated for their infectious period - the second consecutive day this metric was achieved.
But Mr Foley said the daily tally was still significantly more than when the previous lockdown was lifted. Even though the cases were isolated, the high number was cause for caution, he said.
Nine of the 11 were household contacts of known cases, including two linked to Trinity Grammar; two to Bacchus Marsh Grammar; two to AAMI Park; two to the City of Hume cluster; and one to the Young & Jackson pub.
The two cases that were not household contacts were diners at the Ms Frankie restaurant in Cremorne. State COVID-19 response commander Jeroen Weimar praised the restaurant for its work in assisting authorities.
Melbourne University epidemiologist Tony Blakely said it was critical border rules were tightened to the maximum extent.
"It's ironic that soon after we halved the number of returned travellers to reduce risk at our international border, the risk was replaced by our domestic borders," he said, adding rapid antigen testing at the border could help mitigate the danger.
"If NSW wants to rock and roll with this virus ... we need to protect our border. It's not in Australia's interests to have the second-biggest state topple over as well as the biggest state."
Only essential workers, freight workers and people with compassionate exemptions are currently allowed to enter Victoria from NSW. Freight drivers are required to be tested every three days and minimise contact with people in Victoria. Removalists, who sparked part of the current outbreak on July 8, cannot enter from NSW.
NSW recorded two more deaths and 145 new cases of coronavirus yesterday, including at least 76 who were infectious in the community. The proportion of cases infectious in the community in NSW is not decreasing - a sign contact tracers are struggling to control the spread.
Contact tracers from Western Australia are assisting NSW tracers. Victoria has not offered help because officials are dealing with cases in their own state, but help may be provided when Victoria's outbreak ends.
In other developments yesterday, the AstraZeneca vaccine will soon be available for walk-up appointments in NSW after the Australian Technical Advisory Group on Immunisation recommended all adults in Sydney consider the shot.
Mr Foley said the Victorian government was consulting the advisory group to better understand updated advice on the locally made jab. People aged over 60 can receive AstraZeneca from Victorian vaccine hubs but those under 60 can receive it from GP clinics only.
Following reports the NSW government had financial modelling for stay-at-home orders to extend until September 17, Premier Gladys Berejiklian said it did not mean the lockdown would end on that date. "I wouldn't jump to any conclusions like that," she said.
Victoria currently has 190 active cases. State health authorities received 25,404 test results on Sunday and delivered 13,953 vaccine doses at state-run clinics. The tally of exposure sites was 365 yesterday afternoon, after exceeding 430 on Saturday morning.

Full text: Back in May, Melbourne was experiencing another outbreak of Covid-19, since driven to ground.
NSW Premier Gladys Berejiklian appeared on Sky News.
“I fear for Victoria and I worry about what their government may do,” she said. “We’ve demonstrated to other states that it is possible to manage an outbreak and not shut down a city.” In Victoria, we’ve copped a lot of hits from Covid. We’ve copped a lot condescending gibes from NSW politicians, too. Scott Morrison and Josh Frydenberg have made plain their views again and again: Victoria bad; NSW good.
We received the memo, loud and clear. What a shame the virus didn’t, and changed its behaviour accordingly. There are so many factors in play in outbreaks, and luck plays a part. As things stand right now, people in Victoria fear for the people of NSW and the rest of the nation.
Having lived through our long lockdown and learnt the hard way, we can see the errors being made. What we cannot understand is why others have not learnt from our mistakes.
It is clear to all that the Delta variant won’t respond to the lighter touch. During Victoria’s second wave, on day 38, 864 cases had been reported. In this outbreak, NSW locked down much earlier than we did yet reached this number on day 28.
The key number, the daily numbers of people infectious while in the community, is not dropping, and this spells trouble for us all. Hard questions need to be asked of the NSW government and they need to be asked now. If the NSW government really is trying to achieve zero transmission in the community before it lifts the lockdown, then why is it sticking with current settings?
On Thursday, NSW Treasurer Dominic Perrottet said on ABC radio, “I believe, as the Premier has said, the policy settings that we have in place will ensure that we get out of this lockdown as quickly as possible.” However, recently published modelling from the Burnet Institute suggests on current settings cases will still be at 40 a day in six weeks. Yet if settings were moved now to a hard lockdown, then that number would drop to below five.
If the government does not want to accept this modelling, then why hasn’t it done its own and shared it with the rest of the country?
From the outside looking in, the situation is baffling. Political differentiation is clearly being applied to a pandemic setting. At the same time, there is belligerent insistence that all decisions are being made on just the health advice. The lockdown is half-hearted and the health orders are confusing. The messages from the government are muddled and increasingly intemperate.
Employers and employees are supposed to agree between themselves whether work is essential and can be done from home. People are supposed to decide on what shopping is essential in the moment. At the same time, individual errors are detailed and people are ridiculed for their “stupidity”, which NSW Health Minister Brad Hazzard says cannot be legislated against.
At press briefings, responsibility for the lockdown length repeatedly is sheeted home to people doing the right thing. Yet the right thing cannot even be defined by the government when pressed. Instead, success or catastrophe is dependent on the various inter­pretations made at any given time by eight million people about a set of bewildering instructions.
It feels like the whole thing is a set-up for failure, designed by a government that won’t make the tough decisions or, worse, has an agenda it won’t reveal.
The narrative for the worst-case outcome has already been conveyed; if the lockdown drags on, if the outbreak gets out of control, the finger of blame will be pointed at constituents.
Up until this week, reporters at the press conferences hadn’t put much heat on the NSW Premier and her team. Now, though, it seems that everyone – except the NSW government – can see the current settings are not changing the trajectory of infections to the extent required for the lockdown to lift in a timely fashion.
On Thursday, a reporter demanded to know why the lockdown couldn’t be tightened, because “Victoria did it very successfully”. “No they did not,” Berejiklian scoffed, with a laugh and a shake of her head. As the questions continued to rain down, the Premier said it wasn’t very nice to be shouted at and left the podium, before returning to insist that she could see “green shoots”. Optimism is one thing but magical thinking is another.
Of great concern is that all the focus is on when the lockdown will end, not if. Success of this lockdown is not guaranteed. It is possible the virus may jump the soft settings and get beyond everyone, to spread throughout the nation. Victoria has 11 cases linked to the NSW outbreak. A snap lockdown is under way. Here is where the NSW government must be held to account. Its actions endanger its own people and the rest of the nation. Failure will cause misery, illness and death, and eliminate our one strategic advantage – isolation and international border closures.

New regulations for south-west could come into force today

Full text: Sydney's worst hit COVID hotspots face being plunged into a harder lockdown as early as today in a desperate bid to stop people moving across the city as 169 mystery cases spread through 20 council areas.
NSW crisis cabinet ministers were locked in health briefings last night after Premier Gladys Berejiklian foreshadowed more needed to be done to stop people moving across the city's south-west.
Options under consideration included limiting how far residents in Fairfield could travel beyond the council area, restrictions on exercise and tightening rules on some high-risk workplaces, such as those visited by a wide range of workers.
Sydney's outbreak passed 1000 COVID-19 cases yesterday, one month to the day since a positive test was reported in a Bondi limousine driver who transported three international FedEx crew members.
Half of the 169 unlinked cases are in the Fairfield area but mystery cases are spread across 20 local government areas from Randwick to Sutherland.
Ms Berejiklian said yesterday difficult decisions could be made to tighten restrictions, refusing to rule out targeting specific areas, such as south-west Sydney, where 67 of yesterday's cases were recorded.
Despite three weeks of lockdown, the number of cases infectious in the community has risen, with almost half of yesterday's 97 cases not fully quarantined while contagious. Ms Berejiklian has repeatedly said Sydney will not come out of lockdown until the number of cases infectious in the community reaches zero and Prime Minister Scott Morrison reiterated the strategy was for Victoria and NSW to "reduce as far as possible to zero the cases that are infectious in the community".
Australia's peak medical body yesterday warned Sydney could face an indefinite lockdown unless more was done to curb rising unlinked cases and people infectious in the community.
"Rising unlinked cases and people infectious in the community show we are not ahead of this outbreak," Australian Medical Association President Dr Omar Khorshid said. "This means there is no end to the lockdown insight and more needs to be done."
Melbourne is in a five-day snap lockdown, the city's fifth since the pandemic hit, leaving as many as 10 million people across NSW and Victoria in lockdown.
Ms Berejiklian yesterday warned the "number of people being infectious in the community keeps going up."
When Sydney was plunged into lockdown on June 26 there were only two unlinked cases.
The number of cases who have been hospitalised or entered intensive care has steadily grown in the past month, with 75 COVID-19 cases now in Sydney's hospitals, including 18 in intensive care. Chief Health Officer Kerry Chant said just one of the state's ICU cases had been vaccinated: a person who had received one dose of the AstraZeneca vaccine.
There were 77,587 tests yesterday, a record for any day since the pandemic started, with 11,000 tests recorded in Fairfield council area. From today, essential workers who live in the area but work elsewhere will need to present for a swab every three days. Health authorities continue to warn workplaces are a concern, after 13 cases from two adjacent construction sites at Greenacre were detected in the past week.
Professor Adrian Esterman, an epidemiologist at the University of South Australia, said with the reproduction rate, sometimes referred to as Reff, at more than one it "will be difficult to see a significant drop in cases unless further restrictions come in."
"The Reff has been coming down, but it is still over one. At the moment for every five infected people they would infect one other," said Professor Esterman, who emphasised that closing non-essential retail could further restrict movement. "NSW went too late and much too light. Melbourne has gone in quickly and harshly and stand a chance to crush the virus."
Modelling released by the Burnet Institute this week predicted cases would plateau about 30 a day under the current settings but decline to single digits within weeks if Sydney moved to the restrictions in place during Melbourne's long lockdown last year.
University of Sydney modelling released on Thursday suggested the existing level of social distancing was inadequate for infection control, with residents needing to reduce their movements, such as shopping, to one-tenth of their regular social interactions to see cases reduce within a month.
La Trobe University epidemiologist Dr Joel Miller said further restricting movement would "allow contact tracers to get ahead of the game."
"Restricting movement outside to certain times of day could make it easier to cut down ... the number of people out and about."
Dr Miller said while it was possible numbers could reach single digits with existing restrictions they would "have to be in place for a while."
The front line of Sydney's COVID-19 outbreak has widened from family homes to workplaces across the city, with cases emerging at the WestConnex Rozelle interchange site, hospitals and a Rooty Hill aged care facility. About 200 cleaners refused to enter the COVID unit at Sydney's Westmead hospital yesterday morning amid the city's growing outbreak, saying they are being denied requests for hairnets, shoe coverings, mask fit testing and on-site showers after their shift.

Full text: The random nature of COVID-19 makes it impossible to know if Victoria's small outbreak will lead to sustained infections or simply peter out, experts say.
That means government policy - restrictions and lockdowns - depend on how much risk-appetite Premier Daniel Andrews and his ministers have. Yesterday afternoon, the Premier announced a snap five-day lockdown after Victoria recorded 10 cases on Wednesday.
Federal government tracking suggests Victorians lead the nation in social distancing. But the Delta variant - perhaps 60 per cent more infectious than the virus that first left Wuhan - has upped the stakes.
It is not really possible to know if a lockdown is necessary at this stage, said Dr Jason Thompson, a University of Melbourne modeller who worked on the Victorian government's epidemic modelling.
"What our models say is sometimes the infections burn out naturally, because people who are infected don't come into contact with anyone or just stay in their house. And sometimes it takes off," he said.
"People talk about the stochastic, or random, nature of these things, and that's it. Occasionally it takes off, and occasionally it dies off.
"You simply don't know."
This is driven by a key feature of COVID-19: many infected people simply do not pass on the virus, at least for earlier variants.
But a small number of infected people are super-spreaders.
Victoria witnessed this when an infected person spent a night at several bars in Chapel Street, and did not pass on the virus at all.
"The wrong people have to get it. Like the removalist, who goes to several homes and spends lots of time there," said Dr Michael Lydeamore, a Monash University researcher who is contributing to federal government epidemic forecasts.
Mobility data from Google suggests Victorians were moving around far less than usual even before today's lockdown was announced - a legacy of our recent lockdown.
"We've never had two lockdowns so close together like this. It's going to be harder this time, and the journey out, slower," said mobility analyst Rohan Byrne. "Still, I'm optimistic. The data and the anecdotal evidence agree: we Melburnians have gotten really good at this."
Federal government data, based on mobility surveys, suggests Victoria's "transmission potential" - how effectively we are social distancing - remains the lowest of any state in Australia other than locked-down NSW.
In earlier phases of the pandemic, this would give us confidence about the new cases. But Delta changes the game, experts said. Federal government modelling assumes it is about 60 per cent more transmissible than the original virus.
When Dr Thompson places Delta in his models, "it just looks like a massive explosion if you don't control it".
La Trobe University epidemiologist Dr Joel Miller said he would be watching the identity of any cases found for clues as to whether more cases were likely.
"We don't know for sure what the current situation is," he said. "So we don't know for sure if a lockdown is needed or if we might be able to control it with just contact tracing.
"However, if it turns out we do need a lockdown, then a delayed lockdown is a longer lockdown."
A study on Victoria's second wave, funded by the Victorian Health Department and co-authored by Chief Health Officer Brett Sutton, found masks made the strongest contribution to bringing the outbreak under control.
Mandatory face-masks cut transmission by between 31 and 46 per cent while physical distancing cut it by between 6 and 28 per cent.

Lockdowns ‘can stop in two months’

Full text: Epidemiologists believe there will be sufficient Australians fully vaccinated within the next two months to make lockdowns unnecessary in any state.
As the number of vaccinations hit a daily record of more than 163,000 on Friday, Deakin University’s chair in epidemiology Catherine Bennett said the proportion of people fully vaccinated to avoid the need for lockdowns would be in the order of 30 per cent – a prospect that was likely to be only a couple of months away.
“Thirty per cent is probably enough that it slows the spread of the virus and means contact tracers should be able to do their job,” she said. “It should mean that we’re less likely to need to go to these extreme measures.” Once the vaccination rate reached between 50 and 65 per cent of a population, transmission of Covid-19 was significantly slowed, allowing the easing of restrictions and a gradual opening of international borders while keeping mitigation measures such as home quarantine in place.
More than 30 per cent of Australians now have received at least one vaccine dose, with 7,970,153 doses administered. The proportion of the population fully vaccinated is 8.37 per cent, and this will rise quickly within the coming weeks with millions of people scheduled to receive their second AstraZeneca shot.
Almost all residential aged-care facilities have been visited for first and second doses, with only three more facilities remaining for second-dose visits.
International modelling has indicated that vaccine coverage of about 80 per cent would be required to allow for fully open borders and the easing of all restrictions aimed at curbing Covid-19. Professor Bennett said Australia might never get to that level.
“Eighty per cent coverage is what people would like to see, but that’s completely opening up and removing your quarantine,” Professor Bennett said.
“So it’s about how you step your way up to that. But at the end of the day, I think if you say ‘actually, we’re opening up the borders regardless at the end of March’, because that’s when everyone can be vaccinated, then I think you can’t be saying ‘we haven’t quite met the 80 per cent, therefore we’re not going to do it’.” The federal government has commissioned modelling to identify the threshold of vaccination required to begin to open up international borders and that work is not yet complete.
Burnet Institute director Brendan Crabb said announcing that the threshold level was yet to be determined was “honest” of the Prime Minister.
“The reason why being cautious is important is because you can start to open without relying on some force shield immunity,” Professor Crabb said. “Of course we want herd immunity, that’s the ultimate goal, but we could be waiting forever for that.” He said a minimum threshold for beginning to open up borders in a managed way was 60 per cent of all people vaccinated, including children.
“If your only goal is preventing serious illness and death you’d need less vaccine coverage than if your goal was preventing all transmission,” he said. “But I think 60 per cent is the point at which you can start to think there is a chance that community-based immunity is going to stop transmission chains.
“What should be the aim is high enough vaccine coverage with non-vaccine mitigations including mask wearing, the judicious use of border protection and, most importantly, well-ventilated workplaces and recreational facilities of any sort.” La Trobe University epidemiologist Hassan Vally agreed about 60 per cent vaccine coverage was likely to have a significant impact on disease transmission and would see minimal deaths and hospitalisations. But he was doubtful herd immunity could ever be achieved.

“What should be the aim is high enough vaccine coverage with non-vaccine mitigations including mask wearing, the judicious use of border protection and, most importantly, well-ventilated workplaces and recreational facilities of any sort.” La Trobe University epidemiologist Hassan Vally agreed about 60 per cent vaccine coverage was likely to have a significant impact on disease transmission and would see minimal deaths and hospitalisations. But he was doubtful herd immunity could ever be achieved.

Full text: THOUSANDS of Covid-19 doses have been “quarantined” and could be thrown out after storm damage cut power to a vaccine centre.
The Health Department said 2000 AstraZeneca doses had been quarantined for “further assessment of viability”, after power was lost at the Eastern Health Lilydale vaccination site.
“This is a small fraction of the AstraZeneca doses we currently have in stock and it will not impact the broader vaccine rollout,” she said.
“Victorians have continued to come forward for vaccination in record numbers, ­despite extreme weather in recent days.” The Herald Sun has been told at least one elderly woman was turned away from her first scheduled jab.
“She turned up for her appointment and was told the power was out and all the vaccines in the fridge had to be thrown out,” her son said.
It came as Melburnians enjoyed their first taste of partial freedom, with no new locally acquired cases on Friday. Certain restrictions remain in place over the long weekend.
City restaurants – including Yeah Boy in Windsor, which for a week will shout a free round of cocktails to groups of four or more – are limited to groups of no more than 10, and only 50 people indoors, with no visitors at homes and masks mandatory indoors and out.
In a bizarre ruling, it was ­revealed on Friday that despite NSW allowing Victorians to fly there, local restrictions barred them from driving to the airport if they lived more than 25km away.
Acting Premier James Merlino and chief health officer Brett Sutton defended the calls, saying the risks were ­“nowhere near over”.
Professor Sutton warned cases were likely to emerge among new close contacts, but said it was “not a concern as they are all quarantined for the entire period”.
He refused to provide any reassurance that restrictions would ease further next week.
Elective surgery will resume next week after tens of thousands of procedures were ­cancelled.
“It’s a balancing act. You don’t want to open up to the extent that there’s a really significant risk of this variant, any variant, running away,” Professor Sutton said.
“The risk remains and (there is) so many lessons from overseas of what that looks like. We’re moving by increments, and we’re moving safely. We’re not wanting to impose things that are excessive ... it’s always under ­review.” The Saturday Herald Sun can reveal new government modelling shows the latest lockdown prevented Covid-19 being transmitted to thousands of Victorians.
Based on the cluster pattern when Melbourne went into lockdown on May 27, the Burnet Institute modelled four scenarios. It found that without lockdown and with only the mask-wearing rule and work-from-home restrictions, there could have been up to 2000 cases by August.
Adding density limits reduced predicted cases to 1500, while numbers fell to about 250 with a partial lockdown and limits on social gatherings.
The only scenario that avoided an ongoing accumulation of cases was a lockdown, the modelling found.
Opposition Leader Michael O’Brien said small businesses had been “thrown under a bus” and were being “left behind” due to the ongoing restrictions.
Genomic sequencing has confirmed the family of four from the Reservoir house at the centre of the latest scare have all been identified as carrying the Kappa strain of virus.

No easing of restrictions despite key milestone

Full text: Premier Daniel Andrews has ruled out bringing forward the easing of coronavirus restrictions despite Victoria achieving a key milestone of 14 consecutive "double doughnut" days with no new COVID-19 cases.
The state's 14-day rolling case average has now dropped to zero, hitting the target about 10 days earlier than the state government's original modelling.
But Mr Andrews said Victorians would have to wait until next Sunday, November 22, for an announcement about further restrictions being lifted.
"I'd love to make all sorts of announcements today that all sorts of restrictions are off but it would not be safe," he said yesterday. "Fourteen days of zero is not the same as having a vaccine ... it is only one incubation period of the virus."
State Opposition Leader Michael O'Brien accused the Premier of shifting the goal posts "yet again".
He said Victorians were promised they could "get their lives back" when no cases were recorded for two weeks - a trigger for relaxed restrictions in the initial road map.
"Families won't get that opportunity to have family and friends over ... [and] businesses won't get the chance to open up with density limits," he said. "We've got 14 days of doughnuts, but the Premier is giving us doughnuts in terms of eased restrictions."
However, Roy Morgan research reveals widespread support for the current rules, with 75 per cent of those surveyed approving of the 10-person limit on visitors to Melbourne homes from November 22 and 65 per cent of Victorians in favour of compulsory masks.
Mr Andrews said masks were a low-cost measure with a high return. "They won't be here with us forever but they will as long as they serve a very important purpose — almost like an insurance policy," he said as he announced the state government would invest $155 million in a new Australian Institute of Infectious Disease in Melbourne.
Doherty Institute director Sharon Lewin, who is a member of the Victorian COVID Advisory Group, said mandatory masks would not be required if community transmission was stamped out. "I'd imagine they are not going to be with us forever," she said. "But it will take a bit of time to have confidence that there is no community transmission."
The government's road map out of lockdown states that Victoria will take the last step towards COVID-normal when it records no new cases for more than 14 days. Its original modelling predicted that this milestone would not be achieved until about November 23.
There are just three active cases of coronavirus in the state and one mystery case with no known source.
Under the initial plan, public gatherings were set to increase to 50 people outdoors and up to 20 visitors a time in homes. The updated plan for easing at 11.59pm on November 22 scaled back the number of people allowed in homes to 10 visitors but maintains gatherings of 50 people outdoors.
Back in September, health experts expressed doubt that Victoria would hit the hard targets for reopening before Christmas.
The last time Victoria had a 14-day case average of zero was on February 22. Back then, only four cases had been confirmed statewide and there had been three weeks in a row of no new cases, a streak that was broken when two returned travellers tested positive for the virus the following day.
And when Melbourne was plunged into its second lockdown on August 2, the 14-day average had climbed to 408 new cases per day.
The Premier declared yesterday that the days of entire workforces flocking to city offices was over.
"The notion that every worker will be spending every hour where they used to work is gone," he said. "That won't be the function of rules, that will be the function of the choices people will make after spending the best part of a year working from home."
Mr Andrews said the government was keen to get people back to the office as soon as possible, but it had to be done safely, otherwise it would compromise everything Victorians had worked so hard for.

Full text: Health experts have condemned the Victorian government’s decision to retain restrictions on how far Melburnians can travel from their homes, questioning the public health benefit of the policy.
From Monday, Melbourne residents will be allowed to travel within a 25km radius from their homes, up from the current 5km limit, as long as they don’t cross any of the borders between the city and regional Victoria.
However, Premier Daniel Andrews was unable to explain on Sunday why the government settled on the particular metric other than to stop people congregating at popular places such as the beach.
Deakin University infectious diseases specialist Catherine Bennett said she was surprised by the government’s decision to retain the restriction. She said the 5km rule had been due to be scrapped when the state moved to its third stage for easing restrictions. “I’m not sure what 25km gives us and I don’t know how you’d police that,” Professor Bennett said.
“Frankly, if you’re worried about popular beaches or the Dandenongs getting flooded (with visitors) it would be a much more efficient use of police resources to manage those locations.” Canberra Hospital infectious diseases physician and microbiologist Peter Collignon, also a professor at Australian National University, described travel restriction as ineffective in regards to containing the spread of coronavirus, which was significantly more likely to be transmitted ­indoors.
“Fundamentally, it doesn’t do much,” Professor Collignon said. “Provided people are keeping to the rules when they go out, it doesn’t matter if they travel 25km or 50km or 100km as long as they stay within that defined boundary.” Professor Collignon said outdoor gatherings were not a significant risk for spreading the virus.
“Remember it’s people crowded in staffrooms, in workplaces, essential workers, that’s where the virus has spread,” he said.
“And the 5km limit hasn’t made any difference in regards to that.” Victorian Deputy Health Officer Allen Cheng hinted to the limits being expanded last week and said that modelling on scenarios was being carried out.
However, the government did not release any updated modelling on Sunday. The Burnet Institute, which has previously provided modelling work for Victoria’s Department of Health and Human Services, was unable to comment on whether it had been asked to provide specific advice around the limits.
“There is no updated Burnet research (available) for public release,” a spokeswoman for the institute said.
Mr Andrews defended the new limit on Sunday and said its ­purpose was to ensure that “we don’t end up with people from the northern suburbs travelling all the way down to other suburbs where there’s not been much virus”.  “I can’t attribute a percentage dividend or a percentage benefit in public health to it,” he said.
“It’s one of a ­series of measures.” Asked why 25km was chosen, Mr Andrews said “it’s one of those things you need to make a call on”.
“Some might want it to be 30, some might not want it at all,” he said. “It’s not an easy call to make. We think it’s the right thing to do, it will limit movement (and) will stop larger groups congregating.”

Where to now for Melbourne?

Full text: It's time to restore some freedoms, but caution is key and we must be realistic about what lies ahead.
It has been a disconcerting two weeks. Five-day COVID-19 numbers have stubbornly refused to go below 10 cases per day and have even started increasing again. It is now mathematically impossible that we are going to achieve the target set out in the road map of an average of five new cases per day to release to step three on October 19.
The second target, fewer than five mystery cases in the past 14 days, looks unlikely. I can run arguments both ways - to release to step three on October 19, and to not release to step three.
The argument to release is as follows. First, the modelling myself and colleagues provided to the Victorian Department of Health and Human Services that underpinned the road map suggested a 10 per cent chance of a third wave by Christmas if we released at an average of 10 cases per day - compared to 3 per cent for releasing at five per day. A 10 per cent risk is not that much more than 3 per cent - a risk worth taking.
Second, we have learnt from NSW that the virus can be controlled at low levels without lockdowns - with a good dose of luck. Third, the last two steps of the road map are actually elimination steps. Given both the stubborn tail we are now in, and the fact NSW has had a modest resurgence and has made it utterly clear they think long-run elimination is impossible, it is near pointless for Victoria to overtly pursue elimination.
Fourth, we are completely over lockdown. Socially and economically. Our young people in particular are having their lives seriously affected. Life is dull, and the economy is hurting.
On the other hand, the argument to not release has merit too.
First, I and my colleagues have been engaging in more modelling. We are trying to design clever strategies that - if elimination is not possible - will keep the daily case numbers at a reasonably constant level over the next months and year. No matter how clever I think my strategies are (carefully designed triggers when case numbers go up to quickly tighten restrictions, cautious triggers to release social restrictions when numbers are low again), the future daily numbers still yo-yo. In and out of stage three and even stage four lockdowns to prevent an explosion of case numbers. With a cycle of about 100 days. If we release on October 19, the next lockdown may not occur by Christmas but perhaps soon after.
Second, and related, we can see on the TV news how most of Europe is heading back into lockdowns after relaxing for a while. Third, simple logic tells us that if the case numbers now have plateaued following our last modest opening up on September 28, they will go up again if we open up further on October 19. Bugger. So how might we open up a bit more and beat the model? Nothing is guaranteed. But here are my thoughts.
We need to prioritise what we open up. Children back to school is essential - with as many measures as possible to prevent schools becoming a transmission setting.
But people like me going back to work is not a priority - those of us who can keep working at home, keep working at home.
As citizens, we cannot drop our guard. We have to keep social distance, try to keep social contact as much as possible to our family and immediate "bubble", and wear masks when unable to maintain social distance. And get tested with any symptoms or if a contact of a (suspected) case. Quid pro quo, the citizenry of Victoria - especially metro Melbourne - need some sanity-restoring but minor reinstitution of liberties. The five-kilometre radius has to go. My life expectancy is shortening by the day as my girth grows while my bicycle is chained up. Surely I could ride up the Dandenongs again - so long as not in a big-bunch ride.
We need to cautiously capitalise on summer. While mosh-pit and pumping pub band venues are not going to happen again until we have a vaccine, we can close down Lygon Street and enjoy al fresco dining and socialising - in your immediate bubble, at tables well spread out.
This has been and continues to be the worst of years, and we need to front up to 2021 probably not being much better. Living with the virus requires all our smarts and nous to claw back some liberties and the "good things" we love about Melbourne and Victoria, but we will not get to anything like pre-COVID normal. Unless we either eliminate (no longer an option) or go nuclear with a massive wave of infection and thousands of deaths (which is not on the table).
My prediction, and indeed my prescription, is that we have to open up a bit more on October 19. But it should not be as much opening up as the road map laid out in going from step two to three.
We need to prioritise those loosenings we value the most. We also need to lift our understanding and discussion. I hate to be the bringer of bad news, but if we do open up more on the 19th it is very likely that at some point in the future - hopefully after Christmas - we will have to tighten up again. I hope I am wrong, but I fear yo-yoing between step two and step three is our most likely - even most optimistic - trajectory until we get a vaccine.
To maximise how much we can open up, and for how long, we need to all behave COVID-safe. And, critically, our contact tracing and testing has to be top notch.

Full text: Melbourne remains three weeks away from a substantial easing of coronavirus restrictions that would allow the multi-billion-­dollar hospitality and retail industries to reopen, prompting Scott Morrison to urge a faster lockdown exit and improved contact tracing.
Five million Melburnians still cannot leave home without limit­ations, even after the curfew has been lifted, with Premier Daniel Andrews’ “safe and steady” strategy a blow for many businesses.
The Prime Minister said it was important that Victoria do more in the weeks ahead to safely ease ­restrictions, noting that at similar case levels, NSW remained fundamentally open and “COVIDsafe” because of its world-class tracing facility.
Mr Morrison urged Victoria to review its current trigger of five daily cases to move to the third step, and zero new cases for the final step.
“Easing restrictions in Victoria in a COVIDsafe way is vitally important so that more Vic­torians can get back to work and resume their normal lives,” he said in a joint statement with Josh Frydenberg and Health Minister Greg Hunt. “Today’s announcement is a small but important step in that direction. It will be important that more be done in the weeks ahead to safely ease more restrictions.” Unveiling the steps out of stage-four restrictions on Sunday, Mr Andrews said the timeline for future easing could be fast-tracked if case numbers dropped faster than previously anticipated.
The Victorian Premier also announced the scrapping of the curfew — which has confined five million Melburnians to their homes between the hours of 8pm (recently changed to 9pm) and 5am for the past eight weeks — following public health advice that it was no longer needed.
Announcing modest changes affecting work, education, social gatherings and healthcare practices as part of metropolitan Melbourne’s second step out of lockdown, Mr Andrews said case numbers were falling ahead of schedule, which would enable further decisions on easing restrictions on October 19.
In the meantime, from 11.59pm last night, Melburnians were permitted to gather publicly in groups of five to socialise, exercise with a personal trainer and attend small outdoor religious ceremonies. Weddings are allowed with only five people, including the two to be married.
Childcare centres can reopen without the need for parents to apply for a permit and restrictions on in-home childminding will also be lifted.
Once-daily shopping restrictions will be scrapped, and residential property inspections can resume.
Almost 130,000 Melburnians will be permitted to return to work — largely in construction, wholesale trade and manufacturing industries — and all primary school students will be back in class by the second week of term two.
There have been no changes to the restrictions affecting the city’s ravaged hospitality and retail industries, sparking criticism that the measures don’t go far enough.
Mr Andrews acknowledged that Sunday’s changes didn’t go as far as many Victorians would have wanted but urged the community to be patient. He said ­future decisions would be based solely on case numbers and not tied to previously outlined dates.
“There’s just three weeks to go before we can take a really big step,” he said. “We are at least a week ahead of schedule but we must wait and see how things unfold over these next three weeks.” Victoria reported 16 new cases on Sunday, of which 10 were linked to aged-care centres.
It was the fifth consecutive day of cases in the low-teens. The last time Victoria reported successive days with cases that low was mid-June. Active cases numbers dropped to 399, the lowest level since June 30.
Two deaths were reported.
Multiple models relied upon by the government, including new modelling from the Burnet Institute that takes into account data from Victoria’s second wave outbreak, suggest the state was likely to reach a 14-day average of five cases a day between October 12 and 17, ahead of the October 26 target.
Such a milestone was to be the trigger for moving to the third stage of easing restrictions under the state’s recovery roadmap.
However, according to a summary of the latest evidence relied upon by the government, the new modelling has highlighted that opening too soon would be “dangerous”.
“Easing restrictions now would mean that bars and clubs could open, all workplaces could return, and small public gatherings could recommence,” says the summary document.
“Burnet Institute found that opening up too quickly would result in a 41 per cent chance of a third wave within four weeks. Reopening too soon risks wasting all the sacrifices Victorians have made over the last few months.” Mr Andrews said the current strategy was designed “to get us to a COVID-normal Christmas” “We are well on track, in fact we are ahead of time, when it comes to achieving that outcome,” he said.
“There are no short cuts.
“If we can stay the course, if we can just find it in ourselves to get this job done over the next three weeks, we will be able to take even bigger steps on October 19.” The significant decline in mystery cases across the state was attributed to the government’s decision to drop its curfew, which is subject to a legal challenge before the Victorian Supreme Court.
Victoria’s Chief Health Officer, Brett Sutton, said 15 of the 16 new cases reported on Sunday were linked to known cases or clusters. “The community cases we’re seeing are now very small in number,” Professor Sutton said.
“We’re getting to one, two, three community cases a day.
“It’s my view and the public health team’s view that the curfew is not a proportionate measure to have in place going forward.” In its place, those who breach health directions by having gatherings in private homes face a fine of almost $5000, up from $1652.
Sunday’s changes drew a lukewarm response from industry and business and calls for the roadmap to be accelerated.
Victorian Ai Group head Tim Piper said Sunday’s announcements were a “step in the right direction” but left many businesses “extremely vulnerable”.
He called for “sensible, reasonable and proportionate” easing of restrictions and targeting of future restrictions at areas of risk rather than the general community. “We welcome the sensible changes to manufacturing arrangements, meat processing and abattoir arrangements in metro and regional areas and to the food distribution wholesaling employee numbers,” Mr Piper said.
“There remains uncertainty for businesses given the suppression strategy that threatens to permanently suppress businesses as well as the virus.” The Victorian head of the Australian Hotels Association, David Canny, was disappointed that metropolitan Melbourne venues still could not open for business despite their willingness to operate within a COVIDsafe model.

Full text: Melbourne remains three weeks away from a substantial easing of coronavirus restrictions that would allow the multi-billion-­dollar hospitality and retail industries to reopen, prompting Scott Morrison to urge a faster lockdown exit and improved contact tracing.
Five million Melburnians still cannot leave home without limit­ations, even after the curfew has been lifted, with Premier Daniel Andrews’ “safe and steady” strategy a blow for many businesses.

Full text: MELBURNIANS could be freed from lockdown by early to mid October if COVID-19 cases continue to plummet.
As epidemiologists predict Victoria’s 14-day average will dip below five cases a day within a fortnight, it is believed the government could reopen the city ahead of schedule.
That would allow up to 10 Melburnians to gather outdoors to watch the AFL Grand Final on October 24.
Under the current road map, Melbourne’s lockdown will not be lifted until after October 26, on the proviso that Victoria hits the case target.
But on Sunday, Daniel Andrews left the door open to easing restrictions sooner, saying “I’ve never ruled that out”.
“We will always be guided by those three things: the evidence and the science, the data and what is deemed safe,” the Premier said. “We are on schedule. We may even be a bit ahead of schedule, but we’ve got to keep going.” The Herald Sun believes the government would abandon the October 26 date if the cases target is met and it is deemed safe to do so.
It would allow public gatherings to be increased to 10 people, shops to reopen, ­restaurants to offer outdoor dining and the end of the ­curfew.
The government’s modelling expert, Professor Tony Blakely of Melbourne University, said the state was tracking well ahead of schedule.
On Sunday, Victoria recorded just 14 new cases — a three-month low — with the 14-day average dropping to just 38.4.
Basic modelling carried out by Prof Blakely, provided to the Herald Sun, shows daily cases could fall to 10 and the two-week average to 20 by September 28.
“We are on a good track if the recent past predicts the near future,” he said, while warning a moderate cluster in Melbourne could change the predictions. “If we are aiming for tight suppression, which I am led to believe we are, and it is consistent with opening up borders and a hot spot strategy, then there is a case for considering opening up to step three earlier than October 26.” However, Prof Blakely said the government needed to factor in three weeks between a minor easing of restrictions on September 28 and the next step out of lockdown.
Melbourne University head of population and global health Nancy Baxter said the rapid fall in cases gave her ­confidence Victoria could dip below the five-case average within a fortnight.
“It’s going to be at least a week and a bit from now, because even if we got down to almost zero, we have the tail, the numbers from the past 14 days, adding into our averages,” Prof Baxter said. “If we’re doing really well, I’d say we might even be a couple of weeks early.” Deakin University head of epidemiology Catherine Bennett said Victoria’s testing and tracing had improved dramatically in the second wave, giving her reason to believe the state government could bring some easing measures forward.
“If it did keep travelling then we would be below five (case average over 14 days) by the end of the month,” Prof Bennett said.
“Hopefully, that means the government now has more confidence to reset some of those markers (thresholds) — if even if not the numbers, then the dates.” Prime Minister Scott Morrison believed thousands of Victorian jobs could “bounce back” by Christmas if the state government handled the “next step right”.
Treasurer Josh Frydenberg urged Victoria to open up as soon as possible. tamsin.rose@news.com.au SHANNON DEERY, PAGE 22

Melbourne University head of population and global health Nancy Baxter said the rapid fall in cases gave her ­confidence Victoria could dip below the five-case average within a fortnight.
“It’s going to be at least a week and a bit from now, because even if we got down to almost zero, we have the tail, the numbers from the past 14 days, adding into our averages,” Prof Baxter said. “If we’re doing really well, I’d say we might even be a couple of weeks early.” Deakin University head of epidemiology Catherine Bennett said Victoria’s testing and tracing had improved dramatically in the second wave, giving her reason to believe the state government could bring some easing measures forward.
“If it did keep travelling then we would be below five (case average over 14 days) by the end of the month,” Prof Bennett said.
“Hopefully, that means the government now has more confidence to reset some of those markers (thresholds) — if even if not the numbers, then the dates.” Prime Minister Scott Morrison believed thousands of Victorian jobs could “bounce back” by Christmas if the state government handled the “next step right”.

Full text: THE threshold for reopening Melbourne may be eased amid mounting concerns the Andrews government’s COVID-19 targets are too cautious and unreasonable.
Premier Daniel Andrews on Saturday conceded the expectation for Melbourne to drop below five coronavirus cases per day before he lifts Stage 4 restrictions may be scrapped or watered down.
Although Victoria’s Chief Health Officer Prof Brett Sutton said the target was “within our grasp”, he also warned a decision may have to be made to reopen the city before all community transmissions were eliminated.
The concessions came after one of the experts whose research was used by the government to justify the continued Stage 4 lockdown said the target of fewer than five daily cases was too tough.
The road map released by Mr Andrews last Sunday demands an average of fewer than five daily coronavirus cases across two weeks, and a maximum of five mystery cases in 14 days, before curfews and stay-at-home orders are dropped.
However, the Premier appeared to step away from the strict target, saying the targets were being constantly reviewed.
“This is not an academic exercise, this is life, it is real and we have to lock in some settings and then push to achieve those targets,” Mr Andrews said. “On the issue of the achievability or otherwise, we look at putting the data in every single day, we keep running the models, we will see how things unfold day-to-day, week-to-week and we will use common sense.
“We have at no point said these are stone tablets and can never be changed.” As revealed by News Corp on Saturday, University of Melbourne professorial fellow in epidemiology Tony Blakely – who co-authored modelling relied on to extend the lockdown – said the target to release was “too stringent”.
Victoria is on track to meet the average of fewer than five daily cases by October 26, but Prof Blakely said he would have aimed for an average of 10 cases a day.
Metropolitan Melbourne’s 14-day coronavirus daily case average has dropped to 61.6 on Saturday, while regional Victoria’s hit 4.3.

Full text: It's been welcome to see governments taking expert health advice during the pandemic. But on the issue of ultimate responsibility, situations can become tricky, as Annastacia Palaszczuk and Daniel Andrews found this week.
When an agitated Palaszczuk said on Thursday she had told Scott Morrison it was up to the chief health officer to rule on whether to allow a woman out of quarantine to attend her father's funeral, it was a case of the adviser being "on top" rather than "on tap".
Palaszczuk said she'd made it "very clear" to Morrison that "it is not my decision. It is the chief health officer's decision to make".
CHO Jeannette Young later allowed Sarah Caisip to view her father's body but not go to the funeral, saying funerals are "very, very high risk" for COVID-19 transmission.
It was an excessively cautious weighing of danger versus compassion.
Caisip - whose battle with Queensland bureaucracy began before her father's death - had travelled from Canberra, which hasn't had new cases for a couple of months and shouldn't even be classified a "hotspot". It's only so defined because it sits within NSW.
The chance of Caisip being a carrier of COVID-19 appears minimal. It was taking things to an extreme to refuse to allow her to be with her mother and 11-year-old sister at the funeral.
Did the Premier use the health guru as a convenient shield to hide behind? Or was she (rather than the PM) right about who had the power? And if so, is that how things should work?
Graeme Orr, professor of law at the University of Queensland, says it's clear the law provides that only a public health officer can let someone out of quarantine to go to a funeral. "Also, under the crime and corruption law it would be highly inappropriate for a minister to intervene," he says.
Regardless of where the formal power rested, the affair has been damaging for the Premier and the CHO, and showed that if Queensland is to keep its border closed, more flexibility is needed in the system to deal better with compassionate cases.
With the state election looming next month, it is a bad time to get constructive dealings between the Morrison and Palaszczuk governments.
After their phone conversation, Palaszczuk accused Morrison of trying to bully her, a claim rejected by his office.
Queensland government sources said the PM was belligerent, yelled and said "you will do this"; the Premier had reminded him it was R U OK? day.
Prime-ministerial sources said Palaszczuk flew off the handle when the PM said "you can do this, you are the Premier, it's within your power".
Whether or not Morrison adopted a bullying tone - or the premier heard it that way - is beside the point. Palaszczuk is a tough, experienced politician, quite able to stand up for herself.
While Palaszczuk was deferring to her health official, Victorian Premier Daniel Andrews was defending himself after the revelation Victoria's curfew had not been driven by the advice of chief health officer Brett Sutton.
Both Sutton and Police Chief Commissioner Shane Patton this week said recommendations for it hadn't come from them.
Dealing with a barrage of questions, Andrews, who has leaned heavily on health advice throughout COVID-19, declared: "The chief health officer is not the government." Who'd have thought?
Andrews couldn't provide clarity on the curfew's precise origin. But it is there, it seems, because it makes things simpler. If citizens are required to lock themselves in at night, the authorities have fewer people to chase up to determine whether they have a legitimate reason to be out. It's a stretch.
Like Palaszczuk, Andrews is coming under mounting pressure for taking things to extremes.
Ironically, a Victorian road map based on expertise is being undermined by argument among experts.
Many of those with specialist knowledge suggest Victoria could move more quickly to ease restrictions.
Tony Blakely, an epidemiologist from Melbourne University who had a hand in the modelling, thinks Victoria could open "a bit faster" and "maybe the curfew could be dropped".
Blakely gives the road map near full marks, but believes it falls short on the proposed October transition by being too stringent.

Increasingly, as the week went by, the state government started emphasising there was room for tweaking if the advice allowed it.
The pandemic has brought into focus the role of experts, but as it goes on we see a more complicated picture emerging than the initial set of circumstances which prompted many to say "Isn't it great the politicians are following those who know what they're talking about?".
The months have shown not just the value of experts but also how experts in a fast-moving crisis can know a lot less than they appear to. Some of the propositions the federal health advisers advanced at COVID-19's start turned out to be wrong.
Experts can and do change their advice as they learn more or for other reasons (federal advisers' views on masks evolved).
Those with credentials will differ (about "suppression" versus "elimination", or the likely arrival or effectiveness of a vaccine).
Experts will be heroes to their admirers and villains to their critics (Sutton is the case study).
In some instances, the experts will have an eye to the politics as they give their advice.
The politicians draw on experts' authority to fill the yawning gaps in their own, quoting them, parading them at news conferences. Then, on occasion, the decisions and comments of the experts, by now well-known public figures, come back to bite the leaders.
But the longer this pandemic lasts, the harder it is becoming for politicians to just say "we're doing what the experts tell us", because the trade-offs are increasingly so complex.

Full text: Victoria has recorded its highest single-day increase in new coronavirus cases since the start of the pandemic.
It's a pretty striking fact, and one that is starting to get a bit repetitive.
Yesterday's announcement of 725 new cases was the ninth time since early July that Victoria had recorded its largest daily increase so far.
But why do the daily records keep breaking, and how constructive is it to focus on the single-day total?
Deakin University epidemiology chair Catherine Bennett said a large number of the 725 new cases yesterday were from known outbreaks in aged care centres.
"A lot of the effort over the past few weeks has been suppressing community transmission so that we don't see big new outbreaks. That is hopefully happening but we won't see it while we still see outbreaks that have been in train for a number of weeks still causing new cases," she said.
To look at why the numbers keep going up, we have to focus on the R value, or the reproductive factor, which is a measure of how an infectious disease is spreading.
When the R value is at two, it suggests that people with coronavirus are infecting two other people on average, which would cause numbers to start doubling in a matter of days.
When it is below one, people are not infecting others, and daily case numbers should start to decline.
The reproductive factor is still consistently above one - which means case numbers will keep increasing - but not at a level where new daily cases numbers start to double or triple every few days. Analysis from the Burnet Institute and published in the Medical Journal of Australia this week has found the reproduction ratio went from being 1.75 at the start of July to 1.16 at the end of July.
As Burnet Institute deputy director and infectious diseases physician Margaret Hellard explained, that means in early July if there were 10 people with coronavirus, they would spread it to about 17 or 18 others.
Now, if there are 10 people infected, they pass it on to 11 or 12 others. In Victoria's case, that means 500 new cases give rise to about 580 further cases about one week down the line.
"For this week it is not surprising that we will have the same number of cases, if not 10 per cent more cases, because of the R value being what it is," Professor Hellard said.
"Hopefully in a week or two weeks the R value will fall below one and we will see a decline in the number of cases each day after that."
If that R value had stayed at 1.75 through the course of last month, the Burnet Institute's modelling suggests the numbers would have surged - predicting between 9000 and 37,000 more cases than what were recorded.
Professor Hellard said the stage three restrictions had been effective, but not effective enough to drive the R value below one, but that enhanced restrictions may be what drives down the numbers.

Full text: Melbourne truly has become Bleak City. It is a place where, at an appointed hour each day, the Premier stands without ceremony to announce the sick and the dead, followed by the latest decree on things we can no longer do.
A city of 5 million people dares not show its faces in public. Whenever we leave our front doors we must be masked from nose to chin. Bars and restaurants are shut, galleries closed, shopping strips deserted and even the footy has skipped town.
All of Melbourne now knows what a second-wave COVID-19 epidemic feels like - what it means for people's lives and livelihoods. And we can agree on at least one thing: however we bring the virus back under control, we cannot afford to go through this again.
Among the twin tribes who crunch and analyse the numbers of this crisis - the economists and the epidemiologists - an alliance is emerging on what the endgame of Lockdown 2.0 should be.
Since the pandemic began, UNSW Business School professor of economics Richard Holden has held the view that merely suppressing the virus is a false spring; that so long as there is no vaccine for COVID-19, there is no safe level at which a highly infectious, deadly disease can coexist with a functioning economy.
Melbourne's second-wave experience has convinced him that Victoria's public health response must be calibrated with one aim in mind: to extinguish all community transmission of COVID-19 - in a word, elimination - before we contemplate a resumption of social and economic life. "What we are seeing is that if you don't have elimination, you are going to have this yo-yoing of breakouts," Holden told The Age.
"There is an idea that you can keep the reproduction rate below one and you are on this knife edge where you have got cases in the community but they are staying under control.
"What this shows is what a precarious position this is. If you get more than a few cases in the community and the reproduction rate is above one, then you need to do something fairly dramatic to get it under control.
"Either it's ripping through the community or it is converging towards elimination. The idea that it can be somewhere in between is kind of fanciful."
Researchers from Australia's Group of Eight leading universities made the case for elimination in their COVID-19 Roadmap to Recovery, published at the height of the initial wave of infections.
Under this strategy, economic activity can be resumed once community transmission of the virus ceases and remains at zero for 21 days, the average time it takes an infection to clear. It requires our international borders to remain closed and our quarantine measures to be effective.
This was never the publicly stated goal of any state or territory government but as economist Chris Richardson ruefully told The Age: "We were maybe within a security guard of getting it as a national outcome."
Yesterday Prime Minister Scott Morrison affirmed that suppression is the approach endorsed by National Cabinet. It assumes the virus can be contained and managed at low levels, so long as effective testing, isolation and tracing measures are in place to quickly control outbreaks. This approach enables the opening of our international borders.
However, the gap between the two positions closed substantially during yesterday's National Cabinet meeting, when the nation's top health advisers convinced the politicians to adopt eradication of all community transmission as a public health goal.
Richardson, from Deloitte Access Economics, does not claim to be an expert on the competing approaches but points out the symbiotic relationship between public health and the health of the economy revealed in this week's budget updates in Canberra and Melbourne.
"The basic equation, and you see it in the federal and Victoria forecasts, is your degree of success against the virus tells you how big the hit is to your economy and how big the hit is to government budgets," Richardson said. "What it says is success against the virus is vital to economies and it is vital to government budgets."
The simplest measure of this is that, where the national economy is forecast to shrink by 3.75 per cent at the end of this financial year, Victoria's Gross State Product for 2019-20 is forecast to go backwards by 5.25 per cent.
The task confronting Victoria, if it is to stop community transmission of the virus, is an order of magnitude larger than what we and other states faced at the height of the initial COVID-19 outbreak. As of yesterday, there were 3734 active cases within the state. Most troubling is that the virus has now seeped into our aged care system, the place we most wanted to keep COVID-free.
The Andrews government believes that its current response settings - a combination of stage 3 stay-at-home restrictions and the mandatory wearing of masks outside the home - are the right ones, with further targeted measures to be employed in response to specific outbreaks.
Victoria's Chief Health Officer Brett Sutton is open to the idea of elimination but does not believe an Italian or New Zealand-style full lockdown is the best way for Victoria to get there.
Modelling prepared for The Age by a group of researchers led by Melbourne University's School of Population & Global Health predicts that the current settings can work if they are strictly adhered to - but not within the current, six-week lockdown.
Even assuming a high level of enforcement and compliance with the current restrictions - nearly everyone physically distancing and nine out of 10 people wearing masks outside their homes and school classrooms remaining closed to most students, contact tracing improving and 93 per cent of people self-isolating after they return a positive test - there is only a 15 per cent likelihood that Melbourne will be free of community transmission by August 19.
Instead, it is likely that we would not reach this stage until mid-September. It would then require a further three weeks with no community transmission - that is, people becoming infected by unknown sources - for elimination to be reached.
Under this scenario elimination is an achievable goal by October, but only if nearly all Melburnians are prepared to do strictly as the government says.
This is not our experience so far.
On the day Victoria recorded its highest number of new cases confirmed within a 24-hour period, Premier Daniel Andrews revealed some sobering statistics. In nine out of 10 COVID-positive cases, people are not isolating between the time they first notice symptoms and when they are tested. In 53 per cent of cases people do not isolate between the time they are tested and when their positive results are confirmed.
The Melbourne University-led research team modelled what is likely to happen if Victoria maintains its current restrictions but complacency erodes public adherence to rules. In this scenario, the percentage of people physically distancing gradually drops from 85 to 30 per cent as the lockdown wears on. Under this modelling, there is only a 40 per cent chance that elimination would be achieved by October 31.
Melbourne University professor of epidemiology Tony Blakely, a member of the team, says there is no certainty that elimination can be achieved but questions what the alternative is.
"We have got a huge dilemma in Australia at the moment," he says. "There is no way that Queensland is going to open its borders to states with high infection rates. If Victoria buckles down and goes for elimination there is no guarantee, but we'd have a reasonable probability of achieving it if we chose to make that a goal."
Professor Ian Harper, the dean of the Melbourne Business School and a board member of the Reserve Bank, says the economic case for elimination is weaker in Victoria than states like Western Australia, which has closed its borders to achieve it.
Where WA's iron ore and gold exports do not require the reopening of borders to international visitors, Victoria is primarily an exporter of services, most notably education. That requires bringing people here.
"The economic cost of eradication versus suppression depends on the structure of the economy as well, obviously, as the population size," Harper said.
"As a services-dominated economy with services-dominated exports, the impact of restricting movement and gathering of people is disproportionately costly in Victoria.
"Given the revenue-sharing arrangements across the Commonwealth, we Victorians have a vested interest in getting the other states up and running as quickly as possible, and also trying to keep the caseload in NSW down by closing the border. Since Victoria produces roughly one quarter of the national output, the other states also have a vested interest in our economy not being completely immobilised by elimination."
This helps explain why, within the business community, the idea of states like Victoria and NSW being able to eliminate the virus is still greeted with scepticism. Australian Chamber of Commerce and Industry chief executive James Pearson says that among his members there has been no shift in sentiment.
"The compelling equation is still true," he said. "That is, the greater the restrictions, the greater the economic impact and therefore the more jobs that are lost.
"Elimination is simply not possible without 100 per cent compliance by everyone in the community. That is not a realistic ambition. Aggressive suppression, if it is targeted and effectively administered, can be a way of dealing with outbreaks. We would always favour targeted and focused responses."
Economist Saul Eslake doubts whether enough Melburnians are willing to comply strictly enough with lockdown rules to fully stamp out the virus.
As he points out, although this week was Victoria's deadliest in the pandemic, the overall mortality rate is declining as younger people contract and pass on the virus and doctors and nurses become more experienced at treating critical COVID patients.
Dr Tim Thornton, a Senior Research Fellow with Boston University's Economics in Context Initiative, believes elimination is a viable public health policy. He argues that in assessing the economic cost of elimination, governments and economists tend to conflate two things: the impact of restrictions and the impact of the virus itself.
He explains that when calculating, for example, the cost to Victoria of a near-cessation of international students and tourists - the state's two largest export services - we fail to take into account the likely impact the virus will have on demand for these services.
"Is someone going to sit on a plane for 16 hours, packed like sardines with strangers, to come to Australia where COVID might break out at any minute?" he asks. "In a way, it is a false calculus."
The impact of the virus on human behaviour was examined by University of Chicago researchers Austan Goolsbee and Chad Syverson earlier in the pandemic.
Using mobile phone data to track foot traffic in American towns and cities where residents lived on the border of areas subject to COVID restrictions, they found that while total movements fell by 60 per cent, only 7 per cent could be attributed to restrictions. Fear of the virus was a more powerful influencer than government restrictions.
Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade figures show that, in 2018-19, while international tourists added $5.6 billion to Victoria's exports, Victorian tourists spent $12.7 billion travelling overseas. Is it unreasonable to think that, if the virus were eliminated in Victoria, some of that money would get spent on holidays closer to home?
"There is an inability to weigh benefits against costs, which is what national and state governments should be doing," Thornton said. "They shouldn't be captured by particular sectional interests, they have got to think of the common good."
There is little good to be found in Victoria's second wave.
An outbreak that originated with hotel quarantine security guards has spread through the city's northern and western suburbs, our schools and aged care facilities and created havoc in our hospitals.
While the Prime Minister turns his mind to Australia's economic recovery, Victoria remains deep in its COVID winter.
And every other state knows that so long as the virus lingers, it could be them next.

Full text: The true number of people infected with COVID-19 in Australia is likely to be much higher than the official government tally, experts say with one estimate putting the figure as high as 30,000.
There have been 6623 confirmed COVID-19 cases in Australia so far, but independent epidemiologists said that number is likely to be a significant underestimate.
A low estimate of the true spread of the virus might encourage false confidence in the timing of any decision to relax Australia's lockdown, some experts warned. A model developed by the Actuaries Institute suggested the true number could be five times higher than the official number of diagnoses.
"There are a lot more people with COVID-19 than there are confirmed cases," said Douglas Isles, a member of the Actuaries Institute's COVID-19 working group. Actuaries are mathematicians and statisticians who often work in insurance forecasting customer risks. "The reported data is an order of magnitude less than the actual data."
The government's modelling, led by the Melbourne-based Doherty Institute, said Australia's testing system is picking up 93 per cent of all symptomatic cases of COVID-19.
This is despite Australia imposing tight criteria on who can be tested, restricting it to those who have been overseas or have had known contact with someone with COVID-19. These restrictions have recently been relaxed.
The calculation behind the "case detection rate" is based on another number called the "case fatality rate" - the number of people who are infected for every death.
The modelling assumes Australia will have the same case fatality rate as China: on average 138 people will die for every 10,000 who are infected.
"This is a brave assumption, and unlikely to be true," said Professor John Mathews, an epidemiologist at the University of Melbourne and a former senior adviser to the federal government. That figure is not adjusted for Australia, where people may be less likely to die from the disease. Australia's healthcare was not overwhelmed as China's was, and our population demographics are different.
Professor Mathews and Professor Catherine Bennett, chair of epidemiology at Deakin University, said our true case fatality rate was likely far lower.
That would mean the number of people infected is far higher than 6623. It would also mean our testing is capturing far fewer than 93 per cent of those who are ill.
"We may underestimate how much virus is still circulating, and how much natural immunity there may be, and so government may not get the timing right for the relaxation of restrictions," Professor Bennett said. We risked "relaxing too quickly if there is more virus circulating than we can currently see," she said.

THERE’S NOTHING TO FEAR FROM CONTACT-TRACING APP

Full text: If Australia can beat the world in getting back to work, our economy will win too In the midst of a major pandemic that has more than a third of the world’s population living with physical restrictions, Australia has something to be proud of.
Relative to other nations, we are in a strong position today. We have avoided some of the ­devastating scenes overseas, thanks to the efforts of government, health professionals and communities across the country.
Last week, the Doherty Institute released modelling that shows Australia has further lowered transmission rates due to the ­actions the community has taken. It also shows the strength of our healthcare system, good testing procedures, protocols for quarantining positive cases and manual contact tracing to track potential new infections.
The economic impacts from the coronavirus have been significant. Our data at the Commonwealth Bank shows many sectors have been severely impacted, such as travel agents and fitness centres, which have seen their revenue fall almost to zero, recreation and tourism where we have seen falls of 80 per cent, and restaurants and discretionary retail where sales are down 40 per cent. We are fortunate that strong government measures have been put in place to cushion the economic blow, keep businesses intact and support the people who have been most impacted.
These measures are ­designed to bridge the economy through this period, and to help it recover strongly.
To complement these measures, the Commonwealth Bank is supporting more than $850m each month of additional cashflow for households and small businesses. This includes having processed deferrals on more than 78,000 home loans and 74,000 small-business loans. We have made more than 100,000 proactive calls to customers to offer assistance.
We expect the economy to contract substantially and, even with a strong recovery, some economic output and prosperity will be permanently lost. We should all be encouraged that the government has started working through a pragmatic and safe path for reopening parts of the economy.
Australians can look forward to a staged reopening, starting with key sectors such as education, retail and construction. Confidence will be critical and, understandably, it may take some time for all of us to feel safe in returning to our daily lives.
Importantly, the government is looking at technology to help restore confidence. Using technology to automate contact tracing is one area where substantial opportunity to further suppress the virus exists by more quickly notifying people if they may have been ­exposed.
Tracing today is a fairly manual process. The basic idea is when a case is confirmed, a person is asked to recall their movements over the past several days and identify ­anyone they may have come into contact with. Health officials then make phone calls to businesses or individuals, diligently working to contact people.
This relies on the infected person’s memory and ability to accurately identify those with whom they interacted. Crucially, it also takes a lot of time, and time matters.
A University of Oxford study last month showed that 70 per cent of people an individual has come into contact with will need to be traced to control breakouts.
Technology presents real opportunities here. Almost all of us carry mobile phones everywhere we go. It is not hard to imagine an app that can improve and automate contact tracing by helping alert us if anyone we have been in contact with has tested positive for the coronavirus.
Success requires broad adoption, as the system works only if a majority have installed the app so that anonymised information can be shared between devices.
We expect, and are seeing, a healthy debate regarding privacy. There are genuine concerns and the government is focused on ­addressing them to provide confidence to the community.
Even though manual contact tracing today involves an interview and handing over of contact details, it may feel different when new technology is used. Most of us have become comfortable using apps with more intrusive features such as location services, when we can see a clear benefit.
The clear benefit from automated contact tracing is getting more of our lives back sooner. The broad idea is to enable us to feel more comfortable to go shopping or to a restaurant, because we know that if we have been exposed to the virus, we are going to be notified quickly and can take the necessary steps to look after ourselves and prevent further transmission to protect the community.
All businesses are thinking about their staff and customers, and what additional steps they can take to keep them safe and feel ­better about resuming their daily lives.
For example, everyone using the app would feel more comfortable boarding a plane or going to a cinema if more people around them have taken the same precautions. This app would have one purpose — to suppress the virus — and once the virus has been sufficiently controlled we can all delete it from our phones.
We are still in the early days of this pandemic. So long as we all continue to work together, there is a real opportunity for Australia to continue to manage it well and emerge faster and in better physical and economic health than any other country.Matt Comyn is CEO of the Commonwealth Bank.

Full text: Scott Morrison’s road map to recovery must balance health and economic tests
Scott Morrison has given the country his signposts to the road back. It is a journey filled with known and unknown traps. But his core message is that Australia cannot succeed on health and fail on the economy — it is time to buttress success against COVID-19 by planning economic reignition.
This is a new challenge. The fear of a second wave will be ever-present; witness the Singapore blowback. The Prime Minister will harness his authority from success so far, but a staged economic restart, varying across states, will give voice to many conflicting opinions and interests. With any vaccine more than 12 months away the task during our winter is daunting — returning the country to degrees of normality while having the discipline to keep the virus contained, the hospital system viable and deaths limited.
No country has got to this stage. But Australia’s prospects look sound — subject to an assumption: that the medical projections of our progress to date are soundly based. Morrison said our medical progress had been “ahead of time”. He has now qualified his constant six-month timetable with a new four-week period — after which if health protections are strengthened, then base restrictions can start to ease. This is a critical policy change.
The Prime Minister and national cabinet repudiate the irresponsible demand from some people for easing as soon as possible. Instead, Morrison has done two things — identified the conditions needed for easing and specified a new time line. He has opened the door for relaxation of economic and social restrictions far ahead of the six-month period of his initial imposed timeline.
The strategy is cautious relaxation. Morrison will avoid premature moves. “If you ease off too quickly, too early, then you end up making the situation even worse,” he says — and that’s worse in both medical and economic dimensions. But social distancing and washing of hands will stay. They are part of our new life, along with extremely limited overseas travel — until the distant vaccine.
Any business reopening must be conducted on a social-distancing basis. “We should get very used to it for the foreseeable future,” Morrison says about keeping one’s distance.
As for reopening the international borders, he is not even thinking about it with, as he says, COVID-19 “rampant” in much of the world. Here is a future problem: Australia having to manage a successful outcome at home in a world still badly infected.
Morrison flags a revived economy based around three core principles — a recovery that prioritises business, not government; new policies, separate from last year’s election agenda, for a growth economy; and an economy that balances efficiency with greater security self-reliance. Morrison’s political strategy is for national cabinet (himself and the premiers) to co-ordinate economic recovery.
This is sure to deepen federal Labor’s frustration. Government and opposition policy differences will widen in the recovery phase and threaten the current fragile voting bipartisanship. But Labor’s more rigid Keynesianism won’t necessarily help it politically on the other side — as the party that wanted tougher health measures underpinned by far higher spending, not exactly a recipe for election success.
“The issues that we deal with are not simple,” Morrison says. “There are a lot of trade-offs that have to be made. Every state and territory has very different scenarios that they’re facing.” The national cabinet says there are “very different epidemics” occurring in different nations, often a function of varying health strategies.
The national cabinet was briefed on Thursday by Treasury secretary Steven Kennedy and Reserve Bank governor Philip Lowe. Morrison has distilled their message: that on the recovery road “any sense of business-as-usual” policy “will need to be reconsidered” to ensure Australia can rekindle jobs, turnover and economic growth. In short, more ambitious pro-growth, pro-investment policies will be needed.
Morrison says the government’s current huge spending is emergency support. He rejects as “nonsense” any idea that nationalisation, permanent government subsidies or protectionism is the answer in the recovery phase. Morrison and Josh Frydenberg, managing expectations, are warning the public about escalating bad news, with Treasury projections released last week forecasting the unemployment rate to reach 10 per cent, a grim punishment.
Morrison says “it was always difficult to receive that news”. But the public needs to understand the national cabinet is working on “the road out”. The Treasurer highlights the far more damaging scenario — the 15 per cent unemployment projection without the government’s huge stimulus. Morrison says “the hit the Australian economy is taking is the biggest we’ve seen since the Great Depression”.
That’s true. But the government’s political future depends on the public accepting that while the government has shut down the economy, the real cause is the virus, a pandemic beyond its control. Economic reignition totally depends on progress against the virus.
The story so far — welcome and in many ways surprising — is that the Australian “suppression” strategy looks good against the two alternatives: eradication based on a tougher lockdown and the “letting it spread” herd immunity method.
Morrison says Australia is in neither “eradication mode” nor the “herd immunity” approach; it is following neither New Zealand nor Sweden.
Australia in per capita terms is actually doing better than New Zealand, Morrison says, despite the more extreme lockdown in that country at a higher economic price. He says it is possible by following a suppression method “you actually get eradication as a by-product” without the same economic pain. Indeed, the formal statement from the national cabinet refers to an Australian “suppression/elimination strategy”.
Crucial new modelling co-ordinated by the Doherty Institute, linked to the University of Melbourne, provides data on the effectiveness of Australian policy. The key measure is the effective reproduction number (the number of people a single case infects after restrictions are imposed). For Australia this is significantly less than 1, the threshold below which the virus declines. Indeed, it is below 1 per cent in all states except Tasmania. The Doherty analysis says in the absence of imported cases and if “current measures were sustained indefinitely”, then “local elimination may be achievable”.
A feature of the virus debate has been the varying views of the Doherty Institute and other outside experts who have been far more alarmist and, so far, spectacularly wrong.
“If we can hold that number constantly under one,” Morrison says, “it means we can move back to the sort of economy we want.” Chief Medical Officer Brendan Murphy says Australia is detecting 92 per cent of all symptomatic cases, with each state and territory detecting at least 80 per cent, and calls this a “very high” rate pointing to an effective testing regimen. Murphy says the advice the health officers gave national cabinet on Thursday is not to relax restrictions unless you have a health system that can detect and respond to any outbreak. In short, they recognise the need to defeat more outbreaks.
On health, Morrison nominates three tests for the four-week timetable to trigger restriction relaxation. They are, first, a more extensive testing regimen, beyond people who are symptomatic. He says Australia’s testing is one of the most extensive in the world with more than 374,500 tests done, but “we need to do even better” and quickly identify virus outbreaks.
Second, greater tracing capability is needed — that is likely to involve consent-based technology, now used in Singapore, with a voluntary app that allows mobile phone recognition if you are in contact with a person who has contracted the virus. Morrison says the more people who take this up when it is launched “the better the tool we have”, and 40 per cent of the population is the minimum figure needed. The technology means “more options” and “more freedoms” — presumably public support will outweigh the civil liberties backlash.
Third, a swift local response capability is essential when outbreaks occur, such as in northwestern Tasmania at present. Morrison is emphatic: restrictions will remain until these three goals are achieved. There are “no plans” for any easing over the next four weeks. While some restrictions will be lifted, others will remain for the entire six months. The bottom line for easing is the assurance “the system will cope with any surge in cases” including the demand for hospitals beds, ventilators and personal protective equipment for medical staff. In short, the national cabinet has defined the terms, based on medical advice, under which restrictions will be eased.
Interviewed on the ABC, Morrison warned of the blunder of removing restrictions ahead of getting health protections in place.
“I’ve heard this theory,” he said. “If you want to know what it looks like, go and look at New York, go and look at London, go and look at Spain. All of those places — that could be Australia. We should not kid ourselves that the success we’ve had at the moment protects us from ending up where they are right now. If you don’t keep it under control, it will get away from you quickly and then you’ll have to lock down even harder.” Nailing one of the ironic flaws in the current debate Morrison said: “I get lots of health advice from business people and lots of business advice from doctors. What I tend to do is focus on the health advice from those who are experts there.” Morrison has agreed to bring the parliament back next month, long a Labor demand. He continues his campaign for schools to reopen despite differences with the states and believes this can happen next month. National cabinet has agreed with the medical advice that “schools can be fully open” and, aware this is a state responsibility, endorses seven principles to guide decision-making. Morrison says there is recognition that “face-to-face learning in a class room” is the “best way” to deliver education.
His advice to parents is to follow the policy of your premier. How long frightened premiers ignore their responsibilities, appease political pressures and compromise the manifest interests of students will vary across states — but the “return to school” momentum is coming.
It is important to grasp the two pivotal points Morrison makes about the economy. They appear to be contradictory but are not. He rejects the idea that “this is a watershed change in how Australia operates”. By this he means the pro-market, open-economy values of the Liberal Party remain despite what will be niche increases in government intervention. At the same time he accepts the advice of Kennedy and Lowe that the pre-COVID-19 economic settings will need to be enhanced by more assertive pro-investment and pro-productivity policies.
“Our government sees business at the centre of the economy,” Morrison says. “We do not see government at the centre of the economy. Going forward, we need to see a revitalisation of the private sector.” He identifies this as an “opportunity” for federal and state governments to work together as part of a national cabinet process.
“There was a very clear message from the economic advisers this morning, particularly Dr Lowe,” Morrison said on Thursday. “And that is, if we thought we can just grow the economy under the old settings, then we need to think again.” But Morrison is cautious, declining to speculate on specifics. He doesn’t need that debate just yet. There are, however, some certainties: he won’t be rolling out Labor’s tax increase agenda from the last election and he won’t be running on a higher GST courting a political brawl on this issue.
Frydenberg participated in a G20 conference call midweek in which nations were talking about new support packages — beyond the $8 trillion already committed to rescue economies. He says Australia opposes any reversion to protectionism. While borders are now closed, this cannot be allowed to extend into a suffocation of free trade. Morrison and Frydenberg are firm in sensibly rejecting any Australian move to follow Donald Trump’s decision to pull the plug on funding of the World Health Organisation, with Morrison listing its extensive work in the Pacific region.
Pressed by Neil Mitchell on 3AW about the need to increase taxes to tackle the debt, Morrison said: “My first priority on the other side of this is to grow the economy. That’s how you actually restore people’s livelihoods.” Morrison calls the six-month timeline a “ticking clock” — a timetable along which people can be working again, not relying on JobKeeper or JobSeeker. “You have got to work backwards from there,” he says of the six-month deadline. In short, beyond the next four weeks Morrison ideally envisages a review and easing of restrictions over the six-month cycle.
The recovery priorities will be getting some domestic planes in the air, speeding up infrastructure projects, ensuring construction is operating, factories are functioning and schools reopen, and getting some energy back in retail and cafe life. The core message from the week, only getting stronger, is that each nation meets the pandemic in its own way and that Australia’s strategy, so far, has been successful.
Looking at fatality rates Morrison says Australia is just under 1 per cent at present (in terms of cases detected) compared with Britain at 13 per cent, France over 13 per cent, Spain over 10 per cent and The Netherlands at 11 per cent.Australia is not copying anyone. It believes it is on the right path. But Australia, unlike the northern hemisphere, now heads into winter.

Full text: Scott Morrison’s road map to recovery must balance health and economic tests
Scott Morrison has given the country his signposts to the road back. It is a journey filled with known and unknown traps. But his core message is that Australia cannot succeed on health and fail on the economy — it is time to buttress success against COVID-19 by planning economic reignition.
This is a new challenge. The fear of a second wave will be ever-present; witness the Singapore blowback. The Prime Minister will harness his authority from success so far, but a staged economic restart, varying across states, will give voice to many conflicting opinions and interests. With any vaccine more than 12 months away the task during our winter is daunting — returning the country to degrees of normality while having the discipline to keep the virus contained, the hospital system viable and deaths limited.
No country has got to this stage. But Australia’s prospects look sound — subject to an assumption: that the medical projections of our progress to date are soundly based. Morrison said our medical progress had been “ahead of time”. He has now qualified his constant six-month timetable with a new four-week period — after which if health protections are strengthened, then base restrictions can start to ease. This is a critical policy change.
The Prime Minister and national cabinet repudiate the irresponsible demand from some people for easing as soon as possible. Instead, Morrison has done two things — identified the conditions needed for easing and specified a new time line. He has opened the door for relaxation of economic and social restrictions far ahead of the six-month period of his initial imposed timeline.
The strategy is cautious relaxation. Morrison will avoid premature moves. “If you ease off too quickly, too early, then you end up making the situation even worse,” he says — and that’s worse in both medical and economic dimensions. But social distancing and washing of hands will stay. They are part of our new life, along with extremely limited overseas travel — until the distant vaccine.
Any business reopening must be conducted on a social-distancing basis. “We should get very used to it for the foreseeable future,” Morrison says about keeping one’s distance.
As for reopening the international borders, he is not even thinking about it with, as he says, COVID-19 “rampant” in much of the world. Here is a future problem: Australia having to manage a successful outcome at home in a world still badly infected.
Morrison flags a revived economy based around three core principles — a recovery that prioritises business, not government; new policies, separate from last year’s election agenda, for a growth economy; and an economy that balances efficiency with greater security self-reliance. Morrison’s political strategy is for national cabinet (himself and the premiers) to co-ordinate economic recovery.
This is sure to deepen federal Labor’s frustration. Government and opposition policy differences will widen in the recovery phase and threaten the current fragile voting bipartisanship. But Labor’s more rigid Keynesianism won’t necessarily help it politically on the other side — as the party that wanted tougher health measures underpinned by far higher spending, not exactly a recipe for election success.
“The issues that we deal with are not simple,” Morrison says. “There are a lot of trade-offs that have to be made. Every state and territory has very different scenarios that they’re facing.” The national cabinet says there are “very different epidemics” occurring in different nations, often a function of varying health strategies.
The national cabinet was briefed on Thursday by Treasury secretary Steven Kennedy and Reserve Bank governor Philip Lowe. Morrison has distilled their message: that on the recovery road “any sense of business-as-usual” policy “will need to be reconsidered” to ensure Australia can rekindle jobs, turnover and economic growth. In short, more ambitious pro-growth, pro-investment policies will be needed.
Morrison says the government’s current huge spending is emergency support. He rejects as “nonsense” any idea that nationalisation, permanent government subsidies or protectionism is the answer in the recovery phase. Morrison and Josh Frydenberg, managing expectations, are warning the public about escalating bad news, with Treasury projections released last week forecasting the unemployment rate to reach 10 per cent, a grim punishment.
Morrison says “it was always difficult to receive that news”. But the public needs to understand the national cabinet is working on “the road out”. The Treasurer highlights the far more damaging scenario — the 15 per cent unemployment projection without the government’s huge stimulus. Morrison says “the hit the Australian economy is taking is the biggest we’ve seen since the Great Depression”.
That’s true. But the government’s political future depends on the public accepting that while the government has shut down the economy, the real cause is the virus, a pandemic beyond its control. Economic reignition totally depends on progress against the virus.
The story so far — welcome and in many ways surprising — is that the Australian “suppression” strategy looks good against the two alternatives: eradication based on a tougher lockdown and the “letting it spread” herd immunity method.
Morrison says Australia is in neither “eradication mode” nor the “herd immunity” approach; it is following neither New Zealand nor Sweden.
Australia in per capita terms is actually doing better than New Zealand, Morrison says, despite the more extreme lockdown in that country at a higher economic price. He says it is possible by following a suppression method “you actually get eradication as a by-product” without the same economic pain. Indeed, the formal statement from the national cabinet refers to an Australian “suppression/elimination strategy”.
Crucial new modelling co-ordinated by the Doherty Institute, linked to the University of Melbourne, provides data on the effectiveness of Australian policy. The key measure is the effective reproduction number (the number of people a single case infects after restrictions are imposed). For Australia this is significantly less than 1, the threshold below which the virus declines. Indeed, it is below 1 per cent in all states except Tasmania. The Doherty analysis says in the absence of imported cases and if “current measures were sustained indefinitely”, then “local elimination may be achievable”.
A feature of the virus debate has been the varying views of the Doherty Institute and other outside experts who have been far more alarmist and, so far, spectacularly wrong.
“If we can hold that number constantly under one,” Morrison says, “it means we can move back to the sort of economy we want.” Chief Medical Officer Brendan Murphy says Australia is detecting 92 per cent of all symptomatic cases, with each state and territory detecting at least 80 per cent, and calls this a “very high” rate pointing to an effective testing regimen. Murphy says the advice the health officers gave national cabinet on Thursday is not to relax restrictions unless you have a health system that can detect and respond to any outbreak. In short, they recognise the need to defeat more outbreaks.
On health, Morrison nominates three tests for the four-week timetable to trigger restriction relaxation. They are, first, a more extensive testing regimen, beyond people who are symptomatic. He says Australia’s testing is one of the most extensive in the world with more than 374,500 tests done, but “we need to do even better” and quickly identify virus outbreaks.
Second, greater tracing capability is needed — that is likely to involve consent-based technology, now used in Singapore, with a voluntary app that allows mobile phone recognition if you are in contact with a person who has contracted the virus. Morrison says the more people who take this up when it is launched “the better the tool we have”, and 40 per cent of the population is the minimum figure needed. The technology means “more options” and “more freedoms” — presumably public support will outweigh the civil liberties backlash.
Third, a swift local response capability is essential when outbreaks occur, such as in northwestern Tasmania at present. Morrison is emphatic: restrictions will remain until these three goals are achieved. There are “no plans” for any easing over the next four weeks. While some restrictions will be lifted, others will remain for the entire six months. The bottom line for easing is the assurance “the system will cope with any surge in cases” including the demand for hospitals beds, ventilators and personal protective equipment for medical staff. In short, the national cabinet has defined the terms, based on medical advice, under which restrictions will be eased.
Interviewed on the ABC, Morrison warned of the blunder of removing restrictions ahead of getting health protections in place.
“I’ve heard this theory,” he said. “If you want to know what it looks like, go and look at New York, go and look at London, go and look at Spain. All of those places — that could be Australia. We should not kid ourselves that the success we’ve had at the moment protects us from ending up where they are right now. If you don’t keep it under control, it will get away from you quickly and then you’ll have to lock down even harder.” Nailing one of the ironic flaws in the current debate Morrison said: “I get lots of health advice from business people and lots of business advice from doctors. What I tend to do is focus on the health advice from those who are experts there.” Morrison has agreed to bring the parliament back next month, long a Labor demand. He continues his campaign for schools to reopen despite differences with the states and believes this can happen next month. National cabinet has agreed with the medical advice that “schools can be fully open” and, aware this is a state responsibility, endorses seven principles to guide decision-making. Morrison says there is recognition that “face-to-face learning in a class room” is the “best way” to deliver education.
His advice to parents is to follow the policy of your premier. How long frightened premiers ignore their responsibilities, appease political pressures and compromise the manifest interests of students will vary across states — but the “return to school” momentum is coming.
It is important to grasp the two pivotal points Morrison makes about the economy. They appear to be contradictory but are not. He rejects the idea that “this is a watershed change in how Australia operates”. By this he means the pro-market, open-economy values of the Liberal Party remain despite what will be niche increases in government intervention. At the same time he accepts the advice of Kennedy and Lowe that the pre-COVID-19 economic settings will need to be enhanced by more assertive pro-investment and pro-productivity policies.
“Our government sees business at the centre of the economy,” Morrison says. “We do not see government at the centre of the economy. Going forward, we need to see a revitalisation of the private sector.” He identifies this as an “opportunity” for federal and state governments to work together as part of a national cabinet process.
“There was a very clear message from the economic advisers this morning, particularly Dr Lowe,” Morrison said on Thursday. “And that is, if we thought we can just grow the economy under the old settings, then we need to think again.” But Morrison is cautious, declining to speculate on specifics. He doesn’t need that debate just yet. There are, however, some certainties: he won’t be rolling out Labor’s tax increase agenda from the last election and he won’t be running on a higher GST courting a political brawl on this issue.
Frydenberg participated in a G20 conference call midweek in which nations were talking about new support packages — beyond the $8 trillion already committed to rescue economies. He says Australia opposes any reversion to protectionism. While borders are now closed, this cannot be allowed to extend into a suffocation of free trade. Morrison and Frydenberg are firm in sensibly rejecting any Australian move to follow Donald Trump’s decision to pull the plug on funding of the World Health Organisation, with Morrison listing its extensive work in the Pacific region.
Pressed by Neil Mitchell on 3AW about the need to increase taxes to tackle the debt, Morrison said: “My first priority on the other side of this is to grow the economy. That’s how you actually restore people’s livelihoods.” Morrison calls the six-month timeline a “ticking clock” — a timetable along which people can be working again, not relying on JobKeeper or JobSeeker. “You have got to work backwards from there,” he says of the six-month deadline.

Full text: UNPRECEDENTED restrictions on our everyday lives could start to be eased in four weeks as Australia leads the world in detecting coronavirus cases in the community.
The national cabinet’s first priority will be switching on “high-value, low-risk” economic activities — such as work in offices and factories — if the virus can be successfully suppressed in the next month.
Prime Minister Scott Morrison said the road out of the pandemic would “in broad terms” be the reverse of the road in, meaning limits on going outside for essential reasons could also be reviewed sooner rather than later.
But he insisted some restrictions would be needed for at least six months — and that social distancing and hand hygiene would continue to be essential until a vaccine was found.
Mr Morrison indicated our tougher stay-at-home enforcement measures also would be reviewed over the next month.
But before any changes are made, the national cabinet wants to lock in three key reforms: BROADER surveillance testing to track down any asymptomatic cases currently evading authorities, and ensure the speedy identification of any outbreaks.
EXPANDED tracing of who infected patients have been in contact with, using an app to be made available in about a fortnight.
STRENGTHENED local response capabilities — potentially including Defence Force resources — to contain outbreaks.
Mr Morrison said the national cabinet was also focused on keeping the “effective reproduction number” under one — meaning each infected person was spreading the virus to less than one other person on average.
Doherty Institute experts Professor Jodie McVernon and Professor James McCaw, who are leading the national cabinet’s modelling, said that every 10 infectious cases were currently producing only five more cases.
But in a “word of caution” for Australians to avoid complacency, they said the epidemic would “rapidly accel-erate” if rules were relaxed now.
Chief medical officer Brendan Murphy said Australia’s testing regime was leading the world by detecting 92 per cent of all symptomatic cases.
Mr Morrison said the national cabinet was aiming to suppress the virus, and that “eradication mode” to defeat it completely would not be “a wise trade-off” given its economic impacts.Prof Murphy said Australia’s numbers were “very encouraging”, but that if social distancing measures were relaxed now, it would “inevitably lead to some more outbreaks of community transmission”.

“That could lead to situations like we’ve all seen every night on the nightly news in high-income countries with good health systems like the USA and the UK,” he said.
Victoria identified just two new cases yesterday, taking the state total to 1301, along with 14 deaths. A further 39 people remain in hospital, ­including 18 in intensive care.
Victorian Health Minister Jenny Mikakos said she was “relatively optimistic” about the state’s position, and an initial easing of restrictions could help Victorians reunite with family and friends.
“We understand the importance of people remaining connected to their loved ones. We will be guided by the advice around risks,” she said.
Victorian Chief Health Officer Brett Sutton said Victoria was in “a fragile state” but was hopeful tougher stage four restrictions would not be needed.
“If we continue on this track on low case numbers and continue to drive them down, there is no question that we can have greater freedoms and liberties,” he said.
EDITORIAL, PAGE 28
THREE KEY STEPS BEFORE RESTRICTIONS CAN BE EASED 1 Extensive surveillance testing regime to spot asymptomatic cases and quickly identify outbreaks 2 Expanded contact tracing including an app used to automate the process. The government will want at least 40 per cent of Australians to download the app, to give authorities access to a list of people who an infected person has come into contact with 3 Strengthened local response capabilities to contain outbreaks
SYMPTOMATIC CASE DETECTION RATE Australia is detecting 92 per cent of symptomatic cases of the coronavirus − better than any other country in the world EFFECTIVE REPRODUCTION NUMBERThe most important gure to authorities shows how many new cases are produced by each infected person. They want the number to be below one − meaning the virus is spreading to less than one person per new case.

Full text: Australia owes a debt of gratitude to its pandemic modellers, public health officials and politicians - we have avoided the explosive beginning of a COVID-19 epidemic that most other countries are now cursed with.
Globally, it looks like - with our ANZAC mates across the ditch - we are advantaged by being at the bottom of the world with a slightly longer time to respond. Without wanting to cheer too early, the daily case notifications out of the state furthest down the path - NSW - are encouraging. The number of locally acquired cases are not increasing (much) in the past week.
If those cases start to track up, and double quicker than every eight days or so, the rest of this article should be dispatched to wrap fish 'n' chips. While I do not have a crystal ball, I do believe that the physical distancing measures are working - we have suffocated the early stage of the epidemic, "squashing the curve" rather than allowing it to increase then flatten.
But what next? Australia now has a conundrum not afforded most countries trying to slow the epidemic as rapidly as possible, throwing the parachute out the back of the speeding epidemic car while dealing with a health services avalanche. We have three choices.
First, we can go for the moonshot of elimination (and hunker down until there is a vaccine). The chance of this working is now low, but I am reluctant to take it off the table just yet. Second, we can continue to squash the curve as we are now. If we do so, we will avoid tens of thousands of deaths - but we have to stay in this state of near-lockdown for as long as it takes to get a vaccine. Anyone who has project-managed a complex project knows it pays to err on the side of assuming things will take longer than the initial best-case scenario - so let's assume at least 18 months, probably more if we allow for other countries having a more pressing need for the vaccine, then time for the vaccine to induce immunity, and so on.
Thus, we have a confronting reality under "squashing the curve" - living in lockdown for 18 months or more. With its attendant social and economic damage. Unemployment and precarious housing leads to worse health and premature deaths too - possibly more than a pandemic over 18 months.
The third option is to prepare meticulously for allowing the pandemic to wash through society over six or so months. To tool up the production of masks and medical supplies. To learn as quickly as possible which treatments of COVID-19 save lives. To work out our strategies for protection of the elderly and those with a chronic condition (for whom the mortality from COVID-19 is much higher).
All of these measures, I estimate, would lower the mortality by about 75 per cent, compared with just "letting it rip". Perhaps about 30,000 deaths. Which is still awful. But it needs to be kept in perspective: year in, year out, the tobacco epidemic kills 20,000 Australians (younger than COVID-19 on average); and, as stated, the economic consequences of squashing the curve kill people too.
I am not advocating this washing-the-epidemic-through option, or what is also called herd immunity. What I am advocating is that Australia uses the next few weeks to deliberate on what we do next. That means pulling back from the (necessary until now) unchecked executive authority of government, and reinstituting parliamentary oversight. It means liberating the modelling produced by Australia's A-team epidemic modellers to underpin public discussion. It means community participation, from talkback radio to citizen juries.
We need to hear from a wide range of experts to help us deliberate. Philosophers, ethicists, economists, public health experts, epidemiologists and others.
It will necessarily return to the politicians to make the call. But they need some sense of societal consent.
Victoria is scaling up ICU capacity to more than 4000 beds - a measure that would allow the washing-through to happen a bit faster with more health services capacity. And the provision of free childcare would pave the way to the young and healthy (those with children) leading our relaxing of physical distancing.
Australia is truly the lucky country right now - which blesses us or curses us depending on your view - to have this opportunity for decision-making on a scale not seen since World War II. It may even "tool us up" as a civil society for improving our decision-making regarding climate change (which will still be there when we get to the other side).

Full text: Sherryn Groch and Felicity Lewis report on what we know about COVID-19 so far.
Can I leave my home?
The virus needs us to move; it jumps person to person after close contact so the idea is to slow down its spread (and so avoid a sudden crush of cases in hospital wards) by temporarily changing our behaviour through physical distancing such as staying home where possible, avoiding gatherings and keeping 1.5 metres clear of others. To that end, places like pubs, gyms, churches and restaurants have closed their doors. Prime Minister Scott Morrison says there are now really only four acceptable reasons to go out:
● Shopping for what you need (such as food or supplies to help keep you at home)
● Getting medical care or for compassionate reasons such as caring for someone
● Exercising outside, including dog walking
● Attending work or school if you cannot attend remotely.
Can I visit people?
You should only go out with those in your household or one other person. And in Victoria, which has taken one of the toughest lines in enforcing these rules, social visits to the home are also banned. At first, Police Minister Lisa Neville said that meant "you cannot visit your [romantic] partner for social reasons" if you didn't live together. On the morning of April 1, a Victorian health department spokeswoman added: "You shouldn't be physically intimate with people you're not living with, even if they are your partner." But, later in the day, Victoria's Chief Health Officer Brett Sutton announced the so-called "bonk ban" would be relaxed with a new exemption for couples.
Who is most at risk?
The federal government is urging those aged 70 or over (as well as those with a chronic condition over the age of 60 or Indigenous people over 50) to stay home "where practicable", avoiding contact with others as much as they can, including family such as grandchildren. People in these categories can still go outside or shop if absolutely necessary but it is best to opt for delivery or seek help from family, friends or the local council to get supplies. Visits to aged-care homes have been restricted to protect vulnerable residents.
What's the death rate?
Calculating the mortality rate of a pandemic that is still spreading is an imprecise science. Based on the first 55,000-odd cases recorded in China, the World Health Organisation estimates the fatality rate so far as 3.4 per cent. But, given so many milder cases will go under the radar, most experts, including the WHO, agree the true number is likely closer to 1 per cent. That makes it 10 times deadlier than the flu but less dangerous than the other two rare coronaviruses to emerge in humans: SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV. Because the virus is new we don't have any natural immunity or specific treatments to fend it off.
But I'm young and not at high risk. Why can't I socialise?
While the elderly and those with underlying conditions are more likely to die from COVID-19, young people can too. Figures from China, Europe and the US show high hospitalisation rates among the under-60s and in Australia there are people under 50 in need of intensive care. There have been more coronavirus cases in NSW and Victoria among 25-to-29-year-olds than any other age group.
Where are the cases?
In Victoria, about four in five confirmed cases of coronavirus have been recorded in the Greater Melbourne area, but COVID-19 has spread to almost every corner of the state. At the start of April, at least one resident had been diagnosed in 68 of the state's 79 municipalities. So far, the areas with the highest numbers have been among the most affluent parts of Melbourne.
How long does the virus live on surfaces?
So far, a study has found the virus could last up to three days on hard surfaces such as plastic and stainless steel but was less stable on others such as cardboard, fabric and copper. That doesn't mean the virus could infect people for that entire time (as the viral particles will begin to decay outside the body) but touching an infected surface and then your face is a common way to catch such bugs. The WHO recommends cleaning surfaces "with simple disinfectant to kill the virus" (look for the words virucidal or antiviral on the label). Clean your hands with an alcohol-based hand rub or wash them with soap and water. Avoid touching your eyes, mouth, or nose. It is possible, although unlikely, exchanging cash could transmit the virus so using a card has been called lower risk.
What about takeaway?
Nobel prizewinner and medical researcher Peter Doherty has said that while food delivery is unlikely to be a major source of infection, it's something to keep in mind when you're "taking hold of the pizza box". He suggests washing your hands before taking out the food, and transferring it to a separate container.
Should I disinfect my fruit and vegetables?
No. The Centre for Food Safety's guidelines say there's no evidence the virus can be passed on via food. The US Centres for Disease Control and Prevention agrees. Food should be washed with water before you eat it. There is no need to wash food you are going to cook, as the heat will kill the virus. Touching produce and then touching your face is more relevant. "Think of your hands as the enemy," write Professor Ian Mackay and virologist Katherine Arden.
Can people without symptoms transmit?
Yes. People are thought to shed the most virus when they are unwell, especially while coughing, but because the virus can spread before symptoms appear it's hard to contain. The WHO calculates a danger window of infectivity about 48 hours prior to illness onset but other studies have tracked infections overseas to "stealth" transmitters with mild or no symptoms.
Can someone test negative but be a carrier?
Yes because sometimes a test will miss the virus if its particles aren't collected in a throat, nose or lung mucus sample. That's why tests are often repeated. Blood tests look for the body's immune response to the infection, but these too can return false negatives and are not widely available yet outside China.
Is asthma a risk factor?
Having asthma doesn't mean you're more likely to catch COVID-19. The problem is that because your lungs are already inflamed, it can leave you open to a more severe case or trigger an asthma attack.
How does self-isolation work?
To slow the virus' spread, those infected are going into exile at home and in hospital wards. If you have been in close contact with a confirmed case of COVID-19 or have returned from overseas, you must also self-isolate for a full fortnight at home. Your household can still go out but you should try to keep to yourself, wearing a mask around others, ordering in food, disinfecting common areas and keeping a close eye on how you are feeling (symptoms to watch for include a high fever and shortness of breath).
How long is recovery?
About 80 per cent of people will recover on their own without needing to be hospitalised, even if they develop pneumonia. Symptoms tend to clear up in a week or two in mild cases or three to six for the more serious, according to WHO data, but early evidence suggests the virus can stick around in the body even longer. Australian authorities, like the US, typically advise people to stay in isolation at least 72 hours after symptoms disappear but some people, including healthcare staff, must be cleared with retesting. Experts say it's too early to say if this illness will result in permanent damage, such as the lung tissue scarring seen in more severe SARS and MERS patients.
Are you immune after catching COVID-19?
Scientists aren't sure yet. Recovering from a virus leaves us armed with antibodies in our system to fight it off, and usually confers at least a period of immunity (although not always a lifelong shield).
How does the virus affect pregnancy?
So far, experts say pregnant women do not appear at greater risk from COVID-19. However, they tend to be more susceptible to respiratory illnesses in general, such as the flu. Children are less likely to be diagnosed or suffer serious cases. But they are not immune and some have died.
Can you catch it from pets?
It appears that, as with SARS, it's possible for pets to catch the virus from us in very rare cases. But despite hysteria about a Pomeranian in Hong Kong returning a "weak positive" test for COVID-19, the WHO stresses there's no evidence the virus can jump the other way, from pets to people.
Should I wear a face mask?
Face masks can protect against the water droplets that spread the virus and are now commonly worn out in parts of the world such as Hong Kong and Singapore. But many experts in Australia say wearing masks if not interacting with an infected person is largely pointless as the virus spreads mostly from close contact. This question has erupted as a huge debate in the US, with some arguing wearing masks is important. Watch this space.
How long will the pandemic last?
Many experts are drawing parallels with the 1918 Spanish flu pandemic, which killed millions around the world because it spread so far. The good news is medicine has taken a quantum leap forward since then. Still, modelling by the Imperial College London suggests countries will need to use control measures such as social distancing, aggressive case detection, even shutdowns right through until a vaccine becomes available - between 12 and 18 months.
