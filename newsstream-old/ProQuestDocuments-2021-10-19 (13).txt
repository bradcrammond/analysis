Full text: EDITORIAL IT IS indisputably good that we now know at what point the historically bizarre ban on other Australians entering Queensland will be lifted – two weeks after the last of 80 per cent of the eligible population here get their second Covid jab. You have to wonder, though, why it has taken so long for the Premier to release the reopening plan, when it turns out it is based on a benchmark we have known for months was the target the Premier herself agreed to.
It was way back on July 30 – when fewer than 20 per cent of Australians were fully vaccinated – that national cabinet agreed that the nation would be freed when vaccination rates hit 80 per cent. But since then, Premier Annastacia Palaszczuk has almost daily refused to recommit to that deal as the virus forced both the big two southern states into extended lockdowns. Instead, the Premier’s mantra of “we are waiting for updated Doherty Institute modelling” has become something she repeated almost as often in 2021 as she did “my job is to keep Queenslanders safe” in 2020.
As Queenslanders cried out for assurances that once we hit 80 per cent coverage we would be reunited with our family and friends interstate, the Premier stuck to that line – refusing to give any comfort or certainty. And she held firm to that stubborn refusal to discuss what a post-80 per cent Queensland could look like even as we learnt from the southern states that you are 86 per cent less likely to catch and therefore expose others to Covid if you are vaccinated – and 29 times more likely to end up in hospital if infected if you are not vaccinated (thank you to Treasurer Cameron Dick for helpfully sharing that information yesterday).
Anyway, the good news is we finally have a locked-in plan. After months of refusing to bring Queenslanders into her confidence, Premier Palaszczuk has now decided, as she confirmed yesterday, that: “The more information the public has, the better.” And so at 70 per cent, fully vaccinated people from the hotspots interstate can come here so long as they are willing to endure 14 days of home quarantine and pass a Covid test before they travel. From 80 per cent – or December 17 at the latest – they will be allowed in so long as they are fully vaccinated and have returned a negative Covid test in the 72 hours prior to their arrival.
This is a long-overdue victory for commonsense, and one that will now be welcomed by most Queenslanders – something the government has clearly picked up on. Over the past week it was clear the language used by government ministers had shifted. It shifted so substantially and so quickly that it strongly suggests opinion polling showed a significant mood change.
What surely also played a significant role in yesterday’s border decision is the modelling that has convinced health authorities that with 80 per cent of us protected from the worst of the virus, our hospitals will be able to manage the caseload of largely unvaccinated Queenslanders who will end up in intensive care with Covid. Thank you in advance to those brave medical workers who will – without judgment – treat these people.
Again, the only way you can protect yourself is to get vaccinated. And so if you know someone who is yet to get the jab, convince them to do it today. Take them there, even. We are currently on track for the borders to open on December 17, but that will happen sooner if we hit the 80 per cent mark faster. Let’s all work together to make that happen.

Canberra reaches 80% vaccination threshold

Full text: More COVID-19 restrictions in the ACT could be eased after the territory passed the milestone vaccination threshold of 80 per cent.
Chief Minister Andrew Barr said the vaccination rate - which means 80 per cent of people in the ACT aged 12 and over have had two doses of a COVID vaccine - triggered a further step in easing restrictions.
More detail would be provided on Tuesday, Mr Barr said in a post on Twitter.
Mr Barr has emphasised that it takes two weeks after the second dose of the vaccine is administered for it to give full protection.
Under the ACT's pathway forward roadmap for easing restrictions, the next changes are scheduled for October 29.
The ACT, which is on track to be one of the world's most vaccinated areas, has stopped reporting first-dose vaccinations above 99 per cent of the eligible population.
Professor Peter Collingon, an infectious diseases expert at the Australian National University, last week said a double-dose vaccination rate of 95 per cent was usually "as good as you could ever expect".
A national plan, agreed to by national cabinet, had set 80 per cent vaccination thresholds as a key milestone to ease restrictions, based on advice and modelling from the Doherty Institute.
The ACT's strict lockdown ended on Friday, but tough rules remain in place that severely limit businesses ability to trade.
Non-essential retail can operate click-and-collect services and have two people in the store at a time by booked appointment.

The ACT recorded 17 new cases of COVID-19 on Monday, while 17 people remain in hospital. There are nine people in intensive care with the virus in Canberra.
Chief health officer Dr Kerryn Coleman said it was important residents continued to get tested as soon as they felt even the mildest of symptoms.
"Testing remains a vital step in the way we manage COVID-19, especially now that we have eased restrictions," Dr Coleman said.

A big step on path back to normality

Full text: Finally, there is light at the end of this long pandemic tunnel. The exit begins just before midnight on Thursday when some of the harshest elements of lockdown will end. Hopefully forever.
Ahead of expectations, 70 per cent of Victorians aged 16 and over will then be fully vaccinated, and the easing of restrictions has been brought forward by five days. Curfews will be lifted. Restaurants will reopen, with certain restraints. Childcare returns to normal. Most students will start returning to the real school environment.
Families and friends at last will be able to meet from across the entire breadth of metropolitan Melbourne as travel distance restrictions are eased.
For many, the most important of all: 10 visitors, including dependents, will be able to visit your home each day. Once 80 per cent of eligible Victorians are vaccinated - expected in the first week of November - there will be no restrictions on intrastate travel and retail will reopen for in-store services. There is a short while to go before Victorians will be able to attend major events as a community, hear live music, and participate fully in life again.
But this is a major step. While the people of Melbourne have weathered the lengthiest period of being in lockdown, Victorians have embraced vaccination as the one and only way out.
Almost about 90 per cent of the state's eligible population aged over 16 years have received one dose of vaccination, and 70 per cent are expected to have been double-dosed this week.
The path being charted by the state government and health authorities may seem counter-intuitive considering case numbers are bumping above 1800 a day and hospitals are under pressure. Chief Health Officer Brett Sutton concedes a lot of people will be exposed to COVID in the weeks ahead, but what looms is "manageable".
That is because the hospital system and health networks, which have been under tremendous pressure, have generally been ramped up and services expanded in anticipation of a surge. More potently, though, new modelling by the Burnet Institute indicates the effects of vaccination have been positive: COVID-related hospitalisations are likely to be less than originally expected; the length of stays in hospital are shorter; the severity of the illness for fully vaccinated people is less than what was predicted.
Booster shots may be necessary in the months ahead, but what this state - indeed, the nation - has learnt since the 2020 outbreak should help keep any new eruption at least controllable.
Premier Daniel Andrews now says that despite current high daily caseloads, the robust vaccination rates in Victoria and NSW open the way for our cross-border travel strategies, domestic and international, to become "aligned". That would be a huge benefit for the economies of these powerhouse states and, indeed, for the nation.
The COVID-19 pandemic has taken an enormous physical, mental and economic toll. It has kept families apart, cruelled livelihoods, closed businesses, forced people to bunker down with scant face-to-face social contact. It has devastated government budgets.
The path back to a healthy, vibrant population and a vigorous economy will not be straightforward; there may be hurdles and frustrations and inevitable pressures on our health system.
But this is a time for relief, and a sense of achievement.

Hesitancy rates dropping but reluctant few still need persuading

Full text: New vaccine hesitancy data released by the Melbourne Institute shows that a total of 17.6 per cent of Queenslanders are vaccine hesitant.
But a breakdown of those unsure Queenslanders reveals that when further interrogated 8.5 per cent were not prepared to ever have it – a drop from May when more than 22.25 per cent of population were standing firm against vaccination.
Meanwhile 9.1 per cent, as of October 8, said they were still on the fence.
“I would love to see 90 per cent vaccine rate and if friends and family can persuade those who are unsure then that will help us all,” Dr John Gerrard, head of infectious diseases at the Gold Coast University Hospital, said.
Vaccine hesitancy across Australia continues to fall from 15 per cent on September 23 to 13.3 per cent on October 8.
The current hesitancy rate, which shows men are more hesitant than women, suggests Australia can achieve at least 87 per cent of the population fully vaccinated.
The fresh data comes as Queensland again recorded zero Covid cases, with more than 54 per cent of the state now fully vaccinated.
Premier Annastacia Palaszczuk said 70.99 per cent had received their first dose with 17,187 vaccines administered by Queensland Health on Wednesday.
She said the state was fighting to retain its freedoms, again urging everyone to get vaccinated now.
“Don’t walk past the tent at Bunnings, roll up and give us a hand,” she said.
More than 10,500 Covid tests were also undertaken on Wednesday.
Dr Gerrard said he was disappointed that Queensland was lagging behind NSW in hitting the 80 per cent vaccination rate but has a positive spin on the trend.
“Queensland has been given a massive advantage to be able to watch and learn what happens in NSW and adapt our road map and health care accordingly. To this point we are working with modelling. Life isn’t always a maths equation. We will watch to see how the healthcare system holds up when a Covid wave hits,” Dr Gerrard said.
The frontline doctor is speaking out as new data from the Australian and New Zealand Intensive Care Society shows a lack of ICU facilities across the country.
The numbers collected from 194 ICUs across the country highlight that there was a total of 2183 staffed ICU beds in September this year — a 8.2 per cent drop within one year. But Queensland was the state that stood out as holding its bed numbers from one year to the next.
Rural and regional hospitals were all the worst hit for losing staffed beds.
It has been predicted that NSW is most likely to hit the 80 per cent double dose vaccine target today, before other states.
NSW is also likely to become the testing ground for people leaving the country.
“If the Doherty modelling is correct and we increase our vaccine rates I think Queensland will handle what is to come. But it is always good in these situations to watch what happens and change the plans accordingly. We would like increase our ICU beds if we were overwhelmed by the Covid wave that hits when borders open. Staffing is not always easy but we would have to make it work,” he said.

NSW in pole position to avoid case surge

Publication info: Sydney Morning Herald ; Sydney, N.S.W. [Sydney, N.S.W]. 12 Oct 2021: 21.

Full text: NSW has begun the process of opening up in earnest. Former premier Gladys Berejiklian warned the state could expect cases to "go through the roof" once it reached this stage. But NSW may well avoid a calamitous rise in infections, with quite a few things working in its favour already.
First, there has already been some progressive easing out of restrictions throughout September, according to the mobility data. This is not unexpected after a long lockdown. The mobility reports linked to retail and recreation show NSW achieved a nearly 50 per cent reduction in mobility in August compared with pre-pandemic, but this eased back to just over 35 per cent by the first week of October.
This anticipation of rule changes and increased movement actually makes the 70 per cent easing of rules a somewhat smaller step in epidemiological terms than it might otherwise have been. While the range of retail, services and hospitality businesses now opening were excluded then, the increased mobility may reflect a greater degree of engagement in other unallowed activities, including home visiting, which is, in many ways, more risky than managed indoor encounters in work, retail or hospitality settings.
NSW's staged opening is also occurring with vaccination levels in the eligible population over 16 years of age closer to 75 per cent then the scheduled 70 per cent and may even reach close to 80 per cent by the weekend when most will really start to enjoy the extra freedoms. In addition, more than 90 per cent of this group has at least one dose, so more than half those not yet fully vaccinated do at least have one dose, reducing their risk of hospitalisation by as much as two-thirds.
Two temporary COVID-19 wards closed in Sydney due to waning demand last week, a good sign of where things might be heading. Hospitalisations in NSW have now declined by one-third since the peak, same with ICU admissions. They may rise over future weeks, but the pattern to date suggests this will be below the Burnet modelling estimates and within surge capacity.
Importantly, the population level protection from vaccine coverage will be at its peak right now, with more than 50 per cent of recipients having completed their second dose within the last six weeks. The timing of the opening up leverages this period of maximum risk reduction for both infection and forward transmission among those who are fully vaccinated.
NSW is heading towards become one of the most highly vaccinated populations in the world, with 75 per cent of the entire NSW population, including infants and children, having had at least one dose. That's now just in front of Britain today, and equivalent to Denmark, which has also opened completely but with case numbers in check.
But we have to remember that we don't have the same natural immunity in Australia that many other countries have. It is important to ease into living with the virus and we will continue to have rules in place, density restrictions and caps at events as we take this step by step. The public health teams will continue to manage outbreaks and monitor community transmission, but we may go for days at a time without paying attention to the case numbers.
It is also important that we remember it's not just what we are allowed to do as restrictions progressively lift, but how we do it. We can also help manage local and global risk by staying mindful of transmission risks, especially those linked to household gatherings that we know only too well now.
We can make an impact on next week's hospitalisations by staying in step with the rules as they ease and making the most of the outdoors when we have people to our homes, or meeting at venues where COVID-safe rules are in place.
All eyes are now on NSW - may these next weeks be epidemiologically uneventful. There is a lot that all states and territories will want to learn from this next, more substantial, step towards living with the virus.

Full text: Congratulations, Canberra, for collectively rolling up your sleeve to get the COVID-19 vaccine.
In reaching a fully vaccinated rate of 70 per cent for people aged 16 and over, you have helped to get us well on the way to being able to safely reopen our country.
Thank you to all of the ACT healthcare workers for everything you have done.
You have been on the ground from the start, responding to the beginning of this pandemic last year, and now with the vaccine protecting us.
All states and territories are playing a vital role and fast closing in on this important milestone.
The day when we will achieve a fully vaccinated rate of 70 per cent in every state and territory is not far off - and it will be a testament to the resolve, resilience and fortitude of our nation.
Everyone from Townsville in North Queensland to Burnie in Tasmania who has made the decision to get vaccinated is protecting themselves and their community, and helping us get back to the things we all love to do.
With our nationwide double-dose rate now sitting at approximately 61 per cent and rising fast, Australians have again demonstrated we understand the benefits of vaccination and how it can save lives and avoid serious illness.
We have seen this through our world-leading child immunisation rates in general as well as the rate at which Australians are now getting vaccinated against COVID-19, exceeding rates of vaccination of many countries across the globe.

I encourage every eligible person who is not yet vaccinated to make an appointment to go and get the vaccine and be part of this significant achievement.

Full text: CONGRATULATIONS NSW for collectively rolling up your sleeve to get the Covid-19 vaccine.
You have paved the way and, in reaching a fully-vaccinated rate of 70 per cent, helped to get us well on the way to being able to safely reopen our country.
Thank you to all of the healthcare workers across NSW, from Sydney to Broken Hill in the state’s west, and from Byron Bay in the north to Albury on the Murray River, for everything you have done. You have been on the ground from the start, responding to the start of this pandemic last year, through this major outbreak and now with the vaccine protecting us.
Although NSW reached the 70 per cent rate first, all the states and territories are playing a vital role and fast closing in on this important milestone. The day when we will achieve a fully-vaccinated rate of 70 per cent in every state and territory is not far off – and it will be a testament to the resolve, resilience and fortitude of our nation.
Everyone from Townsville in North Queensland to Burnie in Tasmania who has made the decision to get vaccinated is protecting themselves and their community and helping us get back to the things we all love to do. With our nationwide double-dose rate now sitting at about 60 per cent and rising fast, Australians have again demonstrated we are a country that understands the benefits of vaccination and how it can save lives and avoid serious illness.
We have seen this through our world-leading child immunisation rates – and the rate at which Australians are now getting vaccinated against Covid-19, exceeding rates of vaccination of many other countries. The Doherty Institute modelling has indicated when we hit levels of 70 per cent double-dose vaccination across the country, we can start to safely open up the country, with less lockdowns and enjoy dinners with family and friends and children back at school.
At 80 per cent we can have even more freedoms and the opportunity to explore and see loved ones across borders – international and domestic.
Every day we are getting closer, every day we see records met and exceeded in the vaccine rollout, every day we see more people across Australia roll up their sleeves. I urge everyone who has had their first dose to make sure they get their second for maximum protection. I encourage every eligible person who is not yet vaccinated to make an appointment to go and get the vaccine and be part of this significant achievement.

Surge may delay the plateauing of numbers

Full text: It's predicted Victorians will have to wait another month before the state's COVID-19 infections start plateauing because of a concerning surge in cases that's been blamed on grand final parties, coffee dates and other illegal gatherings.
But even as another daily record of 1488 COVID cases were reported, epidemiologists say that the rising vaccination rates should eventually flatten the third wave, before a larger peak expected after the state's reopening begins.
They say the initial flattening could arrive in around four weeks, potentially coinciding with the first significant lifting of restrictions that will see fully vaccinated people in Melbourne allowed to get a haircut and dine and shop outside.
But these predictions make the assumption that there is no more widespread flouting of public health orders. A remaining concern is signs the outbreak is moving into new geographic areas, complicating any predictions.
The state's COVID-19 response commander Jeroen Weimar said yesterday that about a third of the current cases were being driven by a "significant upswing in social gatherings" statewide, including grand final parties and people meeting up for coffee at their homes.
He warned the jump in numbers had put the state in a difficult space where more than 1000 cases were being reported each day. These numbers would see more COVID-19 hospitalisations (now at 429) in the coming days.
"We really need people to recognise that this is a very perilous path that we're on, and that we all need to resolve together to hold it down for that much longer," Mr Weimar said.
"We are four or five weeks away from 80 per cent double dose, it's not an impossible distance. We have all got to do our bit to hold this down otherwise there will be a huge pressure on our intensive care nursing staff and our ambos and healthcare system."
One week ago, 84 per cent of cases were being reported in the northern and western suburbs of Melbourne. Yesterday, following vaccination coverage increases in many of the affected suburbs, that figure had dipped to below 70 per cent and hundreds of new cases were being reported in the south-east, east and regional Victoria.
Deakin University epidemiology chair Catherine Bennett said while the outbreak's shifting footprint would not necessarily stop Victoria's case numbers from plateauing, it could make it harder to do "because you are chasing this fire that's finding new ground".
"That's a bit different to NSW where they did manage to keep it quite contained, even though there were a lot of LGAs impacted ... and then they could really focus their vaccination efforts."
Professor Bennett predicted it could take a month before numbers started to plateau, if there was not too much more relaxation of rule-following.
The key measure that will indicate if cases are turning around is the reproduction number - which refers to the number of other people an infected person will go on to infect, on average. For cases to drop, this number needs to fall below zero.
Before last weekend, epidemiologist Adrian Esterman said Victoria was nearing that milestone, reporting a reproduction number of 1.19 on September 17, suggesting the peak could have been expected within a couple of weeks.
"But there's a very high chance that these people who have been disregarding the restrictions have put that back by two or three weeks," Professor Esterman said. "It's a terrible shame."
Yesterday, he said the reproduction number was 1.5.
Victoria's numbers are already at the lower end of what the Burnet Institute modelling had predicted for late October, when the state is expected to hit 70 per cent of the population aged 16 and over fully vaccinated, triggering the first stage of the reopening.
Premier Daniel Andrews warned last week that if numbers and hospitalisations continued to grow the planned easing of restrictions might need to be postponed.
As of Friday, 73.5 per cent of the people in Victoria's hospitals had not received a dose of a COVID-19 vaccine, while 21.5 per cent were partially vaccinated, and 5 per cent were fully vaccinated.
The deaths from COVID-19 of men in their 60s, from Hume and the Mornington Peninsula, were disclosed yesterday.
It came as a South Australian resident returning from Victoria tested positive. South Australia has alerted eight passengers on Jetstar JQ 778 between Melbourne and Adelaide on Friday as the woman, who was fully vaccinated, returned to the state on that flight.

South-west students return to classroom

Publication info: The Standard ; Warrnambool, Vic. [Warrnambool, Vic]. 01 Oct 2021: 2.

Full text: South-west students will be back in the classroom from next week, despite growing concerns about Warrnambool's COVID-19 outbreak.
State Education Minister James Merlino told regional media on Thursday it would be a staggered return. From Monday next week all Prep to Year 2 students and all final year students return to the classroom full-time, as they were at the end of Term 3.
From Wednesday, October 6, once final year students have completed the GAT, all remaining Year 11 students will return to school full-time. From Monday, October 11, all students will return back to the classroom at least part-time.
Years 3-4 and 8-9 will return on Tuesdays and Wednesdays, and Year 5-6, and Year 10, will attend on Thursdays and Fridays.
Year 7 students will return five days a week.
"This is an earlier return than metropolitan Melbourne," Mr Merlino said. "This is a positive step forward returning to live in a COVID-normal way."
The only exceptions will be City of Latrobe and Mitchell Shire, which will be under the back to school timeline for Melbourne due to COVID-19 outbreaks in those areas.
Minister Merlino told The Standard Warrnambool would still be included in the regional return to school despite the city's growing COVID-19 cluster.
He said if cases continued to escalate in Warrnambool the public health team would consider bringing the city in line with metropolitan Melbourne's return to school.
"There's still concern about the potential spread of the virus in rural and regional Victoria," he said.
"There will be targeted wastewater detection in place in areas of higher risk so we can get the earliest advice possible.
"For you in Warrnambool the plan is: Prep, 1, 2s and final year students back next week, and then all other students back full-time or part-time in week two.
"The public health team remain concerned about the potential for other outbreaks across rural and regional Victoria. If that's the case, then we'll deal with that on the local government area bases, just like we have with Latrobe and Mitchell."
The news has been met with confusion from some south-west residents: "They couldn't go to school when we had zero cases now we are getting cases all of a sudden it's safe for kids to go to school? How the hell does that work?" reader Taleah Ledner asked.
Mr Merlino said it was a decision based on the Burnet Institute modelling.
Masks will remain mandatory for all students 12 and older, and all adults.

Uniting a divided cabinet

Full text: States to discuss planned route out of pandemic VACCINATED Queenslanders should no longer be locked out of visiting aged-care residents and the Covid-19 jab should be made mandatory for all healthcare staff, under advice set to be handed down by Australia’s top government doctors.
The advice is expected to be handed to state and territory leaders on Friday by the Australian Health Protection Principal Committee (AHPPC), at what is set to be a highly-charged 56th meeting of national cabinet.
Despite agreeing to the national roadmap out of Covid-19, state and territory leaders are split on whether they will stick to it.
Premier Annastacia Palaszczuk is yet to confirm if she will reopen the states borders once 80 per cent of the population is vaccinated – and she isn’t alone.
Tasmanian Premier Peter Gutwein this week flagged the island state might not reopen to the majority of the country until 90 per cent of the adult population was vaccinated, deeming an early reopening too risky.
Ms Palaszczuk refused to say if Queensland’s course could be similar to that of Tasmania’s, saying those discussions would be had at national cabinet.
“I’ll have those discussions at national cabinet where every state and territory can put their views to the Prime Minister,” she said.
The meeting is also set against the backdrop of Queensland dealing with four separate clusters and Victoria recording its highest-ever day of infections.
It’s understood interim Doherty Institute modelling that focuses on how to best manage high-risk groups, including Indigenous Australians and other cohorts, such as school children, as the country reopens was handed to leaders ahead of the meeting – something Ms Palaszczuk had requested.
National cabinet is set to be briefed on AHPPC advice that includes allowing vaccinated people to visit residents in aged-care homes, similar to what has already been flagged in NSW once 70 per cent of the population has received both doses.
The AHPPC will also recommend mandatory vaccination for healthcare workers – something Queensland has already put in place. National cabinet will also discuss the health system capacity that each jurisdiction will need under the reopening plan, with initial data presented on September 17 “alarming” some leaders, including ACT chief minister Andrew Barr.

National cabinet is set to be briefed on AHPPC advice that includes allowing vaccinated people to visit residents in aged-care homes, similar to what has already been flagged in NSW once 70 per cent of the population has received both doses.
The AHPPC will also recommend mandatory vaccination for healthcare workers – something Queensland has already put in place. National cabinet will also discuss the health system capacity that each jurisdiction will need under the reopening plan, with initial data presented on September 17 “alarming” some leaders, including ACT chief minister Andrew Barr.

Full text: Victorian authorities are investigating the time spent on hold to triple zero by the family of a three-year-old central Victorian girl, who died after suffering a cardiac arrest.
Ambulance Victoria said paramedics were dispatched "without delay" after being called to a cardiac arrest in a town outside of Bendigo at 6:29pm on Monday.
An Advanced Life Support crew was the first to arrive, at 6.43pm, and loaded the girl for the hospital, however she died while in their care.
"Despite the best efforts of our paramedics and those on the scene, the patient did not survive," AV Acting Loddon Mallee Regional Director Trevor Weston said.
"We offer our sincerest condolences to the patient's family at this difficult time."
The family of the child waited for one minute and 41 seconds, longer than the target time of five seconds, while on hold to triple zero, however it's not yet known whether the delay contributed to the death.
Health Minister Martin Foley said the time spent on hold was "under active investigation".
"Any death is a tragedy, but the death of a young child from a major incident like that is really, really traumatic for everyone involved," he told reporters on Wednesday.
He said emergency departments, hospital wards and paramedics were dealing with "record levels" of demand, with a rise in COVID-19 cases and other emergency presentations.
There are 371 Victorians in hospital with COVID-19, but that number could grow to up to 2500 by end of the year according to Burnet Institute modelling.
Earlier on Wednesday, AV's Mick Stephenson said paramedics had noticed longer delays at hospitals "than we've ever had before".
"Our capacity to respond and our performance has never been challenged as much as it has been over recent weeks," he told ABC Radio Melbourne.
"If the growth in COVID cases continues, performance will be expected to get poorer unless we can do something about reducing the number of people coming into hospital."
He said transferring COVID-19 patients had become a major issue for paramedics, and said those with mild symptoms were being sent home.
Marty Smyth, Emergency Services Telecommunications Authority chief executive, said 3250 Victorians made ambulance calls on Monday, the highest number since the deadly thunderstorm asthma event in 2016.
"This year we're seeing a significant increase in demand and calls but they're all standard calls that we would typically take on a day - road traffic accidents, medical emergencies, chest pain, abdominal pain, headaches that kind of thing," he told ABC Radio Melbourne.
He said there was a benchmark that 90 per cent of triple zero calls are answered in five seconds but the average wait was currently one to two minutes.
Mr Foley said the state government was addressing demand by beefing up the health care workforce, bringing staff across from other parts of the system, and asking both students and the recently retired to assist.
Additionally, non-urgent patients are being redirected, with some transferred to the private sector and the government is working with Ambulance Victoria to enhance its workforce capacity.
"The truth of the matter is we are facing unprecedented levels of demand and we need to continue to work hard to build a surge capacity," he said.
Victorians are urged not to call triple zero unless it is an emergency.

The uncertainty of the pandemic persists

Full text: Throughout the pandemic, one acronym has consistently bobbed alongside the name of this insidious disease.
It has been there, at times unspoken, but always felt.
FUD.
Fear, uncertainty and doubt.
Just as awkward a collection of characters as COVID-19, but just as meaningful.
And so, as it has been for the last 18 months, Peter Gutwein's latest announcement on Wednesday afternoon about the pandemic again brought with it that peculiar collection of feelings.
Mr Gutwein would likely disagree, he may claim announcements and transparency such as he has offered throughout his tenure as a pandemic premier has served only to reassure, provide clarity and offer safety.
But in reality, his announcement to effectively abandon the plan agreed upon by national cabinet to reopen at the 80 per cent vaccination target will only plunge Tasmanian residents and mainlanders with Tasmanian connections back into uncertainty.
There are families in Tasmania and interstate who will not have seen each other in months who have had the promise of a Christmas together snatched away from them.
There are businesses who were relying on a strong summer of trade to survive who may have now been dealt a death knell.
Of course Peter Gutwein knows this, but is being guided as he has by the health professionals and now by the modelling of the revered Doherty Institute.
Because the reality is that an average vaccination rate of 80 per cent across the state is simply not high enough.
As has been seen elsewhere in the world, particularly in Israel, that allows for clusters of the community to continue unvaccinated.
And those clusters, whether they have chosen to not be vaccinated or not, will almost certainly contract the virus and lead to large outbreaks in the broader community if the borders were reopened.
But, as with all decisions made by leaders during this crisis, we can only hope the Premier is being cautious and may be proved right, not foolish and proved wrong.

Delta delay ‘to set economic recovery back by six months’

Full text: Delaying the end of Delta lockdowns and only gradually lifting restrictions after achieving vaccination coverage of 80 per cent would stall the economy for a further six months and keep unemployment above pre-Covid levels well into 2022, exclusive KPMG modelling has revealed.
With NSW, Victorian and ACT authorities focused on the health implications of their recently announced road maps out of severe restrictions, KPMG chief economist Brendan Rynne said policymakers needed to understand what was at stake for workers and businesses from lingering stay-at-home orders.
“The conversations our leaders are having with the population around the different paths of reopening are predominantly focusing on the health consequences of these different transition paths,” Dr Rynne said. “What we are highlighting is there are economic consequences as well, and the trade-offs need to be understood.” The KPMG analysis gauged the potential economic impact of health authorities’ decisions under three scenarios: a fast reopening once vaccination rates reach 70 per cent; a slower scenario where lockdowns lift only incrementally from 80 per cent inoculation levels; and a base case, broadly following the Doherty thresholds.
Dr Rynne said reopening plans announced in NSW on Monday approximated something a little faster than the base case, and the Victorian road map a little slower. “If a fast 70 per cent vaccination threshold was adopted as the trigger point for wholesale withdrawal of lockdown restrictions, then we would expect economic activity to bounce back in a similar manner to what occurred after the first lockdown in the middle of 2020.” In contrast, waiting until vaccination rates reached 80 per cent before beginning to slowly ease Delta restrictions would delay the post-lockdown economic bounce from the December quarter to the June quarter of next year, with “the economy treading water” for six months.
He estimated that real GDP was set to contract by 2.6 per cent in the September quarter – well below the 4 per cent decline anticipated by leading bank economists.
Under the base case, the easing of restrictions would drive a 3 per cent rebound in GDP over the final three months of this year against the fast reopening scenario, which suggests the bounce in output would be 3.9 per cent.
If reopening was delayed and staggered, the economy would grow by 1.6 per cent in the fourth quarter, and by 1.2 per cent over the following three months, putting off a more substantial rebound of 2.7 per cent until the June quarter of 2022.
Dr Rynne said a further risk in a delayed reopening scenario – not captured in his modelling – was for a higher number of business failures. “I think there is a very much a sense that small businesses are holding on – and they are just holding on,” he said.
The modelling revealed the key consequence of a delayed reopening would be higher unemployment than otherwise.
Dr Rynne forecast the unemployment rate would lift from what economists have said was an artificially low 4.5 per cent in Aug­ust, to 5.6 per cent in coming months. Under a faster reopening, the key jobless measure would be below 5 per cent by the March quarter of next year, versus languishing at close to 5.5 per cent under the slowest scenario. In the base case, unemployment would be 5.1 per cent by early next year. By the middle of 2022, under a slow reopening, unemployment would be stuck around 5.2 per cent – still above pre-Covid levels of 5.1 – versus 4.7 per cent in the fast scenario and 4.9 per cent in the base case.

Full text: The ACT's Chief Minister was forced to raise concerns with Prime Minister Scott Morrison about thousands of Pfizer vaccines missing from the territory's allocated supply for next month.
Andrew Barr brought up the supply matter with Mr Morrison at Friday's national cabinet meeting, but he said work was underway to hopefully rectify the issue.
The ACT reported 15 new COVID-19 cases in the 24 hours to 8pm on Friday. Of the new cases, only two were confirmed to be in quarantine for their entire infectious period.
Seven cases were linked to existing cases and the sources of the remaining eight are under investigation. There are eight people in hospital with COVID-19.
Mr Barr made the revelation on Saturday that the ACT was allocated about 60,000 fewer Pfizer vaccines for its October supply.
"Under the proposed Pfizer supply to be allocated to the territory for October, it appeared that the Commonwealth had reduced the territory's allocation," he said.
Mr Barr said he received assurances that it was not the Commonwealth's intention to reduce the supply and he suspected the issue could be "positively resolved".
The Chief Minister said if the supply did not come through it would affect the ACT's mass vaccine clinics.
"The sort of benchmark is around 60,000, a little over half of which would have been going to GPs and slightly less thereabouts to the ACT government mass vaccination clinics," he said.
"The increase in Moderna would have offset the GP allocation [but] what we're particularly focused on is the allocation of what we were anticipating for our mass vaccination clinics."
New modelling from the Doherty Institute showed it would be "prudent" for medium public health measures to remain in place between the 70 per cent to 80 per cent fully vaccinated thresholds if the virus had seeded.

Vaccine mandate set for major events, hospitality

Full text: Crowds could return to Melbourne sporting events by November and the government intends to implement a "no jab, no entry" policy for people going to major events, restaurants or pubs as part of the state's road map to reopening.
State officials have told industry stakeholders of the government's intention to force visitors and staff at hospitality venues and major events to be fully vaccinated, according to two sources not authorised to speak publicly.
The government will spend the weekend putting the final touches to the road map, which is underpinned by modelling from the Burnet Institute and will inform the return to school, the unshackling of businesses and easing of border rules for Victorians stuck in NSW.
Victoria recorded 510 new infections yesterday, 95 per cent of which were in Melbourne's northern and western suburbs. A woman in her 50s died with COVID-19, while 208 people were in hospital, including 49 in intensive care. Just 2 per cent of people hospitalised with COVID-19 are fully vaccinated.
It comes as key health unions, including the Australian Medical Association and the nurses' federation, say it would be reckless if restrictions eased further before 80 per cent of Victorians aged 12 or over are fully vaccinated.
This is higher than the goal set by the national plan for reopening, which bases the 80 per cent rate on those 16 and over and says only "low-level restrictions" should remain once rates hit 70 per cent, assuming adequate contact tracing.
A source briefed on the state government's plans for sport said Victorian officials were eyeing the start of the A-League soccer and NBL basketball seasons, in late October and early November, as the first live sporting events where crowds of fully vaccinated people might be allowed. The plan for heavily capped crowds would only proceed if hospitalisations were under control.
While the full details of the road map remain unknown, Premier Daniel Andrews has confirmed the pressure on hospitals would be a key metric on the reopening path.
Australian Hotel Association Victoria chief executive Paddy O'Sullivan said his organisation was in talks with the government about an indemnity scheme to ensure pub owners could not be sued by either patrons or staff for enforcing a vaccine mandate.
Mr O'Sullivan said pubs could be trialling the vaccine-only model before the state reached its 70 per cent double-dose target, which is forecast to be hit on November 17.
People will be able to prove their vaccine status to enter venues using the same Service Victoria app used to check in to venues. The state government is working to integrate the Medicare vaccine certificate with the Victorian app.
The vaccination status of customer-facing staff, such as security guards and food workers, will also be a sticking point for major events, with Sport and Major Events Minister Martin Pakula in talks with stadium owners about a vaccine mandate.
Last week, Racing Victoria said it would require all staff and participants, including trainers and jockeys, to be vaccinated as a condition of entry to its workplaces and licensed premises. The policy will start on Caulfield Cup Day.
Victorian branch secretary of the Australian Nursing and Midwifery Federation, Lisa Fitzpatrick, said it would be possible for hospitals to cope with a predicted 800 cases by mid-October, but her concern was cases would continue to increase well beyond that number.
She said while everyone wanted a guarantee they would see their family by Christmas, opening up at 80 per cent of those over 16 vaccinated would still leave 40 per cent of the total population unprotected.
"I think the idea of 800 patients in hospital is la la land," she said.
AMA Victoria president Roderick McRae urged Victorians to minimise their movement as much as possible despite an easing of restrictions. "Just because you're allowed to have a group of five in your park, it is in your own interests not to do that," Dr McRae said.
About 2700 Victorians booked in for a vaccine in the city today should still be able to get their jabs, despite police setting up checkpoints in an effort to stem an anti-lockdown protest.

Doctors in Australia’s under-pressure health care system face an additional challenge

Full text: The risk of taking the virus home, worrying about compromising care for non-Covid patients, and missing out on vital training opportunities are among the issues doctors are facing as they fight the virus on the frontline.
A recent review by the Black Dog Institute and The University of NSW, published in the Lancet , has found doctors are at increased risk of suicide and, in their early years of training, one-quarter to one-third reported significant mental ill-health.
Professor Samuel Harvey, the review’s lead author, said mental health issues were already on the rise in the Australian medical workforce and had been further ramped up by the pandemic.
“Some of the reasons are obvious, that working in medicine can be hard. The hours can be long and it can be quite stressful, but that's always been the case,” he said.
“What seems to be changing over time is a number of the factors that used to protect doctors have gradually been eroded.”
Professor Harvey, who runs the Black Dog Institute and UNSW Workplace Mental Health Research Program, said junior doctors were particularly at risk.
“All of the usual training and career progression, in terms of the exams, a lot of that is being disrupted. All of the support networks have been disrupted,” he said.
“We’re concerned about junior doctors working in some of the hardest hit areas.”
In NSW, 1231 Covid cases are currently admitted to hospital, with 231 people in intensive care, 108 of whom require ventilation.
Modelling by the independent Burnet Institute predicts hospitalisations will peak in NSW in late October, putting “overwhelming” pressure on intensive care.
Senior medical students are being recruited as assistants in medicine as part of a surge workforce to fight Covid-19 in the state’s hospitals.
Australian Medical Students’ Association president Sophie Keen said trainee doctors were excited to contribute, but many were struggling with social disconnectedness and disruptions to their education.
She said junior doctors were reluctant to seek help because of stigma, despite the level of very high psychological distress in doctors under 30 being almost 12 times higher than other Australian professionals.
“[They] are scared to go to their GP because they fear they’ll be reported. They don’t want to present to an emergency department because they’re worried they’ll be recognised, you’re left with very few options,” she said.
Ms Keen said universities should be positioned as sites of early recognition and affordable, early treatment for mental illness.
She said there needed to be support from the medical community as a whole to tackle “systemic issues that amplify distress”.
“I don’t know a single medical student who hasn’t experienced bullying, discrimination or harassment. For Indigenous medical students the statistic is most experience at least once a week,” she said.
“Your career progression can be entirely dependent on how others perceive you. If you're perceived as someone who is difficult or complains or can’t just be part of the boys’ club then your career is at risk.
“You think, ‘If I disclosed that I wasn’t coping, what would they think? If they already have these judgments and preconceptions about me or people like me, I can’t give them anything else to latch on to’.”
Royal Australasian College of Physicians president John Wilson said junior doctors were missing out on opportunities for professional development, because of Covid, in an increasingly competitive profession.
He said it was stressful for doctors at any stage of their careers not being able to deliver the highest quality clinical care due to pandemic pressures including cuts to elective surgery.
“One needs to think seriously about how do med practitioners access care for themselves or their families. One might think no one has better access to psychological support than doctors do. It’s not like that,” he said.
“There’s the risk of stigma, the evasive issue of inconsiderate approaches from colleagues and there’s also the uncertainty of the future should one seek help because of psychological distress.”
Royal Australian College of General Practitioners president Dr Karen Price said burnout was a serious consideration for medical practitioners during the pandemic.
“It’s a pretty tough call [to say what should be done] but people need a rest, they need certainty and they need to see that their work is valued,” she said.
Black Dog and UNSW in partnership with the federal government have set up a new, free and anonymous mental health service for all health professionals, including doctors, called The Essential Network.

XMAS QUARANTINE TO REMAIN ON THE CARDS

Full text: CHIEF Minister Michael Gunner says it’s his “Christmas wish” for as many Territorians as possible to be vaccinated, but has insisted that quarantine requirements remain for interstate visitors arriving from hot spots.
Mr Gunner said the government would not revoke Victoria and NSW as hot spots just because the Territory hits vaccination targets set out in the national Covid-19 plan.
It comes as some restrictions begin to ease in Covid-ridden Victoria and NSW, with the states’ respective premiers flagging more to come as new vaccination milestones are hit.
“Territorians haven’t done all this hard work and sacrificed so much just to stuff it up now and let Covid rip,” Mr Gunner said.
“That would be crazy. And that’s not what the national plan says.” Mr Gunner flagged his desire to change the government’s policy on quarantine, which currently requires arrivals from hot spots to undertake 14 days’ supervised quarantine at the Howard Springs or Todd facility, at a cost of $2500 per person.
“What I hope is that by Christmas enough Territorians will be vaccinated so that we can allow fully vaccinated people from hot spots into the Territory to quarantine at home,” he said.
Mr Gunner also flagged potential changes to the way a hotspot is defined, but told ABC Darwin on Monday he “certainly” doesn’t foresee NSW being revoked as a hot spot before Christmas.
It remains unclear whether Mr Gunner would continue to impose lockdowns if there were further cases of Covid-19 in the community after hitting double dose vaccination targets of 70 per cent and 80 per cent.
The national Covid-19 plan, agreed to last month by all states and territories, outlines how the nation would transition its Covid-19 response, based on epidemiological modelling by the Doherty Institute.
The national plan states lockdowns would be “less likely but possible” when a jurisdiction hits a double dose vaccination rate of 70 per cent.
When that rate hits 80 per cent, the national plan calls for “highly targeted lockdowns only”.
There is nothing in the national plan about opening domestic borders. The plan is also silent on quarantine requirements for international arrivals. The national cabinet has no legal powers, so any agreements made by members are not legally enforceable.
However, concerns have been raised about the consequences of continued border closures as vaccination rates rise in the Territory and across other jurisdictions. The NT News understands Mr Gunner is yet to finalise his Christmas leave arrangements.

Full text: GEELONG appears poised to come out of lockdown this week if cases continue to remain low across regional Victoria.
The state recorded 183 new cases of Covid-19 on Sunday as Premier Daniel Andrews warned of “a pandemic of the unvaccinated”.
Of the new cases, 101 are linked to current outbreaks with 82 under investigation. There are 89 Covid patients in hospital in Victoria, with 24 in intensive care and 13 on ventilators.
The new infections take the total number of active cases in Victoria to 1417. There were 48,487 tests in Victoria in the 24 hours to midnight. NSW reported 1485 new locally acquired cases and three deaths on Sunday. Mr Andrews said he expected lockdown would be eased across regional Victoria, with the exception of Shepparton, some time this week.
“(For) regional Victorians, we hope to end the lockdown as soon as we can,” he said.
“I haven’t got the advice to do that yet.” Mr Andrews did not detail what the end of lockdown in regional Victoria would look like, but said residents should expect some freedoms.
“It would be the end to the five reasons to leave home (and) greater freedom of movement, greater economic activity,” he said.
“They would be open. They are not going to be back to normal.” Mr Andrews also flagged trialling different rules and allowing greater freedoms for people who had received both doses of a vaccination in regional areas.
Victorian testing head Jeroen Weimar said 94 of Victoria’s new cases were in Melbourne’s northern suburbs and 50 in the western suburbs.
In regional Victoria, Shepparton recorded six new cases, and Wodonga one. Mr Weimar said the Wodonga case involved a truck driver who visited a number of interstate exposure sites but immediately isolated and got tested when he showed symptoms.
New modelling from the Burnet Institute suggests Victoria’s current lockdown is working to suppress the virus while more people are vaccinated. “So hold the line in these last weeks and months until we get the high vaccination coverage that means that we can have greater confidence about seeing people … initially outdoors, initially in those ventilated settings, and in smaller numbers, but we will get there,” Victoria’s chief health officer Brett Sutton said.

Full text: New modelling put together by independent experts suggests vaccination efforts against COVID-19 should now move from targeting vulnerable groups to prioritising those aged 12 to 40.
The modelling, developed by researchers from James Cook and Monash universities, was headed by Professor Emma McBryde from JCU's Australian Institute of Tropical Health and Medicine.
Professor McBryde said the modelling indicated Australia could achieve herd immunity even against the more infectious Delta strain of the virus, but to do so, 85 per cent of the total population would need to be vaccinated.
"To achieve that level of vaccination, you would have to vaccinate teenagers," she said. "We can achieve that, but it would require a huge uptake of vaccination across the community."
Under the current national plan, based on modelling provided to the federal government by the Doherty Institute, many restrictions would start to be lifted once there was a vaccination rate of 70-80 per cent.
However, at this stage, that only takes in eligible people aged 16 and over, meaning it is a smaller percentage of the overall population.

There are 89 people in hospital in Victoria, with 24 in intensive care and 13 on a ventilator, and the new infections bring the total number of active cases in the state to 1,417.
There were 48,487 tests in the 24 hours to midnight.
Geelong has 14 active Covid cases, including six people from Lara, five from Thomson, two from Hamlyn Heights and one from Little River.
Premier Daniel Andrews said he expected lockdown would be eased across regional Victoria, with the exception of Shepparton, some time this week.
“(For) regional Victorians, we hope to the end the lockdown as soon as we can. I haven’t got the advice to do that yet,” Mr Andrews said.
Mr Andrews did not detail what the end of lockdown in regional Victoria would look like, but said residents should expect some freedoms.
“It would be the end to the five reasons to leave home (and) greater freedom of movement, greater economic activity,” he said.
“They would be open. They are not going to be back to normal.”
Mr Andrews also flagged trialling different rules and allowing greater freedoms for people who have had both doses of the vaccination in regional areas.
Victorian testing head Jeroen Weimar said 94 of the new cases were in the northern suburbs, with 53 in the Hume LGA and 17 in Moreland.
He said 50 new cases had popped up in the western suburbs, 11 cases in the southeast, nine cases in inner Melbourne and the CBD, with two cases in each of the eastern suburbs and the inner south.
In regional Victoria, Shepparton recorded six new cases, and Wodonga reported one. Eight cases remain under investigation.

“The overall outbreak map continues to be a very, very clear, very heavy concentration of community cases in the northern suburbs, in the western suburbs and we have a significant number of teams working in those areas to support people living with COVID at this point in time,” Mr Weimar said.
Mr Weimar said the positive case in Wodonga involved a truck driver who visited a number of interstate exposure sites but immediately isolated and got tested when he showed symptoms.
Victoria’s daily case count has grown rapidly in the past week as health authorities push for more people to get vaccinated.
New modelling from the Burnet Institute this week suggested the current lockdown is working to suppress the virus while more people get vaccinated.
“So hold the line in these last weeks and months until we get the high vaccination coverage that means that we can have greater confidence about seeing people … initially outdoors, initially in those ventilated settings, and in smaller numbers, but we will get there.”
Victorian MP Luke Donnellan on Saturday announced a $27 million extension of a support package for vulnerable communities, as the state battled the current outbreak.

Full text: AT what point did it become clear to you Australia had lost its freaking mind? Was it when you heard about the thousands of people stuck in tent cities and motel rooms unable to get home?
Or the sight of the Premier of Victoria solemnly warning about the dangers of watching sunsets on the beach?
Maybe it was his decision that only one parent may supervise children at a playground and must check in using a QR code.
Or his Western Australian counterpart’s accusation that others were on a “mission” to bring coronavirus to his state.
Perhaps it was ATAGI’s decision to base its risk assessment on the use of the only vaccine of which we have unlimited supply on the danger it posed in a community without any Covid, rather than on the situation in which we find ourselves today.
Or the ban – introduced with no announcement – that meant non-resident citizens required the permission of the federal government to return.
Maybe what has shocked you, even more than the absurdities to which we have been subjected, has been the incredible passivity with which they have been accepted by a resigned population.
Australia’s winter of discontent may have technically come to an end but there is no sign that spring is here.
The Doherty Institute’s modelling on the vaccination rates ­required for us to rejoin the world was meant to give us hope – something that has been in short supply this winter.
But the speed at which WA and Queensland have crab-walked away from it makes you fear our new public health overlords are not going to let go of us easily.
No doubt the Doherty refuseniks in Queensland and WA have research that backs up their positions. In Mark McGowan’s case in WA, the best sort of research there is – a thumping great victory at a general election.
But if we have learnt anything throughout this adventure it’s that political fortunes can change very quickly.
When the virus gets into Queensland and WA, as it eventually will now that elimination has been abandoned by NSW and Victoria, the conversation among the publics there will quickly change from “how good are we!” to “what the hell have you been doing for the past 18 months to prepare our hospital system for this crisis?” Perhaps McGowan and Annastacia Palaszczuk’s recalcitrance in Queensland over the Doherty model is a backhanded acknowledgment that their hospital systems have not been prepared as well as they should have been.
You can accuse Daniel Andrews of many things, but being slow on the uptake is not one of them.
So when last week the lockdown king himself dumped his treasured zero cases target and started making noises about how he would soon be setting Victorians free, you can be sure it wasn’t on a whim.
Andrews has grasped that it isn’t just the Delta variant that has changed the equation of managing the pandemic.
Victorians have run out of patience with restrictions.
Most of them aren’t going to protests, but after 200-and-whatever days in hard lockdowns people have started quietly ignoring them.
Andrews has grasped this, which is why he has been backing in Morrison in the national cabinet.
He’s also grasped that he has to find a way to ensure that when he faces the electorate next year the lockdowns are a distant and unpleasant memory.
Even so it might not be enough. It made sense during this crisis that voters would stick with incumbents. But the longer this goes, I suspect incumbency is going to ­become less and less of an asset in elections, whether or not the crisis is over.
If it is still rolling on, voters might start expressing that frustration by taking it out on the politicians who have been in their faces throughout.
But even if the crisis is over and things have returned to normal or something that looks like it, there is a danger to incumbents that voters will turn on them because they ­remind them of a time we will want to forget.
In other words, elections going forward will not be about how well anyone has done up until now but who is best able to give people hope that things will get better.
The good news for Scott Morrison, if this is true, is that the slow vaccine rollout is unlikely to be held against him.
Not just because politically it is turning out to be a bit like child care – it matters a great deal to those who need it right now but is not ­really a vote shifter for those who no longer need it.
But also because people won’t be voting on his record but on what he intends to do next.
And those plans need to include a promise to make sure desperate Australians will never again be forced to camp along state borders.

We got it wrong on NRL arrivals: Premier

Publication info: Newcastle Herald ; Newcastle, N.S.W. [Newcastle, N.S.W]. 04 Sep 2021: 34.

Full text: The premier has issued a public apology to angry Queenslanders for letting NRL families into the state while refusing to let stranded residents return home.
Annastacia Palaszczuk spent this week defending the NRL arrivals but on Friday conceded "it shouldn't have happened" when Queenslanders in COVID-19 hotspots were banned from coming home.
"I apologise, it was not the right thing to do when we had the pause," the premier said on Friday. "It shouldn't have happened. Unfortunately, it did happen, and I extend my apologies to the public about that."
The premier recently imposed a two-week ban on interstate arrivals saying capacity at the state's quarantine hotels was stretched to the limit.
When a plane load of NRL players' wives, girlfriends and children, along with league officials, was allowed in on Monday, Queenslanders stranded interstate, and families who'd packed up homes to permanently move to the northern state, erupted in anger.
On Friday, the premier reiterated the entourage did not take up rooms in state quarantine hotels, and were put up elsewhere by the NRL. But she also accepted the optics weren't good.
The ban on arrivals will begin to lift on Saturday when 50 newly available rooms in quarantine hotels will be filled. There'll be a dramatic ramp up on Monday, when an additional 680 hotel quarantine rooms become available.
Queensland had no new cases of COVID-19 on Friday and the premier has pleaded with everyone aged 16 and over to roll up their sleeves and protect themselves before the next cluster emerges.
Queensland's vaccination coverage, which is currently 51.6 per cent for one dose and 32.9 per cent fully vaccinated, is the second lowest in the country.
Chief Health Officer Jeannette Young said she wanted every eligible Queenslander to have been offered a vaccine before the state reopens.
She took offence on Friday when asked what level of COVID-19 deaths she would be comfortable with.
The question was asked in the context of Doherty Institute modelling the federal government is relying on to open up the country. It details the deaths that can be expected under different pandemic scenarios.
"I'm a doctor - none," she replied.
"Come on, can you please remember who I am?
"I'm not comfortable with any deaths that are preventable, so that's why I want every single Queenslander to be vaccinated, because that is the best protection."
Dr Young said the risk from two infected truck drivers who've been in Queensland was low.

Full text: AUSTRALIA’S ban on at-home fast Covid-19 tests used widely around the world is hampering efforts to get schoolchildren back into the classroom.
It is hoped the rapid antigen test, which can produce results in 30 minutes, would provide an extra layer of protection for children, if used at home before school.
But under current guidelines by the Therapeutic Goods Administration (TGA) the test can only be conducted in Australia under the ­supervision of a healthcare practitioner.
Moves to change this advice and allow home testing, have already dragged on for months with no indication of when the ruling could be overturned.
An industry source said the supervision requirement added a labour cost of about $20 a test – which are widely sold for about $7.
The federal government has tasked the TGA with examining home tests, with a spokesman for Health Minister Greg Hunt confirming the work had commenced.
“The Minister strongly supports the use of rapid antigen testing in alternate settings, including at the home,” the spokesman said.
Residents in the UK have had access to tests to quickly self-diagnose Covid-19 at home since April, with Scott Morrison even using them daily during his travel there for the G7 conference.
The Herald Sun first revealed the expert push for rapid testing to be used to fast-track a return to schools last month. Now, University of NSW Professor Mary-Louise McLaws said the TGA has been too slow in reversing the ban. Prof McLaws said if the red tape was cut, rapid at-home tests could be rolled out in Australia in “big numbers”.
“That’s the way we could get every kid back to school, fast.” The world’s biggest study into the risk of “long Covid” in children found it was much lower than originally feared.
Researchers from University College London said they were “reassured” after finding that just two to 14 per cent of infected children aged 11 to 17 had symptoms 15 weeks later. It comes as Queensland Premier Annastacia Palaszczuk was condemned for “damaging public confidence” by misquoting Covid-19 death rate modelling and scaremongering about the illness infecting young children.

Full text: QUEENSLAND Premier Annastacia Palaszczuk has been slammed for airing concerns about Covid-19 in children that federal Treasurer Josh Frydenberg says contradict the medical advice and exhibit a “denial of reality”.
Ms Palaszczuk on Wednesday withdrew her support for the national reopening plan once the vaccination targets are reached, declaring opening Queensland’s borders would be too risky for unvaccinated children.
“You open up this state and you let the virus in here and every child under 12 is vulnerable, every single child,” she told the Queensland parliament.
Ms Palaszczuk demanded more research be presented on the dangers of Covid-19 for kids before she would reaffirm her commitment to the national plan.
“I want to see a paper. I don’t want to see a slide show, I want to see detailed information,” she said. “I want to know what is going to happen to the children of this state.” But Mr Frydenberg said Ms Palaszczuk was deluded, as medical advice clearly indicated the national reopening plan was safe for children.
“She said she’s scared for Queensland kids, does that wash with you?” Sunrise host David Koch asked Mr Frydenberg.
“No. It’s a desperate denial of the reality and is not based on the medical advice,” the Treasurer replied on Thursday.
Mr Frydenberg stressed the medical advice given to the federal government said Covid-19 was “much less severe” in children than adults.
“The medical advice is that we should vaccinate people aged 12 to 15 – which we’re doing,” the Treasurer said.
“The medical advice is what we are following. The medical advice is what the Doherty modelling is based on.” Mr Frydenberg then warned Ms Palaszczuk about the consequences and realities of attempting to follow a zero-Covid policy past the vaccination reopening targets.
“The states and territories should have no expectation that that level of economic support that we are providing today will continue once we reach those 70 per cent to 80 per cent targets,” he told the Today show.
“The people of Queensland are recognising they have to live with Covid – it’s a reality that is now being accepted.
“They can’t eliminate (Covid-19). No country has eliminated it. That is why it’s so important we stick to the plan and open up accordingly.” But Ms Palaszczuk insisted her state’s hospital system would crumble if Delta crossed into Queensland’s borders.
“The peak (in infections) is not going to be until October. If you want to see a health system on the verge of collapse, you will see that in October,” she told the Queensland parliament on Wednesday.
“I don’t want that here.” Despite Ms Palaszczuk’s concerns, Mr Frydenberg maintained that for the sake of the economy, the Premier should follow the national plan.
“In Queensland, the tourism businesses are doing it really tough,” he said. “Why does (Ms Palaszczuk) want to keep the borders closed when the rest of the country is opening up?”

Albanese goes cold on Premier’s push

Full text: Federal Labor has distanced itself from Queensland Premier Annastacia Palaszczuk’s attack on the four-stage national plan to live with Covid-19.
Anthony Albanese said there had not yet been a vaccine ­approved for children aged under 12 after Ms Palaszczuk said she would keep the state border closed “until I can get every child ­vaccinated”.
“I support the national plan,” the Opposition Leader said. “And what the national plan provides for is for a reduction in restrictions upon achieving the 70 per cent and 80 per cent full vaccination rates.
“At the moment, there aren’t vaccines … approved for people under 12. And we do need to open up when it is safe to do so.” When asked whether Ms Palas­zczuk was “scaremongering” by raising the risks to young children posed by Covid-19, Mr Albanese said parents were “very worried about their children”.
He shifted focus to the need to vaccinate 12 to 15-year-olds, a step approved by the federal government. Mr Albanese said Labor was supportive of 12 to 15-year-olds being included in vaccination targets under the national plan. “The Prime Minister and the government need to outline what the plan is to vaccinate 12 to 15-year-olds, and whether those numbers should be included as part of those targets,” he said.
“Labor has said that is a matter for the national cabinet, although we are in favour of it.” However, Mr Albanese used a speech in parliament to call on the government to prepare for children younger than 12 to be included as part of the vaccination program.
Federal Labor MPs from Queensland were privately supportive of Ms Palaszczuk’s strategy, saying she was in touch with community sentiment on Covid-19.
One MP said criticism of state governments pursuing zero Covid cases was “Sydney-centric”, given it was a reality in Queensland, Western Australia, Tasmania and South Australia.
Labor MPs outside of Queensland were unhappy about Ms Palas­zczuk’s “ridiculous” attack on the national plan.
On Thursday, the Queensland Premier sent a tweet cherry-­picking data from the Doherty Institute modelling to claim there would be 2240 Covid deaths a month if restrictions ended when the population was 70 per cent vaccinated.
The national plan does not include ending all restrictions when the population is 70 per cent vaccinated but recommends an easing of lockdown measures.
Chief medical officer Paul Kelly said children did not generally get severe illness from the Delta strain of Covid. “There have only been three children under the age of 12 that have been admitted to intensive care. Three out of 3815. That is way less than 1 in 1000,” Professor Kelly said. “While cases have been about 17 per cent of total cases notified this year, that hospitalisation rate and the ICU rate in particular and the fact that there’ve been no deaths in under 12s is very different to what we’re seeing in adults and older children.”

Full text: Schoolchildren trapped interstate allowed to quarantine with family QUEENSLAND children stuck interstate and separated from family will be allowed to return under the state government’s first trial of home quarantine.
Premier Annastacia Palas­zczuk will on Tuesday announce that from next week, Queensland children who go to boarding school interstate and have become trapped due to border closures will be allowed to go into home quarantine in a bid to reunite families.
The trial comes after the state government last week slammed hotel quarantine shut to people travelling from any hotspots due to the system becoming overwhelmed.
It is also a shift in policy for the Premier, who last week said her government was not considering home quarantine.
Previously, children seeking to return to Queensland would have to undergo hotel quarantine, with a parent required to undertake the 14-day stay with them.
Under the home quarantine trial, the child would be allowed to isolate at home with the entire household expected to isolate for 14 days.
The state government will monitor the family with a tracking app, though details have not yet been made public.
The trial will apply to only a small cohort and does not apply to children who board in Queensland, but live in an interstate hotspot. The children must be trapped in an interstate hotspot without their parents to be eligible for the trial.
Ms Palaszczuk is understood to be writing to those people who will be able to gain access to the scheme.
It is understood the trial, if successful, could result in home quarantine being used more extensively in Queensland.
Meanwhile, Ms Palaszczuk said she still wanted to see more information about the latest Doherty Institute modelling before making a call on it – saying it would be irresponsible to do otherwise.
The federal government has insisted the Premier has already been provided the same modelling presented to the Prime Minister and other state and territory leaders.
Ms Palaszczuk on Monday said she had not seen the ­“detailed modelling” and she would not commit to something she had not seen.
A federal government spokeswoman said: “The Queensland Premier has been provided with the same detailed modelling presented to the Prime Minister and other state and territory leaders.” Queensland recorded two cases of Covid-19 on Monday, both in people in hotel quarantine, and zero locally ­acquired infections.

Full text: HSC STUDENTS USED 'AS PAWNS' I call on the NSW Education Minister Sarah Mitchell to stand down over the management of the HSC with the changes announced on Friday.
Clearly the NSW government has failed to manage the COVID-19 cases.
Now the decision for the continuation of the HSC feels like HSC students are being used as pawns in a game to justify taking vaccines away from communities like Wilcannia.
As a parent of a year 12 student, I do not believe students should remain in school longer than normal.
Students are prepared to complete their exams now and move on. Their time at school is over.
This delay negatively impacts them emotionally, educationally and financially.
I also personally know of the negative impacts on individuals.
International students who had flights booked to return home after two years abroad now can't.
My own daughter had a job lined up for later November which she cannot start.
The decision to delay the HSC has implications. I don't believe the needs of the students have been considered.
Greg Adamson, Griffith LET OUR PUPILS LOOSE ON LOGO What happened to community input? ("City logo faces facelift", The Daily Advertiser, August 25).
Why can't the school students of Wagga Wagga submit designs, and have the community vote on the winner?
Stephen Sutton, Wagga READ MORE LETTERS:
Humbled by inspiring attitudes of paralympians Roads around town have 'more holes than a crumpet' Too little too late from Prime Minister on issues STATE MUST PUT PEOPLE FIRST In the last few days, NSW has recorded record numbers of coronavirus cases.
Yet, we have been told we are on a 'safe' pathway to opening up.
The Doherty modelling assumes that there is an active TTIQ (track, trace, isolate, quarantine) system in place, but NSW lost grip of the tracking and tracing some time ago.
Now, we face a boom in clinical cases, including in relatively isolated communities such as Wilcannia.
The irony that Indigenous Australians are supposedly a priority group for vaccination should not be missed.
Gladys Berejiklian seems to avoid any hard questioning from the media, very unlike the Victorian situation last year when Dan Andrews was relentlessly asked the same questions repeatedly from the NewsCorp hacks at press conferences.
With ambulance and hospital services already stretched in some areas, consider the other patients who lose out due to coronavirus cases: emergency cases, surgery cases, cancer treatment and many others.
Yesterday's Guardian Australia reports that nurses are sedating non-COVID ICU patients as a desperate measure to allow them to stay on top of their hospital cases. This is nothing short of appalling.
The suspicion is that the NSW approach to 'living with the virus' prioritises the economy over the people of NSW, and the only safe plan from a federal perspective is to return Scott Morrison to the PM role within the next year.

Full text: EDITORIAL AUSTRALIA’S response to the Covid-19 pandemic so often seems to be a case of one step forward, two steps back. After doing so well in suppressing the virus in 2020, the lag in vaccinations has seen lockdowns and border restrictions linger far longer than seemed possible at the start of the year.
But now, the vaccination rollout has well and truly gathered pace, with yesterday’s announcement of a new hub at the Entertainment Centre at Boondall welcome news.
The hub will eventually accept people without an appointment, a long-overdue development.
And despite Queensland only being ahead of Western Australia on the national vaccination table (it is a race), we are heading in the right direction. Sometime today, our vaccination tracker should tick over to 50 per cent of people with at least one shot, an achievement that should be celebrated.
And that is why it is becoming increasingly frustrating that Premier Annastacia Palaszczuk is still refusing to commit to following the Doherty Institute modelling and opening up borders and limiting lockdowns when the vax rate hits 80 per cent.
Most worryingly, in a case of moving the goalposts, chief health officer Jeannette Young yesterday said that although an 80 per cent vaccination rate would be excellent, she’d like to see a new target of 95 per cent. With more than 1200 people in NSW yesterday testing positive to Covid-19, it seems the virus is with us to stay. We just need some clarity on our future.

Full text: EDITORIAL AUSTRALIA’S response to the Covid-19 pandemic so often seems to be a case of one step forward, two steps back. After doing so well in suppressing the virus in 2020, the lag in vaccinations has seen lockdowns and border restrictions linger far longer than seemed possible at the start of the year.
But now, the vaccination rollout has well and truly gathered pace, with yesterday’s announcement of a new hub at the Entertainment Centre at Boondall welcome news.
The hub will eventually accept people without an appointment, a long-overdue development.
And despite Queensland only being ahead of Western Australia on the national vaccination table (it is a race), we are heading in the right direction. Sometime today, our vaccination tracker should tick over to 50 per cent of people with at least one shot, an achievement that should be celebrated.
And that is why it is becoming increasingly frustrating that Premier Annastacia Palaszczuk is still refusing to commit to following the Doherty Institute modelling and opening up borders and limiting lockdowns when the vax rate hits 80 per cent.
Most worryingly, in a case of moving the goalposts, chief health officer Jeannette Young yesterday said that although an 80 per cent vaccination rate would be excellent, she’d like to see a new target of 95 per cent. With more than 1200 people in NSW yesterday testing positive to Covid-19, it seems the virus is with us to stay. We just need some clarity on our future.

Full text: All Australian children aged 12-15 will be able to receive a Covid-19 vaccine by the end of the year, in a significant boost to the nation’s rollout.
The government’s expert ­immunisation panel on Friday gave the green light to the children receiving the Pfizer vaccine, moving the minimum age from 16 to 12. Bookings open from September 13 and will be available through GPs, Aboriginal community-controlled health centres, commonwealth and state-run vaccination centres and school-based programs.
Since the start of the month, vulnerable children in the 12-15 age group, including Indigenous children and those with under­lying health conditions, have been eligible to receive a vaccination.
Health Minister Greg Hunt said the updated advice was an “extremely important” next step in Australia’s vaccination rollout.
Education Minister Alan Tudge said it would give “peace of mind” to kids, parents and teachers as schools in NSW, the ACT and Victoria prepared to reopen.
The government confirmed the Moderna vaccine could also be administered to teenagers if it was registered by the Therapeutic Goods Administration and recommended by the Australian Technical Advisory Group on Immunisation. Despite Pfizer supplies remaining tight, the Morrison government said every family who wanted their adolescent to be vaccinated could do so before the end of the year.
Scott Morrison also flagged there were “promising leads” about doses for the age cohort.
The Prime Minister said the updated advice would make it possible for families to be vaccinated at the same time. “I would see that happening especially through the GP network, and that provides the opportunity for family vaccinations, for the family to go along together across those age groups,” he said.
ATAGI said the benefits of ­offering vaccinations to younger adolescents outweighed known or potential risks. It also said it would help reduce disruption to their education by preventing disease.
“Covid-19 epidemiology in this age group is rapidly evolving, with younger age groups more implicated in transmission in the context of Delta,” it said.
“With older age groups ­increasingly protected by vaccination, a greater proportion of Covid-19 is anticipated to occur in adolescents and children.” Some premiers had called for children to be included in the vaccination targets that are tied to the staged easing of restrictions across the country. The Doherty Institute’s modelling, which underpins the ­national plan, is based on vaccinations of those 16 and over.
But Mr Morrison said there was no medical advice to include 12 to 15-year-olds in the national targets. “Inclusion in the target does not mean they shouldn’t be vaccinated. The target is about the overall level of vaccination in the adult population, which are the primary transmitters of the virus.” Of Australians over 16, 33 per cent are fully vaccinated and 56 per cent have received a first dose.

Why kids are more likely to get Delta

Publication info: Sydney Morning Herald ; Sydney, N.S.W. [Sydney, N.S.W]. 27 Aug 2021: 1.

Full text: If the pandemic has had a silver lining until now, it has been children. For reasons scientists still do not fully understand, they have been largely spared the ravages of COVID-19.
Some 986 Australians have died of COVID-19. Just one of the deaths was in a person 19 or younger.
But Delta has changed the shape of the pandemic. Countries that thought their vaccine programs had defeated the virus, such as the US and Britain, now face a new wave of infections.
Does this variant pose a greater risk to children? The anecdotes are scary: children in hospital with COVID-19 in the US reached a peak of 1900 last week, though that's only a tiny fraction of the 11,521 Americans admitted every week. Nearly one in five new infections in the US is now in children. Hospitals in several states report they are running out of pediatric intensive-care beds.
Meanwhile, Australians under 15 who do not have an underlying vulnerability remain ineligible for a COVID-19 vaccine.
A mood of panic has crept into the community, says Associate Professor Margie Danchin, paediatrician and immunisation expert at the Royal Children's Hospital in Melbourne. "It's important to get this data out. There is this real groundswell of panic among parents."
Is Delta making kids sicker?
In general, COVID-19 is a very mild illness for children.
"They can catch infection easily but most cases have no or mild symptoms. You might not even know you've had COVID-19," says Robert Booy, professor of child health at The Children's Hospital at Westmead.
Of 393 Australian children who presented to hospitals with COVID-19 in 2020, just 44 were admitted and the rest were sent home. More than one-third had no symptoms. In 4 per cent of cases, a medical intervention was necessary.
Which brings us to Delta. More children are being infected with Delta, experts say. This is because it is a more infectious variant: everyone is more likely to be infected.
But it is not making children any sicker. "Overall, parents need to know that kids still mostly get mild disease with a sore throat, runny nose and fatigue mostly, like a nasty cold, but they are very unlikely to get sick," says Professor Danchin.
This is important, so let's hear it again. "The evidence shows, to the best of our knowledge to date, COVID-19 - even with Delta - remains a mild illness for children," says Royal Australasian College of Physicians president-elect and paediatrician Dr Jacqueline Small.
Let's go to the data.
In November, a month before Delta was first detected in the US, 1.8 per cent of people hospitalised there with COVID-19 were children. Cut to this month, and that number has risen to ... 2.3 per cent.
"Data from the UK and other countries such as India also show the same - no increases in ICU admissions and deaths with Delta, and much lower rates than in adults," says Professor Danchin. One infant is in hospital with COVID-19 in Victoria, the state government said on August 23. In NSW, between June 16 and August 7, there were 41 people aged 17 or younger in hospital with COVID-19 out of a total of 759.
All this adds up to the conclusion of the Doherty Institute's modelling for reopening Australia: in the first six months after we reopen at 80 per cent vaccination, of 762 predicted deaths (most of whom will be unvaccinated), 25 will be in children under 16.
However, this model assumes no one under 16 will be vaccinated, which is not the case, with vulnerable children aged 12 to 15 already eligible and a rollout still to happen for all 12- to 15-year-olds.
Why are more kids in hospital
The Delta variant is about 60 per cent more infectious than the Alpha variant of the virus, which in turn was about 50 per cent more contagious than the strain of the virus that emerged in Wuhan.
That means everybody is more likely to get sick. More adults, more children.
"There will be more infections in children and young people who are unvaccinated. There is no evidence, as yet, that Delta is making children more sick," says Professor Fiona Russell, a paediatric infectious diseases epidemiologist and vaccinologist and spokeswoman for the Murdoch Children's Research Institute.
At the same time, vaccine programs are progressing around the world. These programs have typically prioritised the people most vulnerable to the virus: the elderly. Some 88.7 per cent of Americans over 75 have been vaccinated versus just 17.6 per cent of those under 18.
While vaccines are not 100 per cent effective at preventing infection, they substantially cut the risk of catching COVID-19. By giving them to adults, we dramatically cut their risk of catching COVID-19. So, simple statistics tell us that children will make up a bigger proportion of cases now than they did earlier in the pandemic because they make up a bigger proportion of unprotected people.
But this does not mean Delta is making kids sicker. The US data is "being taken completely out of context", says Danchin.
The effect that vaccination has on making the virus look like it is targeting children can be seen in Victoria's infection data.
In July and August 2020, the peak of Victoria's second wave, people 19 and younger made up 16.4 per cent of diagnosed cases.
In between July 1 and August 23 this year, people 19 and younger made up 37 per cent of cases.
Why? In part because in July and August 2020, people aged over 70 made up 13 per cent of cases. In July and August 2021, they made up just 0.9 per cent. This is evidence that a) the virus is more infectious and b) the vaccines effectively cut your risk of catching it.
There is a third issue warping the situation in the US to make Delta look worse for children than it is: respiratory syncytial virus, or RSV. A largely harmless seasonal virus in adults, it can cause severe infection - leading to hospitalisation - in children younger than one. Some 58,000 American children are hospitalised with it every year.
RSV, like COVID-19, is a respiratory virus. That means lockdowns and masks also inhibit its spread. RSV was almost absent in 2020. When restrictions lifted, it came back with force.
Australia experienced a surge this year, says Russell, when, luckily, there was little COVID-19 around.
The US is being hit with both RSV and COVID-19 at the same time, putting the pediatric healthcare system under serious strain.
Why do children get less sick?
The protection that children seem to have to COVID-19 is unexpected. Typically, they are most at risk from respiratory viruses.
Teams around the world are still trying to figure out why this is. Children generally seem to possess a much more powerful innate system than adults; work by Dr Melanie Neeland, published in Nature Communications, shows a much greater activation of the innate system in children with COVID-19 than in adults.
A second possibility: antibody studies show children "tend to display a more targeted antibody response to this virus" than adults, says Neeland. This could be because adult immune systems have already had to fight off the coronaviruses that cause the common cold; memories of this virus may lead them to create less effective antibodies. Children appear not have this problem.
About 13.3 per cent of adults who catch COVID-19 have symptoms for at least four weeks and 4.5 per cent have symptoms for eight weeks. In children, only 4.4 per cent have symptoms past four weeks, and just 1.8 per cent past eight weeks, according to a large Lancet study.

Full text: TASMANIA – with its enviable Covid-19 status – is keen to emerge from the “cave of Covid” but will continue to rely on local health advice despite the national push for states to learn to live with the virus rather than lockdown.
The Delta strain of the virus continues to run rampant in NSW and Victoria while Tasmania has not had a case of community transmission since May 6 last year.
Health Minister Jeremy Rockliff says he would like to see every eligible Tasmanian vaccinated before the state opens its borders.
Royal Hobart Hospital’s Frank Nicholson this week raised concerns about the ­capacity of the health system to cope with an outbreak of the Delta strain with the system having half the beds needed.
Mr Rockliff said Tasmania was preparing to handle the situation if new cases emerged.
“Another 100 emergency ventilators are on their way to bring the total to 370 in the state,” Mr Rockliff said.
He said Tasmanians had done a tremendous job remaining Covid-19-free since 2020 and this had been achieved through the good will of the population and tough border controls.
“I recognise the Doherty modelling and the frustration restrictions have imposed over the last 18 months,’’ he said.
“But we have a more vulnerable ageing population and will be guided by our public health advice.
“We need to get to a point where we can ease restrictions but we will not risk the safety of Tasmania. Our focus is on vaccination.
“We would like to ensure more than 80 per cent of eligible Tasmanians were vaccinated before we opened up. Actually, I’d like to see every single Tasmanian vaccinated.” At 6pm on August 22, 37.5 per cent of Tasmanians were fully vaccinated. This week, Scott Morrison told state and territory leaders they must not be afraid of Covid-19 cases rising, once enough of the population was vaccinated.
“Once you get to 70 per cent of your country that is eligible for the vaccine and 80 per cent, the plan sets out that we have to move forward, we cannot hold back,” the Prime Minister said.
“We must adjust our mindset. Cases will not be the issue … dealing with serious illness, hospitalisation, ICU capabilities, our ability to respond in those circumstances, that will be our goal.” Mr Morrison said states and territories needed to hold to an agreement to wind down Covid-19 restrictions as more people were vaccinated and signalled financial support might dry up for states that did not. Federal, state and territory governments agreed to a ­national plan in July to begin reopening the country and end large-scale lockdowns once 80 per cent of the eligible population was vaccinated.

Premier’s plan leaves Albanese in a bind

Full text: Anthony Albanese has refused to criticise West Australian Premier Mark McGowan for pursuing a Covid-zero strategy, despite throwing Labor’s support behind the national strategy for living with the virus.
The Opposition Leader said Mr McGowan had “kept Western Australia safe” and would not distance himself from Mr McGowan’s goal to have no Covid cases, which is at odds with the aims of the national plan that is informed by modelling from the Doherty Institute.
“I find it quite extraordinary that the Prime Minister has basically described Western Australians and Queenslanders as somehow being cave people wanting to stay in the cave,” Mr Albanese told the ABC.
“The reason why there are restrictions is because of the Prime Minister’s failure to secure enough vaccines, including for Western Australians and Queenslanders, and a failure to build purpose-built quarantine.” After senior MPs Bill Shorten and Joel Fitzgibbon on Wednesday called for an end to lockdowns when vaccination rates reached 80 per cent, Mr Albanese said Labor backed the reopening plan formulated by national cabinet in July.
Mr Albanese said, under the four-stage plan to normality, there was scope for targeted lockdowns when vaccination rates reached 70 and 80 per cent of the population.
“It has proposals at 70 per cent and 80 per cent. It is, as it is written, there is scope there for lockdowns, but targeted if they’re absolutely necessary,” Mr Albanese said.
“Labor supports the national plan. No one wants to see lockdowns there for one day more than necessary.” Finance Minister Simon Birmingham conceded targeted lockdowns “in some circumstances” could be used under the national plan when vaccination rates reached 70 to 80 per cent.
“Lockdowns become much less likely and if they do occur you are talking more about particular geographical centres,” Senator Birmingham told the ABC.
“Because right now, understandably, people living across Victoria, living across NSW and living across most parts of the country, (when they hear) lockdowns, they think that what we’re talking about, what we are facing is a potential of … a prolonged statewide lockdown.” Senator Birmingham said there could be commonwealth funding available for victims of lockdowns in stages B and C in the plan, as long as state governments used the measure “in the spirit of the agreement”.
Doherty Institute director Sharon Lewin on Wednesday reiterated her advice that a Covid-zero goal was not sustainable.
“We will still make every effort to stop transmission, but we don’t need to get to that very difficult spot of zero,” Professor Lewin said.
On Tuesday, opposition health spokesman Mark Butler conceded Australians would be living with Covid but he also would not disavow the strategy of Mr McGowan.
“Covid at some point, if it hasn’t already, will become endemic in this nation as it’s likely to in pretty much every other nation on the planet,” Mr Butler said. In caucus on Tuesday, Mr Albanese accused Mr Morrison of being misleading about the contents of the plan, but some Labor MPs believed Mr Albanese risked walking into a trap set by Mr Morrison and making the party look like it was opposed to reopening.

Vic aged care centres to get rapid tests

Full text: Visitors to Victorian aged care centres will soon have to undergo a rapid COVID-19 test before entering.
TLC Healthcare will roll out on-the-spot antigen tests, which can produce a result within 15 minutes, at its 11 residential aged care homes in Melbourne and Geelong from September 9.
In a national first, every visitor to the centre will be required to be tested. Staff members and contractors ineligible to be vaccinated will also need to test negative before each shift, and take a fortnightly PCR test.
TLC chief executive Lou Pascuzzi said the screening would reduce the threat of lockdowns while allowing centres to welcome visitors.
"It may take some getting used to, but we see this as an invaluable tool in minimising the risk of a Covid outbreak amongst our very vulnerable residents," he said.
The reliability of rapid antigen tests varies depending on the make, though TLC insists the model it will use will be 95 per cent effective.
Mr Pascuzzi claimed there was a lack of guidance over how aged care providers should manage Covid in the long-term. He said the the Doherty Institute modelling, on which the government's reopening hopes are pinned, did not specifically address the sector.
"There is ambiguity in the report around effects of current and future variants of Covid, and the disease-severity assumptions that don't cater to high-risk environments such as residential aged care," he said.
"I would urgently recommend that a more detailed report be compiled that contains modelling and recommendations specific to residential aged care."
The Therapeutic Goods Administration has approved more than 20 antigen tests in Australia, which need to be administered by a professional. Unlike in the UK, no variation has been approved for self-use.

Full text: Visitors to Victorian aged care centres will soon have to undergo a rapid COVID-19 test before entering.
TLC Healthcare will roll out on-the-spot antigen tests, which can produce a result within 15 minutes, at its 11 residential aged care homes in Melbourne and Geelong from September 9.
In a national first, every visitor to the centre will be required to be tested. Staff members and contractors ineligible to be vaccinated will also need to test negative before each shift, and take a fortnightly PCR test.
TLC chief executive Lou Pascuzzi said the screening would reduce the threat of lockdowns while allowing centres to welcome visitors.
"It may take some getting used to, but we see this as an invaluable tool in minimising the risk of a Covid outbreak amongst our very vulnerable residents," he said.
The reliability of rapid antigen tests varies depending on the make, though TLC insists the model it will use will be 95 per cent effective.
Mr Pascuzzi claimed there was a lack of guidance over how aged care providers should manage Covid in the long-term. He said the the Doherty Institute modelling, on which the government's reopening hopes are pinned, did not specifically address the sector.
"There is ambiguity in the report around effects of current and future variants of Covid, and the disease-severity assumptions that don't cater to high-risk environments such as residential aged care," he said.
"I would urgently recommend that a more detailed report be compiled that contains modelling and recommendations specific to residential aged care."
The Therapeutic Goods Administration has approved more than 20 antigen tests in Australia, which need to be administered by a professional. Unlike in the UK, no variation has been approved for self-use.

PM’s team stakes all on reopening gambit

Full text: Scott Morrison and Josh Frydenberg believe Covid-19 cannot be eliminated and they have tied their government to a new rallying cry – opening up at 70 to 80 per cent vaccination – triggering a likely political war with the elimination-oriented West Australian and Queensland premiers.
With his leadership authority having eroded for weeks, Morrison has embraced a new stance. It is based on hope, restoring economic activity, insisting that Australia change its mindset to live with the virus and concluding that statewide lockdowns become yesterday’s solutions.
This edifice rests on two assumptions. The first is that 70 to 80 per cent vaccination rates, once achieved, will turn public opinion decisively against lockdowns and the elimination mania that has governed the premiers. And second, that hospital systems can cope with the consequences of opening up given the higher intensive care unit and death rates that will result.
The Morrison government’s future depends on these judgments. The ultimate issue is whether the lockdown power of the premiers will be destroyed by the Delta strand. The political transformation is far advanced in NSW, where Gladys Berejiklian champions vaccination as the path to reopening and attacks as “completely unrealistic” the zero cases stance of other premiers, notably WA’s Mark McGowan.
The immediate political battlefield is Victoria, where Australia’s lockdown titleholder, Daniel Andrews, faces his moment of truth against Delta. As daily numbers rise, Andrews still forecasts his victory but the probability is that Victoria will follow NSW into a protracted and losing lockdown.
If Delta out-muscles Andrews the appeal of lockdowns will face a devastating blow. The Morrison-Frydenberg position that the virus cannot be eliminated will be vindicated in the second most populous state. Andrews, having issued patronising critiques of Berejiklian for weeks, will find himself consigned to a similar fate as NSW.
Andrews and Berejiklian, while using lockdowns to try to contain the virus, are strong proponents of the national plan endorsed by the national cabinet last month that envisages a four-stage return to normality with the two big triggers for reopening being 70 per cent and then 80 per cent vaccination rates based on Doherty Institute modelling.
Morrison worked for months to secure this plan in the cause of national consistency. But Morrison and Frydenberg, faced with resistance from McGowan and Queensland’s Annastacia Palaszczuk, decided to put their plan into lights, turn it into a popular national aspiration and use it to sway public opinion from lockdowns to reopening.
There are risks in doing this as the politics vary from state to state. McGowan’s hermit kingdom stance in WA remains popular despite it being, ultimately, an unsustainable fraud. In truth, Morrison and Frydenberg had no other viable option. They must show leadership. Morrison has been seriously damaged by the appallingly slow vaccine rollout and being cast as politically subservient to, and an economic conscript of, the premiers.
The turning point was Frydenberg’s ABC 7.30 interview last Thursday when he said elimination of Covid was a fallacy, that the nation must live with the virus for “years to come” and accept the “deaths and serious illness” this involved. He warned premiers once the vaccine targets were reached there should be “no expectations” of the same levels of federal financial support if they persisted with the same lockdown strategy.
The next day Morrison called the agreed national plan a “deal with the Australian people” that the premiers had signed. These words reveal the heart of Morrison’s calculation – that at 70 to 80 per cent vaccination levels the public will expect their leaders to deliver more freedom, economic activity and a jobs revival.
On Monday Morrison went harder. He said the plan, based on Doherty Institute advice, meant vaccinating at record pace and changing our mindset to reward the public for its sacrifices. “If not at 70 per cent and 80 per cent, then when?” Morrison asked. “We must make that move. We must prepare the country to make that move.” Without identifying the recalcitrant premiers or federal Labor, Morrison said “there will be those who seek to undermine the national plan”, adding they were motivated by politics. This sets up a potentially explosive political situation – a nation divided state by state when reopening begins.
There are three problems for the Morrison-Frydenberg strategy. First, opening up from a high number of cases in NSW and maybe Victoria is being used by other premiers demanding a rethink, with McGowan denouncing NSW policies as a failure. In response Morrison said the Doherty Institute would update on this situation but its advice to him was that “the start point does not influence the overall conclusions of the model”.
In a Monday statement Doherty Institute director Sharon Lewin said reopening with the large case numbers was still valid at 70 to 80 per cent vaccination.
In a separate statement the institute said: “Once we reach 70 per cent vaccine coverage, opening up at tens or hundreds of cases nationally per day is possible; however, we will need vigilant public health interventions with higher caseloads.” Second, vaccination of young people aged 12 to 15 must still be factored into the agenda overall. And third, the national plan said 70 to 80 per cent easing should occur only when these thresholds were reached at the national level and in each jurisdiction. That’s a double test and this is the catch.
The vaccination rates in the states fluctuate wildly. This will become a devastating reality. The bonus of the NSW lockdown is its huge incentive for vaccination. Surging rates suggest that NSW hits 70 per cent before the end of October and 80 per cent by mid-November – maybe faster – yet Queensland, South Australia and WA will be lagging weeks behind.
Berejiklian won’t wait. She will begin to reopen NSW at 70 per cent. For her, that’s a political imperative. Morrison and Frydenberg, obviously, will have little option but to support her. Yet other premiers will say this violates the letter of the national plan – just wait for the outcry from McGowan and Palaszczuk. But Andrews addressed this reality on Tuesday, saying each state was in a different situation and would make its own decisions.
The timing of vaccination will determine the timing of reopening, state by state. The politics are certain to be fraught and different among states. If cases are low or zero in WA and Queensland when Berejiklian opens up then the denunciation from McGowan and Palaszczuk is likely to be deafening, claiming Berejiklian threatens the entire nation. Expect a pro-lockdown media to back the populist alarmism. Yet support for reopening will be strong. Morrison and Frydenberg must lead the country away from a futile hermit island fate. Everything will hinge on the public accepting the rate of hospitalisations and deaths. The transition will be high risk. But Morrison and Frydenberg, living together at the Lodge during the current sittings, have staked their government’s revival on this agenda.

Full text: The Delta strain of the virus continues to run rampant in NSW and Victoria while this State has not seen a case of community transmission since May 6 last year.
Health Minister Jeremy Rockliff says he would like to see every eligible Tasmanian vaccinated before this state opens its borders.
Royal Hobart Hospital’s Frank Nicholson this week raised concerns about the capacity of the State’s health system to cope with an outbreak of the Delta strain with the system having half the beds needed.
But Mr Rockliff said Tasmania was preparing and was prepared to handle the situation if new cases emerge here.
“Another 100 emergency ventilators are on their way to bring the total to 370 in the State,” Mr Rockliff said.
He said Tasmanians had done a tremendous job remaining Covid-19 free since 2020 and this had been achieved through the good will of the population and tough border controls.
“I recognise the Doherty modelling and the frustration restrictions have imposed over the last 18 months. But we have a more vulnerable ageing population and will be guided by our public health advice,” he said.
“We need to get to a point where we can ease restrictions but we will not risk the safety of Tasmania. Our focus is on vaccination. We would like to ensure more than 80 per cent of eligible Tasmanians were vaccinated before we opened up. Actually, I’d like to see every single Tasmanian vaccinated.”
At 6pm on August 22, 37.5 per cent of Tasmanians were fully vaccinated.
This week Prime Minister Scott Morrison told state and territory leaders they must not be afraid of COVID-19 cases rising once enough of the population was vaccinated.
“Once you get to 70 per cent of your country that is eligible for the vaccine and 80 per cent, the plan sets out that we have to move forward, we cannot hold back,” he said.
“We must adjust our mindset. Cases will not be the issue … dealing with serious illness, hospitalisation, ICU capabilities, our ability to respond in those circumstances, that will be our goal.”
Mr Morrison says states and territories need to hold to an agreement to wind down COVID-19 restrictions as more people are vaccinated and signalled financial support may dry up for states that do not.
Federal, state and territory governments agreed to a national plan last month to begin reopening the country and end large-scale lockdowns once 80 per cent of the eligible population was vaccinated.

Waiting for Pfizer? The 'boomer' vaccine delay could prove catastrophic

Full text: At least 60 people have now died in the current New South Wales COVID outbreak.
We've been keeping track of how old these people were, and have observed 85% of the COVID deaths up to August 18 (51 out of 60) were among people aged over 60.
We've also been taking note of reports on their vaccination status. It appears 96% of those over 60 who have died (49 of 51) were not vaccinated, or had only received one dose.
These deaths are tragic and, in all likelihood, were preventable. So if you're over 60 and are yet to be vaccinated, now is not the time to hesitate.
Older age increases your risk from COVID-19 Age is a major risk factor for serious illness and death from COVID-19.
A person aged 65-74 is at six times greater risk of hospitalisation and 95 times greater risk of dying compared to an adult under 30.
People over 85 are 15 times more likely to be hospitalised and 600 times more likely to die than 18 to 29-year-olds.
This is why Australia's vaccination program has prioritised older adults.
So why do people in this age group remain unvaccinated?
Most older Australians are vaccinated It's important to acknowledge that of the 5,632,555 Australians aged 60+, more than 4.4 million (79%) have had a first dose of a COVID-19 vaccine.
This ranges from 71% for 60 to 64-year-olds, to 86% for 75 to 79-year-olds.
So despite the criticism of Australia's vaccination program, more than three-quarters of Australians aged 60+ have at least partial protection from COVID-19.
Still, that leaves 1.2 million Australians aged 60+ yet to receive a first dose of any COVID vaccine, despite having been eligible for vaccination for several months.

What are they waiting for? For a variety of reasons, no vaccine ever achieves 100% take-up. But most Australians over 60 want to be vaccinated. Surveys have shown over 65s are the least hesitant age group. As of August 7, only 6.75% of adults over 65 were unwilling to be vaccinated.
Some people have experienced difficulty accessing the vaccine. In particular, we need to improve access in areas which are more vulnerable to COVID outbreaks.
But according to data from the Australian Bureau of Statistics published last month, around 25% of unvaccinated people over 70 are waiting for a different vaccine option.
We can read this to mean they're waiting for what they perceive to be a "better" vaccine - an mRNA vaccine from Pfizer or Moderna.
Sadly, with the NSW outbreak escalating, and the increasing frequency and likelihood of COVID outbreaks across Australia, some of these folks may die waiting.
AstraZeneca is a highly effective vaccine The vaccine for which all people aged 60+ in Australia are currently eligible is AstraZeneca.
While adequate supply of the Pfizer vaccine has been an ongoing issue and shipments of the Moderna vaccine are yet to commence, AstraZeneca is being produced in Australia and is widely available.
But not everyone is keen on it.
Read more: Australians under 60 will no longer receive the AstraZeneca vaccine. So what's changed?
Some of the lack of enthusiasm surrounding the AstraZeneca vaccine relates to the perception it is less effective than Pfizer.
The most important outcome, however, is prevention of serious illness from COVID-19, and both vaccines perform similarly well on this metric after two doses. Recent modelling from the Doherty Institute assumed an 86% reduction in hospitalisation with the Delta variant after two doses of AstraZeneca, compared to 87% after two doses of Pfizer.
For deaths from Delta, the difference is also very small. The AstraZeneca vaccine is believed to achieve a 90% reduction after two doses, compared to 92% with Pfizer.
Although milder COVID-19 infections occur more commonly in people who have been fully-vaccinated with AstraZeneca, "breakthrough" infections also occur with Pfizer.
So, the benefits of AstraZeneca are clear and the differences between AstraZeneca and Pfizer in terms of effectiveness against the most worrisome outcomes of COVID-19 are very small.
But what about the risks? Both vaccines have common side effects including pain at the injection site, fatigue and headache. While these side effects are more common with AstraZeneca, they don't last long with either vaccine.
So that brings us to blood clots. In March, just weeks into the launch of Australia's vaccination program, reports emerged of a rare clotting syndrome following use of the AstraZeneca vaccine.
Named thrombosis with thrombocytopenia syndrome (TTS) to describe the unusual combination of serious blood clots with a low platelet count, the discovery of this significant complication saw changes to COVID-19 vaccination guidelines in many countries, including Australia.
Deaths from TTS have received extensive coverage in the media, and concern about this condition is undoubtedly a key reason for reluctance towards AstraZeneca.
But importantly, the risk of TTS is small, and becomes lower as you get older (the opposite of the risk from COVID-19). The Australian Technical Advisory Group on Immunisation has estimated below age 60, the incidence of TTS is 2.7 per 100,000 doses. Over age 60 the incidence is thought to be 1.8 in every 100,000 doses.
Of 112 cases of confirmed or probable TTS that have occurred in Australia to date, a total of six people have died. One was over 60 (a 72-year-old woman).
Based on these statistics, if the 1.2 million Australians over 60 not yet vaccinated all received AstraZeneca, we would expect about 22 to develop TTS and one or two of them to die.
While these are serious albeit rare complications, remember that in NSW, in an outbreak with close to 10,000 cases of COVID-19 diagnosed to date, more than 50 people over 60 have already died and more will unfortunately follow.
Read more: Over 18 and considering AstraZeneca? This may help you decide
Balancing the risks and the benefits Balancing risks and benefits is key to informed decision-making before taking any medication; none are risk-free.
For those 1.2 million Australians over 60 yet to be vaccinated, the benefits of taking the vaccine available now - AstraZeneca - are high, and for most people will outweigh the small risks.
The threat of COVID-19 is no longer theoretical, especially for those living in Sydney and other major metropolitan cities.
And this year's jabs will not be the last over 60s receive. While it's very likely mRNA boosters (Pfizer and Moderna) will be offered in 2022, you'll need to be alive to get one.

Full text: Scott Morrison thinks he has picked the national mood with a forceful message about the path out of lockdown and towards normal life.
He is so sure, in fact, that he is staking everything on a pledge to voters that he can lead the way even when the country is posting record coronavirus case numbers.
But this is not just a big bet for the Prime Minister on the government's future and his own political fate, although it could decide his fate at the election.
It is a calculation about lives, also, and it means Morrison cannot win the argument with words alone. He will have to level with voters about the advice from medical experts that makes him so sure he is right.
Morrison's language yesterday was his simplest and strongest in a long time. "The task is not to delay, the task is not to fear, the task is to embrace, prepare, plan," he said.
If so, the task is also to plan with eyes wide open. The problem for Morrison is that he has an aversion to full disclosure.
In Parliament yesterday, he relied in part on new information he received over the weekend from the Doherty Institute, the government's trusted medical modellers. At one point he told question time he was quoting from a confidential document but in the next he said it was an oral briefing.
Labor leader Anthony Albanese smelled a rat and called for the information to be revealed. He was right. Australians need to know if lockdowns can be eased at 70 and 80 per cent vaccination rates without causing a wave of cases that overwhelm hospitals.
Morrison's office says the latest advice, which was contained in both an oral briefing from the Doherty Institute's Jodie McVernon and a letter from senior public servant Phil Gaetjens, could be released on Friday. The sooner the better.
But the argument over the letter is not the main issue. The Doherty Institute research does not tell political leaders what to do; it sets out scenarios about what might happen rather than recommending what should.
A lot has been made of the fact that its scenarios start with low case numbers. "We assume that a single outbreak involving 30 individuals initiates community transmission at the time of transition to Phase B once target vaccine coverage is achieved," it says. But the scenarios have case numbers rising to the thousands even with high vaccination.
The assumptions are key. One is that governments only apply "partial" testing, tracing, isolation and quarantine. Doherty does not say state leaders cannot go harder. As they no doubt would.
The ultimate call is for leaders, not modellers. Morrison has made his decision: things must change at 70 per cent. It is a safe bet he has polling and focus group research to tell him he is right.
Albanese is yet to make his call. He used Parliament yesterday to question the modelling. He positioned himself alongside Queensland Premier Annastacia Palaszczuk in casting doubt on the plan. Even so, Victorian Premier Daniel Andrews backed the plan.
Albanese runs the risk of standing for more lockdowns. Is that what Australians want? Morrison has decided they do not. Everything turns on that call.

Full text: Prime Minister Scott Morrison insists the country must start to reopen when it hits vaccination targets, declaring lockdowns and heavy restrictions are "not a sustainable way" to live.
But Mr Morrison has emphasised Australia won't have a UK-style "freedom day", when effectively all restrictions are removed at once.
His comments came as ACT Chief Minister Andrew Barr again called for the nationally agreed vaccination target to be expanded to include 12- to 15-year-olds.
The national plan to steer Australian out of the pandemic is in jeopardy, with states including Western Australia and Queensland threatening to chart their own paths even once targets are reached.
Under a reopening plan based on modelling from the Doherty Institute, and agreed to by the national cabinet, states and territories would ease some restrictions once they had vaccinated 70 per cent of people aged 16 and over, if the same coverage had also been achieved nationwide.
At 80 per cent, lockdowns would only be used in "highly targeted" situations, and Australia would start to reopen to the world.
Doubts over the safety of reopening the country at those rates have risen in recent weeks, as coronavirus outbreaks have worsened in Sydney, Melbourne and Canberra.
The Doherty Institute's modelling assumed there would be just 30 cases of community transmission at the time states moved to the second stage of the plan - far fewer than the numbers currently being registered across the east coast.
Mr Morrison said in question time that he had received advice over the weekend that the number of cases would not influence the "overall conclusions" of the model.
Labor asked Mr Morrison to table the advice, but was told it was confidential.
The Prime Minister had earlier used a press conference at Parliament House to heap more pressure on the states to hold true to the national roadmap out of the pandemic.
Mr Morrison said with high rates of vaccination, Australia should not fear the prospect of reopening the country and the inevitable rise in case numbers. Instead, it should prepare for and "embrace" the path out of the pandemic, he said.
"[Lockdown] is taking a heavy toll and so they must only continue for as long as they are absolutely necessary and not a day more," he told reporters.
"It is always darkest before the dawn, and I think these lockdowns are demonstration of that, but the dawn is not far away and we are working towards that dawn and we are hastening towards the dawn.
"We should not delay it, we should prepare for it. We should not fear it, we should embrace it and we should move forward together."
Mr Barr said the ACT had agreed to the national plan because it believed there needed to be a "pathway forward".
But the ACT has two points of difference, which Mr Barr reiterated again on Monday. He wants more children to be vaccinated, with the latest outbreaks - including in the ACT - highlighting the threat of the Delta strain to younger Australians.
He also wants the plan to take into consideration the fact that individuals aren't fully protected until two to three weeks after they receive their second dose.
Mr Barr said he was on a "unity ticket" with Mr Morrison about the importance of vaccination and his assurance Australia would not replicate a UK-style "freedom day" once its targets were met.
The ACT Chief Minister took a swipe at unnamed "senior politicians" and media outlets who he said had "glossed over" the details of the national roadmap, which makes clear restrictions - including lockdowns - would remain a possibility even once 80 per cent was hit.

PM insists he is right, so should reveal more

Full text: Scott Morrison thinks he has picked the national mood with a forceful message about the path out of lockdown and towards normal life.
He is so sure, in fact, that he is staking everything on a pledge to voters that he can lead the way even when the country is posting record coronavirus case numbers.
But this is not just a big bet for the Prime Minister on the government's future and his own political fate, although it could decide his fate at the election.
It is a calculation about lives, also, and it means Morrison cannot win the argument with words alone. He will have to level with voters about the advice from medical experts that makes him so sure he is right.
Morrison's language yesterday was his simplest and strongest in a long time.
"The task is not to delay, the task is not to fear, the task is to embrace, prepare, plan," he said.
If so, the task is also to plan with eyes wide open. The problem for Morrison is that he has an aversion to full disclosure.
In Parliament yesterday, he relied in part on new information he received over the weekend from the Doherty Institute, the government's trusted medical modellers. At one point he told question time he was quoting from a confidential document but in the next he said it was an oral briefing.
Labor leader Anthony Albanese smelled a rat and called for the information to be revealed. He was right. Australians need to know if lockdowns can be eased at 70 and 80 per cent vaccination rates without causing a wave of cases that overwhelm hospitals.
Morrison's office says the latest advice, which was contained in both an oral briefing from the Doherty Institute's Jodie McVernon and a letter from senior public servant Phil Gaetjens, could be released on Friday. The sooner the better.
But the argument over the letter is not the main issue. The Doherty Institute research does not tell political leaders what to do; it sets out scenarios about what might happen rather than recommending what should.
A lot has been made of the fact that its scenarios start with low case numbers.
"We assume that a single outbreak involving 30 individuals initiates community transmission at the time of transition to Phase B once target vaccine coverage is achieved," it says. But the scenarios have case numbers rising to the thousands even with high vaccination.
The assumptions are key. One is that governments only apply "partial" testing, tracing, isolation and quarantine. Doherty does not say state leaders cannot go harder. As they no doubt would.
The ultimate call is for leaders, not modellers.
Morrison has made his decision: things must change at 70 per cent. It is a safe bet he has polling and focus group research to tell him he is right.
Albanese is yet to make his call. He used Parliament yesterday to question the modelling. He positioned himself alongside Queensland Premier Annastacia Palaszczuk in casting doubt on the plan.
Even so, Victorian Premier Daniel Andrews backed the plan yesterday.
Albanese runs the risk of standing for more lockdowns. Is that what Australians want? Morrison has decided they do not. Everything turns on that call.

RMH cluster fears

Full text: HEALTH officials have increased protective measures for emergency department staff as officials brace for more Covid cases from one of Melbourne’s busiest hospitals.
PPE requirements in emergency departments have been increased to their highest level, with staff to wear N95 masks, gowns and eye protection while dealing with all patients in a bid to prevent them catching coronavirus.
Pre-operative testing — introduced during last year’s second wave but later revoked — will again reinstated for all but the most urgent surgical cases, and on-site staff numbers will be scaled back.
It comes after hundreds of medical staff at the Royal Melbourne Hospital are on forced leave after a Covid-infected Shepparton man had surgery at the hospital.
Victoria recorded 65 new cases on Sunday, with just 12 of those in isolation throughout their infectious period. Ten more mystery cases were reported with authorities “driving as hard as they can” to get on top of the crisis.
“We’re still in the realm of hauling this back,” Health Minister Martin Foley said.
Covid response deputy secretary Kate Matson said people were failing to get tested as soon as they experienced symptoms. “Our teams are working as hard as they possibly can to get on top of this. Victorians can work equally as hard by getting tested as soon as you’ve got a slight symptom,” Ms Matson said.
Victoria’s health network has been forced to re-implement pre-operative testing, with pressure mounting on the government to use rapid testing in all hospitals and high-risk settings.
It comes after the Shepparton man, treated as the source of the Royal Melbourne Hospital cluster – now at seven cases – was not tested before his surgery on August 12.
A family member who visited a patient in the same room as the man later tested positive to the virus, alerting the hospital to the outbreak.
Both Minister Foley and Ms Matson said there was “no evidence” Victoria’s health system had dropped the ball.
“At that point in time there wasn’t a known risk in Shepparton, so there was no reason to necessarily test that gentleman prior to his surgery,” Ms Matson said. “We are now working with our health system to reintroduce pre-operative testing given the community transmission.” Contact tracers are unsure as to whether the man is epidemiologically linked to the wider Shepparton outbreak, which has grown to 23 cases.
“We don’t have a source case for the Shepparton outbreak yet, we’re not sure how the outbreak started. It could well be a new incursion from New South Wales, it may be something else we don’t know yet,” Ms Matson added.
All 23 Shepparton cases are believed to be linked by family, but it forced at least 100 Goulburn Valley health staff into isolation through exposure site links.
A new infection from Mansfield, which has since been connected to Shepparton, was also detected on Sunday, and will be included in Monday’s case numbers.
Meanwhile, authorities are working with 120 businesses in a Sunshine West industrial zone with repeated positive wastewater detections.
There are now 27 Victorians in hospital with Covid, including a child aged under five. None are vaccinated, despite 18 being eligible.
As NSW reported a record 830 cases, Prime Minister Scott Morrison said on Sunday it was “highly unlikely” Australia would get to zero cases, and the focus would move from case numbers to serious illness once vaccine targets were hit.
“You can’t live with lockdowns forever and at some point, you need to make that gear change,” he said.
Chief medical officer Paul Kelly said Doherty Institute modelling, which underpinned Australia’s four-step plan to ease restrictions once vaccination levels hit 70 and then 80 per cent, was still relevant despite rising infections. mitchell.clarke@news.com.au

Full text: A business leader has thrown his support behind COVID-19 vaccination as a tool to allow more freedoms and ultimately live with the pandemic.
Port Macquarie Chamber of Commerce president Michael Mowle said vaccination was the most important element of the government's transition plan.
The roadmap, which charts the way back, takes into account the Doherty Institute COVID-19 modelling and Commonwealth Department of Treasury economic analysis.
The plan contains vaccination thresholds.
"It is in everybody's interests to get vaccinated and I think it's pretty logical that the way ahead is to get vaccinated," Mr Mowle said.
He urges businesses to hang in there and stick to the rules as the state remains in lockdown in an attempt to stop the spread of the Delta variant.
Milkbar Town Beach co-owner Anthony Lynch also wants people to get the COVID-19 vaccine jab.
Vaccination protected patrons, staff and the community, Mr Lynch said.
"We can't be going through lockdowns all the time - it's not practical and it's not good for the economy," he said.
The Town Beach business is providing takeaways and deliveries during the lockdown and is closing a little earlier.
The Pepperberry director and head chef John Konemann urged people to stay safe.
The Port Macquarie cafe is offering takeaway and home delivery as it adapts to the lockdown rules.
All hospitality venues must be closed to the public, including pubs, restaurants and cafes, except for takeaway.
Mr Konemann said everyone needed to be level-headed, follow the rules and use their common sense.
Pipeworks Cafe is gauging the business climate as it decides its next step during the lockdown.

Full text: The effectiveness of some vaccines is likely to drop below 50 per cent within a year of vaccination, a new study claims, and the Delta variant of COVID-19 is expected to speed up the time it takes protection to wane.
However, protection against serious illness and death is expected to remain solid for much longer, a paper by Australian experts says - although this estimate comes with a large dose of uncertainty.
The findings are central to an emerging argument over the role of vaccine boosters. Australia has bought millions of booster doses, even as the World Health Organisation urges a moratorium on them while people die in poorer nations that have yet to roll out first doses.
Deborah Cromer, a senior research fellow at the Kirby Institute in NSW and the paper's lead author, said people were hoping it would be a "one-stop shop". "But that's not what we do for flu, or for other respiratory viruses. I think it's not really unexpected," Dr Cromer said.
"Immunity is likely to wane over time but could then easily get reboosted, either with vaccination or natural infection. And it kind of depends on when you get boosted, whether or not you would see any symptomatic disease."
The paper, a collaboration between researchers across the Kirby, the Doherty Institute in Victoria, and the University of Sydney, uses data from clinical trials and lab studies done around the world to map out how antibody levels generated by the COVID-19 vaccines effectively block the new variants.
It was uploaded to medRxiv a website for preliminary reports, on Friday but has not yet been through rigorous peer review or published in an academic journal.
COVID-19 vaccines cause our immune system to produce a surge of new antibodies. Over time, those levels drop, and we become vulnerable to reinfection. Pfizer's vaccine falls from 91 per cent efficiency to 84 per cent over six months, for example. Data from a limited Israeli study is even more troubling: a drop in effectiveness from 95 per cent to 39 per cent between January and July. Pfizer is anticipating an annual shot will be required.
The emergence of variants that can evade some vaccine-generated antibodies, such as Delta, probably further shortens this timeline, the Australian paper argues. Initially, this vulnerability is likely to lead to only a mild illness.
"Our modelling in this paper would suggest protection against severe infection and hospitalisation will hold up better over time," said the University of Sydney's Professor James Triccas, a co-author.
But Professor Fiona Russell, a vaccine expert at the University of Melbourne, urged caution on the study's conclusions, which rely on a model of a drop-off in vaccine effectiveness in the place of hard data.
"Every vaccine we have, for everything, has waning antibody levels. That does not mean we're suddenly going to get an infection," she said. "Your antibodies are important, but so are other parts of your immune system."
Israel has rolled out a booster program, while Australia has bought 25 million Moderna doses in case it decides to do the same. High-income countries have administered almost 100 doses per 100 people; low-income nations 1.5 doses per 100 people. The result: in Indonesia, the pandemic's new centre, more than 100 children a week are dying from the virus, with just 10 per cent of the country fully vaccinated. That's led the World Health Organisation to call for a moratorium on boosters.

Nation locates 1 million new Pfizer doses

Full text: One million extra doses of the Pfizer vaccine were due to land in Australia last night and the first 530,000 shots will be made available to 20 to 39-year-olds in Sydney suburbs with the highest infection rates.
Prime Minister Scott Morrison said yesterday the additional doses, which come on top of the 40 million shots the federal government has promised to purchase, would be enough to vaccinate everyone in the 20-39 age bracket in Sydney's 12 highest risk local government areas.
The government purchased the doses from Poland with supply coming from the Pfizer plant in Belgium, which was approved by the Therapeutic Goods Association. The shots will be administered through the NSW Health system.
"There are more than a million doses of hope on their way. Earlier today, a plane left Dubai, having left Warsaw last night. We have been in discussions with the Polish government now for several weeks and we have secured an additional one million doses of Pfizer and they will start landing in Australia tonight," Mr Morrison said yesterday.
The 12 Sydney local governments targeted for the Pfizer doses are Bayside, Blacktown, Burwood, Campbelltown, Canterbury-Bankstown, Cumberland, Fairfield, Georges River, Liverpool, Parramatta, Strathfield and Penrith.
The decision to direct the vaccines to adults aged under 40, who tend to be mobile and active in the community, was based on advice from the chief medical officer Professor Paul Kelly on how to best grapple with NSW's outbreak.
"His advice is based on that Doherty modelling and other work they have done about how the transmissibility of the virus works on those most affected areas and can be addressed through these additional doses," Mr Morrison said.
Doherty Institute modelling shows that immunising younger people who tend to transmit the virus more - rather than older Australians who come into contact with fewer people - is a better strategy for the country to adopt.
The remaining doses will arrive in Australia this week and will be distributed among other states and territories, Mr Morrison said.
The allocations to the remaining states and territories is: Victoria 175,500, Queensland 136,890, South Australia 47,970, Western Australia 70,200, Tasmania 17,550, Northern Territory 8190, and the ACT 14,040.
He implored people to only leave their homes "when you absolutely have to".
"There's no need to be out for hours and hours and hours a day. I know the rules provide it. But please don't do it, stay home."
Victorian Premier Daniel Andrews said while the state was in the middle of a "concerning" outbreak, he would not "quibble" about NSW getting a bigger slice of those jabs which is their "way out of this".
Poland's Australian embassy said in a statement that Australia had been added to the list of "low and middle-income countries" with which Poland was sharing vaccines due to the recent outbreaks of the Delta strain of coronavirus. The doses were sold on a non-profit basis, according to the embassy.
Federal Health Minister Greg Hunt said rapid antigen testing will be trialled in 50 aged care facilities in Sydney.

Bosses flag return to work for the jabbed

Full text: The nation’s peak business advocacy groups have called on the NSW government to allow vaccinated people to return to work once immunisation targets reach at least 50 per cent, a move they say will preserve jobs and livelihoods being routed by lockdowns.
The hospitality industry is calling for outdoor dining with limited indoor services to be restored, while the state’s leading business lobby is advocating for an ­industry-by-industry relaxation approach that would ease in line with vaccination targets.
NSW recorded one death and 283 fresh cases of the virus in the 24 hours to 8pm on Sunday, of which 106 people were known to be active in the community during their infectious period. The isolation status of another 71 cases ­remains under investigation.
Officials began placing numerous regional areas into lockdown to keep ahead of exposure sites emerging in some locations. The Tamworth region, in the state’s northeast, was placed into a week-long lockdown after a Covid-­positive woman travelled to the area from Newcastle.
By late Monday afternoon, the NSW government also announced that the Byron Bay, Ballina, Lismore and the Richmond Valley local government areas, all in the state’s far north, would be placed in a similar lockdown ­because of a Covid-positive case identified in the region.
The man in his 50s, now in hospital, had travelled from Sydney to the area for reasons that remain under investigation; residents of metropolitan Sydney and other areas are forbidden to travel to the regions, although this is permitted in narrow circumstances.
With the lockdown of Greater Sydney due to expire on August 28, Premier Gladys Berejiklian on Monday appeared to firm in her conviction that easing restrictions would be possible for vaccinated individuals in some areas, suggesting the government was eager to implement these measures.
This has already happened in the construction sector, due to ­resume operations at 50 per cent capacity from Wednesday; workers from hotspot locations will be permitted to participate as long as they are fully or partially vaccinated, an edict that has angered some conservative Liberal MPs. They plan to oppose the move at a partyroom meeting on Tuesday where they will argue it is not the role of government or business to mandate workers receive vaccinations.
“Please think about the future,” Ms Berejiklian said. “If you work in an industry where you’d like to go back to serving customers … or you work in a workplace which is currently not open – please consider getting vaccinated.” Doherty Institute modelling provided to national cabinet last week set a target of 70 per cent coverage before restrictions could be eased in a comprehensive way. NSW is tracking towards six million inoculations by the end of the month, which would amount to roughly 50-60 per cent of the state.
Ms Berejiklian said NSW would respect the conclusions of the Doherty Institute report, but it was her belief that options for easing restrictions could tentatively occur much sooner. “That report obviously allows certain freedoms at 70 per cent vaccination, at 80 per cent vaccination … Please know that once we hit 50 to 60 (per cent of vaccination coverage), lockdown plus easing some restrictions is very different to what the Doherty report says must happen at 70 per cent,” she said.
Wes Lambert, chief executive of Restaurant and Catering Australian, said a further lockdown extension was probable, meaning flexibility for vaccinated workers and patrons would be welcomed. The sentiment was backed by Clubs NSW chief executive Josh Landis, who said the mental and fin­ancial wellbeing of 25,000 workers was a primary concern.

How sick must nation become before we are well again?

Full text: A business leader broached this very reality, but Scott Morrison branded it as “insensitive”. Yet, as Waterson asks of our political leaders, “How many fruitful young lives are you happy to waste to keep those Covid numbers low? How many small businesses are you ready to see disappear? How many suicides will you tolerate? How many bankruptcies? How many children should forgo their formative primary education and socialisation? How many deaths from other untreated illness are acceptable to you? How much sorrow are you willing to impose on your subjects? How many grief-stricken families must bury parents and children without ceremony, like backyard pets? How many tears will soften your stony, self-righteous hearts?”
By failing to lead the difficult discussions, a squeamish PM plus a deafening silence from his federal government colleagues is making our nation more sick.
Mandy Macmillan, Singleton, NSW
Steve Waterson makes the point that the recent modelling that the Doherty Institute has done is essentially limited to considering the direct health downside of Covid under various vaccination scenarios. However, the less direct consequences are not measured, nor the consequences of lockdowns. Surely citizens’ lives fractured, sickness induced by stress, businesses destroyed and so on are worth measuring? This can be balanced against saved lives.
It may be considered Orwellian to attempt to put an economic measure on human pain and suffering or relief from it. However, this is done regularly by the federal Department of Health in assessing the costs and benefits of taxpayers’ money being spent on new expensive drugs. If we are to have modelling, it should consider all major factors on both sides of the equation. The outcome will be approximate, but worth doing.
Mark Sibree, Canterbury, Vic
Another brilliant article by Steve Waterson articulating the thoughts, I hope, of most Australians. I am only guessing here, but I think many of the older Australians who died with Covid on top of their comorbidities would have been far happier to say goodbye to their loved ones, thank them and wish them good fortune rather than be cast aside as statistics for the likes of our premiers and health official to bleat on about at their fearful press conferences.
Tony Pearce, Wynnum, Qld
The virus is the guilty party here. Covid has become more infectious as it now spreads by aerosol mist so the 1.5m separation rule is not as effective. Covid also is spreading among vulnerable populations with poor language skills and a fear of authority.
You can lay the blame at the feet of the politicians if you wish, but the answer is right in front of us. Get vaccinated with AstraZeneca or Pfizer. These vaccines will save your life. Between now and Christmas we are in for a wild ride. Take care of your own health. It is your individual responsibility. Stop blaming everyone else and just get vaccinated.
Alan Woodward, South Melbourne, Vic
It is an employer’s responsibility to provide a safe workplace. Medical science proves that a Covid jab will make a safer one. Unions should be embracing the opportunity to get a free jab that delivers safety for their members, their families and the community.
Bruce Crowhurst, Burnside, SA
On reading Steve Waterson’s column, a quote from Voltaire sprang to mind: “Those who can make you believe absurdities can make you commit atrocities.” This is what we are slipping into. Hope, logic, reason, kindness, caring, all jettisoned for a cruel, mindless grab for power by the lustful few.
Ros Tooker, Bald Knob, Qld
If I wish to work in an industry that requires child safe practices I am required to obtain a Working with Children Check. Is it asking too much that in order to work in a job that requires contact with other humans (especially the elderly and the sick), food production, attendance at events, entry to services or air and other forms of travel that we are asked to produce a Vaccination Check to ensure safety?

DELTA A SWORD ABOVE OUR HEADS

Full text: HEALTH authorities have warned Victoria faces rising coronavirus case numbers today as it emerged last night that an extra 150,000 Pfizer doses were on their way after ­intervention by Prime Minister Scott Morrison.
The Saturday Herald Sun understands new positive cases will be in the double digits today, with contact tracers scrambling to get on top of the latest outbreak that has sparked a seven-day lockdown.
The state government holds serious concerns the virus may have already escaped the western suburbs, with the pandemic’s testing commander, Jeroen Weimar, warning the number of exposure sites will continue to rise.
“We did not go into lockdown because we were worried about a few cases in the western suburbs,” he said. “We are worried about a Delta penetration again here in Victoria.
“We’re worried that it might be seeding out quite widely; we’re worried it might be going to places we haven’t yet seen.” Victoria’s vaccine rollout will ramp up dramatically in coming days after the federal government decided to send the state an extra 150,000 Pfizer doses before the end of the month. This will see the state’s Pfizer vaccine jabs top half a million a month for the first time in August.
It follows a decision last month to release an extra 150,000 Pfizer doses to locked-down NSW from reserve supplies held by the Commonwealth. Victoria was scheduled to get about 400,000 doses this month but will now get an extra 150,000 starting from August 13. It was meant to get 550,000 Pfizer doses a month starting in September.
Mr Morrison communicated the offer to Premier Daniel Andrews on Friday evening. “I will always work closely with Dan Andrews and our Premiers to make sure Australians are protected in their time of need,” he said.
The state opposition called on the government to change its approach to lockdowns, to instead shut down hot spots rather than the entire state.
“The government needs to be a lot more targeted and a lot fairer to people living in areas where there’s no Covid,” opposition leader Michael O’Brien said. “This is too important. We can’t keep living like this.” The vaccine supply breakthrough comes as authorities were forced to admit “possible” unauthorised home visits had occurred and may have contributed to the virus spreading.
But the government stood by its stance that rulebreakers would not be fined or publicly shamed, despite anti-lockdown protesters being told they would face justice.
“We are not going to win this by turning on each other or by fining our way through,” Mr Weimar said.
Victoria recorded six new locally acquired cases on Friday, all linked to reported cases in the Hobsons Bay and Maribyrnong outbreaks but none were in quarantine throughout their infectious period.
Genomic sequencing confirmed both clusters carried the highly infectious Delta strain, but the initial source of transmission for both clusters remained a mystery.
Three new cases are linked to the Maribyrnong cluster, the other three – including two announced on Thursday – to Hobsons Bay.
A dedicated public health team, charged with responding to outbreaks in “sensitive settings”, is supporting the Warringa Park specialist school community after it was revealed one new case attended the Hoppers Crossing facility.
Another case, a man who lives with the Maribyrnong case, was a cleaner at Epworth Hospital in Richmond, but in the administration area and not on a general ward.
Mr Morrison also warned that bosses wanting to force their workers to get vaccinated would need to comply with federal discrimination legislation after national cabinet decided against setting hard-and-fast rules about who could be ordered to get the jab.
He said the question of what bosses were allowed to do would turn on the question of reasonableness, such as where employees were in “regular contact” with the public.
National cabinet has “fully agreed” to live with the virus once 70 per cent of the population is vaccinated, under the Doherty Institute’s modelling, which should mean lockdowns are limited to isolated occasions and abandoned when the country reaches 80 per cent.
Meanwhile, almost 100,000 struggling businesses will have cash payments automatically paid to them under a jointly funded $400m support package announced on Friday.
Another $2800 grant will be deposited to 90,000 businesses, while almost 9000 hospitality venues will receive another round of funding between $5000 and $20,000.
An extra $54m will be added to the small business Covid hardship fund, which provides grants of up to $8000 for small businesses not eligible in other schemes which have experienced a 70 per cent reduction in turnover. Islamic College of Melbourne principal Dr Abdul M. Kamareddine said last night health authorities were investigating a confirmed case of coronavirus that attended the Tarneit college in July.

Politicians have abdicated responsibility for this crisis

Full text: Leaders hide behind ‘health advice’ to ignore the pain their Covid response has caused Well, that was worth waiting for. Finally a tiny glimpse of the modelling that has underpinned government decision-making on our Covid response, and very convincing it is too. And quite astonishingly precise.
Let’s not go through the various conditional predictions of the virus’s impact, especially the “worst-case” scenario, which happily generates a number far short of “everybody dies”, which I would regard as the worst case.
Instead here’s what the Doherty Institute says could happen if we suffered a six-month uncontrolled outbreak with only 60 per cent of the population vaccinated: there would be 737,971 infections and 5294 deaths. Love the super-scientific accuracy: not 737,970 or 737,972 infections; why, that would just be sloppy guesswork.
I’m teasing, of course (it’s one of the few pleasures not yet forbidden in these joyless times), and have no doubt the statisticians are doing their very best with the data; so let’s assume they’re correct that almost three-quarters of a million would be infected, of whom 5000 would die.
Many of us in the anti-lockdown corner are asked how many lives we would sacrifice to see the country open up again, our accusers triumphantly certain there is no decent answer because, as the NSW Premier told us in May, “no death is acceptable”.
She and her interstate counterparts would rather smash our lives and livelihoods in pursuit of their ridiculous, hubristic ambition.
If a foreign power were causing damage on this scale we would regard it as an act of war, when deaths in defence of the country would become acceptable again.
Perhaps we should bite the bullet and say 5000 predominantly old people taken prematurely is a sad but tolerable price to pay for the restoration of our freedoms and the repair of our society – as long as it’s not my precious grandparents. Oh wait, mine have already died of old age, like all my ancestors since humans first wandered out of the African Rift Valley. It happens a lot, I understand.
The Prime Minister’s proud boast is that our closed borders and hyper vigilance have “saved 30,000 lives” since the start of the epidemic last year. More unverifiable modelling; but again, let’s assume he’s right. I wonder how many of the saved have succumbed to other ailments in that time; or will next week’s census reveal a Cocoon-like bubble of healthy nonagenarians, 30,000 strong, laughing at Covid and death in all its other guises?
At best, we’ve dragged their lives out for a few more lonely months sequestered from their families, just as we’ve kicked the whole pandemic a little way down the road, at an almost inconceivable cost. As our leaders and their worker bees finesse their incarceration strategy, in the background the cries of misery grow louder.
The politicians look on, stern-faced and witless, bleating their platitudes about feeling our pain, and urging us to get vaccinated as the only way to escape the shackles on our lives, as though they had nothing to do with the sinister emergency powers they have granted themselves and aimed against us. “A surge in cases has closed restaurants”; “the latest outbreak means tradesmen can’t go to work”; “thanks to some selfish cab driver we must stay at home for the next month”.
No, ladies and gentlemen, the virus hasn’t done this to us; you have, cosy in your luxurious offices with your index-linked financial cushions, surrounded by sycophants and shoving people around like demented puppetmasters.
It may come as a shock to those snorting and gobbling at the trough of public money, but not everyone makes their living by opening a spreadsheet on a laptop, reaching out to a stakeholder and unmuting themselves on a Zoom call.
There are people who pay taxes (rather than recycle them) by travelling every day to places where they make actual things with their hands, who build home offices rather than work from them.
Some then have the audacity to consider their manual or menial work essential, as though they are under some obligation to put food on the table for their families.
And these ungrateful wretches, instead of praising the wisdom of their superiors who imprison them in their unfashionable suburbs, have the nerve to march in the streets in complaint, thousands of people engaged in reckless superspreader events that have led to a massive zero new infections.
“How sharper than a serpent’s tooth it is to have a thankless child!” wails Shakespeare’s King Lear. Echoing him, our politicians and bureaucrats, parents to their infantilised population, are “disgusted” (NSW Premier Gladys Berejiklian) with these “filthy” (NSW Deputy Police Commissioner Gary Worboys) “boofheads” (NSW Police Minister David Elliot), “wankers” (NT Chief Minister Michael Gunner) and “hooligans, dropkicks” (WA Premier Mark McGowan). Treasure the eloquent, statesmanlike rhetoric of these latter-day Ciceros; that’s the way to bring the people along with you in difficult times. Instead they govern by regulations that grow daily more ridiculous. Sit down to drink, but stand up near a park bench; exercise, but don’t rest; go shopping but don’t browse, even though the sadists at Coles have moved everything you wanted into different aisles; under no circumstances talk to anyone you know, despite the masks that afford magic protection from nanometre Covid dust; the list is a never-ending carousel of hilarity.
The latest inanity from the future governor of Queensland (remember her, the one who did more than anyone else to dissuade people from receiving the AstraZeneca vaccine?) is to warn against online shopping.
“Do you need those people out in the community delivering packages and things?” she asks. No, your excellency, of course not, let them park their vans and bikes and get a well-paid, non-executive board position like your pals do.
What begins as absurdity soon turns dark. In NSW you must carry evidence of your address at all times when outside your home, and produce it to a police officer – “Papers please!” – on demand. You must carry a mask on your person, even to walk the dog around the block. Cold War Berlin-style police checkpoints have appeared on our streets to confirm cars are within 10km of their homes, and their occupants not intending to protest against their rulers. The army is on patrol in areas whose citizens are often refugees from regimes where camouflage battle-dress is rarely a welcome sight.
Do Western concepts of freedom no longer matter in Australia? Is it a trivial matter that we are commanded not to leave our homes? Does it seriously not bother anyone in office that we are being compared – accurately – to North Korea in our legislated refusal to allow our citizens to leave the country, or overseas Australians to return? This is very bad company we find ourselves in.
The politicians say they’re faced with tough decisions, but they’re not making decisions at all. They defend their abdication of responsibility by loftily declaring they are acting on the health advice they receive. They don’t evaluate that advice, mind, they simply follow it.
And it leads always to the same destination: lockdown. It’s “horrible”, Berejiklian said this week, “but we know we have no option”. In Victoria, Premier Daniel Andrews parrots her: “There are no alternatives to lockdown”, he said on Thursday. Unless of course you don’t order a lockdown, which I think does qualify as an option, and a much more appealing one.
Lockdowns certainly work in the crudest sense, in that by isolating people you limit viral transmission, but that’s not the point.
It’s the cost-benefit analysis that’s missing, absent from the moment our governments panicked and abandoned our sensible national pandemic plan to follow the brutes of Communist China into a policy of dystopian oppression, to “keep us safe”.
Let’s turn the acceptable casualty question around and direct it to our leaders: how many fruitful young lives are you happy to waste to keep those Covid numbers low?
How many small businesses are you ready to see disappear? How many suicides will you tolerate? How many bankruptcies? How many children should forgo their formative primary education and socialisation? How many deaths from other untreated illness are acceptable to you?
How much sorrow are you willing to impose on your subjects? How many grief-stricken families must bury parents and children without ceremony, like backyard pets? How many tears will soften your stony, self-righteous hearts?
Whether born of stupidity or callousness, the effect of our current aimless course is the same. State against state, city against country, suburb against suburb, office worker against tradesman, old against young, vaccinated against unvaccinated: it is a heartless, divisive and dehumanising policy. And worse, it doesn’t work.
The very people we elect to safeguard our freedoms are shredding them, causing fractures in society that may never be healed. Surely there are politicians in every party who are silently appalled by this mounting despair and devastation. If their leaders cannot find a path out of this madness, perhaps those others should speak up and think about taking the reins, before the electorate’s frustration turns to fury.

Full text: ALMOST 2000 Australians would die in the first six months after Australia reached 70 per cent vaccination if a national outbreak of Covid-19 went unchecked.
This worst-case scenario would only occur if the country’s health systems were overwhelmed and there were no interventions to slow the spread.
Researchers found Australians aged under 40 were Covid-19 “superspreaders” who take the virus home to their children and elderly ­parents.
Outbreaks are likely to be better contained if younger people were vaccinated sooner.
“As supply allows, extending eligibility to all adults (16+) offers the greatest potential to slow down transmission,’’ the report said.
Doherty Institute Professor Jodie McVernon (inset) said immunising younger people should be a priority.
“This is a strategy that basically follows where we are right now but brings forward immunisation of the 30-39 group to the beginning of September and 16-29 to early in October,’’ she said.
The models also found a vaccination rate of between 50 and 60 per cent would not be enough to prevent “strict” lockdowns in the event of a major outbreak where the number of cases was hampering contact tracing and testing.
This is despite NSW Premier Gladys Berejiklian arguing that 50 per cent vaccination rate would be enough for the state to consider easing the current lockdown.
But Prime Minister Scott Morrison said the vaccination modelling was not to “break out of an existing lockdown”. Treasurer Josh Frydenberg also revealed Treasury had found “short, sharp” lockdowns are now the preferred option when dealing with the Delta variant to protect the economy.

Labor calls for $300 payments for vaccinated Aussies

Full text: Labor has demanded a one-off $300 payment for any Australian fully-vaccinated before December.
Prime Minister Scott Morrison on Friday revealed new details of Australia's path out of COVID-19 restrictions, relying on a high vaccination uptake in each state and territory.
COVID-19 Taskforce Commander Lieutenant-General John Frewen was optimistic about Australians being offered vaccinations by the end of the year.

And in a bid to encourage Australians to come forward, Labor has called for $300 to be sent to any Australian to have received their second dose by December 1.
"The government has failed on its two jobs this year, the rollout of the vaccine and fixing quarantine. It needs to use every measure at its disposal to protect Australians and our economy," he said.
The money would be back-paid to Australians who had already received the vaccine.
However, the government has already rejected the proposal.
Finance Minister Simon Birmingham described the announcement as insulting to millions of Australians who had already received a shot.
"The evidence says that it's unnecessary and unlikely to work," he told the ABC on Tuesday.
Labor claimed the cash payments would provide a $6 billion boost to an economy crippled by NSW's extended lockdown.
The party's treasury spokesman Jim Chalmers on Monday lashed the Mr Morrison's claim Australia would be in a "goal medal race" to get vaccinated.
"Let's be brutal about it: we're at the arse-end of the medal tally when it comes to vaccinations," he told ABC Drive.
The federal government on Friday revealed a 70 per cent full-vaccination rate among eligible Australians would be required to enter Phase B of its four-step reopening plan.
In a sign the government was mulling incentives to get vaccinated, an outline of the plan revealed Phase B may include moves "encouraging uptake through incentives and other measures".
The next phase, which will see lockdowns almost entirely eradicated, will be triggered once an 80 per cent threshold is reached.
Health Minister Greg Hunt said on Monday modelling from the Doherty Institute, on which the reopening plan was based, will be revealed "in the coming days".
"Our goal here is to ensure everybody who seeks to be vaccinated is vaccinated this year. The number is unlimited," he said.
The Grattan Institute on Friday suggested a $10m-a-week lottery with an entry for each dose, as well as vaccine passports for domestic flights and attend large events.
Australia's vaccine rollout was significantly dented after ATAGI recommended against AstraZeneca being administered to people aged under 60 over extremely rare blood clotting.
But as NSW's crisis deepened, Prime Minister Scott Morrison has stressed the jab was available to all adults after consultation with a GP.
"People take risks driving their car every year, and that's greater than what we're talking about with this vaccine, or any vaccine for that matter," he told 4BC Radio on Monday.
"All vaccines, any medicines have these very mild and small risks ... You can give your informed consent."
Health Department data showed 13,391 AstraZeneca doses had been administered to people aged 16-50 across the ACT.

Hunt supports rapid testing

Full text: AUSTRALIANS may soon be able to have on-the-spot Covid-19 checks at pharmacies or even at home as the federal government backs the expanded use of rapid antigen testing.
Federal Health Minister Greg Hunt said he was “very supportive” of the technology and wanted it to be used more widely, including ultimately for self-diagnosis.
It comes as Australia’s expert immunisation panel has cleared the way for about 220,000 children aged 12-15 to receive the Pfizer Covid-19 vaccine from next Monday.
The vaccine will initially be available to children in that age group who have specific medical conditions — such as asthma, diabetes and obesity — or live in a remote community or identify as Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander.
Mr Hunt said the nation’s immunisation experts were likely to approve the Pfizer vaccine for all children over 12, possibly by the end of the month, once they received further data from overseas.
At least 18 rapid antigen tests are currently approved for use in Australia and can deliver results within about 15 minutes. The Therapeutic Goods Administration said a PCR test involving throat or nasal swabs remained the “gold-standard” because rapid antigen tests were typically less accurate, particularly for asymptomatic patients.
Scott Morrison will on Tuesday release modelling from the Doherty Institute and Treasury which informed the national cabinet decision last week to set vaccination targets of 70 per cent and 80 per cent to reopen Australia and reduce the reliance on lockdowns.
A lockdown in southeast Queensland has been extended to Sunday, as authorities scramble to contain a new Delta outbreak that has widened with 13 new cases, including 10 children. The death toll from Sydney’s outbreak reached 15 as a cluster at an aged-care home grew to 20 cases after a “superspreading event” at a “Christmas in July” party.

Full text: Health Minister Greg Hunt has warned Australians "do not wait" for the Pfizer jab to be vaccinated, as data shows just 1 per cent of people who have caught COVID-19 in Sydney's Delta outbreak were fully vaccinated.
His warning came a day after the federal and state governments reached an in-principle agreement on a road map out of the pandemic.
They agreed 70 per cent of the adult population must be vaccinated before they begin easing restrictions for people who have had the jab and cautiously reopening borders. Once 80 per cent of Australian adults are vaccinated, wide-scale lockdowns would be all but abolished.
South-east Queensland entered a three-day lockdown yesterday after seven new community cases were recorded, throwing NRL and AFL games into disarray. Sydney recorded 201 new cases, including 138 people under the age of 40 - who were only recently approved to receive the AstraZeneca vaccine and cannot get Pfizer yet.
The role that vaccines will play in propelling Australia out of the pandemic is underscored by data from the federal Health Department that shows just 1 per cent of the 2702 people who have caught COVID-19 in Sydney's Delta outbreak were fully vaccinated. Of those 15 people, none have been hospitalised, treated in intensive care or died.
Just 5 per cent of cases, or 141 people, caught COVID after having one jab, with the partially vaccinated accounting for 6 per cent of hospital cases, 4 per cent of ICU cases and 8 per cent of deaths.
Mr Hunt said the data showed that the AstraZeneca vaccine - which is widely available but which some Australians have resisted taking because of changing health advice about the risk of blood clots that can lead to death - is equally effective as Pfizer against the virus. "Either vaccine can protect your life or protect the life of your loved ones."
He said the data highlighted just how effective vaccines were at saving lives, reducing symptomatic infections and transmission.
"It is a reality check for those people who have been dangerously and irresponsibly attacking the effectiveness of vaccines," he said.
"This is a significant sample of over 2700 cases and it is the strongest Australian demonstration yet of the absolutely life-saving role of vaccination. Our message is do not wait [for Pfizer]. Sadly unvaccinated people have lost their lives in the current outbreak; people who have been vaccinated with AstraZeneca have had their lives saved."
Yesterday, Australia passed 40 per cent of the population aged over 16 having had at least one jab; nearly 19 per cent of the population has had both.
Prime Minister Scott Morrison said yesterday that unless Australia reached the 70 per cent vaccination target, "the virus wins and lockdowns are absolutely necessary". But he was optimistic that Australia could reach the 70 and then 80 per cent targets to open up.
"I wish the number was 50 [per cent vaccinated]. I wish the number was less, but it's not. And I can't tell people that it's a different number. Seventy [per cent vaccinated], based on the science, we know gives us more than a fighting chance to ensure we stay ahead of it. And then when you get to 80 [per cent vaccinated] ... I'm more optimistic."
At a lengthy national cabinet meeting on Friday, according to a source familiar with proceedings, a significant portion of the discussion focused on when vaccination of children, who at this stage are not part of the rollout, should begin. The view was that providing COVID vaccinations at schools, before the school year ends, would be the most practical approach.
Epidemiologists and health experts cautiously welcomed the COVID road map, but said Australia needs to reach higher vaccination rates to achieve herd immunity than the targets set.
In The Sun-Herald, Melbourne University epidemiologist Tony Blakely says 90 per cent vaccine coverage - including children - is needed. He says the deal is "pretty good" in that it sets targets Australia can aspire to, with carrots such as freedom from lockdowns when hit.
Grattan Institute's Health program director Stephen Duckett said a vaccination target of 70 per cent before entering phase two was actually only 56 per cent of the population because under 16s were excluded and that was too low:
"The targets they have set are too low even if they are assuming that the virus is not very transmissible."
Last week, the institute published modelling that showed 80 per cent of the entire population needed to be vaccinated before major easing of restrictions.

Full text: Federal Health Minister Greg Hunt has warned Australians to "not wait" for the Pfizer jab as new data shows just 1 per cent of people who caught COVID-19 in recent Delta outbreaks were fully vaccinated.
Victoria hit 1 million people fully vaccinated yesterday and the state government changed its advice on the interval between Pfizer doses from three weeks to six, freeing up ten of thousands more doses in the coming weeks.
Victoria yesterday recorded two new local cases, while Sydney had 201 new cases, including 138 people under 40.
Parts of south-east Queensland went into a snap three-day lockdown after six local COVID-19 cases were reported.
Eleven local government areas were declared a red zone by Victoria's Chief Health Officer Brett Sutton. Victorians returning from those zones must get tested and quarantine for 14 days.
The critical role that vaccines will play in propelling Australia out of the pandemic is underscored by new data from the federal Health Department that shows just 1 per cent of the 2702 people who have caught COVID-19 in Sydney's Delta outbreak were fully vaccinated. Of the 15 people who were vaccinated but still caught COVID-19, none have been hospitalised or died.
Just 5 per cent of cases, or 141 people, caught COVID-19 after having one jab, with the partially vaccinated accounting for 6 per cent of hospital cases, 4 per cent of ICU cases and 8 per cent of deaths.
Mr Hunt said the data showed that the AstraZeneca vaccine - which is widely available but which some Australians have resisted taking because of changing health advice about the extremely low risk of blood clots - is equally effective as Pfizer. "Either vaccine can protect your life or protect the life of your loved ones," he said.
"It is a reality check for those people who have been dangerously and irresponsibly attacking the effectiveness of vaccines. This is a significant sample of over 2700 cases and it is the strongest Australian demonstration yet of the absolutely life-saving role of vaccination. Our message is do not wait [for Pfizer].
"Sadly, unvaccinated people have lost their lives in the current outbreak; people who have been vaccinated with AstraZeneca have had their lives saved."
Australia yesterday passed 40 per cent of the population aged over 16 having had at least one jab, while nearly 19 per cent of the population has had both.
Mr Hunt's warning came a day after the federal and state governments reached an in-principle agreement on a road map out of the pandemic.
They agreed 70 per cent of the adult population must be vaccinated before they begin easing restrictions for people who have had the jab and re-opening borders. Once 80 per cent of adults are vaccinated, wide-scale lockdowns would be all but abolished.
Prime Minister Scott Morrison warned yesterday that unless Australia reached the 70 per cent vaccination target, "the virus wins and lockdowns are absolutely necessary". But he was optimistic that Australia could reach the 70 per cent and then 80 per cent targets to open up.
"I wish the number was 50 [per cent vaccinated]. I wish the number was less, but it's not. And I can't tell people that it's a different number. Seventy [per cent vaccinated], based on the science, we know gives us that more than a fighting chance to ensure we stay ahead of it. And then when you get to 80 [per cent vaccinated] ... I'm more optimistic."
At the lengthy national cabinet meeting on Friday, according to a source familiar with the proceedings who asked not to be named, a significant portion of the discussion focused on when vaccination of children should begin. The view was that providing COVID-19 vaccinations at schools, before the school year ends, would be the most practical approach.
Health experts cautiously welcomed the road map, while warning that Australia would need to reach higher vaccination rates to achieve herd immunity than the targets set.
Melbourne University epidemiologist Tony Blakely, writing for The Sunday Age, said that 90 per cent vaccine coverage - including children - would be needed.
Grattan Institute's Health program director Stephen Duckett said a vaccination target of 70 per cent before entering phase two was actually only about 56 per cent of the population because under-16s were excluded and that was too low.
"It's a very risky strategy, the targets they have set are too low even if they are assuming that the virus is not very transmissible."
Grattan Institute modelling shows 80 per cent of the population would need to be vaccinated before restrictions could ease significantly.

Full text: Health experts and epidemiologists say the 70 per cent vaccination target for adult Australians is too low to achieve herd immunity, though they have welcomed national cabinet striking a deal to plot a course out of the pandemic.
After a marathon national cabinet meeting on Friday, Prime Minister Scott Morrison announced that agreement had been reached on a 70 per cent vaccination target to move Australia to phase two of the national plan out of the COVID-19 pandemic.
In Phase 2, vaccinated Australians would not be subject to some restrictions and international arrivals will begin to rise.
Phase 3 would be reached when 80 per cent of the adult population is fully vaccinated. Lockdowns of whole cities would not be used and vaccinated people could leave the country.
But Grattan Institute Health program director Stephen Duckett said the 70 per cent of adults figure was actually about 56 per cent of the entire population and "it's a very risky strategy".
"The targets they have set are too low, even if they are assuming that the virus is not very transmissible," he said.
"Part of the issue is they [the federal government] have never met any of the previous targets they have established. So they are setting very low goals so they can achieve them."
Professor Duckett said five to six million extra people - including the huge cohort of people under the age of 16 - also needed to be vaccinated for Australia to open up safely.
Last week, the Grattan Institute released modelling that showed 80 per cent of the entire population needed to be vaccinated before restrictions could be eased significantly.
Nancy Baxter, an epidemiologist and head of Melbourne University's School of Population and Global Health, welcomed the fact that governments had set targets for vaccination because "it's important to give people something to aim for".
"When we are at 70 per cent of those 16 and over things will definitely be better. Every percentage of people vaccinated accrues a benefit. But there is not a lot of specificity in the plan and there is a long time between now and then," Professor Baxter said.
"I don't think these are ambitious goals. We have to think about how to get every one we can vaccinated. There will also need to be a willingness to adapt from government as the variant we are dealing with then might be different to now."
Melbourne University epidemiologist Tony Blakely, writing for The Sun-Herald, said 90 per cent vaccine coverage - including children - would be needed for herd immunity.
He described the plan as "actually pretty good" because "in setting a target of 70 per cent to move into Phase B (transition phase), then 80 per cent coverage to move into Phase C (consolidation), it both provides targets we can aspire to with collective carrots when we get there, and clearly explains the role of non-vaccine measures during these transitions".
"The plan also lays down a framework for more rewards to those who are fully vaccinated. For example, first access to free travel from and returning to Australia."

Full text: Under-40s drive massive vaccine delivery result YOUNGER Sydneysiders are answering Australia’s call to arms and getting the AstraZeneca vaccine in record numbers, with more than 12,000 under-40s in NSW receiving the jab this week in the four days from Sunday to Wednesday alone.
According to figures seen by this newspaper the momentum is increasing, with 4839 of those jabs being administered just on Wednesday, the same day the nation recorded a ­record 201,470 vaccine doses delivered.
If the trends continue, it will mean that more than 20 per cent of the state’s daily jabs will have gone to under-40s heeding the calls by Prime Minister Scott Morrison and Premier Gladys Berejiklian to seek health advice from their GP and get vaccinated.
The news comes as worrying new data revealed that Sydney’s second Covid wave is mainly hitting younger ­people. Sixty-five per cent of cases recorded in the past week were in people under 40.
“We have to also remember that the communities of southwestern and western Sydney are also particularly young,” Chief Health Officer Kerry Chant said. Young people are being hospitalised with Covid-19, including two teenagers currently in intensive care, as well as eight ICU patients in their 20s, and four in their 30s.
The age group with the most infections in the past week were 30 to 39-year-olds – representing 227 cases. Experts say the numbers show that younger Australians are keen to do what they can to protect themselves and help get the country out of the ­pandemic.
Edgecliff resident Adelaide Bracey, 26, has booked in to get her first jab because she “just wants to do the right thing”. “I want Australia to open up again and I want to protect my family and my friends,” she said.
Professor Lyndal Trevena of the School of Public Health at the University of Sydney applauded the positive approach by younger jab recipients.
“Until recently there was some pent-up demand because younger people weren’t eligible, but we have also hit that tipping point where the risks of the disease are seen to outweigh the very small risks of the vaccine.” Provocate managing director Troy Bilsborough said the news about the uptake was positive as the NSW lockdown proved Australia’s economy – and the Morrison Government’s political fortunes – could not afford for people to wait for Pfizer later in the year.
The news comes as national cabinet prepares to meet on Friday to discuss modelling to guide the nation’s reopening plan, which will be based on hitting as-yet undetermined vaccination thresholds.
Writing in The Daily Telegraph today Lieutenant-General John Frewen, co-ordina­tor general of the govern­ment’s Operation Covid Shield, said “the momentum is building” behind the vaccine program. OPINION PAGE 64

The vaccination rate needed to end lockdowns

Full text: Australia has been warned 80 per cent of all 25.7 million residents being fully-vaccinated is the "only way" to see life return to normal.
The Grattan Institute has demanded national cabinet make lockdowns and border closures a thing of the past by pledging to hit the "ambitious target" by March.
Australians had supported a hardline approach which had averted disaster but, after months punctured by state lockdowns, were increasingly "tired and frustrated" with disruptions to their lives, it warned.
"Australians shouldn't and won't accept high death tolls or indefinite restrictions. Achieving very high vaccination coverage is the only way to avoid these outcomes," its report read.
"We cannot abandon our zero-Covid strategy too early and risk the calamity we have so far avoided.
"But on the other hand, we cannot remain walled inside Fortress Australia indefinitely, cut off from the rest of the world and periodically cut off from one another."

"We can vaccinate enough Australians to tame Covid ... [Our targets] will give us the best chance of gradually returning to normal life," it said.
Australia's sluggish rollout has been hampered by supply issues, and a damaging fallout from revelations over AstraZeneca's links to extremely rare blood clotting.
Prime Minister Scott Morrison revealed the Doherty Institute, tasked with providing a vaccination target needed to reopen, had provided its modelling to the federal government.
State and territory leaders will begin discussions on Australia's reopening timeline at national cabinet on Friday.
Grattan said an 80 per cent target was achievable by March, and could even be reached by the end of the year if vaccines were approved for children under 12.
But that would require a drastic increase in full-vaccination rates among the most vulnerable, including over 70s. Just 36.6 per cent of over 70s had received two doses by Sunday, a figure that would need to hit 95 per cent.
To do that, Grattan has called for vaccines to be administered in workplaces, schools, and pop-up clinics.
A number of measures to incentivise uptake were also touted, including a national vaccine lottery and vaccine passports being required for certain activities.
Aged care workers will be required to receive the jab by September, and Grattan said mandating vaccination in other "high-priority" workforces may also be needed.

Full text: MIDDLE-AGED Victorians are leading the charge to get jabbed to protect themselves against Covid-19.
The state has the highest percentage of people aged from 40-59 years that have received a Covid-19 vaccine out of all Australian states.
The new data, released on Wednesday, comes as Scott Morrison said Christmas would look very different to what Aussies were experiencing now.
More than 11.5 million Covid-19 doses have been administered nationwide, with two-thirds of Victorians over 50 having had one dose.
Vaccine figures show one in two Victorians aged 50-59 have had at least one shot.
This is higher than New South Wales and Queensland, which are both yet to get half of that cohort immunised.
Almost 50 per cent of those aged 40-49 in Victoria have done their bit for the community, compared with one in three in NSW.
National cabinet will on Friday discuss modelling from the Doherty Institute that leaders will use to set targets for vaccination and easing of restrictions.
“I would expect by Christmas that we would be seeing a very different Australia to what we are seeing now,” the Prime Minister said.
“What we want to do is make sure we set these targets right. “Then all of Australia, like our Olympians, we go for gold on getting those vaccination rates where we need to go.” Mr Morrison said Australia now had the supplies, the distribution, pharmacists, GPs, and vaccination clinics in place to give a jab to everyone who wants one by the end of the year. “We make a gold-medal run all the way to the end of this year, and the sooner we get there, the sooner we get there,” he said.

Just 40pc in Sydney are staying at home

Full text: Modelling by scientists at the University of Sydney has estimated that only 40 per cent of people in Sydney are staying home, and predicts it is unlikely that NSW will be able to reduce case numbers of the Delta variant at current lockdown settings.
Covid-19 modeller at the university Mikhail Prokopenko says Sydney’s current level of social distancing is inadequate for outbreak control.
Professor Prokopenko said that to see a drop in case numbers in one month, Sydney residents must reduce their interactions including shopping to one tenth of normal activity.
Professor Prokopenko said that when he ran his modelling, he was shocked at the level of non-compliance. Modelling by the Burnet Institute found that under current restrictions in NSW it would take at least two months for daily cases to fall below 40 and many more months for cases to reduce to zero.

Bite the bullet and lockdown hard

Full text: It would be a disaster to shrug our shoulders and say let's live with the virus now that Delta is spreading.
Health Minister Brad Hazzard quickly saw off suggestions yesterday that the NSW lockdown as it is being implemented might have to extend many months, telling journalists at the government's regular briefing that he would rely on the expertise and on-the-ground information being supplied by his NSW Health advisers to determine the state's next steps.
He is right to listen to his people. And I understand his frustration with the free advice he's been offered from all quarters in the past 18 months. But as someone who has been deeply engaged in modelling how COVID responds to policy options, including for the Victorian government, I feel compelled to lay out the three options before NSW and express my concerns with the state's "soft lockdown" model.
First, NSW can shrug its shoulders and say, "the virus is here now. Let's just live with it and get out of lockdown". This would be a disaster. Even with masking and contact tracing taking the edge off the virus's spread (and reducing the Delta variant's reproductive rate from five to, say, two), lifting the NSW lockdown would result in large mortality, health service disruption, and the (desperate) need to go back into lock down. Option 1 is not an option.
Second, NSW can continue as it is now, with a soft lockdown. Augmented "a la NSW", with requests that community members self-assess: self-assess if you are an essential worker, and either go to work or not; try and limit mobility and contacts, but without strict rules on mobility such as a 5 kilometre radius.
People are encouraged to get tested if at all symptomatic, or every three days if an essential worker (there will not be enough testing capacity for
this Sydneywide).
Credit where credit is due, yesterday some perimeters were placed around the suburb of Fairfield, requiring that any essential workers having to move in and out of Fairfield have proven testing at least every three days (for which there will be enough capacity).
But it is hard to know whether this NSW approach accompanied by strong contact tracing will work, as it has not been tried before. (The zonal lockdown in Melbourne last year was not accompanied by strong contact tracing, and the northern beaches had a well-defined geographic boundary.)
In the context of the highly infectious Delta virus that can and will spread among asymptomatic people (even among the most compliant who are tested every three days), it is hard to believe that it will work - and if it works, it
will probably take a long time.
There is a real risk of whack-a-mole. Fairfield today, then the virus seeds somewhere else and another suburb takes off next week, then another one - unless a citywide hard lockdown is imposed to shut down the virus in any new niche it finds. There is the prospect of a very drawn out "soft-lockdown" with numbers bouncing around until vaccine coverage is high enough to tip the balance - perhaps by October when more vaccine becomes available. This is not appealing to anyone, citizens or businesses.
For a "soft lockdown a la NSW" to turn the curve, NSW citizens would need to be highly compliant and able to navigate the self-assessments effectively. And even if it turns the curve, it is hard to believe it will achieve an effective reproductive rate substantially less than 1.0 - meaning it will take a long time to get cases down to less than five a day NSW wide.
The third, tried and true, approach is that Sydney rolls up its sleeves, and gets the job done as quickly as possible with a (really) hard lock down. The term "essential" needs to be defined properly with only truly essential services open.
Option 2 is experimental (it may work, but I fear not) and could lead to months of soft lock down until increasing vaccination coverage tips the balance. Option 3 looks like three weeks of tough lock down, then perhaps normal living conditions for the rest of the year. And will cost less in societal and GDP terms than grumbling along in soft lockdown.
What does a really hard lock down look like? Arguably, New Zealand over did it last year for a virus with a reproductive rate of 2.5 (remember the good old early days of this pandemic), but now it is just the ticket. It means that essential actually means essential services only are open.
Getting takeaways, be it food or coffee, is not essential. Keeping construction sites open is not essential. Everything that can be done to reduce mobility and the opportunity for the virus to (fleetingly) jump from one citizen to the next has to be done. Every extra bit of effort matters.
Finally, economic support from the NSW and federal government to all the workers and businesses that need it would be a core part of any effective hard lockdown policy.

Vaccine's roadmap aimed at restoring trust

Full text: FIVE days after Prime Minister Scott Morrison blindsided state and territory leaders with his pronouncements on AstraZeneca and sparked days of confusion and criticism, he tried to present a united front.
After a second national cabinet meeting at the end of a week of crisis, he outlined a new plan for the country to tackle the momentous task of vaccinating the population and reopening Australia to the world.
Mr Morrison laid out the new outlook with four phases on Friday - one that would see governments move away from lockdowns and hard border closures and move towards allowing COVID-19 to become just another seasonal virus.
But the plan requires crucial boxes to be ticked along the way before that end goal is reached.
Vaccination percentage thresholds are the missing puzzle piece Australia needs in order to progress to each new phase, and one the Prime Minister shied away from committing to just yet.
A vague indication suggesting the country would start to slowly ease restrictions for vaccinated people next year was flagged, but it could hardly be seen as a commitment.
While the plan sounds otherwise promising it feels all too familiar.
At the start of the year, the Prime Minister and Health Minister Greg Hunt had confidently predicted 4 million Australians would be vaccinated by the end of March.
In reality, by that time the rollout had barely reached a quarter of the government's initial hopes.
The Health Department released figures this week showing about 8 per cent of the eligible population had received the required two doses.
It's clear, the so-far shambolic rollout and recent confusion over which vaccine should be taken has made the vaccine a tough sell.
Filling in the gaps on dates or vaccination percentage targets might be the only move the government has left to make.
Mr Morrison said those details would be provided by the Doherty Institute once its modelling on targets had been completed.
If things go to plan, we can assume we will see a return to international travel at the earliest some time next year.
But as the experience of the pandemic has showed, plans fall apart. Optimistic forecasts are made at peril.
Right now, the challenge for the Prime Minister is to win back trust and build credit with Australians frustrated by recent events.

Politicking won't help NSW move forward

Full text: 'We are following the best medical advice" has been the refrain of every state and federal political leader during the pandemic. And, with the support of the community, the quality of this advice and adherence to it has largely been the foundation for Australia's successful efforts in containing COVID-19. Implicit in the message is that such advice is politically neutral and based exclusively on the data and the science. As if to emphasise the point, during the dark days of lockdown in Victoria, Premier Daniel Andrews often remarked that he was never less interested in politics.
While it was always hard to accept that assertion knowing Mr Andrews' reputation for bare-knuckled political brawling and his need to defend a government that had bungled hotel quarantine, it was also a convenient mantra that distanced the Premier from the harsher social distancing measures he introduced. These included at one time an unpopular curfew and the five-kilometre travel restriction.
In NSW this week we have seen on full display a similar uneasy amalgam of politics and "best medical advice". Premier Gladys Berejiklian has until now been able to buttress her reputation by pointing to how her government has managed COVID-19 outbreaks with minimal disruption to people's lives. Now in the wake of the Delta outbreak she is faces a difficult reckoning. Recorded daily cases reached a new high of 38 yesterday and a disconcertingly high number of people were moving around the community while infectious. With all this happening at a time when the initial two-week lockdown should have been winding up, it is clear the state faces challenges. The genesis of the problem seems to be NSW spurning the go-hard, go-early approach that most other states have learnt to adopt - some like Victoria through bitter experience.
In what might now be considered a bold experiment, NSW Premier Gladys Berejiklian's "lockdown light" approach to this outbreak allowed many shops and businesses to stay open, relying heavily on the state's world-class contact tracers and on ordinary people "doing the right thing". University of Melbourne epidemiologist Tony Blakely, whose modelling influenced the Victorian government's response to last year's second wave, welcomed the decision to "gain compliance by a sense of volunteering". But he also warned that the chance of Sydney controlling the outbreak was a bit less than 50/50.
That experiment is now at a tipping point. Ms Berejiklian finds herself caught between the pressure from some in the community and within her own cabinet to begin lifting restrictions, and the need to plead with Sydneysiders to follow the rules. While tougher restrictions have not been taken off the table, she is hemmed in by her own previous rhetoric that other states were overreacting to outbreaks. Her reputation as the Premier who avoided lockdowns was also burnished by senior ministers in Canberra and the Prime Minister, who compared her favourably with Labor counterparts.
But with the number of infections growing in Sydney and no clear plan B, public squabbling has broken out. Some senior state Liberals have even suggested NSW may have to get used to living with the virus in the community, an idea Ms Berejiklian was quick to quash.
We at The Age unequivocally wish our northern neighbours the very best in ending this outbreak. Victoria has been there and we know politicking, point-scoring and those without deep expertise offering ill-informed views to suit narrow agendas don't help.

But the plan requires crucial boxes to be ticked along the way before that end goal is reached.
Vaccination percentage thresholds are the missing puzzle piece Australia needs in order to progress to each new phase, and one the Prime Minister shied away from committing to just yet.
A vague indication suggesting the country would start to slowly ease restrictions for vaccinated people next year was flagged, but it could hardly be seen as a commitment.
While the plan sounds otherwise promising it feels all too familiar.
At the start of the year, the Prime Minister and Health Minister Greg Hunt had confidently predicted 4 million Australians would be vaccinated by the end of March.
In reality, by that time the rollout had barely reached a quarter of the government's initial hopes.
The Health Department released figures this week showing about 8 per cent of the eligible population had received the required two doses.
It's clear, the so-far shambolic rollout and recent confusion over which vaccine should be taken has made the vaccine a tough sell.
Filling in the gaps on dates or vaccination percentage targets might be the only move the government has left to make.
Mr Morrison said those details would be provided by the Doherty Institute once its modelling on targets had been completed.
If things go to plan, we can assume we will see a return to international travel at the earliest some time next year.
But as the experience of the pandemic has showed, plans fall apart. Optimistic forecasts are made at peril.
Right now, the challenge for the Prime Minister is to win back trust and build credit with Australians frustrated by recent events.

Full text: Opposition Leader Anthony Albanese has seized on reports of three aged care residents in Sydney being infected with COVID-19, blaming the Morrison government for its failure in rolling out the vaccine program.
The three were infected by two staff members and were among 16 new local cases across NSW reported on Sunday.
"It was another reminder of this government's incompetence when its comes to the rolling out of the vaccine," Mr Albanese said.
The four-stage plan to steer Australia through the COVID-19 pandemic and back to some sort of normality outlined by the Prime Minister Scott Morrison last week hinges on the vaccination target.
That target will be predicated on medical advice and modelling by the Doherty Institute being conducted over the next month or so.
"The vaccination is the key to our ability to be able to open our borders up again and get Australia back to whatever the new normal is going to look like," Social Services Minister Anne Ruston told Sky News' Sunday Agenda program.
"Every Australian wants us to get to stage four as quickly as possible, but we can only do that if we know that the health and safety of Australians is being protected on the way."
Deakin University chair of epidemiology Catherine Bennett hoped to see progressive targets which would bring the benefits that vaccine offers into more immediate reach.
"So we are not just looking at that final number when we can open up our international borders but when we are in a position to say we can triage our arrivals from overseas according to their vaccination status," Professor Bennett told Sky News.
However, there was still no exact timetable for when under-40s could get the recommended Pfizer vaccination. Mr Albanese said the inability to set a date was a massive failure of the government, saying: "It is a race and we have seen the consequences of it. The fact there is no date or no timelines on the so-called four phases that we need to go through, says it all about this government."
Victoria has complained its Pfizer allocation was already dwindling as NSW received more to battle its unfolding outbreak.
"We wish [NSW] every success, of course, but ... disappointingly, Victoria will have to manage down for the next few weeks," Victorian Health Minister Martin Foley said.

SHUTTING DOWN IS A POOR FIX

Full text: ANOTHER lockdown done and dusted. There must be no more, except in the most desperate of circumstances.
The devastating social effects and dire economic consequences of forcing businesses to close, stopping kids going to school, keeping people locked in their homes and keeping family and friends apart are now only too well known.
After four lockdowns we might know what to expect, but that doesn’t make it any easier.
Kids Helpline recorded a 184 per cent increase in youth suicide attempts in Victoria from December 2020 to May 2021 compared to one year earlier.
Reasons for the surge included “the impact of isolation and lockdowns” and the “increased stress” of young people not being at school. Consequently, there has been an increase in young people looking for community-based mental health services.
This was recognised by the state government last week with the immediate injection of $10m into critical mental health services.
After a record $3.8bn investment in mental health announced in last month’s budget, the extra $10m is small money. But it is recognition that critical services need funding right now.
The government is no doubt feeling justified in locking Victorians up for a fourth time.
Modelling by the Burnet Institute, released last week, found that without the action up to 2000 Victorians would have contracted Covid-19 by August.
There can be no arguing the lockdown worked. Of course it did. When people can’t mix, the virus can’t spread. But there must be another way. How can it be that after more than 15 months we’re no more advanced at dealing with this virus?
Fortunately, unlike so many countries around the world still dealing with uncontrollable levels of the virus, Victoria is not in that position. Just two cases were discovered after more than 80 days of no locally acquired transmissions. Which leaves us in the unique position to be bold with our approach, and experiment with methods that don’t force the state to grind to a halt.
But it will take courage from authorities to let life continue while putting out the spot fires that will no doubt continue to emerge.
Victorian members of the Committees for Cities and Regions are now calling on the state government to develop a long-term Covid readiness plan. They rightly point out staged restrictions and recovery road maps are too often inconsistently applied.
“This unpredictability of government decision-making contributes to the general unease in the community about unforeseeable restrictions that could be imposed upon Victorians at any moment,” they say.
“The lack of a clear and consistent approach to reopening and locking down Victorian communities erodes business and consumer confidence to plan, resulting in damaging effects to local economies, community mental health outcomes and the reputation of Victoria as the place to be.” Among other things, they want “a common set of publicly available and industry-informed standards to be applied to decision-making on Covid restrictions in Victoria”.
The government has long kept the rationale behind its decision-making process secret, saying only it is based on “public health advice”.
But increased transparency over the process will not only instil confidence, but could prompt a public debate on how to move forward. And how to do so without another lockdown.
AND ANOTHER THING IT beggars belief that four days after wild storms lashed parts of the state, tens of thousands of Victorians remain in the dark.
More than 250,000 homes in storm-damaged areas lost power last Thursday. Thousands on Sunday night were still waiting for the lights to come back on. In the middle of winter and with ongoing Covid restrictions in place, they’ve sat for days with no power, no lighting and, for many, no heating.
The net of blame could be cast far and wide. But ultimately, this is an act of God and the blame game serves little purpose.
What is hard to fathom is the virtual radio silence on the issue. The fact that hundreds of thousands of people were left without power, lights and heating is nothing short of a disaster.
But the pandemic is all-consuming. The morning after the storms, Acting Premier James Merlino faced the media to announce an easing of restrictions. There was reference to the storms, but not much of substance.
Energy Minister Lily D’Ambrosio put out a series of tweets and thanked energy companies for their efforts in restoring services.
In normal times, it’s hard to imagine Ms D’Ambrosio not facing the media at least once, but probably many times, to update the public and instil a sense of confidence.
It poses the question: With such intense government focus on Covid, what else is being ignored, or given less attention than it deserves?
Carrying on the business of government alongside a pandemic response has been a problem for governments the world over. Taxpayers should be concerned about the return of the virus, particularly through government error.
Because every time Covid-19 returns through a hotel quarantine breach or similar failure by authorities, the government is forced to again turn all attention to eliminating the scourge. And that can only be to the detriment of other critical functions.

Hotel boss quits

Full text: SUSPENDED hotel quarantine boss Matiu Bush resigned on Friday after an investigation into alleged breaches of infection control policies.
Mr Bush agreed to quit in the wake of Covid-19 Quarantine Victoria deciding his hiring of two gym trainers to $100,000-a-year jobs should be part of a “wide-ranging” investigation into his conduct.
Mr Bush was directly involved in the hiring of Functional U gym owner Alex Cheong and one of its trainers, Christine Yap, as hotel site leads.
The broadened inquiry was ­examining Mr Bush’s “recruitment processes”, including ­whether he declared any potential conflict of interest in ­relation to his links to the gym and, in particular, Mr Cheong.
In other concerning revelations, thousands of Covid-19 doses have been “quarantined” and could be thrown out after storm damage cut power to a vaccine centre.
The Health Department said 2000 AstraZeneca doses had been quarantined for “further assessment of viability”, after power was lost at the Eastern Health Lilydale vaccination site.
“This is a small fraction of the AstraZeneca doses we currently have in stock and it will not impact the broader vaccine rollout,” she said. “Victorians have continued to come forward for vaccination in record numbers, ­despite extreme weather in recent days.” The Herald Sun has been told at least one elderly woman was turned away from her first scheduled jab.
“She turned up for her appointment and was told the power was out and all the vaccines in the fridge had to be thrown out,” her son said.
It came as Melburnians enjoyed their first taste of partial freedom, with no new locally acquired cases on Friday. Certain restrictions remain in place over the long weekend.
City restaurants are limited to groups of no more than 10, and only 50 people indoors, with no visitors at homes and masks mandatory. In a bizarre ruling, it was ­revealed on Friday that despite NSW allowing Victorians to fly there, local restrictions barred them from driving to the airport if they lived more than 25km away.
Acting Premier James Merlino and chief health officer Brett Sutton defended the calls, saying the risks were ­“nowhere near over”.
Professor Sutton warned cases were likely to emerge among new close contacts, but said it was “not a concern as they are all quarantined for the entire period”.
He refused to provide any reassurance that restrictions would ease further next week.
“It’s a balancing act. You don’t want to open up to the extent that there’s a really significant risk of this variant, any variant, running away,” Professor Sutton said.
“The risk remains and (there is) so many lessons from overseas of what that looks like. We’re moving by increments, and we’re moving safely. We’re not wanting to impose things that are excessive ... it’s always under ­review.” The Saturday Herald Sun can reveal new government modelling shows the latest lockdown prevented Covid-19 being transmitted to thousands of Victorians.
Based on the cluster pattern when Melbourne went into lockdown on May 27, the Burnet Institute modelled four scenarios. It found that without lockdown and with only the mask-wearing rule and work-from-home restrictions, there could have been up to 2000 cases by August.
The Reservoir house at the centre of the latest scare have all been identified as carrying the Kappa strain of virus. Authorities are still investigating how a Covid-infected Melbourne couple escaped to Queensland, sparking concerns across three states.

Full text: TWO “fleeting” transmission cases partially used to justify Victoria’s extended lockdown were false positives with the state government now under increasing pressure to publicly release its health advice.
An expert panel on Thursday ruled the cases – a woman who was said to have caught the virus at a display home in Mickleham and a man allegedly infected while dining outdoors at the Brighton Beach Hotel – were “false positives”.
It came just days after health officials warned those infections showed the danger posed by the Indian super-strain circulating across Melbourne.
“What we are seeing now clearly is people who are brushing past each other in a small shop, they are going to a display home, they are looking at phones in a Telstra shop – they don’t know each other’s names and that is very different from where we have been,” Covid-19 response commander Jeroen Weimar said on Tuesday.
But the Department of Health said on Thursday those two instances were “no longer considered confirmed cases”. “Following analysis by an expert review panel, and ­retesting through the Victorian Infectious Diseases Reference Laboratory, two cases linked to this outbreak have been ­declared false positives,” a department spokesman said.
Both the display home and Brighton Beach Hotel will remain exposure sites because they are linked to other cases, but any exposure sites linked to the two false cases, including all listed in Anglesea, will be “stood down”.
Melbourne University epidemiologist Tony Blakely said he was hopeful the false positives could result in lockdown being lifted as early as Sunday.
“It is actually good news, although it doesn’t completely remove fleeting transmissions that are happening, it suggests just maybe we will get out of this lockdown a little quicker,” he said.
“I’m reasonably hopeful we could get out of this by the end of the week. We are doing all the right things. There are a lot of contact sites but they are looking at a slightly better ­picture.” Former premier Jeff Kennett said the false positives had needlessly alarmed communities. “Another Fawlty Towers example of failure,” he said. “While thousands of employees stood down. Tragic.” Victoria recorded just three new Covid-19 cases on Thursday, with each identified as a primary close contact, ­meaning all had been in isolation during their infectious period.
The government repeatedly said last week its decision to plunge the state into another lockdown was based on public health advice, but officials have come under fire for scaremongering about the risks of Covid-19 variants.
Opposition Leader Michael O’Brien on Thursday called for the government to ­urgently release that health ­advice so Victorians could see the evidence for themselves.
“It’s the least we’re entitled to,” he said. “We’re seeing our lives put on hold. We’re seeing our lives locked down and the government will not even release the public health advice.” Mr O’Brien backed comments from leading epidemiologists who have raised concerns over “apocalyptic” language used by the government, which he claimed had scared Victorians.
“That’s the last thing we need at the moment. We need Victorians to be calm. We don’t need government officials trying to amp up their language and scare people,” he said.
The false positives have ­renewed questions about whether the B1617.1 or “Kappa” strain at the centre of Melbourne’s current outbreak is moving as fast as first ­predicted by chief health ­officer Professor Brett Sutton.
Referring to it as an “absolute beast”, Prof Sutton – who was absent from Thursday’s press conference – claimed it was in the “measles category of infectiousness”.
But measles, thought to boast a reproduction number of between 12 and 18, is significantly more infectious.
Deputy chief health officer Professor Allen Cheng, who moved to clarify Prof Sutton’s comments, said due to strict limits of movement, the current virus had been predicted as having an effective reproduction number of about 0.069 by national modelling experts.
“It’s not really controversial to say most of these variants have been shown to be more infectious,” Prof Cheng said.
But La Trobe University ­associate professor in epidemiology Prof Hassan Vally said it was important to put any fear and anxiety into perspective. “I think we have to be careful and measured with our use of language when it comes to the situation in Victoria,” he said.
“It’s certainly true that we are facing a different variant in this cluster that has been reported to be more infectious than other strains. However, we are still facing the same virus and it still behaves in a similar way in all other respects to the original strain.” Professor Raina MacIntyre, head of the biosecurity program at the Kirby Institute at the University of New South Wales, said little was known about the Kappa variant but it was “definitely something to be worried about”.

Full text: Victorian Premier Daniel Andrews suffered a serious vertebrae injury that could lead to an extended period away from the state’s top job as he faces potential surgery, The Australian understands.
Home Affairs Minister Peter Dutton will fill in for Christian Porter as Leader of the House when federal parliament returns on Monday.
Energy Minister Angus Taylor said the early closure of Victoria’s Yallourn coal power station raises reliability and price concerns while placing added pressure on the market to deliver new supplies.
Richard Ferguson 10.15pm: No surgery for Andrews
Daniel Andrews suffered serious injuries but is not facing immediate surgery, his doctors say.
The Alfred’s Director of ICU, Associate Professor Steve McGloughlin, confirmed that the Victorian Premier was in a stable condition.
“Mr Andrews is comfortable and his pain is well-controlled,” Professor McGloughlin said.
“A multidisciplinary team including intensive care, trauma and orthopaedic specialists has developed a treatment plan, together with the Andrews family.
“Mr Andrews has sustained some serious injuries, and his condition is being monitored closely. At this stage there is no immediate plan for surgery.
A spokeswoman for Mr Andrews said: “On the advice of clinicians at The Alfred, there are no immediate plans for surgery.”

Stephen Lunn 9.55pm: Fear of getting lost on way to new energy
When Ashley Schoer was told the Yallourn power station would be closing in 2028, four years earlier than scheduled, his employer ­EnergyAustralia offered him no pathway from his job in old ­energy to the company’s new ­energy future.
“We were given FAQs that talked about support during the transition, but it was pretty wishy-washy,” said Mr Schoer, a 34-year veteran of the brown-coal-fired power plant.
“There were no guarantees they would take any of us along with them into this renewable ­energy future they talked about.”
Mr Schoer, a unit controller at the plant, said the company’s commitment to have a 350MW battery — larger than any currently operating — up and running at the plant by 2026 offered no comfort to him or his ­colleagues.
“Their timetable has the battery up and running by 2026, but also they have the plant fully ­operational until 2028, so this doesn’t seem to allow for workers like myself to make any transition, because it would need new people to construct and run it,” he said. “My understanding is most of the jobs are in the construction phase anyway.”
EnergyAustralia’s promises of carbon neutrality by 2050, and its commitment to cleaner energy, threaten to leave behind workers like Mr Schoer, 52, despite the company’s commitments to support the workforce through its transition to cleaner energy.

Richard Ferguson 9.25pm: Plan needed for foreign students
Universities Australia chair­woman Deborah Terry is calling on the Morrison government to devise a plan to bring foreign ­students back to Australia, as Canberra says the $40bn inter­national education sector’s ­revival depends on the states.
Trade Minister Dan Tehan said the return of international students into Australia could not proceed until the states gave the commonwealth detailed plans on how they would quarantine foreign students.
The closure of Australia’s international borders has threatened the $10bn stream of revenue universities get from foreign students, and enrolments from overseas plunged by 5 per cent last year.

Rebecca Urban 8.40pm: Goal to make our schools best in class by 2030
Federal Education Minister Alan Tudge has flagged an impending review of the teacher education sector, arguing further reform is necessary to reverse declining academic outcomes and return the nation to the top of the global rankings by 2030.
He has also hinted at the ­creation of new pathways into teaching, including bringing back one-year diplomas to attract talented mid-career professionals from other fields, such as engineering and accountancy.
In a speech to be delivered at the Menzies Research Centre on Thursday, Mr Tudge points to a 20-year decline in Australian student achievement, as evidence by the OECD PISA test, as justification for reform focused on boosting teacher quality, creating a more rigorous school curriculum and safeguarding NAPLAN from “those who call for less accountability”.
“Australian students are now, on average, about 1½ years behind Singaporean students when it comes to reading and science, and three years behind on maths,” he says. “The next evolution of ­reforms is needed (and) I will soon be launching a review to help shape such reforms.
“This review will investigate where there is still further work to do to ensure that all (initial teacher education) courses are high-quality and adequately prepare our teachers to be effective from day one. The quality of teaching is the most important factor in student outcomes. It is my most ­important priority when it comes to schooling.”

Ewin Hannan 8pm: IR bill in doubt as senator calls for major change
Senate crossbencher Stirling Griff has called for significant changes to the Coalition’s industrial relations bill before he would consider supporting it, casting fresh doubt on the ability of the government to get the proposed laws passed next week.
Fellow crossbencher Rex Patrick, who along with Jacqui Lambie wants a Senate vote on the bill delayed until May, said it would be “impossible” for the government to get agreement on the complex legislation while Christian Porter was on leave.
Senator Patrick told ABC television that he could almost guarantee that the bill would not be dealt with during next week’s sitting.
Senator Griff told The Australian on Wednesday that the government would need to support changes recommended by the Law Council of Australia before he would entertain supporting the bill, including greatly enhanced arbitration powers for the Fair Work Commission.
In its submission to a Senate inquiry, the Law Council proposes a raft of changes, including giving casual workers access to arbitration by the commission where an employer denied a request to convert to permanent employment.
The proposal, backed by the union movement, is not currently supported by the government but the Law Council said the change would prevent employers unreasonably denying a request from a casual.

Anglie Raphael 7.20pm: Kirkup to quit politics if he loses WA seat
West Australian Liberal leader Zak Kirkup says he will not “continue in the political arena” if he loses his seat at the state election this weekend.
The concession comes after the Opposition Leader’s other bombshell a few weeks ago when he admitted his party could not defeat Labor and its hugely popular leader Mark McGowan.
Mr Kirkup, who is a first-term MP and became the youngest ever WA Liberal leader in November, holds his seat of Dawesville by a razor thin margin of just 0.8 per cent.
“If I am not returned to Dawesville, I don’t think that I would return to politics,” Mr Kirkup told the ABC’s 7.30.
“This is my home, and this is the community that I love and have a privilege of representing.
“If I’m not returned here … I’m not going to continue in the political arena. I think that’s my time.”
Mr McGowan has become wildly popular in WA thanks to his handling of the COVID-19 pandemic and he has repeatedly argued MrKirkup lacks experience to lead the state.
After conceding defeat was inevitable, Mr Kirkup shifted his focus to suggest voters should not allow Labor to gain “totalcontrol” in parliament.
The election will be held on Saturday.

Jimmy Vielkind 7.10pm: Cuomo accused by fourth adviser
New York Governor Andrew Cuomo’s office has received a complaint from another female employee alleging inappropriate behaviour and referred it to investigators conducting a review of sexual-harassment accu­sations against him, according to sources.
The Albany Times-Union first reported the new complaint. The complainant, who wasn’t named by the paper and still works in the governor’s office, accused Mr Cuomo of touching her inappropriately late last year at the Executive Mansion in Albany, according to the Times-Union. The person familiar with the matter confirmed that was the allegation in the complaint.
Mr Cuomo, a Democrat, told reporters during a Tuesday conference call that he was unaware of the claim.
He said he never touched anybody inappropriately or made any inappropriate advances. Nobody ever told him at the time that his actions made them feel uncomfortable, he said.
The latest accuser is the fourth woman who worked for the governor to accuse him of inappropriate behaviour or sexual harassment.

John Ferguson 6.20pm: Stability of Andrews government in doctor’s hands
The stability of the Victorian government is in the hands of Daniel Andrews’ doctors.
The fall is self-evidently painful and unwelcome news for the Victorian Premier and his family, but the implications of the misstep may be wide.
The immediate challenge for the cabinet is to effectively dismantle, at least over the short term, the Andrews system of him being the administration’s north, south, east and west. His deputy, James Merlino, will not have the same authority as Andrews and will be required to function in a more inclusive manner.

Agencies 5.40pm: Myanmar security forces target striking workers
Hundreds of soldiers and police swooped on a railway station in Yangon on Wednesday seeking to arrest workers on strike to protest against the military coup in Myanmar, AFP reports .
The country has been in turmoil since the military ousted and detained civilian leader Aung San Suu Kyi last month, triggering daily protests around the country to demand the return of democracy.
Security forces have responded with an increasingly brutal crackdown involving tear gas, water cannon and rubber bullets, as well as isolated incidents of live rounds.
Close to 2000 people have been arrested and the death toll has climbed to more than 60.

Ben Packham 4.05pm: China fumes as wanted HK politician lands in Australia
China has accused Australia of “meddling” in its internal affairs by allowing Hong Kong pro-democracy leader Ted Hui Chi-fung into the country.
Australian authorities relaxed travel restrictions for non-citizens to allow the former Hong Kong opposition MP – who is wanted by Beijing – to fly from London to Darwin on Tuesday.
He is the first of Hong Kong pro-democracy leaders to relocate to Australia, prompting an angry response from the Chinese Embassy in Canberra.
“China’s position on Hong Kong-related issues is consistent and clear,” an embassy spokesman said.
“Hong Kong is China’s Hong Kong, and every bit of Hong Kong affairs belongs to China’s internal affairs, in which no other country has the right to interfere.
“The Chinese side urges the Australian side to stop meddling in Hong Kong‘s affairs and China’s internal affairs in any way. Otherwise the China-Australia relations will only sustain further damage.”

Anthony Piovesan 3.45pm: Anti-vaxx medics cop warning over dodgy advice
Doctors, nurses and pharmacists could be stripped of their ability to practise if they are found by the medical watchdog to be spreading COVID anti-vaccination claims.
Western Australia Premier Mark McGowan has responded to criticism from NSW Premier Gladys Berejiklian - who called internal borders a "national embarrassment" - labelling her statement as "silly".
The punishment is part of a string of harsh penalties health practitioners face after the national medical boards and the Australian Health Practitioner Regulatory Agency (AHPRA) released a joint directive warning on Tuesday.
The alert said practitioners risked regulatory action if they spouted false or deceptive misinformation to patients or on social media which could undermine Australia’s vaccination program.
“There is no place for anti-vaccination messages in professional health practice, and any promotion of anti-vaccination claims including on social media, and advertising may be subject to regulatory action,” spokesman for the medical boards and Pharmacy Board chairman Brett Simmonds said.
AHPRA chief executive Martin Fletcher urged all of Australia’s 800,000 registered practitioners and 193,800 students to follow the guidelines.

Staff Reporters 3.25pm: ACT reports one new Covid-19 case
The case, in hotel quarantine, brings the ACT’s coronavirus total to 123. The new case is a male under 20 who is a close contact of a previously infected person.
The territory has five active cases, all in hotel quarantine.
Health authorities say the male arrived with his family on a flight on March 1. He is a family member of a woman and another male under the age of 20 who tested positive last week.
Lachlan Moffet Gray 2.59pm: Leisure flight bookings eclipse pre-pandemic levels
Jetstar CEO Gareth Evans says leisure flight bookings are 10 per cent to 20 per cent higher than they were pre-pandemic, according to Bloomberg.
Speaking at a Centre for Aviation conference on Wednesday, Mr Evans said Qantas’s low-cost airline would be flying 90 per cent of its pre-COVID-19 schedule this month.
“Right now, with all the borders open pretty much, it’s looking pretty positive,” he said.
Qantas is trading at $5.175 per share, up 0.68 per cent, and above its five year average of $4.99.
Earlier today analysts at JP Morgan raised their recommendation for the stock to buy, saying the national carrier is well positioned to expand market share post-pandemic.

Perry Williams 2.53pm: Origin weighs closure of NSW coal station
Origin Energy boss Frank Calabria said an accelerated move to renewables sparked EnergyAustralia’s decision to close Victoria’s Yallourn coal plant four years early in 2028 as it weighs a range of scenarios for when to close its own Eraring coal station in NSW.
The energy transition “is reaching a tipping point,” Mr Calabria told a business conference on Wednesday. “Our future system is going to be powered by wind and solar, it’s going to be firmed up by pumped hydro and batteries and probably the need for gas fired generation for those extended outages that may occur.”
“We’re getting to the point where it’s accelerated over the last year and so today’s announcement I think is a sign of the times that this energy transition is really accelerating right now.”
Origin’s Eraring plant, the biggest in Australia, is also due to close by 2032 and Mr Calabria said it will consider a range of scenarios for the facility as the market keeps changing.
“We’ve said we would close by 2032 but I did say previously that you’ve got a market now really shifting rapidly and like all generators in the market we’re running that plant differently today than we were six months ago,” Mr Calabria said. “Therefore, there would be a range of scenarios we plan for. I can’t predict a particular scenario but you’d have to say the acceleration over recent times does not surprise me with EnergyAustralia’s announcement.”

Rhiannon Tuffield 2.39pm: Travel company ordered to refund more to thousands
The Australian consumer watchdog has directed a travel company to hand out additional refunds to thousands of customers who had their travel cancelled due to COVID-19.
Australian Pacific Touring, trading as APT and Travelmarvel, agreed to stop deducting marketing and overhead costs from refunds and to reimburse customers who had previously had those costs deducted.
APT is Australia’s largest family-owned tour and cruise company offering Australian and international tours and cruises.
The ACCC said it was concerned about the fees the company had been charging customers who had their travel cancelled, and it had accepted a commitment from APT to address the issue.
“The costs that APT deducted for marketing and overheads amounted to 15 per cent of the booking price and, with many holidays costing over $20,000, this meant a significant amount was withheld from the refunds given to consumers,” ACCC commissioner Sarah Court said.
“APT was not entitled to deduct these marketing and overhead costs as they were incurred before the booking was made and they would have been incurred regardless of whether a booking was made.”
Affected customers have either already been contacted by APT or will shortly be contacted about their revised refund. — NCA Newswire

JOHN FERGUSON 1.52pm: Andrews prognosis worse than expected
Victorian Premier Daniel Andrews suffered a serious vertebrae injury that could lead to an extended period away from the state’s top job.
Mr Andrews suffered a fracture in his middle back, the T7 vertebrae, and faces potential surgery, The Australian understands.
Doctors will today decide how to support the fractured vertebrae. There is no suggestion he has suffered a neck injury. But the prognosis is believed to be worse than the government was expecting.
The initial medical assessment was focused on his broken ribs, and concerns that he might have a punctured lung. But the focus has now switched to his fractured back.
The T7 vertebrae is part of the thoracic spine, which is known as the upper back.
Fractures in this area can take months to heal.
“It’s clear he’s got a massive road ahead of him,” a friend said.
The fracture occurred when he fell heavily on his back, without time to break the fall, friends said.
It could lead to surgery to support the vertebrae, possibly with pins, but no definitive treatment pathway is known.

Ellie Dudley 1.46pm: NSW team injects leadership on vaccine rollout
NSW Premier Gladys Berejiklian has received her AstraZeneca vaccine, alongside Chief Health Officer Kerry Chant and Health Minister Brad Hazzard .
The state’s rollout of the new jab began today from two Sydney hospitals in St George and Hornsby.
When asked whether she was nervous for the vaccination in a press conference prior to her jab, Ms Berejiklian laughed.
“I don’t mind injections,” she said.
Cleaning services supervisor Hailey Sharif was the first staff member at the hospital to receive the vaccine.
I feel so fortunate to receive the vaccine, it gives extra assurance that I’m going to be protected,” she said.
“I want to protect my kids and my grandkids. I’ve got five children, 14 grandchildren and one great grandchild. It’s so important that we all receive our vaccine to keep each other safe.”

DAVID SWAN 1.37pm: Aussie Facebook rival breaks crowd-funding record
A new Australian equity crowd-funding record was set yesterday with local Facebook rival LITT raising $500,000 in just 40 minutes.
The company, which is offering $1.5m worth of shares, became the second fastest to raise $1m, hitting that number in 11 hours.
LITT co-founder Brent Thompson says he’s recommending any investors who were considering participating in the offer do so before it’s too late.
The site spiked in popularity after Facebook blocked Australian news from its platform last month, with more than 15,000 users signing up to LITT since Thursday, a membership surge of 50 per cent.
LITT co-founder Peter Salom described his platform as an app that combines social media with digital payments and augmented reality advertising, and he’s calling on more businesses and media companies to sign up.

Geoff Chambers 12.50pm: Dutton to take on Porter’s parliamentary duties
Home Affairs Minister Peter Dutton will fill in for Christian Porter as Leader of the House when federal parliament returns on Monday.
Prime Minister Scott Morrison is standing firm in his support for Attorney-General Christian Porter – reiterating there is no basis under Australian law to take action against him.
Mr Dutton is expected to run the government’s business on the floor of the lower house over the next sitting period, while Mr Porter takes medical leave to address his mental health after identifying himself as the Cabinet minister accused of an historical rape dating back to 1988.
Mr Porter, who has not made clear when he will return from leave, has strenuously denied the allegation.
The parliamentary sitting fortnight, which includes Senate estimates hearings, will be the last time federal MPs travel to Canberra before the May 11 budget.
The government’s industrial relations legislation, which was being led by Mr Porter as Industrial Relations Minister, will be a legislative priority overseen by acting Attorney-General and Industrial Relations Minister Michaelia Cash .

Ellie Dudley 12.30pm: States lagging on overseas travellers ‘frustrating’
Gladys Berejiklian has criticised other states for accepting low levels of overseas Australians, saying they’re “certainly” not accepting as many as NSW.
“It causes frustrations for us,” she said.
“The other states certainly aren’t doing the same rates as NSW.”
Her comments come amid growing tensions between the state leaders after NSW sent Queensland and WA hotel quarantine bills for processing their residents.
Ms Berejiklian said NSW had taken a “compassionate” approach to handling stranded Australians, and said the other states should “do their bit”.
“I don’t think any Australians abroad would be blaming NSW … they’re very grateful for what we’ve been doing “

Ellie Dudley 12.21pm: NSW ‘happy to help nation with vaccine rollout’
NSW Premier Gladys Berejiklian has again repeated her plea to the federal government to let the state assist in the national rollout of the vaccines.
At the end of Stage 1B of the rollout, the responsibility of the states to administer the vaccines ends and the federal government will turn to the national GP network to do so.
However, Ms Berejiklian has called on the government to let NSW help with the nation’s rollout.
RACGP President Karen Price says she is “not particularly” concerned the nation’s vaccine rollout is well behind the government’s original schedule since it is important not to rush the process.
“We’re happy to do more if we can,” she said.
“If I can be so bold as to say if NSW is poised to move more quickly than other states then I’d like to do that.”
Ms Berejiklian would like to see the state “complement” the GP network when it is functioning.
Perry Williams 12.13pm: Yallourn closure adds price, reliability pressures
Energy Minister Angus Taylor said the early closure of Victoria’s Yallourn coal power station raises reliability and price concerns while placing added pressure on the market to deliver new supplies.
The 1480 megawatt Yallourn plant in the Latrobe Valley supplies 22 per cent of Victoria’s electricity and 8 per cent of the national market and will close in mid-2028, four years earlier than expected.
“While the commonwealth government understands this is a commercial decision, the exit of 1480 MW of reliable energy generation brings with it reliability and affordability concerns,” Mr Taylor said in a statement.
“As an essential service, the commonwealth government expects the market to step up to deliver enough dispatchable generation to keep the lights on and prices low once Yallourn closes.”
The Morrison government has previously raised fears the closure in 2022 of AGL Energy’s Liddell coal plant did not repeat the market chaos that ensued after the closure at short notice of Engie’s Hazelwood plant in 2017.
It will model the impact of Yallourn’s early closure amid concerns over high bills.
“While coal exits impact reliability and system security, the major impact for consumers will be the significant increase in prices if not adequately replaced with dispatchable capacity. We have already seen this happen with the closures of Northern in South Australia and most recently Hazelwood in Victoria, where wholesale prices skyrocketed by 85 per cent,” Mr Taylor said.
“The commonwealth government will model the impact of the closure to hold industry to account on the dispatchable capacity needed to ensure affordable, reliable power for consumers. This will deliver needed transparency around the impact of Yallourn’s closure.”

Ellie Dudley 12.03pm: NSW on track to vaccinate 35,000
Gladys Berejiklian has announced 27,000 people in NSW have now received the COVID-19 vaccine, with “many more” to come as the St George and Hornsby hospitals open their vaccination hubs today.
By the end of the week the figure should reach 35,000. The numbers exclude those in aged care.
National Vaccine Rollout
Speaking at St George hospital where she was due to have the AstraZeneca vaccine today, the NSW Premier said the state was “very pleased” to be “open and transparent” in regards to how many people had been vaccinated, criticising some states who she said wanted that information to remain private.
“Can I make it very clear that New South Wales was not one of those states that objected to figures being provided,” she said.
“We’ve also always believed during the pandemic it’s best to be up-front with our public and at any time the federal government or anybody else wants access to those figures, we’re happy to provide them.”
Ms Berejiklian also announced the state has given out 74 per cent of the doses given to them by the federal government, due to syringes which could only administer five out of six doses in the vial.
NSW has now received new syringes which allows the full six doses to be given.
NSW Chief Health Officer Kerry Chant has confirmed the state is on track to meet its target of 35,000 people vaccinated by the end of the week.

Perry Williams 11.24am: ‘No secret that future of coal has been questioned’
EnergyAustralia said challenges for coal from the fast-paced move to renewables had taken place faster than anticipated.
“I think it’s fair to say it’s happened faster than most people forecast,” EnergyAustralia managing director Catherine Tanna told media after its decision to bring forward the closure of the Yallourn coal-fired power station by four years to mid-2028 from 2032.
“It’s no secret that the future of all coal fired power stations has been questioned a lot and what this announcement does is give clarity to the workforce at Yallourn around what the plan is and also ensures the storage capacity comes in well before Yallourn retires. It gives everybody an opportunity to plan for whatever else might be needed for the market.”
EnergyAustralia said it would consider adding gas-fired generation in Victoria as it considers how to fill the gap between a proposed 350 megawatt battery and the 1480MW capacity of the Yallourn power station.
The closure of Hazelwood in 2017, Victoria’s last coal plant to close, caused chaos in the national electricity market after owners Engie shut down the facility with just four months notice.
EnergyAustralia said it had committed to run Yallourn until 2028 under a pact with the Victorian government amid questions over whether the accelerating move to renewables and low wholesale power prices could even require the utility to bring forward a closure date again.
“Our belief is the system needs something like Yallourn out to 2028. There is as part of the agreement with the Victorian state government a safety net to ensure that’s what happens.”

Ellie Dudley 11.08am: NSW, Queensland both record zero local virus cases
New South Wales has recorded no new cases of locally transmitted COVID-19 and five in overseas arrivals.
A total of 15,534 tests were conducted over the past 24 hours to 8pm last night.
The state is treating 59 active cases of the virus, with one in ICU.
Meanwhile, Queensland has recorded no new cases of locally transmitted COVID-19, along with five positive results from overseas travellers.
A total of 7717 tests were conducted for the state over the past 24 hours, leaving Queensland with 37 active cases.
Queensland will set up five more AstraZeneca vaccine hubs to assist with the state’s escalating rollout, on top of the four that were launched earlier in the week.
The new hubs will be in the Royal Brisbane and Women’s Hospital, Redcliffe, Rockhampton, Mackay and Ipswich Raising hands, Premier Annastacia Palaszczuk wrote on Twitter today.
The current locations are in Logan, Bundaberg, QEII Jubilee Hospital and Toowoomba Hospital.

Perry Williams 10.51am: Yallourn coal-fired power station to close early
EnergyAustralia has confirmed the early closure of its Yallourn coal power plant in Victoria’s Latrobe Valley by mid-2028.
“While the announcement may have surprised some of our people, its context did not,” EnergyAustralia chief executive Catherine Tanna told media on Wednesday.
A multi-million dollar support package will be offered to the plant’s 500 workers and the company will build a utility scale battery facility by the end of 2026.
The new 350 megawatt battery will ease some of the stress on the power grid, although will only be a fraction of the 1480MW capacity of the coal plant.
The coal plant was due to operate until 2032 but is under immense earnings pressure amid a rapid fire fall in wholesale energy prices.
EnergyAustralia is due to make an announcement at 10.30am at the Yallourn Golf Club.
It is expected to bring forward the closure date of Yallourn by several years, possibly to close by 2028.
The 1480 megawatt Yallourn station in the Latrobe Valley supplies 22 per cent of Victoria’s electricity and 8 per cent of the national market.
Modelling by the Australian Energy Market Operator says if Victoria does meet a 50 per cent renewable target by 2030, at least one unit of the Yallourn station faces challenging economics due to additional renewable generation.
While coal still provides about 70 per cent of Australia’s power generation mix, there’s concern that plants may be forced out of the grid earlier than expected.
Yallourn has been nominated as one plant at risk by AEMO which cited lower demand, a higher renewables component in the generation mix, cuts to wind, solar and battery costs and higher maintenance costs for the nation’s ageing coal fleet.

Adeshola Ore 10.01am: Ill Hunt will be ‘fine by next week’
Scott Morrison says Health Minister Greg Hunt will “be fine by next week” when parliament resumes after he was admitted to hospital yesterday with a suspected infection.
On Tuesday, the office of Mr Hunt said he was being kept overnight for observation and would be administered antibiotics and fluid. It said Mr Hunt’s condition was not related to the AstraZeneca COVID vaccine he received on Sunday.
The Prime Minister said he would fill the health and aged-care portfolios while Mr Hunt recovers.
Health Minister Greg Hunt has been admitted to hospital where he is being treated for an infection with IV fluids and antibiotics.

Adeshola Ore 9.40am: Australia a long way off April vaccination target
Department of Health secretary Brendan Murphy has signalled that Australia will not reach its target to vaccinate four million people by early April.
Australia has now surpassed 100,000 COVID vaccinations since the national rollout began more than two weeks ago. The federal government said it aimed to initially begin vaccinating 80,000 people a week.
Prime Minister Scott Morrison has praised the efforts of the Therapeutic Goods Administration throughout the COVID-19 pandemic following a doorstop at the Canberra facility.
Last month, Health Minister Greg Hunt said Australia was still aiming to inoculate four million people by early April. But today Professor Murphy said Australia’s “major” target was to have every Australian vaccinated by the end of October.
“That is what we are working to and particularly to get the vulnerable people in phase 1 and 1B vaccinated as quickly as possible by the middle of this year,” he said.
“It is a dynamic program, that is what we are targeting.”
Professor Murphy said Australia’s national vaccine rollout was “not a race.”
“We have no burning platform in Australia. We are taking it as quickly and carefully and safely as we can,” he said.
“We are not like the US or the UK or any, or most other countries in the world where they have got people in hospital dying. We can take our time, set up our systems and do it safely.”
Mr Morrison said more than 1.3 million doses of the Pfizer and AstraZeneca vaccine have now arrived in Australia.
He said this meant Australia now had enough imported vaccines to tide the country over until the locally-produced vaccines were rolled out from March 22.

The ACT has begun their rollout of the AstraZeneca COVID-19 vaccine in Canberra this morning.

The centre can currently administer 6000 vaccines a week.
ACT health authorities today confirmed there are plans to expand the rollout to other sites if necessary.

Adeshola Ore 9.29am: Porter an innocent man under law, Morrison says
Scott Morrison says Attorney-General Christian Porter is an “innocent man under our law”, as he plays down political pressure to hold an independent inquiry into the historic rape allegation against him.
The ABC has reported that former Solicitor-General of Australia Justin Gleeson has urged the Prime Minister to enlist the current solicitor-general to assess whether Mr Porter should maintain the nation’s top law officer job.
Mr Morrison said his office had not received this advice.
“I have dealt with that issue. He is entitled to his view,” he said.
Mr Morrison said Mr Porter was a “fine” Attorney-General and Industrial Relations Minister.
“He is an innocent man under our law,” he said.
“To suggest there should be some different treatment applied to him, based on what had been allegations that the police have closed the matter on, I think it would be grossly inappropriate.”
Mr Porter has denied the allegation he raped a 16-year-old in 1988.

Adeshola Ore 9.21am: Morrison pleased at Anzac Day march increases
Scott Morrison says he’s “pleased’ that Anzac Day parades around the country have increased their capacity to allow more veterans to march.
Anzac Day marches will be held in every capital city this year after a push by Prime Minister Scott Morrison.
Anzac Day marches will be held in every capital city after the Prime Minister yesterday said he wanted the national day to proceed, arguing that if people were free to “protest” and “party” then they should be free to honour the nation’s war veterans. The NSW government increased the number of veterans allowed to march on April 25 from 500 to 5000 following the Prime Minister’s intervention and an outcry from veterans.
“I’m pleased that Anzac Day is on. I’m very pleased that we’re seeing changes being made to facilitate that happening across Australia,” Mr Morrison said on Wednesday.
“This is a sacred day for Australia”
On Tuesday, the Victorian government was considering plans to declare this year’s Anzac Day march in Melbourne a “major event’’ which would allow up to 5000 people to participate.

Adeshola Ore 9.15am: Quad meeting sends strong message to region: PM
Scott Morrison says the first leaders summit of the Quad framework on Friday is “another key step forward’ for strengthening Australia’s regional ties in the Indo-Pacific.
The Prime Minister will meet virtually with his international counterparts from the coalition – US President Joe Biden , Japanese Prime Minister Yoshihide Suga , and Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi . The meeting will focus on maintaining a free and open Indo-Pacific region, climate change and the economic effect of COVID.
US President Joe Biden will meet virtually with Prime Minster Scott Morrison on Saturday morning Australian time to discuss commitments in the Indo-Pacific.
The strategic framework was formalised in 2007, but Friday’s meeting will be the first time the leaders of the participating countries meet.
“It was the first thing I discussed with President Biden and I was so pleased that other leaders are so enthusiastic about the program and President Biden is taking this to another level,” Mr Morrison said.
“The Indo-Pacific is our world. This is where Australia lives and our security, our peace and stability that all Australians rely on for their freedom.”
“I couldn’t be more pleased. The meeting may be in the wee small hours of Sunday. Prime Minister Suga will also be up late that night, but it’s certainly worth staying up late.”
Mr Morrsion said the Quad meeting would “send a strong message” to the Indo-Pacific about Australia’s support for a stable and independent region.
“It will be in a historic moment in our region,” he said.

Erin Lyons 9.12am: Quarantine-free travel bubble with NZ reinstated
The quarantine-free travel bubble between Australia and New Zealand has been reinstated after Auckland’s hot-spot status was removed.
More than 1.7 million Kiwis emerged from a strict week-long lockdown in the nation’s biggest city on Sunday as health authorities rushed to contain a COVID cluster that broke out at an Auckland high school.
Later a case of the highly contagious UK variant was detected.
Updated advice received on Tuesday from New Zealand officials suggested the hot-spot status be lifted and “green flights” should resume from 11.59pm on March 11.
Australia’s chief medical officer Paul Kelly has been monitoring the situation and said it had “improved greatly”, with “minimal risk” remaining from the Auckland cluster.
A statement from the Department of Health and Professor Kelly outlined that states or territories were welcome to introduce their own conditions that might differ to the national advice.
“All travellers are advised to check the arrangements in both their place of arrival and place of final destination before they travel,” Professor Kelly said in the statement.
Australian health authorities applauded New Zealand’s contact tracing efforts.
“New Zealand’s contact tracing efforts showed the recent case identified, unrelated to the Auckland cluster, posed a low risk of COVID-19 spreading in Australia,” Professor Kelly said.
“The Australian government will continue to work closely with colleagues in the New Zealand Ministry of Health to monitor and assess the public health risk posed by COVID-19.”
Australian residents are still not allowed to fly to New Zealand under the current international travel ban, and any Kiwis who do travel to Australia will also have to complete 14 days quarantine on return.
The Prime Minister’s office has been contacted for comment.
Australia started taking green flights earlier in the year. They were halted when cases of the South African variant were detected in hotel quarantine in Auckland.
They were reinstated at the beginning of February, just a couple of weeks before the high school cluster in Auckland become known.
The bubble was swiftly halted again.
Three Air New Zealand flights are scheduled to touch down in Sydney on Thursday hours before the bubble ban is lifted.
There are no flights scheduled to arrive on Friday at this stage. — NCA Newswire

Natasha Robinson 8.27am: Fauci praises Australia’s response to pandemic
America’s chief medical adviser Anthony Fauci has praised Australia’s response to the coronavirus pandemic as he pledged to closely co-operate with Australia to stamp out the virus in the Pacific.
In an online conversation with Australia’s chief medical officer Paul Kelly hosted by the US Center for Strategic and International Studies, Dr Fauci said America had never managed to lock down as effectively as Australia had, and so had lost control of the virus.
“If you look at the monitoring of how well we locked down, we never really locked down completely,” Dr Fauci said. “We had a terrible economic impact, but we never really locked down as well or as completely as Australia did.
“And I think a combination of the other things that Australia did effectively really led to the fact that they’ve done really quite well when you compare Australia to other countries in the world.”
Professor Kelly said during the conversation that as Australia’s vaccination program continues and the country starts to open up, people will need to adjust to the fact that there will be rising numbers of cases.
“In many ways we can only go one way with this which is to have more cases, and as we start to open up that will be an issue,” Professor Kelly said. “We will have to have a conversation with the Australian public about tolerance of outbreaks because they will be inevitable.”
Professor Kelly revealed that Australia has recorded 140 cases of the UK strain and 25 of the SA strain, mostly in hotel quarantine. “It’s starting to become the largest proportion of the few cases that we’ve had but mostly they’ve remained in hotel quarantine,” he said.
The two chief health advisers also discussed vaccine hesitancy, with Dr Fauci saying that the desire to avoid further constraints on day to day life would be a major factor in driving people to get the vaccine and combating vaccine hesitancy.
Dr Fauci said that Australia was one of the US’s strongest research partners and the two countries were expecting to work together to stamp our COVID-19 in the Pacific.

Ellie Dudley 7.48am: NSW weighs lifting march numbers for Anzac Day
NSW authorities will consider raising the number of attendees at the ANZAC Parade this year from 5000 to 10,000.
Sydney received a march boost overnight, with the number of people permitted to participate going up from 500 to 5000.
Prime Minister Scott Morrison says he wants to see Anzac Day events return this year to the fullest extent that is safe after 30,000 people were allowed to gather at Mardi Gras at the weekend.
However, NSW Police Minister David Elliot said this morning that if 5000 people register for the event “we will do another COVID plan and increase it to 10,000.”
“I want to make sure the veterans are honoured and their loved ones are there to cheer them on during the sacred march,” he told Today.
He said ANZAC Day is the “most sacred” of this year’s national events and said authorities must “make sure our honoured veterans are given the opportunity to get together.”
Mr Elliot urged all veterans to register for the event to enable a COVID-Safe march.
“I’m concerned veterans are saying, “We won’t register, we will turn up,”” he said. “This is not about control. It is making sure we can trace you.”

Adeshola Ore 7.39am: Quad to hold first summit on Indo-Pacific region
Scott Morrison will participate in the first leaders meeting of the Quad framework on Friday.
The Prime Minister will meet virtually with his international counterparts from the coalition — US President Joe Biden , Japanese Prime Minister Yoshihide Suga , and Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi .
The strategic framework was first formed was formalised in 2007, but Friday’s meeting will be the first time the leaders of the participating countries meet.
The leaders of India, Australia, Japan and the United States will meet to address “regional and global issues of shared interest, and exchange views on practical areas of co-operation towards maintaining a free, open and inclusive Indo-Pacific region,” a statement by India’s foreign ministry said.
The summit will also cover supply chains, emerging and critical technologies, maritime security, and climate change.
White House press secretary Jen Psaki said the meeting would discuss a range of issues such as the threat of COVID to the economy and the climate crisis.
“That President Biden has made this one of his earliest multilateral engagements speaks to the importance we place on close co-operation with our allies and partners in the Indo-Pacific,” she said.
Trade Minister Dan Tehan said the quad’s elevation to leadership level was “historic.”
“The fact that Joe Biden has put this at the head of his multilateral agenda I think is incredibly significant.,” he told ABC Radio.
“The fact that Australia has a seat at the table at such an important meeting, I think, we cannot underestimate the importance of this.”
Mr Tehan said Australia was committed to ensuring that all countries in the Indo-Pacific would benefit from a free and open region.
“What this will be is very good, fruitful, open discussions on key issues for the Indo-Pacific, starting with COVID-19, measures to address climate change and also the issues around the supply of critical technologies,” he told Sky News.
Yesterday, the UK and the US issued a joint statement in London declaring a commitment to achieving net zero greenhouse gas emissions no later than 2050.
Mr Tehan said Australia was committed to a path to carbon neutrality through technology, despite not adopting a 2050 target.
“Through our technology roadmap, we’ve got very strong interest from the new Biden administration and from lots of other countries around the world about how we can work cooperatively to get the technology in place that will actually lead to emission reduction,” he said.
“We’re working with the rest of the world to say these are the technologies that will get you there and if we work cooperatively and collaboratively together we’ll all be able to meet the targets that we want to beat.”
Mr Tehan said the meeting will discuss “positive issues” and focus on “our agenda for a free and open Indo-Pacific.”
“This will be an absolutely historic meeting,” he told the ABC.
“Bringing together the leaders … to discuss the Indo-Pacific and, in particular, our agenda for a free and open Indo-Pacific … really shows that President Biden puts the Indo-Pacific at the top of the agenda.”
The United States will use the meeting to strengthen ties with key allies as China takes an increasingly assertive foreign policy approach in the Indo-Pacific region.

Ellie Dudley 7.02am: ‘Not much sympathy’ for Meghan, Harry
Queensland Senator Matt Canavan has said he “didn’t think there was a lot of substance” to the claims made by Harry and Meghan during their tell-all interview with Oprah Winfrey .
The Duke and Duchess of Sussex revealed in the interview questionable behaviours of the royal family, which the pair attributed their departure last year from the Palace to.
The pair alleged a failure from within to support mental health, especially Meghan’s suicidal thoughts and spurious claims that their son Archie was prejudiced against being titled as a ‘’Prince’’ because he was of mixed race.
Mr Canavan said that while “even rich people” have burdens to carry, the public will struggle to empathise with the pair.
“I wish them all the best, but, really, I didn’t think there was a lot of substance to the claims from both Harry and Meghan,” he told Today.
“I think the public has a hard task feeling all that sorry for two people living in a massive mansion in California doing very well.
“Everybody has their cross to bear in life, even rich people, I get that, but trying to say they deserve some kind of special attention or have a special burden, that seems a bit hard to swallow.”
Mr Canavan added: “They have done this interview while [Prince Phillip] is in hospital on potentially his deathbed. They’re asking for sympathy from others, but it’s not necessarily reciprocal here and that needs to be pointed out.”

Angelica Snowden 6am: Andrews in trauma care after holiday home fall
A seriously injured Daniel Andrews was transferred to Victoria’s leading trauma centre on Tuesday night after damaging his vertebrae and breaking several ribs in a heavy fall that required hospitalisation in intensive care.
Colleagues are concerned the Victorian Premier could face a lengthy period away from work after falling on the stairs of a holiday house, smashing his back and ribs, but will not know how long until further tests are taken.
Mr Andrews was moved from a private intensive care unit on the Mornington Peninsula late on Tuesday amid concerns about the severity of his ¬injuries. Sources said Mr Andrews fell on his back while negotiating a wet step, prompting him to be rushed to hospital. “This is a precautionary measure to ensure he has the most appropriate care available, given the nature of his injuries,” a spokeswoman said.
Mr Andrews was being moved to the trauma centre after doctors examined MRI scans.
He will likely be in intensive care for several days, where further tests will be conducted and painkillers administered after the mishap on Mornington Peninsula, south of Melbourne.
The government is unsure when he will return, but ribs can take weeks to heal and are notoriously painful. Back injuries can have longer term implications.

Ben Packham 5.45am: Hunt hospitalised, Reynolds ‘serious’, Porter on leave
Health Minister Greg Hunt has been admitted to hospital with a suspected infection, making him the third cabinet minister to have fallen sick, after Defence Minister Linda Reynolds and ­Attorney-General Christian Porter took time off for health reasons.
Mr Hunt’s office said he was being kept in hospital overnight “for observation and is being ­administered antibiotics and fluid. The minister is expected to make a full recovery. His con­dition is not considered to be ­related to the (COVID-19) vaccine,” which he received on ­Sunday.
On Tuesday, Scott Morrison described Senator Reynolds’ heart problem as “quite serious”, amid speculation she may not ­return to her position as Defence Minister.
The Prime Minister said he was not concerned about having two members of cabinet’s ­national security committee on leave — Senator Reynolds and Mr Porter — “because I have highly competent ministers that are taking over their duties”.

Richard Ferguson 5.30am: Urgent warning on Chinese-backed email hack
Cyber-security officials are urging Australians to immediately secure their digital networks after a major Chinese infiltration of Microsoft’s email systems, warning too many of the nation’s businesses are exposed to attacks.
US President Joe Biden is setting up an emergency task force after the tech giant revealed a Chinese state-backed hacker group, known as HAFNIUM, had exploited vulnerabilities in its ­Exchange systems, which allow businesses and governments to store emails.
Amid fears 7000 servers in Australia and more than 30,000 in the US are affected by the threat, the Australian Cyber ­Security Centre on Tuesday urged the Morrison government and the states to urgently “patch” their email networks and protect them from state actors who sought to make use of the Microsoft vulnerabilities.

Full text: A 20KM travel limit is being considered for Melbourne’s new road map — due for release on Sunday — as commerce chiefs renew calls for small businesses to reopen.
Deputy Chief Health Officer Allen Cheng confirmed the controversial 5km zone could be expanded, but said a decision was yet to be made.
“We are looking at it, but the announcement will be on Sunday,” Prof Cheng said. “We’re looking at everything at the moment.
“We are running the models as we speak and they should be off the computer in the next day or so, it does take a little bit of time to do that. We are considering all sorts of things.” Business leaders ramped up their campaign against “extreme” measures to stop the spread of the coronavirus and pleaded for relief for retailers, cafes and personal service operators.
Business Council of Australia chief executive Jennifer Westacott said: “Extreme lockdowns and border closures are papering over the urgent need for a workable plan to live safely with this virus.
“We all recognise that in the long run there can be no trade-off between health, social and economic recovery, but our strategy must deliver on all fronts, or it will fail.” Ms Westacott said Victoria needed to “lead” and bring forward its timetable to ­reopen.
University of Melbourne epidemiologist Tony Blakely also backed an easing of ­restrictions.
“We need to pick those things that give us some sanity and normality,” Prof Blakely said.
“The 5km has to go — whether that be 10km or completely. Picnics of up to 10 people, having people over to your house but just use the backyard. We know it doesn’t spread outside much.” It came as Premier Daniel Andrews’ electorate office in Noble Park was again targeted by vandals.
Police are investigating the incident after “sack Dan” was sprayed in red, twice, across the front windows.
It’s the second time in three weeks his Princes Highway office has been targeted, but this time the vandals also smashed the front window. Half a brick could be seen lying on the footpath nearby.
Mr Andrews said on Thursday that none of his staff were put in danger and were all doing fine.
“What I’d say to those individuals and all Victorians is graffiti doesn’t work against this virus, it simply doesn’t,” he said.
Victoria had six new cases and no deaths on Thursday, keeping the number of fatalities at 816. The rolling case average for the state was 9.6, for Melbourne it was 8.9 and for regional Victoria 0.6.
There have been 15 mystery cases during the same 14-day period. They were recorded across 13 postcodes including Altona North, Reservoir, Braybrook, Ashburton and Ashwood.
Active cases dropped to 175 and there are 21 people in hospital. alexandra.white@news.com.au
WHAT RESTRICTIONS MELBURNIANS WANT EASED “We definitely need to remove the 5km rule, I don’t think it was necessary. Businesses need to open, we need to open ASAP. We need to be able to see our families and go for a walk beyond 5km.” REBEKAH TARCA, 28, NARRE WARREN “As long we’re going for eradication, which it seems we are, we need to stay as is. I think we need to stick to the modelling.” JUSTIN McSTAY, 22, SURREY HILLS We need to ease the restrictions but I understand that we can’t go into having no restrictions at all. I definitely would like the 5km rule removed so we can see our loved ones.” TORI CAMPBELL, 24, MITCHAM “Restaurants need to be open inside as well, or they won’t survive, with registration of customers who socially distance. The 5km rule needs to be eased too.” GARRY DOWEL, 66, SURREY HILLS
WHICH RESTRICTIONS COULD/SHOULD GO MELBOURNE was due to move to the third step out of lockdown on Monday — but has not hit the required case targets to do so.
The government will still announce some easing of restrictions on Sunday, having hinted that while social measures could be relaxed there isn’t much relief for businesses.
These are the predicted moves and which restrictions two leading experts — Australian National University epidemiologist Peter Collignon and University of New South Wales infection prevention expert and member of the World Health Organisation, Mary-Louise McLaws — believe are safe to ease.
SOCIAL REMOVING 5KM LIMIT LIKELY Outdoor public gatherings increased to up to 10 people LIKELY Home visitors of up to five people from one household POSSIBLE, WITH SOME EASING EXPECTED
EXPERTS SAY: Relax most outdoor restrictions, including 5km travel limit, but no home visits.
PC: We know that if we are outdoors, the risk of spread is markedly lower. Curfews and 5km limits are a pretty broad brush — they might have some relevance if you have 700 cases a day (but not now).
MLM: If you’re going to allow anyone at home, it’s problematic. You could increase outdoors, but indoors increases amplification events because of low or poor ventilation. Outside, you’d have to make sure you kept the mask on but you do want to release the public from two months of lockdown fatigue. I think the 5km could be extended (in distance) as long as people are wearing masks.
EDUCATION Schools reopened for all students.
YEARS 8-10 TO RETURN FROM OCTOBER 26
EXPERTS SAY: Allow all children back to school, but no parents gathering. PC: We know being with younger children is much less of a risk than being with adults in their 20s and 30s. Any benefits from closures in decreasing community spread is very low, compared to the medium and long-term detrimental effects on children and their families.
MLM: The group that causes the increased risk are the parents. Parents cannot be anywhere near the campus — that has to stop. Children from the age of 14 start responding to COVID-19 like adults, so you’ve got to keep teenagers in early high school away from other people’s parents as well.
BUSINESS Restaurants and cafes allowed to have seated service — predominantly outdoors — with limits on group numbers (10), indoor patrons (20) and outdoor patrons (50) LIMITED CHANGES Retail reopens, including hairdressing and beauty services UNLIKELY Outdoor real estate auctions allowed, subject to gathering limits UNLIKELY
EXPERTS SAY: Shopping should be permitted using QR codes/keeping visitors details for contact tracing and with capacity limits. Allow outdoor dining, but only in small groups.
PC: What greatly increases the rate of spread are crowded indoor venues, shouting and singing. Alcohol ingestion additionally decreases people’s adherence to physical distancing.
MLM: Dining could be allowed outside but not inside. This is the time for Melbourne to show off how innovative and creative it is. Go and do some retail therapy with your mask on, but use your QR code every time. It’s all about not amplifying clusters.
SPORT AND RECREATION Outdoor contact and non-contact sport for U18s LIKELY, BUT COULDBE LIMITED Outdoor non-contact sport for adults, with gathering/density limits, outdoor skate parks open, outdoor fitness (10 people) POSSIBLE EXPERTS SAY: Outdoor exercise and activities such as boating and fishing should be permitted, with masks and social distancing.
PC: We should scrap most outdoor restrictions regarding travel and activities where you remain in small groups irrespective of case numbers as the risk of transmission is so low.
MLM: Exercising outside is fine … everybody around the world is fed up with joggers pushing particles out onto pedestrians. We have to ask them to jog away from pedestrians.
CEREMONIES 10 people, including the couple and witnesses, at weddings UNKNOWN Up to 20 people allowed at funerals UNKNOWN Up to 10 people at outdoor religious gatherings, plus a faith leader, facilities open for private worship for households or household bubbles, plus a faith leader UNKNOWN
EXPERTS SAY: Outdoors but in small groups only.
PC: The virus spreads predominantly by droplets to people close to someone who is infected. We need to ensure that whatever restrictions are in place are proportionate to the amount of transmission occurring.
MLM: Things such as weddings, funerals and religious ceremonies cannot occur for a long time yet. These settings tend to congregate people close to one another, they get huggy and are close.
TRAVEL AND ENTERTAINMENT Intrastate travel NOT ALLOWED Outdoor entertainment venues and spaces open with density quotients UNLIKELY Accommodation venues open with household bubble UNLIKELY
EXPERTS SAY: Only when cases get to an average of five per day. Entertainment venues to remain shut.
PC: You may be able to travel but stay within greater Melbourne for a while. If you’re travelling with your family, you’re not going to come into contact with anyone else. MLM: Leave (travel and accommodation) until your case numbers are less than five. If authorities think those regional areas — outside of the hot spots — have very low levels, then you don’t want people from Melbourne seeding (the virus). That sort of travel could be done by the locals themselves.

Full text: Long-term plans
With the number of active cases declining, I am hoping state and federal governments will collaborate on some common long-term plans allowing people back to work and borders and businesses to open.
I would much rather the government have a budget for a large team of qualified and trained staff in each state whose work is focused on immediate contact tracing and ensuring infected people are isolated, monitored and their personal needs met. I believe this is a better investment than keeping the economy closed/restricted and spending money to prop up businesses and extending JobKeeper payments.
Francis Chew, Camberwell
Systemic failures
Day after day we hear the increasingly querulous question: Who made the decision about private security at hotel quarantine? Even if there is an answer it brings us no closer to knowing what really matters: How was the decision implemented and who was responsible for the oversight of the implementation? Our collective failure to pursue these questions increases the likelihood that the failures in our systemic public health response to COVID-19 will continue.
Public policy implementation is difficult. One of the requirements is a committed public service that, at its core, values the importance of specialists who have an understanding of the interplay of social, cultural and ethical variables. It needs to be backed up by accountable political leadership. Simon Gardiner, Camberwell
Hollow mea culpa
It appears that politicians are not the only ones who can't be trusted ("Heat on Premier as hotel scandal claims top scalp", 13/10). Victoria's most senior public servant Chris Eccles didn't think it was necessary to tell the truth at the hotel quarantine inquiry, and now, conveniently for him, he says he was thinking of retiring anyway. His mea culpa therefore sounds hollow, especially in view of the retirement package he will undoubtedly take with him.
Helen Scheller, Benalla
Eddie's albatross
I'm a devastated Magpie supporter sleeping with a deliriously happy Cats supporter: my wife - mother of our ecstatic, Cats-supporting daughter; the mother of our four over-the-moon Cats-supporting grandchildren!
So as someone knowing great success (and failure) I say Eddie McGuire - after 21 years of great hoo-hah and expenditure warranting eight premierships (instead of a mere one) - should own his mistakes. If the captain of the ship chooses the wrong officers to man the bridge, and head up the engine room, then still sets sail into rough seas; then it's the captain's fault.
Should Eddie McGuire stay at the helm at Collingwood we'll see Collingwood's famous Magpie emblem morph into the shape of the bird the ancient mariners most feared at sea: the albatross.
Howard Hutchins, Chirnside Park
Promote responsibility
Victoria's Opposition Leader seems to be dancing on graves with his "flag-planting" stunt. Did he seek permission from the COVID-bereaved families? As most fatalities occurred in aged care, did he check whether relatives might blame the federal government?
Throughout this second wave Michael O'Brien has been divisive, disparaging and demoralising. No wonder a growing minority is disobeying. He has opposed legislation designed to manage infectious people who refuse to get tested or self-isolate.
The self-proclaimed party of business and personal responsibility is not doing much to promote either. We all have responsibilities to beat this virus - corporates, customers and politicians.
Joan Reilly, Surrey Hills
Therapy required
We've been under stage four lockdown for months and as the case numbers have dwindled to almost nothing, I am appalled to see that most allied health face-to-face sessions are still banned. My son is seven and needs to see a speech therapist but he must continue to do so via telehealth. This is ridiculous and not in line with the needs of children.
It is ludicrous and unkind to restrict a child from receiving medical or developmental support. And the telehealth experience is shocking, with glitches and all sorts of irritating aspects, such as not hearing one another or delayed replies. This is speech therapy - we need to understand one another clearly and see the position of the mouth. Therapy needs to go back to normal.
Andreia Brodsky, Ormond
Taxpayer funds
The rorting of JobKeeper by corporations that used the bailout to pay dividends and executive bonuses was condemned by everyone, except perhaps the federal government. Now the government is organising a repeat performance with businesses being able to claim the full amount of an asset as a tax deduction in the first year.
The government specifically wants large overseas-owned and headquartered companies included in the scheme. Australian taxpayers' money will then be used to pay bonuses and dividends to overseas shareholders and executives. Government support was not possible for overseas students and workers trapped in Australia by the pandemic but it is possible for foreign-owned corporations that sometimes have billions of dollars in reserve.
Peter Martina, Warrnambool
Voters ignored
The elephant in the room - the government isn't offering support for anyone it doesn't think will vote for it anyway, arts, universities, working women, part-time workers, pensioners - forget it.
Stuart Gluth, Northcote
Liberal thoughts
Members of the Coalition government view the study of liberal arts as serving no practical purpose. Well may they point to their Minister of Education, Mr Tehan, and rest their case. A BA (Hons) at Melbourne University should surely aspire to prepare its graduates for liberal thinking and leadership.
Now there is a meeting of minds between the heirs to Robert Menzies' party of enlightened liberalism and the most anti-intellectual elements in the Parliament. I may have missed it, but I have not seen or heard a critique of the new, ultra-utilitarian taxonomy of higher education objectives from any of the commentators whose public careers were built on their scholarship in the disciplines of philosophy, politics and history.
Frank Hurley, Alfredton
Auditing fine print
Disclosed in the fine print of the budget papers is a matter of profound concern, the reduction in funding to the National Audit Office led by the independent Auditor-General. Given the scale and scope of the budget deficit the withdrawal of about $15 million is a trivial amount, yet many investigations normally planned cannot now occur. It thus appears the issue is not financial but rather the desire to silence an objective, independent observer whose observations can cause embarrassment and discomfort to incompetent ministers.
Incompetent ministers will be shielded from competent investigators. The same reasoning is behind the failure to set up a comprehensive anti-corruption commission. John Miller, Toorak
Protest tactics
While not everyone will applaud the tactics of protesters at the University of Queensland, the target, our government's inhumane treatment of refugees, seems to be the only issue unaffected by COVID-19. I find it appalling that the government is even now unable to show the slightest humanity to people who must be suffering immensely, physically and mentally, even if they are allowed to keep their phones. If not humanity, perhaps practicality may appeal to Peter Dutton and co. The government needs to save money, the country needs more people. The "crime" of these people is being on the wrong side of what is arguably the most inhumane policy ever instituted by a supposedly liberal democracy.
Terry Bourke, Newtown
Years of inaction
Eight years of LNP inactivity has put Australia in a much worse position than it should be regarding emissions reduction. With no policy framework despite all industry bodies calling for certainty we have seen a 50 per cent reduction of investment in renewables.
The Paris agreement was shown with the subsequent IPPC reports to be an inadequate target due to the political compromise forced on Paris by the big polluters.
COP26 to be held in November next year will certainly demand a more rapid reduction target to address the climate emergency. It's up to Morrison to explain to the Australian people what action he intends to take until the election. Australia should listen to the scientists at COP25 and join with other leading nations to demand real action on global warming to achieve zero net emissions by 2050.
Dr Colin Hughes,
Doctors for Extinction Rebellion
A third wave
In his article ("Where to now for Melbourne?" 13/10) Professor Tony Blakely, an epidemiologist at the University of Melbourne, provides welcome data on COVID-19 modelling in Victoria. He indicates that we can expect a 10 per cent chance of a third wave by Christmas if we release restrictions when we have an average of 10 cases a day and a 3 per cent chance of a third wave if we release at five cases a day. Elimination of the virus is not achievable.
The white elephant not mentioned, but a key factor causing COVID spread, is the behaviour of people. This includes the flaunting of restrictions. While the government is under constant surveillance for any bad COVID-related decisions, there appears to be little onus or disincentive for people who are the instruments of spread.

Full text: ANGER is growing across ­Victoria amid fears many harsh lockdown rules will continue for weeks.
Retailers, restaurateurs, business chiefs and community leaders are up in arms after Premier Daniel Andrews warned on Saturday that his target for reopening the city would not be met by October 19.
Two weeks after saying ­restrictions could be rapidly eased and a major reopening milestone moved forward a week, Mr Andrews conceded he would now be unable to do that. But prominent industry figures are calling for the stage four lockdown to be eased.
“I think it is unlikely that we will be able to (announce) as big a steps as we would have hoped to take next Sunday,” Mr Andrews said.
“We can’t have a situation where because we want it to be over, we pretend that it is. The last thing that I will sign off on is doing what might be popular, and what might perhaps please some, but steps that are not safe, that will set us back.” It comes two weeks after the Premier said: “We are well on track. In fact, we are ahead of time when it comes to achieving that outcome.” Victorian Chamber of Commerce and Industry chief executive Paul Guerra said: “Victorian businesses are ready to open under COVID- safe plans, and want to get going on October 19.
“We have to learn to live with the virus and let Victorians get back to work.” A top epidemiologist behind government lockdown modelling said Victoria must learn to live with coronavirus and “hope” contact tracing had ­improved dramatically.
Melbourne University public health specialist Tony Blakely, whose research was used by the Andrews government to justify its extended lockdown, said: “We can’t really ask for God to help us, but we can ask for contact tracing to help us.
“So we really hope, we assume, that the contact tracing has improved dramatically.” Restaurateur Chris Lucas, CEO of Melbourne’s largest restaurant group Lucas Restaurants, urged the Premier to open up Melbourne.
“The longer Mr Andrews continues with this draconian lockdown, the more damage he will be doing to the mental health and wellbeing of thousands of young hospitality workers,” he said.
Janet Rosenberg, president of St Kilda’s Acland St Traders Association, said: “We are all desperate to be open again. Everyone’s going stir-crazy and people want to get back to normal as soon as possible.” On Saturday, Mr Andrews promised that a “substantial” easing of restrictions would be announced next Sunday, though he is yet to provide businesses or frustrated Melburnians with details.
“Based on the daily average … it is likely not to be low enough for us to do all the things that we have foreshadowed,” Mr Andrews said. “But we will do some of them and they will be significant.” After another 14 COVID-19 cases were confirmed on Saturday, Melbourne’s rolling 14-day average number of new daily cases remained stuck on 9.5 — well over the average of 5 needed to end Melbourne’s lockdown.
There are also 10 “mystery” cases remaining where authorities cannot determine the cause of transmission — double the number allowed under Mr Andrews’ road map to end stage four restrictions.
Despite the higher numbers, the government will this week determine which measures can be relaxed.
While Mr Andrews said it was too early to reveal whether Melbourne’s restaurants and cafes would soon be open for outdoor dining, he confirmed the vastly different risk profile between indoor and outdoors settings was “front of mind”.
However, he said it was ­impossible to give businesses advance warning either way until a detailed examination of how the latest cases had spread.
Chief Health Officer Professor Brett Sutton said it was clear recent transmissions had occurred between families, within households and at open workplaces, potentially allowing for consideration of an ­increase in outdoor ­activity.
“It is absolutely the case that outdoors will be prioritised in all of the activities that we look to open up over time,” Prof Sutton said. Asked directly about the “5km rule”, he said that could be re-evaluated.
Lord Mayor Sally Capp said: “I have been consistently calling for our city to be allowed to reopen. Businesses should be allowed to trade in a COVID-safe way to revitalise our city.” Lord mayoralty candidate Arron Wood said: “Every week that we’re closed means more businesses won’t come back.” mandy.squires@news.com.au

Full text: FORMER health minister Jenny Mikakos has claimed Victoria is “well on the way” to eradicating COVID-19 — despite the government repeatedly claiming it wanted only to suppress the virus.
Ms Mikakos caused a stir on Monday with the tweet that cast doubt over the state’s coronavirus strategy.
“I am saddened to see more lives lost, my sympathy to their families. But I’m so pleased to see how low the numbers are. I’m so proud of Victorians and so grateful for the sacrifices made to get us to this point. We are well on the way to eradication,” she tweeted.
Premier Daniel Andrews — who has not spoken to Ms Mikakos since she resigned on Saturday — has persistently denied pursuing a controversial eradication strategy.
Asked about the tweet, he again said authorities were trying to suppress the virus.
“I have answered this question many, many times. That (eradication) is not the strategy,” Mr Andrews said.
“The strategy is to suppress this virus and that’s the National Cabinet decision.” It comes after Australia’s Chief Scientist Alan Finkel said Victoria’s problem-plagued contact-tracing system should be able to keep up with the falling coronavirus caseload as Melbourne reopens.
Dr Finkel, who this month led a delegation of Victorian officials to NSW to study its system, said Victoria’s system was “significantly more capable” now than when it was “overwhelmed” at the start of the deadly second wave.
He told the ABC last week that while it was “not where we want it to be” yet, he was “much more comfortable” with a process that was being digitised from test results to alerting close contacts.
“The improved system should be able to cope to keep us at low levels even if we come out of lockdown,” he said.
After Mr Andrews eased restrictions on Sunday, the federal government said it was “important that more be done in the weeks ahead” and called on Victoria to review its triggers to move to future stages.
It noted NSW was fundamentally open when it had similar case numbers. Victoria recorded five new cases on Monday, three of which were linked to aged care and two to health services.
It left the state with 359 active cases and a rolling 14-day average in Melbourne of 20.3, which must fall below five a day for the state to move to the next stage of restrictions.
A Herald Sun analysis shows by comparison, NSW had 419 active cases on May 15 and a rolling two-week average of 2.7 when it allowed five visitors to homes and 10 in cafes and restaurants.
By June 1 — when regional travel was allowed, 50 people could dine at venues and beauty salons reopened — NSW had 363 active cases after a 14-day average of 1.3.
That was at the end of the state’s first wave, and it has since been able to remain open even as daily case numbers reached double digits, particularly during July and August.
Deakin University epidemiology chair Catherine Bennett said NSW had managed to control the spread of the virus and remain open by using its “follow, chase” system.
She encouraged Victoria to use its new model created by the Burnet Institute to chart how removing restrictions would affect case numbers.
“Our old modelling was very conservative,” she said.
Prof Bennett said Victoria was now “suppressing risk of transmission, not actual virus” and if mystery cases remained below 10 per cent, there was no reason for tight restrictions.

Full text: Victoria's coronavirus restrictions are set to be relaxed earlier than anticipated and primary school students will be back in the classroom sooner under the government's revised lockdown plan.
But for those who break the newly relaxed set of rules, the penalties will be tougher, with fines of almost $5000 in place for illegal gatherings - more than the fine for drink-driving and more than triple the previous amount.
While announcing the latest phase in the easing of restrictions yesterday, Premier Daniel Andrews also confirmed the axing of Melbourne's controversial 9pm-to-5am curfew, which faced a Liberal-backed legal challenge in the state's Supreme Court this morning.
Mr Andrews said the government's only consideration for moving to the next step in the easing of coronavirus restrictions would be case numbers, with metropolitan Melbourne on track to reach its next target of fewer than five cases per day some time in October.
"We believe we will be able to take that important step on the 19th of October," the Premier said at his 87th consecutive daily press conference, adding the government would wait at least three weeks between each step.
"We are so close, so, so close to beating this thing," he said.
The announcement came after a week in which Mr Andrews lost his fourth minister in a year with the resignation of health minister Jenny Mikakos, who quit after the Premier gave evidence to the state's hotel quarantine inquiry saying she was responsible for the botched system that led to the state's devastating second wave of coronavirus.
Melbourne could take a further step in the easing of restrictions on November 9, two weeks earlier than planned, when public gatherings could lift to 50 and interstate travel would almost certainly return if the 14-day average daily case number reaches zero. Business owners and industry group heads such as Australian Retailers Association chief executive Paul Zahra criticised Victoria's new road map as still too slow. Mr Zahra said he was "deeply concerned" non-essential retail would remain closed until at least mid-October.
"That is simply too close to Christmas trading to allow viable retail activity," he said.
Epidemiologists widely supported the government's commitment to a more nuanced approach to evaluating restrictions by focusing on the story behind each positive case.
The government released modelling yesterday showing a move to a NSW-style set of restrictions today would have resulted in a 41 per cent chance of a third wave within four weeks.
Adopting NSW's restrictions on September 14 - when Melbourne's stage four was originally due to end - would have brought an 86 per cent chance of a third wave, it found.
Melbourne's controversial curfew, which was set to be debated in a Supreme Court case from today, will lift but the five-kilometre limit on movement will remain in place.
Murdoch Children's Research Institute modelling prepared for the government suggested the risk to students is likely lower than previously estimated, meaning the government will allow all primary school students to gradually return to campus from October 12 - an advancement on previous plans for only prep to grade 2 and VCE students to come back.
Aspiring Liberal MP Michelle Loielo's case against the government's 9pm curfew was scheduled for the Supreme Court today, where she intended to argue it was disproportionate and violated Victorians' human rights.
Three weeks after sparking controversy around the curfew by admitting it was not his idea, Chief Health Officer Brett Sutton yesterday announced he did not believe the curfew was proportionate.
"If you take today's 16 cases, 15 of them are linked to known cases, clusters and outbreaks ... that is a very different situation to where we have been in recent weeks," he said. "We always said that aged care cases would be a stubborn tail of this epidemic curve. That remains the case ... and a curfew doesn't address that transmission risk, obviously."
Professor Sutton said the curfew would be replaced by a fine of almost $5000 for illegally gathering. Comparatively, first-time drink-driving offenders receive a fine of up to $3200, while speeding more than 45km/h over the limit attracts a $826 fine.
Melbourne University epidemiologist Tony Blakely welcomed yesterday's "extremely good" announcements and said it was the right time to remove the 9pm curfew. "Given where we're at, I think having the curfew was eroding public trust," he said.
Epidemiologists earlier this month warned the government should not keep Melbourne under tight restrictions because of outbreaks in aged care and healthcare settings.
The Premier announced that the lifting of limits on workplaces will mean 127,000 Melburnians can return to work from today.
Supermarkets and food distribution centres will return to full capacity, while abattoirs - the site of multiple large outbreaks in Victoria - will increase "in line with levels we know are safe".
Sole traders doing gardening can return to work and outdoor pools will reopen from today. Golf courses will stay shut until at least October 19.

‘Elimination’ looks possible

Full text: A JAMES Cook University professor says new figures have indicated COVID-19 is on track to die out.
The Peter Doherty Institute-led study has found the reproduction number of the disease was below one, meaning every infected person was infecting less than one other person on average and the virus was on course to die out.
This news comes as Townsville remains free from new COVID-19 cases. It was more than a week ago when the last case was reported and there are only three active cases remaining in the Townsville region.
On Thursday, the Australian Chief Medical Officer Professor Brendan Murphy said if the reproduction rate stayed below one, it was estimated the epidemic was in decline.
JCU professor of infectious diseases epidemiology and modelling Emma McBryde, who was part of the study, said the analysis produced broadly consistent results that the effective reproduction number was likely less than one in New South Wales, Queensland, South Australia, Victoria and West Australia as of April 5.
The Australian Institute of Tropical Health and Medicine professor said all three methods used indicate that the COVID-19 epidemic was being suppressed strongly to achieve a reproduction rate below one.
Prof McBryde said the exception was Tasmania, with outbreaks in hospitals in the state’s northwest.
“If current measures were sustained indefinitely, and in the absence of imported cases or localised clusters, suppression in Australia is achievable, and down the track, elimination may be achievable too,” she said.
The researchers provided estimates of the percentage of people with active COVID-19 symptoms who were being discovered through testing.
“As of April 2020, the estimate of the symptomatic case detection rate for Australia is 93 per cent,” Prof McBryde said.
She added this was an excellent result, and among the best in the world. “It means that we can afford to relax the most stringent lockdown measures in the near future,” she said.Prof McBryde said completely controlling the virus would still take many months.

Full text: I DON’T get it. The seven pages of “modelling” belatedly released by the Morrison Government doesn’t justify what looks like a drastic over-reaction.
Remember the Medical Journal of Australia’s prediction that our emergency wards would be overrun by coronavirus victims by last Sunday?
The government cancelled all elective surgery to free up more beds, yet fewer than 100 coronavirus patients now lie in the 2200 emergency beds we started with.
Around the country, just 112 people caught the virus in the 24 hours before 6am yesterday. The death toll yesterday was still just 49 — when three weeks ago we were warned it could hit 150,000.
Yes, I know about Italy. I know about New York. I know this virus is dangerous. That’s why I supported the early restrictions, and called for more flight bans two weeks before the government imposed them.
But at some stage soon we must accept a win and start gradually easing these bans, because the price of fighting it this way comes at a horrendous cost in jobs, money and freedom.
Of course, I may be missing critical information that justifies government claims that we need these bans for six months — or else.
That’s why the modelling is so important. That’s what the politicians supposedly relied on. But looking at that seven-page handout, and supporting documentation from the Doherty Institute that cites Chinese data, I think we’re being snowed.
Some graphics in the handout are from a couple of days ago. One, warning of 35,000 deaths as the “best case scenario” if the virus is “uncontrolled”, comes with a warning: “Artificial … Doesn’t reflect current state in Australia.” The last of the seven pages promises “the focus of future modelling is based on real world Australian data”.
Well, look at that data.
In Victoria, the one state that releases such information, the number of people actually sick plummeted from 620 on April 1 to 494 on Tuesday.
In Australia, we had 49 deaths by yesterday, compared to the 1255 who died in the 2017 flu season.
Back then, we locked down just the nursing homes. This time we’ve locked down all homes, even though this virus has killed no Australians under 55 and the 2017 flu killed 21 people under 44.I don’t get it. At what stage is this terrible pain still worth the gain?

Full text: Australians face a “rapid and explosive resurgence” of coronavirus if unprecedented national restrictions are relaxed, leaders warn as they nervously eye the Easter break.
Prime Minister Scott Morrison said previously secret modelling released yesterday showed authorities had bought valuable time. But he warned early gains must not lead to complacency.
“We are on the right track.” Modelling showed in the “incredibly unlikely scenario” it spread without intervention, up to 23 million Australians could have contracted it with 38 per cent needing medical care and 35,000 people needing an intensive care bed.
Experts from the Peter Doherty Institute, who prepared the modelling, warned relaxing existing restrictions would result in a “rapid and explosive resurgence” of the virus.
University of Melbourne epidemiologist James McCaw said the number of new cases would decline as restrictions were enforced, but that the population was “still largely susceptible” to the virus.
Mr Morrison said the modelling was based on international data and did not predict how many Australians would fall ill but it proved the theory of “flattening the curve”.
But the early “modest” success in Australia, with fewer than 6000 positive cases and low levels of community transmission, had so far provided researchers only limited homegrown data, which authorities need before they can begin considering any roll-back to social distancing rules and border controls.
“This type of work, particularly when we get more of the Australian case data, it will help us plan the way out,” he said. “For now, and certainly over weeks ahead, we must continue to do what we are doing.” Mr Morrison and Queensland Premier Annastacia Palaszczuk urged people not to ruin the downward trend and bunker down for a usually a jam-packed Easter long weekend.
Mr Morrison warned now wasn’t the time to become complacent. “Failure to do so this weekend would completely undo everything we have achieved.
“All the things we’ve been asking you to do, day in, day out, they apply, especially so this long weekend.” BULLETIN VIEW, P16

Full text: Australian woman Imogen Carr’s New York life is shutting down around her.
Isolated in a small Brooklyn apartment block, she’s been told by her doctor (via a messaging app) that she has symptoms of the devastatingly infectious virus that has driven New Yorkers off the once thronging streets.
But she can’t get a test. Without being badly ill, “no one can get tested in this city”, she says. “I haven’t touched a human in a month, and I probably won’t for another month. My entire social network has become digital.” Among the city’s more than 1400 dead is an acquaintance from her local gym. A friend of a friend has succumbed as well. “We are all going to know someone who dies from this,” she says.
Densely populated New York is feeling the greatest pain now but the virus is seeping across the country. The White House has acknowledged that between 100,000 and 250,000 Americans could die from COVID-19.
American epidemiologist and former World Health Organisation program director Dr Gary Slutkin says the impact on the nation’s psyche will be ‘‘devastating’’. ‘‘There is still tremendous denial within the country, and several states that are taking the wrong decisions, or being way too slow,’’ he says. It’s a profound shock, particularly to the country’s middle, upper and government classes.
‘‘The US feels that it knows better, it always feels it knows better and it wants to tell the rest of the world what to do,’’ Slutkin says. But that’s been a costly error in this pandemic. “Not being able to tool up with widespread and systematic testing, that was a massive mistake.”
In Britain the news grows darker by the day. On March 5 the UK had no deaths from the virus. By April 2, the number of deaths had risen to almost 3000, from around 34,000 documented cases (a case fatality rate of just over 8.5 per cent).
In Australia, the nation’s doctors, health workers, public health advisers and politicians are asking themselves a profound question: will we be spared this wave of death?
Already our case numbers have surged past 5300, yet as of yesterday fatalities were still pegging below 30. This, coupled with an apparent slowing in the rate of new infections, drew cautious optimism from federal Health Minister Greg Hunt earlier in the week. “To Australians, I want to say thank you,” he declared. “These early promising signs are your doing.” Deputy Chief Medical Officer Dr Nick Coatsworth stressed that “our death rates are lower ... our hospitalisation rates are lower and our number of community cases are lower”.
Coupled with that, the US was finding one positive for every two tested, while in Australia it was only three out of 100 – testament to our much more extensive testing regime.
Prime Minister Scott Morrison also hailed the fact that our COVID-19 infection growth was now in the single digits. “Had the virus kept growing at the same rate it was 12 days ago, we would now have more than 10,500 cases in this country,” he said.
Yet Allen Cheng, professor of infectious diseases at Monash university and an expert adviser to the federal government, warns against drawing too much comfort from our early figures. “The key is to keep an eye on the unlinked cases, the cases where you can’t work out where they’ve come from,” he says. “If we start picking up a lot of [those], then there is a big iceberg there and we need to work out how big it is.”
One of the most striking features of the pandemic is the huge variation in rates of death and severe disease across the globe. Countries doing better than most include the East Asian grouping of Taiwan, Hong Kong, Singapore, Japan and South Korea. Germany has also kept a firmer lid on its death rate (around 1 per cent of its reported cases thus far). Italy and Spain, however, are undergoing horrors familiar to anyone following the nightly news: many thousands of dead in each country, makeshift morgues in churches and ice rinks, hospitals overrun, even reports in parts of Spain that the elderly have been left to perish in their beds.
Italy’s death rate is 12 per cent, Spain’s 9 per cent.
This puzzling variation in death rates is explained by a broad range of factors. The most significant is how widely a country is testing, and whether it is screening people of all ages and those who have mild as well as severe symptoms. In the UK, for instance, testing has been limited to those hospitalised with the disease.
“If you only test cases that look like they are COVID-19, then you are going to get an extremely high mortality rate,” says the director of the ANU’s school of demography, Professor Heather Booth. “If you have a high testing regime like in Australia, [and] you’ve picked up lots of cases, many of which are mild, your case fatality rate will be low.”
UNSW infection control expert Professor Mary-Louise McLaws says the US death rate is “biased by a number of serious cases that have died very early on, representing an older group that have a lot of comorbidities”.
Stanford University epidemiologist Professor John Ioannidis has expressed frustration at the extreme disparity in the testing data from different countries. “Given the limited testing to date, some deaths and probably the vast majority of infections due to [the virus] are being missed,” he wrote recently. “We don’t know if we are failing to capture infections by a factor of 3 or 300.”
Cheng agrees that the relative youth of Australian cases detected so far is holding down our case fatality rate. Leaving aside the passengers from cruise ships, “most of the cases have been travel-related and [those] travellers tend to be younger, people under 50, and the death rate and mortality is much lower in that group’’, he says.
But that could change “quite sharply” once the disease impacts more on older Australians. Here and elsewhere, aged care facilities have already emerged as hot spots.
“The other factor that often makes the death rate look quite low early on is that some of the people that have just got infection may still go on to die,” Cheng adds. “That’s really important at the very start of an outbreak – the death rate looks artificially low because the time to death is several [two to three] weeks.” Eventually around 20 to 30 per cent of those in intensive care will end up losing the battle against the virus.
A recent paper from Oxford University’s Leverhulme Centre for Demographic Science highlights the far greater fatality rates among older people. Using Chinese data, they calculate a death rate of just 0.4 per cent in the 40 to 49-year group, compared with 14.8 per cent among those aged 80 and over. Macquarie University’s professor of demography, Nick Parr, says most Australian cases have been in the large urban centres, where population age structures are lower than in other parts of the country. “This may also affect the extent to which cases are translating into deaths,” he believes.
But country or city age profiles don’t necessarily point to similar outcomes either. In Italy, around 23.3 per cent of the population is aged over 65. In China, it’s around 12 per cent, and here it’s around 15 per cent. In Japan more than 28 per cent of the population is aged over 65 – yet its pandemic experience is far milder than Italy’s.
So there are a multiplicity of other factors that also bear on the variation in death and severe disease rates between different countries. Among them are geography and density of population. Culture has a role, as does patterns of cohabitation between older and younger generations (Italy is a standout for high interactions between adult children and their parents).
How far the pandemic has progressed is another key determinant, as is the speed and effectiveness of initial responses and mitigation measures, such as closing borders, preventing mass gatherings, social restrictions, contact tracing and enforcement of quarantine and isolation regimes.
Italy, says Cheng, did not lock down until 800 deaths. “By then there would have been a whole lot more community transmission,” he says.
The surge capacity of a nation’s health system is also critical for keeping deaths down, as intensive care units get flooded with patients struggling with severe pneumonia. Japan and Germany, for instance, both boast better resourced hospitals than many other countries. According to Bloomberg, Japan has around 13 hospital beds for every 1000 people, more than triple the capacity of Italy, the US and the UK.
Other cultural factors in Japan may also be helping to “flatten” the pandemic curve. The habit of mask-wearing is firmly established, as is hand washing. Kissing, handshakes and hugs have not traditionally been part of how the Japanese interact socially.
It is also not clear from some countries’ reporting how many COVID-19 victims are dying with co-morbidity, which might have killed them anyway.
Gary Slutkin believes Western populations have, in general, been slower to heed the warnings of public health officials than those in the East.
“The Eastern mind is much more communal, the Western mind is much more individual,” he says. “In East Asia, their [government] systems are organised and generally speaking more efficient.”
But former British journalist turned Singapore-based academic James Crabtree, an associate professor in the Lee Kuan Yew School of Public Policy, plays down culture as a factor. Both he and Slutkin highlight the fact that countries such as Singapore, Hong Kong, Taiwan and South Korea were already primed to battle the COVID-19 pandemic after experiencing the scares of SARS [severe acute respiratory syndrome] and MERS [Middle Eastern respiratory syndrome] in 2003 and 2012.
“They are rich countries, with recent experience which the West has not had for a very long time,” says Crabtree of the East Asian group. “They have thought about it thoroughly, they have built institutions, they have stockpiled.”
By contrast many Western democracies “have under-invested in the kinds of state infrastructure that you need to handle one of these things’’, Crabtree says. “It’s less about are countries Eastern or Western, are they democratic or autocratic, it’s more about the capacity of the government.”
Australia can draw some comfort from its geography and relative lack of density compared with a city such as New York, according to Booth.
“We have space on our side,” she says. “I don’t mean the entire country. I mean Australia has been built with the luxury of space. We don’t have the cramped conditions that one has in other countries like Italy, and the UK ... When I go to Britain I stay in what is a small market town and go to a pub ... it’s that cosy feeling that we enjoy so much in a social environment ... Australia doesn’t have that, we just want to sit in big, characterless rooms, but they have actually been an advantage to us.”
Fellow demographer Nick Parr agrees that “Australia as a whole, it has one of the lowest population densities of any country in the world’’, but points out that Singapore, like New York, also has a population living in very close quarters. “[So] it would be overly simplistic to say that population density is a major or determinative factor.”
In Italy, the “high degree of residential proximity” between adult children and their parents is likely to have fed the flames of the pandemic, according to detailed research from the Leverhulme Centre in Oxford. “Even when inter-generational families do not live together, daily contacts among non-co-resident parent-child pairs are frequent,” the team, lead by Jennifer Beam Dowd, stated recently. In other words, the Italians really like living with and hanging out with their old folk.
Sadly, that otherwise laudable trait seems to have made their elderly much more vulnerable to transmission from younger adults carrying the virus.
“We think many young people who are infected may be asymptomatic or show mild symptoms,” Dowd says. “We think it is possible that in Italy, younger workers from Milan who commute home to smaller villages and live and eat in multi-generational households could have hastened the spread.”
Others point to dysfunctional government and the deep distrust that has engendered as a partial explanation for Italy’s slowness to recognise the danger in its midst.
The extreme partisan divide in the United States has not helped public health messaging in that country either, as a recent article in The Atlantic graphically illustrated. Under the headline “The Social Distancing Culture War Has Begun”, the writer observed a group of elderly Republicans on an Atlanta golf course making “a show of shaking hands, and complaining loudly about the ‘stupid hoax’ being propagated by virus alarmists”.
It’s difficult to see people with that mentality accepting the US government’s move to now recommend the wearing of face masks. Speaking to Science magazine several days ago, head of the Chinese Centre for Disease Control George Gao said the US and Europe had made ‘‘a big mistake’’ in discouraging the wearing of masks, because droplets could be transmitted when people were speaking, not just coughing.
Testing remains key to controlling the outbreak here. As Slutkin says, “if you feel like you are overdoing it as a country or a city, or even as yourself, then that is the right feeling. Then overdo it some more.”
Cheng says there is an effort now to “plug” any holes in surveillance and “look at a different risk group” as Australia’s testing regime pivots away from travellers and towards community transmission.
McLaws remains optimistic we will not become like Italy or the United States. She regrets we did not close our borders earlier, when we had around 100 cases on March 11. Nevertheless, she welcomes the slowing in the rate of new cases in Australia. “I think in about nine days’ time we may be able to start having a quiet smile to ourselves [that] we’re on a trajectory downwards,” she says.
Cheng is more guarded. Modelling is under way for a range of “scenarios”, he states. “We could be Italy, we could be South Korea, we could be Germany, we could be the United States, we could be any of these countries and we are going to prepare for all those things.
“We are not looking like Singapore, unfortunately.”
Why not? “Because we have more cases and it’s rising quicker than it is in Singapore.” Nevertheless, he adds, “I would be cautiously optimistic. But there is a long way to go yet.”
Back in New York, 33-year-old architect Toshi Woudenberg, stricken with COVID-19, is hunkering down in his digs on top of a noodle factory in Bushwick. “I’m scared man,” he says. “Hearing about the shortage of ventilators and the lack of hospital beds. They are bringing in the hospital ships. It’s not like we didn’t have months to prepare for this. People understand there’s real panic, and that’s pretty demoralising.”

Full text: The huge variations in COVID-19's rate of death and severity across the globe have Australian experts asking: will we be spared a wave of death? Deborah Snow, Rachel Clun and Angus Thompson report.
Australian woman Imogen Carr's New York life is shutting down around her. Isolated in a small Brooklyn apartment block, she's been told by her doctor (via a messaging app) that she has symptoms of the devastatingly infectious virus that has driven New Yorkers off the once-thronging streets.
But she can't get a test. Without being badly ill, "no one can get tested in this city", she says. "I haven't touched a human in a month, and I probably won't for another month. My entire social network has become digital." Among the city's more than 1400 dead is an acquaintance from her local gym. A friend of a friend has succumbed as well. "We are all going to know someone who dies from this," she says.
Densely populated New York is feeling the greatest pain now, but the virus is seeping across the country. The White House has acknowledged that between 100,000 and 250,000 Americans could die from COVID-19.
American epidemiologist and former World Health Organisation official Dr Gary Slutkin says the impact on the nation's psyche will be "devastating".
"There is still tremendous denial within the country, and several states that are taking the wrong decisions, or being way too slow," he says. It's a profound shock, particularly to the country's middle, upper and government classes.
"The US feels that it knows better, it always feels it knows better, and it wants to tell the rest of the world what to do," Slutkin says. But that's been a costly error in this pandemic. "Not being able to tool up with widespread and systematic testing, that was a massive mistake."

Victoria in a state of 'new normal'

Full text: The Andrews government believes Victoria has reached a stage of social and economic shutdown that will enable the health system to withstand the COVID-19 pandemic and avoid a large-scale loss of life.
Sources in the Department of Premier and Cabinet confirmed that, unless the rate of infections dramatically rises, the stage-three restrictions which came into force at midnight yesterday will be the "new normal" for Victorian life while the virus runs its course.
Although it is likely that further businesses will be forced to shutter their operations as the local epidemic unfolds, Premier Daniel Andrews yesterday shifted his rhetoric from previously warning that further restrictions were inevitable.
Asked whether an additional shutdown stage would be required, Mr Andrews indicated this would only become necessary if people failed to observe the current regime or the number of new infections started to climb.
"Will there be a fourth step? I can't rule that out," Mr Andrews said. "So long as we see people doing the wrong thing ... as we see additional cases, each day then we're going to have to consider taking next steps."
The subtle change in message, along with renewed expressions of optimism from Commonwealth and state public health experts advising the national cabinet, signals a steep change in the pandemic policy
response.
Victoria's Chief Health Officer, Brett Sutton, said the measures now in place, if adhered to by the public, could "completely flatten the curve", the predicted course of the epidemic. He said infections in Australia might total just 15,000 - a fraction of last year's 217,000 recorded cases of influenza.
Mr Andrews said that, at present, there was no need to declare a state of disaster and enact further emergency powers.
"If everyone follows these rules and they are as simple as they can be, then we will slow the speed of this virus. We will save lives, we
will protect our health system,
we will get through this together and we will get to the other side of it quicker," he said.
Professor Sarah Wilson, the head of the Melbourne School of Psychological Sciences, told The Age the shift in public message, combined with Victoria's incremental cessation of social and economic activity, would help people adjust to the restrictions.
"In order to help people maintain what is a fairly strict or draconian set of changes, that message that what we are all doing is working needs to be very loud and strong," Professor Wilson said. "That is what will help us maintain this behaviour.
"Witnessing from afar, in horror, what was first going on in China and then in Italy and now in the US and other places, was this shattering of optimism. What the government is doing, I think very successfully, is helping us rebuild that sense of optimism.
"It is unreasonable to expect certainly, but if there can be some sense that maybe we will stay in this pattern of stage three for a period of time, that will help."
Victoria has for all intents and purposes entered a pandemic lockdown, with the outlawing of social gatherings and advice that people should remain in their homes unless they need to go out to buy food or medicine, exercise or work.
Breaches of the restrictions are punishable by on-the-spot fines. People aged over 70 have been told to place themselves in self-isolation.
The new regime, which Victoria adopted ahead of other states, comes as the rate of new infections in the state and nationally continues to fall. Victoria recorded 56 new COVID-19 cases yesterday, bringing its total number of cases to 821.
Modelling of the likely spread of the virus in Victoria by Melbourne University epidemiologist Tony Blakely indicates the success of policies designed to suppress the rate of infection could delay the peak of the epidemic until late June. This would mean stage three restrictions for at least three months.
Professor Wilson said while the restrictions were in place, it was imperative for people to access health services. There is growing concern within the national cabinet that suicide and other harm caused by economic and social dislocation could kill more people that the virus.
"Now, more than ever, we need to encourage people to access mental health services so that the loss of life via those mechanisms doesn't outweigh the pandemic," he said.
