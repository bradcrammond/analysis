Full text: VICTORIA’S supercharged vaccine rollout has halved the number of people expected to die from Covid-19 before the end of the year, as new modelling shows a much lower risk of the hospital system being overwhelmed.
The Burnet Institute on Sunday updated its modelling – used to inform Victoria’s road map – also predicting a much lower hospital admission rate than first forecast.
It found that although case numbers were likely to peak at a seven-day average of 3850 in mid-December, the chances of the healthcare system becoming overwhelmed has dropped from 63 per cent to 23 per cent.
Experts said that was in part due to younger people being infected, as they tended not to become as sick and spent less time in hospital.
Chief health officer Brett Sutton said on Sunday the fast vaccination rate had also played a big role in reducing pressure on Victorian hospitals.
“With high vaccination coverage the health system will have significant challenges but it will cope,” Prof Sutton said.
Initial modelling from mid September predicted 2202 Covid patients would die between July and December but that has been revised to 1212.
As of Sunday, 144 Victorians had died with the virus this year. “In the weeks and months ahead, we will see a peak in cases and we will see a peak in the number of people who are in hospital,” Premier Daniel Andrews said.
“And we will see people lose their lives to this … They’re not numbers, they’re people.” Mr Andrews said it was “positive” that while case numbers were higher than authorities would have liked, the average length of hospital stays and the “acuity of illness is substantially less”.
It comes as new data shows the average age of people who have died with coronavirus in Victoria has fallen from 85 last year to 74 this year. And despite an 85 per cent drop in fatalities overall this year, more people aged 40-49 and 50-59 died of Covid in 2021.
Prioritising elderly Australians early in the vaccine rollout has been fundamental to reducing death rates, and the average age of victims, following disastrous nursing home outbreaks last year.
However, experts say the continued rates of death and severe illness among younger Victorians highlight the ongoing threat of Covid, even after the 80 per cent vaccination target is reached.
University of Melbourne Professor of Epidemiology Tony Blakely said Covid was increasingly spreading among younger people because “they’re not vaccinated yet, or just getting vaccinated, and they’re out there sick of complying” with restrictions.
He said modelling showed that even at 90 per cent vaccination coverage, the virus will spread “quite easily” if all restrictions such as density limits in venues and masks on public transport are lifted.
“You simply can’t get to a level with this virus, and the vaccines we currently have, where transmission is stopped. It’s just impossible,” he said.
While restrictions will be further eased at 70 per cent than originally planned, the Burnet Institute modelling showed if all freedoms planned for 80 per cent were brought forward, cases could peak at 4900 on December 12.
It would also increase the chance of the hospital system being overrun to 40 per cent, and the number of deaths would increase to 1373. mitch.clarke@news.com.au

Full text: Victoria has recorded a spike in hospital cases as well as a surge in people in intensive care and those on ventilators.
Authorities on Thursday announced 564 people were in hospital — a rise of 39 from the previous day.
There was also a rise in the number of people in intensive care and on ventilators.
The state now has 115 people in intensive care after 21 more were added to the list, and also 21 more people on ventilators, bringing that number to 74.
It comes as the state recorded 1638 new Covid cases, along with two more deaths.
The state’s active caseload now stands at 15,074 after more than 77,000 Victorians were tested for Covid on Wednesday.
There are currently 564 people in hospital with Covid, including 115 in ICU and 74 on ventilators.
Of the people in hospital, 66 per cent were unvaccinated, 27 per cent were partially vaccinated and 7 per cent were fully vaccinated.
More than 35,000 vaccines were administered by state-run centres in the past 24 hours.
Currently, 83.6 per cent of eligible Victorians have received a single vaccine dose with 54.5 per cent fully vaccinated.
It comes as NSW unveiled changes to its roadmap out of lockdown after the state reached its 70 per cent fully vaccinated milestone on Wednesday.
TWO REGIONS COULD BE FREED Authorities are discussing whether Shepparton and the Moorabool Shire will be able to leave lockdown.
Both areas were plunged into a seven-day lockdown last week, as cases grew.
Acting chief health officer Professor Ben Cowie said the government would likely make a decision within the next day.
“We will be consulting with the local public health unit colleagues there who have the on the ground intelligence and variance of what is happening. That decision hasn’t been made. We will review all that and obviously give an announcement either way tomorrow.”

BREAKDOWN OF THURSDAY’S CASES • 566 in Melbourne’s northern suburbs (43 per cent of all active cases)
• 485 cases in western suburbs
• 351 cases in south east suburbs
• 114 cases in eastern suburbs
• 115 cases in regional Victoria (707 of 15,074 total active cases are outside Melbourne)

VICTORIA ‘ON TRACK’ DESPITE CASE SPIKE Victoria’s path out of lockdown remains “on track” despite recent record daily case numbers, according to a top Burnet Institute professor.
Mark Stoove, head of public health at the medical research institute, said the roadmap was not at risk of alteration.
“The numbers that have been coming through over the last week or so have been high and they’ve been stabilising between 1000 and 1500,” Prof Stoove told Today.
“But it is well within the bounds of our modelling … I don’t see any reason why the government would want to change its roadmap at the moment.”
Prof Stoove said he expected to see daily case numbers decline over the next week or two.
“Our latest look at the data in NSW actually suggests that the comparable vaccine coverage we’ve got in Victoria at the moment was clearly responsible for the bending of the curve in NSW,” he said.
“I think Victorians should be reasonably optimistic about where we’re heading at the moment.”
EYES ON LATROBE Authorities remain concerned about Victoria’s Latrobe Valley, which has experienced a rise in cases.
Professor Cowie said a local lockdown should help stop cases from spreading in the region and buy contact tracers more time.
“Extended lockdowns in regional areas, as is the case of metropolitan Melbourne going forward, I think are going to have to become increasingly rare,” he said.
“The way we bring it forward and do it safely is to get as many people vaccinated as we possibly can right now.”
JAB BOOST FOR PEOPLE WITH DISABILITIES Vaccination rates among Victorians living with a disability are lower than the general population, at 84.4 per cent.
Disability and Aged Care Minister Luke Donnellan said from October 8, all state-run vaccine hubs would provide vaccinations to people with disabilities without a booking.
A further 10 dedicated disability vaccination pop-up centres will be available in Covid hotspots this month.
“That will be those where we see hotspots, low vaccination rates, we’re going to go out and we need to keep pushing, harassing and just non-stop getting these vaccinations rates up for the community living with disabilities,” Mr Donnellan said.
“It’s just not acceptable where it is at the moment. We can’t open up when we’ve got people living with disabilities, with vulnerabilities, if they’re not at a higher rate of vaccinations.
“And that’s what we’re pushing to do today. These 10 dedicated disability vaccination pop-ups build on the priority access already available across many vaccination centres with enhanced accessibility and pop-ups.
“Disability friendly drive-through clinics and a dedicated new low sensory site at La Trobe University. This is on top of the two disability worker vaccination blitzes we’ve had over the last couple of months.”

CLUSTER LINKED TO BIRTHDAY PARTY Students from several schools in the Essendon area, including a Catholic girls’ school, have tested positive to Covid after blatantly breaching health directions by attending a birthday party.
It’s understood the group of students attended the party in the past week.

Vic Locally-acquired Covid-19

SWEDEN HALTS MODERNA USE IN YOUNG Sweden’s Public Health Agency has recommended a temporary halt to the use of the Moderna Covid-19 vaccine among young adults, citing concerns over rare side effects.
Neighbouring Norway and Denmark reiterated that Moderna’s vaccine was not recommended for under-18s.
Sweden’s health agency said the suspension concerned anyone born after 1991 and should initially be in force until December 1, explaining that it had received evidence of an increased risk of side effects such as inflammation of the heart muscle (myocarditis) and inflammation of the pericardium (pericarditis).

NSW REVEALS CHANGES TO ROADMAP NSW Premier Dominic Perrottet has announced students across the state will return to school by October 25 as he unveiled several changes to the state’s roadmap out of lockdown.
With the state reaching 70 per cent of its eligible population aged 16 and older fully vaccinated against Covid-19 on Wednesday, Mr Perrottet said he was able to announce the easing of several restrictions, including increased capacity at weddings and funerals.

GRIM STATISTIC FOR MELBOURNE’S CBD Office occupancy in Melbourne’s CBD has dropped to its lowest level on record as workers opt to work from home during the city’s sixth lockdown.
A Property Council survey, released on Thursday, found occupancy was just 6 per cent in September, down from 45 per cent earlier this year.
“No part of Melbourne has been harder hit by the pandemic than our CBD. Many businesses have closed, office occupancy and vacancies are at record high levels and the CBD is on life support,” Property Council Victorian Executive Director Danni Hunter said.
“The City of Melbourne has done everything it can to keep the city alive as workers, tourists and students have been forced to stay away and our iconic retail and hospitality sectors have had to close their doors.”
Ms Hunter said initiatives such as vaccination hubs and testing sites at workplaces, lifting of work from home directions and a minimum three-day-a-week return to the office once vaccines targets are met should be used to entice workers back to the city.
“We need people back in the city as they are the lifeblood of Melbourne and support our businesses. The hybrid working model is here to stay and it’s great to have flexibility to work from home but there’s also no substitute for being together to collaborate and exchange ideas and knowledge,” she said.
“The CBD won’t bounce back of its own accord. It will require proactive action by the state government working in tandem with the City of Melbourne and business to revitalise the CBD over the coming 12 months as we switch our mindset from survival to revival.”
Ms Hunter said Melbourne’s central city economy supported 500,000 jobs and produced about 7 per cent of Australia’s GDP and 25 per cent of Victoria’s GSP at its peak.

CHILDREN’S HOSPITAL ON ALERT None of the children in the Royal Children’s Hospital cancer ward have tested positive to Covid yet, chief executive Bernadette McDonald revealed.
It comes after a parent visiting the Kookaburra cancer ward tested positive to the virus, placing staff, patients and visitors into quarantine.
The hospital executive told 3AW 12 patients across the entire hospital, including 8 who are receiving care through the hospital in home initiative, have Covid.
But she emphasised none of those patients were on the cancer ward.
“These patients have come in positive, they’ve not necessarily been admitted for Covid and have been admitted for other reasons.”
Ms McDonald said that while their cancer patients are at a “higher risk” they are “reasonably confident” the other children weren’t exposed to the parent on the ward due to their infection control measures.
“Our precautions are a lot better than a supermarket,” she told the program.
“We believe we have contained the outbreak.”
She said there are currently no Covid patients in ICU but revealed the hospital had treated Covid patients in the ICU ward before.
“We have had some covid cases in ICU,” she said.
Ms McDonald said vaccination was not a requirement for parents to visit the hospital, but their staff would be covered by the mandatory healthcare vaccine requirement beginning on October 15.
“But we’re really happy to say at least 90 per cent of our staff are fully vaccinated,” she said.
She said they were working to facilitate and encourage immunisation with staff yet to have their jab.
Ms McDonald said the hospital’s Covid screening protocol allowed for one parent or carer to accompany children into the hospital.
“But that does allow ­exposure sites to happen and that’s what’s happened in this case,” she said.
“We are finding the balance between allowing mums and dads and carers to come in … (it’s) a fine balance between ­­restricting visitors and not having any visitors or parents at all.”
Children undergoing cancer treatment are at an increased risk of severe illness from Covid, raising fears about the potential dangers of a hospital outbreak.
But the patients in the RCH’s oncology ward are among the most protected ­because they receive care in ­individual infection-controlled rooms.
The latest exposure is among three recent Covid scares at the hospital’s surgery, intensive care and cardiac wards caused by infected parents and guardians, none of which have led to bigger outbreaks.
Professor Cowie said the positive case linked to the Royal Children’s Hospital cancer ward was concerning.
“Any outbreak in a healthcare facility is a concern,” Professor Cowie said.
“The department, and particularly all of our health services, have done a huge amount of work to both manage the risk as far as possible.”
NED-4292-Percentage-of-eligible-population-fully-vaccinated-by-state
A private hospital has also stopped receiving new mental health patients while isolating those already admitted after a staff member tested positive to Covid-19 last week.
A Healthscope spokesman said it was believed a Northpark Private Hospital staff member was infected outside the hospital, with one patient testing positive since.
“As a consequence, a number of patients and staff at the hospital have been isolating as close and secondary close contacts,” he said. “There are currently 11 patients in the mental health ward, five of whom are in isolation, with one having subsequently tested positive.
“All the patients are being supported by psychologists on site, and their treatment courses are being continued wherever possible.”

INDUSTRIES PUSHES FOR RAPID TESTS Victorian businesses want a rapid antigen test trial ­immediately rolled out across critical industries, and quarantine orders reduced, in a bid to keep the state’s supply chains moving.
The state government announced on Wednesday that almost 2.2 million rapid antigen tests would be rolled out across the healthcare system before extending to schools, childcare and corrections.
But key industry figures want the fast tests widely distributed, and isolation protocols revised to promote certainty ahead of the state reaching key vaccine targets.
It follows calls to reduce the strict 14-day isolation requirement, with up to 100,000 Victorians trapped in their homes at any one time.
The two-week quarantine impost is wreaking havoc on key supply chains, with food producers and abattoirs and Melbourne’s ports struggling to keep operations afloat.
“This is going to cause further unnecessary delays in our supply chain and will no doubt impact on businesses and therefore consumers in the lead-up to Christmas,” Australian Industry Group Victorian head Tim Piper said.
“The isolation constraints that we currently have need to be relaxed in all supply chains to ensure we don’t have these artificial barriers.”
Victorian Transport Association chief Peter Anderson ­labelled the state’s supply chains “fragile” amid the growing list of exposures.
“As vaccinations steadily increase, the government needs to urgently reassess isolation requirements for essential freight workers so Victorians can have confidence access to essential food, fuel and medicine won’t be compromised,” he said.
Victorian Farmers Federation president Emma Germano said the industry had already been plagued by worker shortages, and that the public health ­orders needed to be reflective of the individual risk.
“This is a real concern and we need a more sophisticated and nuanced approach.”
National – 2021 – Covid Vaccination Stats
Victorian Chamber of Commerce and Industry chief executive Paul Guerra said the current measures needed to be “urgently addressed”.
“We are seeing similar ­issues, as occurred in Shepparton, across the state now as case numbers climb and essential businesses continue to be treated as Tier 1 or Tier 2 ­exposure sites, regardless of whether staff and customers are fully vaccinated or if there was any transmission of the virus at the premise,” Mr Guerra said.
The state’s largely closed hospitality industry would also be left devastated if staff were constantly “thrown into 14-day isolation periods”, Restaurant & Catering Australia chief executive Wes Lambert said.
“Victoria needs to look at adopting a more sensible risk category system that allows people’s vaccination status to actually mean something. We have to let the vaccines do their job and let the economy reopen for good,” he said.
Health Minister Martin Foley has flagged that isolation requirements could be overhauled for more settings in a matter of weeks.

CONFUSION OVER UNIVERSITY HOUSE PARTIES Lockdown parties with up to 40 guests have been occurring at a popular university apartment complex during Victoria’s sixth lockdown.
UniLodge in Bundoora told the Herald Sun they had been given the green light by the Department of Health to host events, gatherings and parties during lockdown. But the department maintains the events did not fall in line with current restrictions.
The most recent party at the RMIT Bundoora Walert House was held last week to celebrate a birthday, it is understood.
Concerned residents have raised the alarm about the daily gatherings after two residents tested positive to the virus earlier this week.
It is not known if they attended the most recent event, but the entire apartment complex has been urged to get tested as a precaution, according to emails from management.
One resident, speaking on the condition of anonymity, said parties were a weekly occurrence, while pizza and movie nights, craft afternoons and barbecues happened daily.
“It poses an unacceptable risk to the public and could easily cause a superspreader event that increases infections in the community,” the resident said.
Common rooms remain open during lockdown while masks and social distancing are “strongly recommended”. Residents can still gather even after the curfew for events held inside the building.
A leaked email to residents, seen by the Herald Sun, said residents could gather in large groups as long there are no nonresidents in attendance.
But a Department of Health spokeswoman said indoor gatherings, including in residential settings, were a breach of the rules.

Full text: TOWNSVILLE mayor Jenny Hill is unwilling to declare a climate emergency after scientific modelling predicted several of the city’s suburbs to be inundated by 2100.
Concerned about modelling on the Coastal Risk Australia website showing that melting glaciers and ice sheets could make the sea level rise by 0.84m by 2100, a climate expert warned last week that future generations and local councils would pay the price. Townsville tide comparison 2021-2100
CQUniversity Adjunct Professor of Environmental Geography in the Research Division Steve Turton urged Townsville City Council to follow Noosa Shire Council’s lead in declaring a climate emergency “to bring their residents on board to prepare for a very different future”.
Well aware of the threat posed by climate change, Cr Hill wasn’t prepared to make an emergency declaration, saying it would be “superfluous”.
She said the right way forward was to concentrate on practical solutions relating to the building designs and the council’s vision for a renewable energy driven future.
Much like how building requirements changed after cyclones devastated Australia, she wanted to see building code legislation adapted in line with the changing climate.
Instead of having homes built on pads which concentrated the flow of floodwaters, she suggested we embrace the approach of the city’s forefathers by building houses on stilts.
The mayor disagreed with the assertion that local councils would carry the financial burden of a retreat from the coast, saying coastal inundation would be a nationwide problem for the federal government to address.
Cr Hill said Townsville could be part of the emissions reduction solution by harnessing the new energy economy.Townsville south tide comparison
“If we’re going to make a real dent in carbon dioxide emissions, we need to invest in new technology to run manufacturing,” Cr Hill said.
“As a city, we are uniquely positioned to take advantage of new energies such as solar and hydrogen, thanks to the development of the Lansdown Eco-Industrial Precinct.
“We can bring manufacturing jobs into the area with renewable energy production.”Townsville north tide comparison 2
A fortnight ago the Lansdown Eco-Industrial Precinct had its first development application approved by TCC with Edify Energy’s proposed 1GW green hydrogen production plant as well as a behind-the-meter solar photovoltaic and battery storage facility at the precinct. Edify’s initial plans involved generating green hydrogen from a pilot scale facility of 10MW and increasing capacity in stages to meet the needs of a growing domestic and export green hydrogen market.
As part of the Townsville City Deal, the federal government has pledged $12 million to match the state government’s funding for the Lansdown Eco-Industrial Precinct.

Fair go demanded for NQ’s hydrogen projects A STATE minister has called on the federal government to make sure North Queensland’s emerging hydrogen centres are not being overlooked as locations for future hydrogen projects.
On Monday, Federal Minister for Energy and Emissions Reduction Angus Taylor announced an additional $150 million for a further two locations under the Clean Hydrogen Industrial Hubs program.
He said the program would enable the rollout of hydrogen hubs across seven priority regional sites, before naming Gladstone as Queensland’s prospective location.
The Queensland government’s Minister for Energy, Mick de Brenni, was concerned by the decision not to mention Queensland’s other emerging hydrogen centres, including Townsville and Mackay.
He wrote to Mr Taylor noting a “concerning pattern” appearing to emerge where NQ renewables and hydrogen projects were being excluded from federal government funding opportunities.
“I am concerned because of the signal this may send to investors about the Australian government’s posture towards projects in Northern Australia, and in this case particularly, Townsville,” Mr de Brenni said.
In the guidelines for the Hub Development and Design Grants, the federal government considered the seven locations to be “priority prospective hub locations, based on interest of industry and the location’s existing capability, infrastructure and resources”, before adding that applications weren’t restricted to these locations.
Mr Taylor said there were active industry players in Townsville looking to build up hydrogen capabilities.
“Developing a clean hydrogen industry in Australia could create around 8000 new jobs, many in regional areas, and generate over $11 billion a year in GDP by 2050,” Mr Taylor said.
“The Clean Hydrogen Industrial Hubs program is open to any location in Australia, so we encourage groups across Australia to show the merits of their hub and apply, including those in Townsville.”
Federal Herbert MP Phillip Thompson said work was progressing well on Townsville’s bid to become a major hydrogen producer, with the region well placed to take advantage of the funding.
He met with representatives from Ark Energy, Copperstring 2.0 and Townsville Enterprise on Thursday morning to discuss hydrogen production opportunities.
“We are putting together a strong consortium with good governance to be able to enhance our ability to be a leader in hydrogen production, and will meet with key players tomorrow,” Mr Thompson said.
“There have been seven Hydrogen Hub locations announced – these are just the first seven.
“Even still, applications for Hydrogen Hub grants don’t actually have to be from the nominated locations, so we’re not taking our foot off the pedal.”
Twice the Covid jabs planned for rugby double-header TWO pop-up vaccination clinics will appear in Townsville’s CBD to coincide with Saturday’s rugby union double-header.
The Townsville Hospital and Health Service (THHS) revealed that one clinic will be based at the northern entrance to Queensland Country Bank Stadium and the other at the Stanley St end of Flinders St as part of Townsville City Council’s Townsville Eats – Rugby Championship Edition.
THHS chief executive and keen rugby fan Kieran Keyes said the initiative, delivered in partnership with the Townsville City Council, was the health service’s first time bringing vaccinations into the community at a major event.
“We know locals love their footy, so we thought we’d capture all of the avid rugby fans and give them the chance to get vaccinated against Covid-19 at the same time,” Mr Keyes said.
“Each pop-up will have eight nurses and one administration officer, and all people need is to have their photo ID and Medicare card on them.
“Anyone over 12 can get vaccinated at either of these pop-ups and they don’t need an appointment.”
He said each pop-up had the capacity to vaccinate 200 people on Saturday.
On Monday he confirmed that appointments weren’t needed to attend their West End vaccination centre.
Rugby Australia Chief Executive Andy Marinos said the vaccination plan was a terrific initiative from the Queensland government.
“We’re delighted to host the clinic at Saturday’s double-header for the people of Townsville,” Mr Marinos said.
“Initiatives like the walk in on Saturday at Queensland Country Bank Stadium as well as the Queensland government’s STEP UP and Make the Choice campaigns will support Queenslanders in getting vaccinated, to ensure life returns to normal as fast as possible.”
Mundingburra MP Les Walker said the nurses would be vaccinating from 1.30pm to 8pm at the Stanley St end of Flinders St and from 3.30pm until 8pm at the northern entrance to the stadium.
“If you’ve been meaning to get the vaccine but haven’t had the chance yet, this might be perfect for you,” Mr Walker said.
“We are so lucky in Townsville to be able to host large football games such as this and getting the vaccination ensures we can continue to do things like this in our region.
“I know other regional centres such as Mackay and Rockhampton had good success with boosting their vaccination numbers at recent sporting events and I have high hopes that these pop-ups will do the same for Townsville.”
Herbert MP Phillip Thompson said Townsville had the second highest vaccination rate for a regional city in Queensland, behind Cairns.
“So as the Wallabies try to beat Argentina, let’s beat our northern neighbours by rolling up our sleeves at the same time,” Mr Thompson said.
Townsville Mayor Jenny Hill said the council, through the Townsville Local Disaster Management Group (TLDMG), was a strong supporter of the Townsville Hospital and Health Service’s efforts to get locals vaccinated against Covid-19.
“We will continue to provide assistance where we can,” Cr Hill said.
Addressing the media last week, Mr Keyes lamented that their dedicated Covid-19 vaccination centre in West End had never reached its capacity of administering 2000-3000 doses a day.
He believed that the lack of local Covid cases had created “a touch of complacency”.
“If people are waiting for Covid to come to Townsville before they get vaccinated, then they’re leaving it too late,” Mr Keyes said.
“It takes at least five weeks. If we vaccinated you today, it’s three weeks before your second dose of Pfizer, and another couple of weeks before you are fully immunoconverted so you’re able to be prevented from getting Covid-19.
“The community really needs to roll up their sleeves and push us to a limit so that we can get everybody vaccinated and protect ourselves against this pandemic.”
Covid jabs planned for rugby to lift Townsville’s vax stats FOOTY fans attending the Rugby Union double-header this Saturday at Queensland Country Bank Stadium will have the opportunity to roll up their jerseys to receive a Covid-19 vaccination.
While details are yet to be finalised, Townsville Hospital and Health Service chief executive Kieran Keyes confirmed plans for their vaccination team to be in action at the stadium.
The strategy aims to emulate the success experienced by trial pop-up vaccination clinics at NRL finals games hosted by Mackay and Rockhampton in recent weeks.
The decision to broaden Townsville’s vaccination strategy comes after a bittersweet Super Walk-in Weekend at Townsville’s vaccination hub, where Pfizer jabs were given to people without an appointment.
Mr Keyes said it was great to see more than 2,209 people receive their vaccinations – 706 on the Saturday and 1503 on the Sunday – but had hoped for a higher turnout.
“I was disappointed to see our northern rival, Cairns, trump us on vaccination numbers over the weekend,” Mr Keyes said.
“People no longer need to book an appointment to receive their vaccine. They can walk into the vaccination centre at West End at any time and I hope this removes any barriers for people hoping to get vaccinated.”
Forty per cent of people in Townsville are fully vaccinated and 56.2 per cent have received one dose with a total 101,676 doses administered by the Townsville HHS.
Premier Annastacia Palaszczuk said more than 56,900 Queenslanders were vaccinated over the weekend.
She said the state’s vaccination rate would be a key factor in determining whether borders could reopen and Queenslanders could see their interstate relatives for Christmas.
It is understood that the Chief health officer Dr Jeannette Young and Ms Palaszczuk have shifted in the past week to the 90 per cent vaccinated figure as their preferred threshold for opening up.
Mr Keyes said vaccination was critical if people wanted life to return to normal.
“Fortunately, we have not been greatly impacted by the effects of Covid-19 in Townsville but, unfortunately, I believe this is leading people to believe they don’t need to prioritise receiving the vaccine,” he said.
“The Covid-19 vaccine is how we ensure that our region doesn’t have to face the incredibly difficult impacts to business, mental health, and healthcare that other parts of Australia have experienced.
“There is a lot of noise out there in the community and on social media about the vaccine and much of it is not based on fact or science.”
He strongly urged people yet to receive their first Covid-19 vaccine dose to prioritise a discussion with their doctor.
“Medical professionals are trained to understand how vaccines work so if people do not wish to make it a priority to get vaccinated, at least talk to your doctor so any concerns can be allayed,” he said.

Economist’s Olympics petition demands fair go for NQ TIME is running out to sign an e-petition which draws attention to the negative impacts of hosting the Brisbane 2032 Olympics on regional Queenslanders.
Created in early July by regional economist Colin Dwyer, the Better Deal For Regional Queensland From Brisbane Olympics petition warns that Brisbane’s Games will cost billions in direct and indirect infrastructure that will likely experience large cost overruns, blowing out state debt that will increase taxes and levies.
With two weeks until the petition is tabled and debated in state parliament, it has 1561 signatures.
Mr Dwyer urged decision makers to genuinely consider all Queenslanders as the Brisbane Olympics starts to reprioritise public and private funds/projects, relocate skilled workers and recoup higher taxes.
“There are massive investment requirements for hosting the Olympics from new and refurbished stadiums and venues, to better transport facilities and athletes and spectators ­accommodation,” Mr Dwyer said.
“Holding minor events in regional centres will not offset the massive drain of skilled workforce from ­regions to Brisbane to build these ­facilities.
“Regional Queensland already struggles to get its priorities noticed. The Brisbane Olympics will see ­crucial regional priorities delayed or possibly cancelled.”
He said the repayment and net tax burden will disproportionately affect people in regional Queensland.
Townsville MP Scott Stewart ­responded saying the 2032 Olympics were an opportunity for businesses across the state to participate and compete and for our region to showcase its attractions to the world.
“Those opportunities are priceless. Townsville will benefit from the 2032 Olympics with our high performance facilities and world class stadium,” Mr Stewart said.
“There is the opportunity for teams to be based in Townsville prior to the Olympics as well as hosting football matches at Queensland Country Bank Stadium.
“As the former KAP candidate knows well, Townsville will play host to international rugby later this month, further showcasing our world-class stadium.”
He said the government recognised the need for the games to deliver a legacy for communities across the state, including Townsville.
“Also this month the Palaszczuk Government launched a supplier gateway for businesses to receive future updates about procurement,” he said.
“The Games will deliver economic and social benefits across the state, with more than $8.1 billion in benefits predicted.”

The Oasis Townsville reaps the benefit of Lamberts Fresh Produce’s 120th birthday THE snags were sizzling and the community spirit was overflowing when one of Townsville’s oldest businesses extended a hand of friendship to one of the city’s newest charities.
To celebrate their 120th birthday Lamberts Fresh Produce recently embarked on a week-long fundraising drive where they hosted barbecues, donated $1 from every pineapple sold, held meat trays, competitions, and collected donations.
The worthy beneficiaries were the The Oasis Townsville, a local charity which finds the best services in Townsville to support veterans integrating into the community.
The organisation officially opened their fit-for-purpose Townsville hub in June, which federal Herbert MP and veteran Phillip Thompson described as potentially “lifesaving”.
Lamberts Fresh Produce owners Michael and Christine Burge last week handed over a cheque for $14,425 to the charity.
“With the veteran community making up 20 per cent of Townsville and supporting a cause close to our hearts, we wanted to partner with the Oasis in their early stages and help them grow,” Mr Burge said.
“Lamberts aligns itself with The Oasis Townsville’s motto of needs that make you happy: something to do, someone to love, and something to look forward to.
“As these things often stem from family and food, it complements our core business perfectly.”
The Oasis Townsville chairman John Caligari was extremely grateful for Lamberts’ continuing support.
“These funds will help us make our home base with furnishing and decor to make all veterans and their families and friends feel at home,” Mr Caligari said.
“Thanks also to 4th Regiment who were on site directing traffic and carrying groceries for donations all week during Lambert’s 120th birthday celebrations.”
Lamberts employs more than 50 people, including 12 butchers, and operates seven days a week.

Finals success as Townsville lines up for more TOWNSVILLE has reinforced its credentials as a host for large scale sporting events after successfully staging the NRL finals double header at Queensland Country Bank Stadium on Saturday night.
A crowd of 18,244 fans was treated to a nail biter with the Sydney Roosters just holding on against the Gold Coast Titans 25-24, followed by a stunning 16-10 upset of the Penrith Panthers by the Sydney Rabbitohs.
A NRL spokesman said they were pleased with the crowd and atmosphere, “particularly given the Cowboys were not playing and the short notice for the game”, but didn’t address the largely vacant corporate section in the stadium.
With the threat of Covid-19 looming large over Brisbane and Premier Annastacia Palaszczuk warning that the next 24 hours were critical, NRL chairman Peter V’landys confirmed Townsville was the back-up option for the NRL Grand Final if Suncorp Stadium couldn’t host a suitable crowd.
Reflecting on Saturday night’s games, Townsville Enterprise CEO Claudia Brumme-Smith said it was a great opportunity for the community to cheer on four teams in two entertaining games showcasing the stadium at its best.
“We welcomed the NRL with open arms for State of Origin and we have done it again for the qualifying finals,” Ms Brumme-Smith said.
“Every time we see an event like this in our stadium it provides a significant boost to the city’s accommodation, dining, retail and more.
“It’s events like the NRL and upcoming Rugby Championships which are helping to prop up the tourism sector at a very difficult time.”
Townsville Mayor Jenny Hill said the NRL finals double header once again demonstrated that Townsville could successfully host major sporting events.
“We saw a crowd of more than 18,000 pack into our world class stadium for two exciting games,” Cr Hill said.
“The broadcast of the games also provided a platform to promote our exciting city to those watching in southern states still locked down because of COVID-19.
“Away from the stadium, we saw many of our local hotels and hospitality venues enjoy strong bookings and trade.”
She said this economic benefit to the community was why the council and its partners work so hard to attract and successfully host events like these games and the upcoming Rugby Championships double-header in a couple of weeks.
But it wasn’t all roses, with West End resident Gary Campbell blasting the inadequate public transport arrangements for the double header, complaining there weren’t additional buses.
“Public transport was a joke. There was a disconnect between what was needed and what was available,” Mr Campbell said.
“I estimated that there were over 200 people waiting for taxis. I ended up walking home from the city.
“We need to do a hell of a lot better than that in the future if we’re going to host large scale events like the Olympics.”

Full text: ANOTHER DAY, ANOTHER NEW AND DIFFERENT EXCUSE
LAGGING vaccination rates in poorer communities has become the Palaszczuk government’s latest roadblock to reopening under the national plan when 80 per cent of people are double-dosed.
In what was the government’s fifth different excuse for walking away from its pledge to reopen, Health Minister Yvette D’Ath raised the new jab concerns yesterday, just 24 hours after Premier Annastacia Palaszczuk claimed the state’s hospitals were not properly prepared.
Ms D’Ath also told Queenslanders they would need to wait for international travel to be trialled in NSW, though experts insist there is no reason why the Sunshine State cannot commit to reopening now. When asked if the state would reopen at 80 per cent, Premier Annastacia Palaszczuk’s office on Saturday said she was still waiting for “completed advice” from the Doherty Institute.
But that advice is done, with a federal government spokesman saying NSW, the ACT, NT and Victoria had released road maps.
“It is a matter for Queensland to articulate why they cannot make decisions based on the advice already provided to … other states,” he said.
Infectious diseases expert Paul Griffin said other states were implementing the same advice Queensland had.
“I don’t think we need to reinvent the wheel here in terms of questioning that ­advice too much,” he said.
Just days after Ms Palaszczuk contentiously asked why people would want to travel to India or Tokyo, Ms D’Ath on Saturday questioned why anyone would want to travel to Bali, which has had an average of 1900 cases daily for the past week.
“I have said continuously around the 80 per cent threshold that the Doherty Institute modelling is not just about percentage,” she said.
“It’s also whether, as a state, what’s the number of outbreaks you’ve got? Whether you are able to test, whether you are able to contract trace, whether you are able to isolate the virus and manage those things.
“I saw the reference to Bali … where people will be able to travel to Bali and back but may not be able to travel to Queensland. Can I say I don’t know if anyone wants to be travelling to Bali right now when they recorded 1693 cases two days ago.” It’s understood the Doherty Institute explained its update on the impact of Covid-19 spread if seven-day home quarantine was adopted during Friday’s national cabinet meeting.
The federal government spokesman said Doherty would continue to advise ­national cabinet in addition to the modelling that was ­finalised and adopted by all jurisdictions in September.
“Governments should hold up their end of the deal made with Australians, that if they get vaccinated they would be able to enjoy greater freedoms,” he said.
Assoc Prof Griffin said if Queensland delayed a decision there could be a “big lag” before it could be implemented.
“We do risk being significantly behind other states (in border reopenings),” he said.
Ms D’Ath said the government was not “closed off” to the idea of resuming international travel but the Commonwealth had to do more planning around what countries Australia opened up to.
Ms D’Ath said the 80 per cent vaccination rate figure was “one element” of the Doherty modelling.
She said the remaining unvaccinated 20 per cent “could be our remote indigenous communities, it could be our low-socio economic, it could be our multicultural communities that have a lower percentage of protection in their vaccination rates.”
LINES OF EVASION July 2 The plan The National Cabinet agreed to formulate a four-phase National Plan to transition Australia’s National Covid Response.
August 6 Scott Morrison says plan is agreed to: The National Cabinet agreed to adopt in full an updated National Plan, based on the Doherty Institute’s findings. This follows the National Cabinet’s agreement in principle to the updated National Plan on July 30.
August 16 A long way off the threshold that allows an easing of restrictions, the Premier said: “We are provided constantly with advice from the Doherty Institute and what (it) is saying is that 80 per cent national threshold is what we are aiming towards.”
August 17 Still discretion for specific lockdowns. Annastacia Palaszczuk said: “(The national cabinet plan) doesn’t say we are not going to have lockdowns, but that lockdowns will be minimised. That Doherty research starts from the premise that Australia is in a situation with very little Covid.”
August 24 Modelling predicated on different case numbers. Ms Palaszczuk said: “(The modelling used was) predicated on 30 cases across Australia, not 13,000. So I’m looking forward to seeing that modelling.”
August 28 Wanted “a look” at the new modelling. The Doherty Institute reiterated to national cabinet on August 27 that it would be safe to reopen the country once 80 per cent of over-16s were fully vaccinated – regardless of case numbers. A spokesman for Ms Palaszczuk said her government was yet to receive the paper and “looks forward to further discussions next week”.
September 1 Premier Annastacia Palaszczuk: “What’s going to happen to the children? We need to have further research done on what happens to the 0 to 12-year-old cohort as they remain unvaccinated.”
September 2 Worst case scenario Doherty modelling. Ms Palaszczuk said: “Doherty Institute modelling predicts that even with 70 per cent of the population vaccinated, 80 people will die each day from Covid once the outbreak reaches six months after it started. That is 2240 who will die each month.”
September 23 What freedoms or rewards would Queenslanders get? Ms Palaszczuk: “The national plan hasn’t been finalised, they’re still doing work. We’ve got another meeting next week so everyone can just hold off and calm down until next Friday.”
October 1 Hospital funding. Ms Palaszczuk: “I am not going to put Queenslanders at risk until ... a big injection of funds from the federal government into the states to make sure the hospitals are able to cope with the growth (in cases) that will happen.”
October 2 Vax rates. Yvette D’Ath said: “That 20 per cent ... could be our remote indigenous communities ... our low-socio economic ... that have a lower percentage of protection in their vaccination rates.”

Full text: MORE FRUSTRATION AS STATE DELAYS COVID ROAD MAP
LAGGING vaccination rates in poorer communities has become the Palaszczuk government’s latest roadblock to reopening under the national plan when 80 per cent of people are double-dosed.
And Queenslanders have been told they will need to wait for the international travel trial outcomes from NSW, though experts insist there is no reason why the Sunshine State cannot commit to reopening now.
When asked if the state would reopen at 80 per cent, Premier Annastacia Palaszczuk’s office on Saturday said she was still waiting for “completed advice” from the Doherty Institute.
But that advice is done, with a federal government spokesman saying NSW, the ACT, NT and Victoria had released road maps.
“It is a matter for Queensland to articulate why they cannot make decisions based on the advice already provided to … other states,” he said.
Infectious diseases expert Paul Griffin said other states were implementing the same advice Queensland had.
“I don’t think we need to reinvent the wheel here in terms of questioning that ­advice too much,” he said.
Just days after Ms Palaszczuk contentiously asked why people would want to travel to India or Tokyo, Health Minister Yvette D’Ath on Saturday questioned why anyone would want to travel to Bali, which has had an average of 1900 cases daily for the past week.
“I have said continuously around the 80 per cent threshold that the Doherty Institute modelling is not just about percentage,” she said.
“It’s also whether, as a state, what’s the number of outbreaks you’ve got? Whether you are able to test, whether you are able to contract trace, whether you are able to isolate the virus and manage those things.
“I saw the reference to Bali … where people will be able to travel to Bali and back but may not be able to travel to Queensland. Can I say I don’t know if anyone wants to be travelling to Bali right now when they recorded 1693 cases two days ago, and the seven-day average for Bali … it’s over 1900 cases a day.” It’s understood the Doherty Institute explained its update on the impact of Covid-19 spread if seven-day home quarantine was adopted during Friday’s national cabinet meeting.
The federal government spokesman said Doherty would continue to advise ­national cabinet in addition to the modelling that was ­finalised and adopted by all jurisdictions in September.
“Governments should hold up their end of the deal made with Australians, that if they get vaccinated they would be able to enjoy greater freedoms and eased restrictions,” he said.
Assoc Prof Griffin said if Queensland delayed a decision there could be a “big lag” before it could be implemented.
“We do risk being significantly behind other states (in border reopenings),” he said.
Ms D’Ath said the government was not “closed off” to the idea of resuming international travel but the Commonwealth had to do more planning around what countries Australia opened up to.
Ms D’Ath said the 80 per cent vaccination rate figure was “one element” of the Doherty modelling.
“That 20 per cent, if we’re looking at percentage and percentage alone, in every jurisdiction it is saying that that 20 per cent – that could be our remote indigenous communities, it could be our low-socio economic, it could be our multicultural communities that have a lower percentage of protection in their vaccination rates, that we’re OK for them to have outbreaks,” she said. “So we’ve got to look at all of it.”

August 6 Scott Morrison says plan is agreed to: The National Cabinet agreed to adopt in full an updated National Plan, based on the Doherty Institute’s findings. This follows the National Cabinet’s agreement in principle to the updated National Plan on July 30.
August 16 A long way off the threshold that allows an easing of restrictions, the Premier said: “We are provided constantly with advice from the Doherty Institute and what (it) is saying is that 80 per cent national threshold is what we are aiming towards.”
August 17 Still discretion for specific lockdowns. Annastacia Palaszczuk said: “(The national cabinet plan) doesn’t say we are not going to have lockdowns, but that lockdowns will be minimised. That Doherty research starts from the premise that Australia is in a situation with very little Covid.”

Full text: ANOTHER DAY, ANOTHER NEW AND DIFFERENT EXCUSE
LAGGING vaccination rates in poorer communities has become the Palaszczuk government’s latest roadblock to reopening under the national plan when 80 per cent of people are double-dosed.
In what was the government’s fifth different excuse for walking back from the reopening plan, Health Minister Yvette D’Ath raised the new jab concerns yesterday, just 24 hours after Premier Annastacia Palaszczuk claimed the state’s hospitals were not properly prepared.
Ms D’Ath said Queensland would also have to wait for international travel to be trialled in NSW before it would be considered for the Sunshine State.
When asked if the state would reopen at 80 per cent, Premier Annastacia Palaszczuk’s office on Saturday said in a statement she was still waiting for “completed advice” from the Doherty Institute.
But that advice is done, with a federal government spokesman saying NSW, the ACT, NT and Victoria had released road maps.
“It is a matter for Queensland to articulate why they cannot make decisions based on the advice already provided to … other states,” he said.

Full text: The tourism giant has accused Tasmania, Queensland and Western Australia — who all have a hard stance on border closures — of costing the company $100 million a month.
“My first priority and the priority of people in this room is Tasmania’s health,” Mr Gutwein said.
“To be frank I couldn’t care less if the head of Flight Centre or any other business wanted to take Tasmania to court because our position will always be the health and safety of Tasmania.”
Tighter travel restrictions with Victoria will come into place at midnight tonight after the mainland state recorded more than 2500 cases in the past two days.
Tasmanian Premier Peter Gutwein said this was “an alarming rise”.
“In response to that increase from midnight tonight 12:01 tomorrow morning, Tasmania will be introducing increased travel restrictions with Victoria, the local government area of Hume,” Mr Gutwein said.
National – 2021 – Covid Vaccination Stats
“Importantly as well there are further additional 18 government areas that have been identified as high-risk. If you have been in one of those government areas you will not be able to enter Tasmania.”
The premier said the new high-risk LGAs would be listed on the coronavirus website, with the rest of Victoria remaining high risk level 2.
As of today, 72.6% of Tasmanians have had first dose and 58.4% are fully vaccinated
For those undertaking home quarantine, you will have to be double vaccinated.
Mr Gutwein said if people had travel planned from Victoria after midnight any G2G passes will be cancelled and you will need to apply to identify if you’ve been in those level 1 locations.
He also gave an update on Tasmania’s border reopening plan.
“Our planning remains on track to open borders before Christmas,” Mr Gutwein said.
“Our aim is to reach 90% of over 16s by the first of December.
“We will be releasing the modelling along with our border opening plan. This modelling will be released in mid-October the week beginning the 18th of October so that Tasmanians have confidence in knowing what the risks are and how we plan to manage them and the risks of opening borders up.”

Thursday, September 30: PREMIER Peter Gutwein will take his defiant stand on border closures to Friday’s national cabinet meeting as federal colleagues urged him to stick to the plan for reopening.
The Tasmanian government won’t consider fully opening borders until the state hits 90 per cent vaccination rate and 100 per cent of people having access to jabs.
Mr Gutwein also wants fresh modelling and to see the trend in case numbers in NSW and Victoria before making a decision.
On Wednesday, Mr Gutwein claimed Tasmania would suffer “upwards of” 14,900 cases, 590 hospital admissions, 97 ICU admissions and nearly 100 deaths over six months.
But the Doherty Institute modelling on which his assumption is based is a national outbreak which infects nearly 750,000 people within six months.
Australia has experienced 105,000 infections in the 18 months of the pandemic so far.
The Doherty Institute stressed “the deliberately artificial nature of our assumption that Australia’s population would experience a uniform national epidemic”.
The national plan agreed to by all states allows for the easing of state and national border restrictions once vaccination rates reach 80 per cent.
These include an exemption from domestic travel restrictions for vaccinated people and the gradual reopening of international travel with “safe countries”.
Minister for Senior Australians and Aged Care Services Richard Colbeck urged Mr Gutwein to stick to the plan.
“Under the consolidation phase of the National Plan, 80 per cent of adults aged 16 and over will be fully vaccinated,” he said.
“This will allow residents of all states and territories, including Tasmania, to live with the virus like any other infectious disease, while minimising serious illness and death.
“We know from extensive modelling and the experience of other nations, that high rates of vaccination offer a pathway to normality.
“As previously stated, I am confident any decisions made by Premier Gutwein will based on the ongoing advice of National Cabinet and the AHPPC and serve the best interests of all Tasmanians.”
Senator Eric Abetz said he was confident the Premier would make the right decision, as he had throughout the pandemic.
“We can’t force people to be vaccinated and we can’t live with lockdowns, border restrictions, mental health issues, huge government debt, and jobs losses forever,” he said.
“The rest of the world is moving forward with their lives and eventually we need to as well.”
Data from Tuesday shows Tasmania at 75.8 per cent first dose rates and 57.8 per cent fully vaccinated. The state is expected to reach 90 per cent by December 1.
More than 3000 doses are being administered daily and the rate is increasing.
Nationally 77.3 per cent of eligible people have had their first dose and 53.4 per cent have had their second dose.
An announcement on when the state will would relax border restrictions is expected to be made before Christmas.
Tasmania remains in a state of emergency.

Lockdown exit at risk after record virus tally

Full text: Melbourne's road out of lockdown might drag on longer if a leap in COVID-19 cases linked to illegal home gatherings and parties over the grand final long weekend becomes a trend.
Victoria recorded 1438 new cases yesterday - 488 more than on Wednesday and by far the highest daily total on record.
Contact tracing interviews revealed that about 500 of the new cases may have stemmed from gatherings on Friday and Saturday. Five deaths were also recorded yesterday.
COVID-19 response commander Jeroen Weimar described the weekend's rule-breaking as a city-wide superspreading event that pushed the virus into new pockets of Melbourne. He said it could result in case numbers reaching the upper range of the Burnet Institute's outbreak modelling, though one of the lead modellers cautioned against reading too much into one day's data.
"Today is a significant setback in how we manage this outbreak," Mr Weimar said. "If this trend is continued ... we will jump to the worst quartile of those Burnet projections."
With a greater proportion of men among the caseload, the outbreak spreading outside northern hotspots into the eastern suburbs and a 15 percentage point increase in road traffic, the numbers painted a picture of a weekend of socialising by weary Victorians keen to watch the footy with loved ones.
Premier Daniel Andrews said the rule-breaking was understandable but inexcusable, affirming his intention to lift the lockdown. But he warned that if case numbers and hospitalisations continued to grow the easing of restrictions planned in late October might need to be postponed.
"We are not turning back. This is a plan to open ... [and] we are finding a way to push through and get this place open," he said. "However, it would be irresponsible for me to say we wouldn't, for instance, have to pause, we wouldn't have to modify things."
The government also halved the Pfizer dose interval (from six weeks to three weeks) in an attempt to reach vaccine targets earlier, welcomed the receipt of 88,000 unused Moderna doses from pharmacies and announced that a ban on opening toilets at golf courses and tennis clubs would be reviewed. But despite a federal government move to release the Pfizer vaccine to over-60s at GP clinics and pharmacies, the Victorian government will not administer it to older people at state-run hubs.
The Burnet Institute modelling of COVID's spread in Victoria - which informed the state government's road map out of lockdown - predicted a first peak in daily average infections of between 1400 and 2900 in the final two weeks of October.
Epidemiologists said this week that higher than expected vaccination rates could mean avoiding the worst-case scenario.
Mr Weimar said the outbreak's trajectory was in Victorians' hands, but yesterday's rise was caused in part by tired people who felt they "deserved a bit of a payback ... a nicer time. It's a significant setback on our Burnet road map ... [but] today may just be one rogue day."
Margaret Hellard, of the Burnet Institute, said it was not yet known if apparent non-compliance at the weekend would have a longer-term effect. "While a high number today is disappointing and concerning, it's important to look at an overall trend in the numbers," said Professor Hellard, who co-authored the Victorian modelling.
University of South Australia epidemiologist Adrian Esterman said the case rise was concerning, but he believed it would soon be "crunched" by high rates of vaccination.
Mr Andrews said 49.8 per cent of Victorians were fully vaccinated, just shy of the 50 per cent mark, the milestone at which he said NSW started to see its case numbers fall.
Victoria, which passed NSW in the daily case numbers tally on Monday, now has 11,018 active recorded cases. NSW, which recorded 942 new cases yesterday, has 10,109.
NSW Premier Gladys Berejiklian said she wished Victoria the best after the rise in case numbers.
"I say to them be optimistic about the future," she said. "Yes, it is a difficult time, but you'll get through this, as we did."
A looming overhaul of NSW's contact tracing rules would allow fully vaccinated people in pubs, restaurants and shops to no longer be identified as close contacts and forced to isolate for two weeks if exposed to COVID-19.
In Victoria the number of people in hospital when the state reaches vaccine milestones will be a key determinant of whether the government eases restrictions, meaning suppressing case numbers this month will give the state the best chance of coping with the projected case rise when rules ease.
The Burnet modelling showed hospitals would be overwhelmed in 45 per cent of scenarios when there were 1000 to 1500 hospitalisations as the state eased restrictions at 80 per cent.
There were 398 COVID patients in hospital yesterday.
Federal Health Minister Greg Hunt announced yesterday that all Australians over 60 would have access to the mRNA Pfizer and Moderna jabs from GPs and pharmacies from October 1.
Over-60s had been restricted to AstraZeneca while supplies of Pfizer and Moderna were limited.
A Victorian government spokeswoman said state-run hubs would not administer Pfizer vaccines to older people.
"Victoria's state-run hubs continue to prioritise access to Pfizer for people under 60, including teenagers who have no alternative option for vaccination," she said.

Full text: There are several avenues by which an aggrieved and powerful litigant may proceed.
National cabinet agreed in August on a national plan to transition Australia’s Covid-19 response to post-vaccination settings, starting when national vaccinations reached 70 per cent, with that target expected to be reached by Oct­ober 22. But Queensland Premier Annastacia Palaszczuk and West Australian Premier Mark McGowan have a very different plan for their states – to stay closed.
Although previous legal challenges to state border closures such as these have failed, including Clive Palmer’s constitutional challenge to the WA border restrictions, unanimously dismissed by the High Court last year, the legal prospects, just like the pandemic, are changing.
The High Court’s reasons in the Palmer case were based on limited legal grounds and very different facts. Three members of the five-judge bench (Chief Justice Susan Kiefel and justices Patrick Keane and James Edelman) were careful not to rule out definitively the possibility of a future successful challenge.
Meanwhile the Queensland border closure legislation has not been subjected to a sustained challenge and its constitutionality remains an open question.
The border closure also could be challenged via judicial review of public health measures, which would argue restrictions go further than is necessary to protect public health.
A new challenge also may garner support from other stakeholders. Scott Morrison says Australians just want to “get on with it”. Home Affairs Minister Karen Andrews has waged a public war of words with the Queensland Premier since July and Attorney-General Michaelia Cash, a senator from WA, says things have changed fundamentally and as a result the WA border restrictions are “no longer necessary and proportionate”.
South Australia’s backing is likely, given its position in the Palmer case. And while NSW did not show its hand in the Palmer case, border tensions and social media posts by Attorney-General Mark Speakman may indicate where its sympathies lie. The basic facts of any case could be agreed and should not be contentious, given Covid-19 is perhaps the most rapidly and exhaustively studied phenomenon in history.
Apart from vaccines and new treatments, what has changed?
Critical to the High Court’s reasoning in the Palmer case were “uncertainties about the level of risk”. Chief Justice Kiefel and Justice Keane endorsed WA’s position with a powerful and prescient statement of the court’s reasoning: “There is no known vaccine, and no treatment presently available to mitigate the risks of severe medical outcomes or mortality for a person who contracts Covid-19.”
The question is this: did the High Court deliberately leave the door open to a future challenge as soon as a vaccine was rolled out and other treatments approved?
Fast forward to last month, and more than 50 per cent of Australians now are fully vaccinated against the virus. Uncertainty has been dispelled by Doherty Institute and Burnet Institute modelling based on more than 12 months of international data. With test, trace, isolate and quarantine measures in place, the level of risk in reopening at 70 per cent has been quantified with precision: 2737 infections and fewer than 15 deaths, with no lockdowns required.
That is a caseload the health system surely can cope with. Since April last year, Victoria has tripled its intensive care unit capacity, bringing an additional 1600 beds online. The NSW and Queensland governments announced early in the pandemic that they would double their capacity.
Australia’s prospects for returning to everyday life are looking very good. Health capacity has been ramping up continuously since Covid-19 reached our shores last year. All of which makes Palaszczuk and McGowan’s refusal to commit publicly to a date for reopening difficult to understand.
Vaccination rates in Queensland and WA lag behind the rest of the country by a wide margin, which adds to the uncertainty on reopening. It is not clear when Queensland and WA will reach 80 per cent vaccination. And their premiers tell Queenslanders and West Australians borders will stay closed for as long as necessary to keep the virus out.
However, we also know the implications of border indecision aren’t merely about convenience and federal consistency. The livelihoods of many Australians are affected. The tourism industry in particular is under pressure. In WA, tourism is an $11bn industry employing about 8.2 per cent of the state’s population. In Queensland, always a popular holiday destination, about 75 per cent of the $28bn sector is reliant on domestic tourism.
More intangible but no less deeply felt is the human cost for all of us. Queenslanders and West Australians with friends and relatives living elsewhere have endured almost two years of separation. The daily lives of border residents have been disrupted, including by restrictions on movement within their own states.
Faced with indefinitely prolonged restrictions, the Australian Human Rights Commission has expressed concern, citing a “lack of transparency in explaining the continued justification for some emergency measures”. The commission says: “The need for the restrictions must be regularly assessed, and the moment they are no longer necessary they must cease.” Prospective plaintiffs may be wondering whether that moment finally has come. With agreed facts, a challenge could be heard and determined in as little as a few weeks: the High Court pronounced orders on Palmer’s challenge within two days of the close of hearings.
Whatever the outcome of any challenge, it will be a step further down the path out of Covid-19 and back to normal life, something likely welcomed by all of us.

National cabinet meeting to decide whether states stick to roadmap out of Covid-19 restrictions

Author: McCormack, Madura

Full text: The advice is expected to be handed to state and territory leaders on Friday by the Australian Health Protection Principal Committee (AHPPC), at what is set to be a highly-charged 56th meeting of national cabinet.
Despite agreeing to the national roadmap out of Covid-19, state and territory leaders are split on whether they will stick to it.
Premier Annastacia Palaszczuk is yet to confirm if she will reopen the states borders once 80 per cent of the population is vaccinated – and she isn’t alone.
Tasmanian Premier Peter Gutwein this week flagged the island state may not reopen to the majority of the country until 90 per cent of the adult population is vaccinated, deeming an early reopening too risky.
Ms Palaszczuk refused to say if Queensland’s course could be similar to that of Tasmania’s saying those discussions would be had at national cabinet.
“I’ll have those discussions at national cabinet where every state and territory can put their views to the Prime Minister,” she said.
The meeting is also set against the backdrop of Queensland dealing with four separate clusters and Victoria recording its highest ever day of infections.
It’s understood interim Doherty Institute modelling that focuses on how to best manage high-risk groups, including Indigenous Australians and other cohorts such as schools as the country reopens was handed to leaders ahead of the meeting — something Ms Palaszczuk had requested.
National cabinet is set to be briefed on AHPPC advice that includes allowing vaccinated people to visit residents in aged care homes, similar to what has already been flagged in New South Wales once 70 per cent of the population has received both doses.
The AHPPC will also recommend mandatory vaccination for health care workers — something Queensland has already put in place.
National cabinet will also discuss the health system capacity that each jurisdiction will need under the reopening plan, with initial data presented on September 17 “alarming” some leaders, including the ACT’s Andrew Barr.

Full text: Tough mask mandates have already been reinstated in Brisbane and Moreton Bay in response to an unvaccinated truck driver testing positive after he was unknowingly infectious in the community for eight days, and a vaccinated aviation worker also contracting the virus.
The Gold Coast was on Tuesday added to that mask mandate after two people were infectious while in the community.
Chief Health Officer Dr Jeannette Young said “large numbers” of cases in the coming days could trigger a lockdown – the first since July 31 when six community cases were deemed enough to warrant stay-at-home orders.
On Tuesday, after announcing another case linked an aviation worker, Dr Young elaborated saying a ‘large number of cases, community spread and unlinked cases’ would prompt a lockdown.
“Of course, I always consider a lockdown, and then I work through what we need to do, at this stage I do not think a lockdown is warranted, that could change,” she said.
“I do have a reasonable level of concern.
“I’m really, really, very comforted by the fact that people do know how to respond and respond very, very quickly.”
Infectious disease expert Paul Griffin – who investigated the Prince Charles Hospital outbreak – said he would be convinced a lockdown was “unavoidable” if there were high number of exposure sites and close contacts, as well as more unlinked or mystery cases.
On Wednesday morning, workers from Woolworths in Eatons Hill were reportedly contacted by Metro North Health after an infected case visited the supermarket between 9:30am and 10:15am on Saturday, September 25.
It is believed that those workers have not been told to isolate, however.
Last night, more than a dozen exposure sites were listed on Queensland Health’s website including the Adalong Student Guesthouse where the truckie stayed while infectious along with 25 other people, who were bussed out of the accommodation about 6pm yesterday.
The fresh Covid scare was sparked late Monday night when Queensland Health revealed a man who works for an aviation training site tested positive – despite not travelling interstate or overseas – and had been in the community, including at a childcare centre.
Hours later it emerged his wife had also tested positive, but authorities were more worried about an unrelated truck driver who stayed at three locations in Brisbane including the guesthouse where bathrooms are shared.
Dr Young said it was not known how the truckie or the aviation worker contracted the virus.
But she said the aviation worker likely had contact with international pilots through his job.
A returned traveller from Timor Leste also tested positive five days after completing her 14 days in hotel quarantine, however authorities are looking at whether this could be “light shedding” as opposed to being a new case.
Dr Griffin said Queenslanders could not assume our run of luck would continue, especially as it is one of the lowest vaccinated states in the country so “most susceptible to a delta outbreak”.
NED-3869-Covid-19-Exposure-Sites-Qld
“These new cases present some concern, particularly the truck driver who stayed at multiple temporary accommodation sites, his case presents some very concerning features,” Dr Griffin said.
“The truck driver’s situation of spending a long time in the community while infectious, the likelihood of a high number of close contacts means this must be taken very seriously.
“There are a number of factors which would convince me a lockdown would become unavoidable including a high number of exposure sites and close contacts, as well as unlinked or mystery cases.”
Visitors have been restricted at aged care facilities, hospitals, prisons and disability services facilities in the Brisbane and the Moreton Bay local government areas.
And just days after mask restrictions eased, people in those two LGAs are now required to wear them at all times while inside, including sitting down.
Masks do not need to be worn when eating and drinking.
Premier Annastacia Palaszczuk also announced unvaccinated freight workers would be banned from entering Queensland from October 15.
With seven Covid-positive truckies entering Queensland since August 24 – including Tuesday’s case – Ms Palaszczuk declared all drivers must have at least one vaccination by October 15 or they will not be allowed in.
Drivers must then have received or have a booking for their second dose by November 15.
Under the new mandate, drivers must receive a negative test seven days before entering Queensland – removing the requirement for a test within 72 hours.
The state has already established a roadside vaccination facility at John Flynn Private Hospital at Tugun and will add a second clinic at Goondiwindi Showgrounds from 6am to 10pm each day.
Queensland Vaccine Locator
Transport Workers’ Union national secretary Michael Kaine backed the government’s move but said it was vital the roadside hubs were effective.
Queenslanders have again been urged to get vaccinated with the mass vaccination hub at Boondall in Brisbane’s north now accepting daily walk-ins.
Meanwhile Dr Young said she was still waiting to see specific Doherty modelling before making decisions around the border.
It comes after Ms Palaszczuk called on Prime Minister Scott Morrison to release “revised Doherty modelling” ahead of Friday’s national cabinet which she said she needed before making any border decisions.
It’s understood national cabinet has been advised they can expect to see three other pieces of modelling from Doherty.
The Prime Minister’s office on Monday said Ms Palaszczuk already had modelling around how cases would grow if the country opened up amid interstate outbreaks.

Covid Qld: New case spring up as authorities scramble to trace contacts

Full text: Four of the cases are locally acquired, with one of those causing “a little concern”, as it was detected in a truck driver who was in the community for a week and stayed in two hotels and a guesthouse, prompting calls for more truckies to get vaccinated.
Meanwhile, acting deputy police commissioner Shane Chelepy said a male in his 50s was found dead in his hotel quarantine room in Brisbane.
The first community case, an aviation worker in his 30s, was infectious in the community since September 23 and authorities believe he could have come in contact with international pilots. The second case is his wife.
The third case, who the Premier said Chief Health Officer Dr Jeannette Young is “a little bit more concerned about”, is the truck driver, which also forms a second cluster separate to the aviation worker.
Dr Young said he had been infectious in the community for eight days and had stayed in three different accommodation venues, including two hotels in Spring Hill – the Metropolitan Hotel between September 21 and 24 and the Royal Albert between September 18 and 21 – and the South Brisbane guesthouse that was placed under police guard on Tuesday morning.
Dr Young is not considering moving people at the hotels because they have their own ensuites.
However, they are looking at the South Brisbane guesthouse because it has shared bathrooms.
Around 25 people were staying there.
Authorities are working with the truck driver to work out how he contracted the virus.
“We’re working through with the managers of those three facilities … to who was there,” Dr Young said.
The fourth case is a woman who completed 14 days in hotel quarantine before testing positive after leaving. Dr Young said the woman had tested negative five days after exiting hotel quarantine.
Authorities are now determining how she got it, with Dr Young saying it could be late shedding of the virus.
The Premier said a lockdown was not imminent, and there was no change to the arrangements for Sunday’s NRL Grand Final at this stage after a leading epidemiologist urged authorities to postpone the event following reports of the infections in Brisbane.
Dr Young said a final decision on the NRL Grand Final was not required today and she would monitor the decision right up until Sunday morning.
Dr Young said a high number of cases would force a lockdown, but said she was confident the state would manage the latest outbreak.
“I’m very comforted by the fact people do know how to respond and respond very quickly,” she said.
“We’ll just see what happens what happens over the next few days.”
Ms Palaszczuk said masks were the “best line of defence”.
“There’s no need to panic because Queenslanders have been doing the right thing,” she said.
“We want to go back to people wearing masks indoors if you live in the Brisbane area and the Moreton Bay region.”
Aged care facilities, hospitals, prisons and disability services facilities will be restricted to visitors.
NED-3869-Covid-19-Exposure-Sites-Qld
Queensland will mandate the vaccination of truck drivers entering the state after seven drivers have entered Queensland while infectious since late August.
Ms Palaszczuk said from October 15 it will be mandatory for drivers to have received the first dose and the second dose by November 15.
The state will establish a roadside vaccination facility at John Flynn Private Hospital at Tugun.
Transport Minister Mark Bailey said freight workers had lower vaccination rates compared to the public.
“We’ve been working with the industry around this,” he said.
Drivers will also be forced to receive a negative test at least seven days prior to entering Queensland.
He said Queensland Health would “prioritise” freight workers and truckies for vaccination.
Mr Bailey expects about 200 vaccinations will be provided at the Tugun roadside facility each day.
Vaccinated drivers will be permitted to go about the Queensland community normally.
Mr Bailey said “now is the time to act and get the jab”.
Queensland Vaccine Locator
On a broader level, Health Minister Yvette D’Ath said everyone needed to get vaccinated, urging people to not wait until there was another outbreak.
“There are plenty of options, there is no reason to not be getting vaccinated now,” she said.
Ms D’Ath said the mass vaccination hub at Boondall would be accepting walk-ins from today, with Dr Young stressing the importance of getting vaccinated sooner rather than later.
“It’s really important, we don’t know where our next case is going to come from,” she said.
“We just need all Queenslanders 12 years or older to come forward and get vaccinated.
“There will be somewhere that can vaccinate you today.”
Dr Young said there was no plans to rollout drive-through vaccination clinics, following calls from Opposition Leader David Crisafulli, due to the difficulty in monitoring people.
Dr Young said the state’s mass vaccination clinics were effective.
Health Minister Yvette D’Ath said drive-through vaccination clinics were “less efficient” and would “slow down our vaccination rate”.
Ms D’Ath said the Queensland government had reached out to Victorian counterparts regarding the testing method and said that it was “very inefficient” and only necessary if there is widespread community transmission.
“In Victoria, they are only putting through about a third or a quarter of their capacity, so I wouldn’t say it’s efficient, I would say it’s very inefficient,” Ms D’Ath said.
“The drive throughs are only necessary if there is widespread transmission, and it’s also dangerous because healthcare workers are getting right up close to potential cases in their cars.”
Ms D’Ath told Mr Crisafulli to start listening to the advice and the evidence.
Ms Palaszczuk said the state government was investigating alternative options to hotel quarantine.
“It’s a very very difficult time for anyone to be in hotel quarantine - we are looking at a number of measures,” she said.
“It is a very difficult situation - it is a very tough time for everyone.”
Ms Palaszczuk said there was no change to the arrangements for Sunday’s NRL Grand Final at this stage after a leading epidemiologist urged authorities to postpone the event following reports of the infections in Brisbane.
“We’ll be updating the community every single day, very early stages at the moment,” Ms Palaszczuk said.
The city was on Tuesday morning rocked by news of the truck driver case within a matter of hours of the aviation worker, with the South Brisbane guesthouse placed under police guard.
The Adalong Guesthouse on Stephens Road has been cordoned off by police as authorities scramble to gather more information, but it is believed the case is not linked to the case detected in an aviation worker that was alerted late on Monday night.
The aviation industry employee unknowingly infected with the virus visited a busy childcare centre northwest of Brisbane, making it one of several new contact sites to be added to Queensland Health’s website late on Monday night.
The third case is expected to be confirmed as the aviation worker’s wife, with more contact sites to be added in the coming hours.
Dr Young says she is still waiting to see specific Doherty modelling before making decisions around Queensland’s border.
It comes after Ms Palaszczuk called on Prime Minister Scott Morrison to release “revised Doherty modelling” ahead of Friday’s national cabinet which she said she needed before making any border or restriction decisions.
Dr Young said she had seen some “preliminary information” from Doherty which would go to national cabinet this week.
“It’s really about seeing that different information, so you all saw that original Doherty modelling that looked at the 70 per cent and 80 per cent vaccination,” she said.
“Then there’s further Doherty modelling that looks at those vaccination rates starting at different starting points, so it’s really looking at that.”
The Prime Minister’s office on Monday said Ms Palaszczuk already had modelling around how cases would grow if the country opened up amid interstate outbreaks.

Full text: The opposition’s minister for government services and former leader said Prime Minister Scott Morrison was failing Australians by shirking away, and leaving individual states to pave their own paths out of lockdowns.
It comes as disputes continue between states Queensland and Western Australia – who refuse to be drawn on when they will open their borders to NSW, Victoria and the ACT despite vaccination rates nearing 80 per cent double dose – and federal ministers.
Mr Shorten said he wished “we could get agreement”.
“Really, at the end of the day, where is the Prime Minister? He is the national leader,” Mr Shorten told Today on Tuesday.
“I had someone stop me in the street the other day and they don’t feel they have a national leader anymore. The new leaders of Australia are the premiers.
“The Prime Minister is MIA … There has been a real failure here.
“I feel like I live in the United Nations of Australia these days, and that is a failure from Canberra.”
Mr Morrison told Weekend Sunrise that the premiers had a responsibility to reopen once high vaccination rates were achieved.
“There comes a time where you’ve got to honour the arrangement you’ve made with the Australian people, and that is once you get to 80 per cent vaccination, it is very clear that you can start opening up,” he said.
“I’d like them (the Australian people) to have for Christmas... their lives back, and that’s within the gift of governments and that’s a gift I’d like to see us give them.”
Mr Morrison returned from the USA on Monday morning after attending a Quad meeting. He will spend the next two weeks in quarantine.
Queensland Premier Annastacia Palaszczuk has previously insinuated her state may not reopen to its southern neighbours until there is more evidence about how to protect children under 12, who are currently not eligible for vaccination.
She is facing increasing pressure to open the borders by Christmas, but said on Monday she would wait to see updated modelling by the Doherty Institute, which will be discussed at national cabinet on Friday.
“I look forward to those discussions with the Prime Minister and all of the other Premiers,” she said.
Meanwhile, WA Premier Mark McGowan has said his state could remain closed to Victoria and NSW until April next year.
NSW Premier Gladys Berejiklian suggested on Monday, while announcing the pathway out of lockdown, that NSW residents could potentially travel overseas before they could get to Perth.
“We believe by December 1 we will be at that Covid normal stage where hopefully we will be booking international travel, once the PM gives that green light,” Ms Berejiklian said.
“But I don’t want it to be the case that I will be able to go overseas before I can go to Perth. I hope Australia will open up together once we get to those double dose figures.”
According to projections, Queensland will be the last state or territory to reach the 80 per cent double dose threshold, on December 7.

‘What’s his name?’ Palaszczuk’s snipe at Barnaby Joyce as Queensland records zero new Covid-19 cases

Full text: On Monday morning, both Mr Joyce and party ally David Littleproud mocked the Queensland government’s refusal to commit to a border opening plan.
The Coalition frontbenchers accused the Premier of defying national cabinet in two separate breakfast television appearances as hostility between the state and federal leaders festers.
Mr Joyce told Sunrise it seemed that Ms Palaszczuk had decided she “knows better than the Doherty Institute”.
“I didn’t know she was an immunologist … I didn’t know her epidemiology was so up to speed,” Mr Joyce said.
“She’s prepared to put her views ahead of the Doherty Institute and sending business broke.
“Queensland is not locking people out anymore they’re locking their own people in. They’re locking in the opportunities, so businesses do not have the capacity to stand up at Christmas and … recoup the losses.”

Mr Littleproud followed a similar tone, accusing Ms Palaszczuk of squandering billions of dollars in tourism opportunities.
But the Queensland Premier ridiculed the two-pronged attack given the temporary defection of Darren Chester from the National Party.
The Gippsland MP revealed on the weekend he would be taking a break from the party due to “hard-right-wing” colleagues such as George Christensen.
In reference to the spat, Ms Palaszczuk urged Mr Joyce to deal with his own internal party dramas rather than hurling criticism at the Queensland government.
“Well look, he’s entitled to his views (but) I think Barnaby should be sitting down with, what’s his name? Darren Chester? Who’s just left the Nationals or something I think,” she told reporters on Monday.
“He’s got to focus on his own job and let me do my job.”

Queensland recorded zero new Covid-19 cases on Monday after the state’s deputy premier, Steven Miles, urged residents to get vaccinated.
Ms Palaszczuk’s often provocative lieutenant retreated on his reservation about the state being opened by Christmas.
“No one has ever suggested the border should be closed at Christmas but what we’ve said is it should be opened at the right time and that we don’t yet have the information that tells us what that right time is,” Mr Miles told reporters earlier on Monday morning.
“Christmas is still about 90 days away, a lot can change in that period of time.
“Let’s focus on what we can do today to bring that date forward and that is get as many people vaccinated as we possibly can.”
The Doherty Institute is expected to present updated modelling to national cabinet on Friday which was hoped to provide greater transparency from state and federal leaders about a plan to open borders.

Locked-down and out in Daniel Andrews’ penal pandemic paradise

Author: Stewart, Cameron

Full text: It’s a fact my friends in Washington, where I lived until earlier this year, cannot comprehend. “How could that happen?” they ask me. “Why do Australians still put up with such restrictions?”
I explain that Australia is six months behind the rest of the world on vaccinations because our federal government didn’t fight hard enough last year to secure global supplies. But things are improving, I say; in another month or so Australia will be about 70 per cent double vaxxed. By that time almost everyone who wants a vaccine will have had the opportunity to have one.
“Wow, that’s great, so you guys in Melbourne will finally be free then,” they say.
“Um, well, not real­ly,” I reply. “Even at 70 per cent, fully vaccinated people in Melbourne still won’t be allowed to eat inside a restaurant or drink at a bar, or go to the movies, or send their kids back to school full time or have a single visitor in our house.”
There is silence on the phone from my friends, who are living freely despite the US being only 55 per cent fully vaxxed. “You’re kidding me, right?” they say.
I’ve been back in Melbourne for about six months, and it is easy to forget how abnormally cautious our so-called road map out of lockdown seems to the rest of the world. In the US, Britain and Europe, life and freedoms have returned to something close to normal despite having fewer than 70 per cent of their populations fully vaccinated. People still catch the virus and many still die. But unlike last year, when there were no vaccines, this is now a pandemic of the unvaccinated. Those getting ill and dying overwhelmingly are those who chose not to get the jab when they could have.
Yet even when Australia finally reaches those Doherty Institute milestones of 70 and 80 per cent, Victorian Premier Daniel Andrews is choosing to sleepwalk his way out of the pandemic. His road map to freedom released this week is so cautious, it has been dubbed a “road map of roadblocks”. His government has used the same Burnet Institute modelling as NSW Premier Gladys Berejiklian, yet at 70 per cent double vaxxed people in Melbourne will receive substantially fewer freedoms than their counterparts in Sydney. At 80 per cent they also will receive fewer freedoms.
This tells you why Melbourne is the rightful heir to the embarrassing title of the most locked-down city. That sad prize will be seen by many of Andrews’ supporters as proof of how he has protected his people. Instead, it is a reflection of the pro-lockdown mindset that continues to infect the Andrews government.
Andrews, assisted by the ultra-cautious advice of chief health officer Brett Sutton, believes the health risks posed by Covid when 70 per cent of people are double vaxxed are more dangerous than the damage indefinite lockdown is causing to children’s education, mental health and jobs.
Melbourne is barely recognisable as the city I left for Washington more than four years ago. It is beaten down by perpetual Covid-19 lockdowns. The physical scars of these – the hundreds of closed businesses and the emptiest CBD in the country – are easy to see. Less easy to spot is the devastation it has caused to children’s education, to mental health and to the psyche of the city. Melbourne has lost its mojo. I bet Buenos Aires looks equally shabby.
No matter what your view is of Andrews’ four-month lockdown of Melbourne last year, his eventual triumph over the (pre-Delta) virus at that time instilled in him a bias towards lockdowns that he is finding difficult to shake. He has abandoned his previous Covid-zero targets now only because Delta has got away from him.
I lived in the US during the worst of its Covid crisis last year and saw how it mismanaged the pandemic compared with Australia. But the tables are reversed now, with the US being awash in vaccines and opening up, while in Australia 60 per cent of us remain locked down amid a bumpy vaccine rollout.
“What has gone wrong Down Under? You guys were doing so well last year,” my American mates ask me.
When Melbourne finally emerges from its lockdown – in very minor ways – on October 26, the city will have been locked down for a staggering 267 days.
As the city’s Herald Sun puts it, that is “a shameful indictment on a government that has failed the people of Melbourne and Victoria at almost every turn over the past 18 months”.
One wonders how the exhausted people of Melbourne will feel as they watch Sydneysiders regain many of their freedoms at 70 and 80 per cent vaxxed while the Andrews government robs them of similar rewards.
On October 4, Melbourne will win the lockdown world cup – straight to Dan’s pool room – when it surpasses the 245 days of lockdown experienced by Buenos Aires. Yet Victoria’s Premier still will refuse to reward his battered city with at least the same freedoms as Sydneysiders. As my American mates would say, “Goddamn it.”

Full text: VICTORIA faces a peak of more than 4500 daily cases of Covid-19 by Christmas and 2200 deaths in the New Year, following the easing of restrictions over the next seven weeks.
Epidemiologists behind the modelling that has guided the road map out of lockdown say if Victorians “make an extra effort” to follow the rules over the next two months, the impact on the healthcare system could be significantly less.
Premier Daniel Andrews announced on Sunday details of a staggered return of freedoms starting next weekend when 80 per cent of Victorians have received their first vaccination dose. More substantial restrictions are due to be lifted on November 5 when 80 per cent of eligible Victorians are fully vaccinated.
The road map, based on modelling by Melbourne’s Burnet Institute, shows the peak seven-day average is expected to be reached on December 15. By the end of the year, 3150 people will be in hospital, with more than a quarter of those in intensive care.
“These are sobering numbers,” Mr Andrews said.
Burnet professor Margaret Hellard, one of the authors of the modelling, said Victorians could “individually make a difference” to these projected outcomes, based on the choices they made.
The modelling shows that if the road map is accompanied by increased testing of vaccinated people with mild symptoms, the peak number of cases could be almost halved and about 1000 fewer people would die.
“There is fatigue, but we shouldn’t be pessimistic. We should instead be going ‘It’s the final quarter, and we’ve really got to run hard for the ball’,” Professor Hellard said.
“If Victorians wear their masks, meet outdoors and don’t go to each other’s houses, if we get vaccinated, if we get tested when we need to, if we try our best to do all the things we’re being asked to do, we can change that.
“If the health system gets overwhelmed, people die. We don’t get to rewrite the story then, but we have the chance to rewrite it now.” AMA Victoria president Rod­erick McRae said while the easing of restrictions was “premature”, it was reassuring that the impact on hospitals would be carefully monitored. Australian Nursing and Midwifery Federation (Victorian Branch) secretary Lisa Fitzpatrick said the plan was sensibly “cautious”.

Covid-19 restrictions Dan Andrews won’t ease at 80 per cent vaccinated

Full text: Premier Daniel Andrews said that once 70 per cent of the population was fully vaccinated, likely to be around October 26, the double jabbed would have more freedoms.
Once Victoria hits 80 per cent of people aged 16 and older fully vaccinated – predicted to be around November 5 – most of the remaining restrictions will be eased in line with density limits.
Victorian businesses have been “left shattered” by the reopening plan, with many required to stay closed until the state hits the 80 per cent double dose target.
The Victorian Chamber of Commerce has been advocating for a “balanced and practical” road map reflective of the national cabinet plan and Doherty Institute modelling, similar to that of the road map of NSW.
But chief executive Paul Guerra said all Victorian businesses got out of the announcement was “roadblocks”.
“Victorians deserve answers as to why Victoria’s health advice and road map is so different to NSW,” he said.
“It is extremely tough to look over the border and see our NSW neighbours get back to relatively normal life while we continue to be locked down in a holding pattern.
“Business has been in crisis for the last 20 months, Sunday’s announcement further intensifies that crisis and many businesses will not make it through.”
Mr Guerra urged the state government to commit to additional financial support to businesses that “remain in limbo”.
Once 70 per cent of the Victorian population aged 16 and older is double jabbed hospitality businesses can open for outside trade only with a density limit of 50 fully vaccinated people.
At 80 per cent, hospitality venues will be able to open for 150 vaccinated people inside and 500 outside for seated service only.
Shopping strips will be open for outside trade only at 70 per cent vaccinated, with all retail to open at 80 per cent.
In NSW, hospitality venues can open only for fully vaccinated patrons at the state’s 70 per cent target, subject to the 4sqm density limit indoors and 2sqm outdoors. Standing drinking will be permitted outside.
Retails stores can also reopen under the 4sq m rule.
When asked about the difference in the road maps on Monday, Mr Andrews said Victoria was in a “very different position” to NSW.
“You can compare us with other parts of the world, with Sydney, that’s fine,” he said.
“People are free to do that. But I’m not free to ignore the advice that I get.
“This is not everything that people want when they want it, but it’s not possible for us to go faster than that at this time.”
There are some rules that Mr Andrews said must remain in place even after 80 per cent of Victorians are double vaxxed in order to “preserve our health system and ensure Victorians can still get the healthcare they need”.
The Premier said there was no alternative to the slow and staged opening up plan and flagged the “acute stress” it would place on the health system if done too quickly.
“While we’re no longer aiming for Covid zero, it’s imperative we don’t jeopardise our health system as we open up – too many Victorians rely on it every day,” the Premier said.
At 80 per cent fully vaccinated, Victorians will still be required to wear masks indoors at all times, including at work.
Private gatherings at home will be permitted but limited to 10 people only, including children. This limit will increase to 30 visitors to the home for Christmas.
NED-4588-VIC-road map-out-of-lockdown
Public gatherings will be allowed for up to 30 fully vaccinated people, but only five for those who aren’t.
Only those who are fully vaccinated will be able to go to work, with Victorians still encouraged to work from home if they can.
The same applies for non-practical adult education with only those with two doses of the vaccine allowed on campus.
Those who aren’t vaccinated will be unable to attend religious services indoors, and must practice their faith outdoors, in groups capped at 20.
Hospitality food and drink businesses, karaoke venues and nightclubs will only be able to operate seated service.
Food courts will remain closed with takeaway only allowed, and customers will not be allowed to remove their masks indoors to consume food or drinks.
Weddings and funerals will be capped at 150 people indoors and 500 outdoors for those where all guests are double jabbed, while unvaccinated funerals will be limited to 20 people and weddings 10.
Holidays will also have to occur in a “bubble”, where households nominate another to go on vacation with.
There are now 5262 active cases in Victoria.

Full text: It’s not about former Labor prime minister Kevin Rudd’s Twitter obsession with the idea News Corp runs a protection racket for the Berejiklian Coalition government in NSW. Quite the reverse actually.
Look how Berejiklian was slammed by the ABC, the Nine tabloids, Guardian Australia and news.com.au when she said on September 10 that she would no longer be attending all daily 11am Covid-19 press conferences. Patricia Karvelas on RN Drive spoke for many when interviewing former health bureaucrat Jane Halton that night: “Full disclosure. I have been very critical of that (decision). It’s a very important accountability measure for journalists, particularly as cases are rising.”
Yet I have seen and heard little comment from journalists about Victorian Premier Daniel Andrews no longer attending daily pressers more than about half the time. Victoria’s daily briefings are often led by state Health Minister Martin Foley.
Berejiklian said she had other work to do. Fair enough, but just before a forecast peak in infections it looked to some like she was dodging scrutiny. NSW has in fact continued daily live press conferences rather than the health video Berejiklian had flagged. The briefings have been fronted by health officials and Health Minister Brad Hazzard. Yet Berejiklian did front about half of last week’s pressers.
Some Victorian reporters believe Andrews is trying to distance himself from Covid and lockdowns in the lead-up to the November 2022 state election. Whatever the strategy, he is being judged less harshly than Berejiklian for taking a similar approach.
Worse has been the media pile-on suggesting Berejiklian has let the case numbers in NSW get out of control. The numbers are not out of control – lockdowns are working and so is vaccination. There was every sign last week that NSW cases had peaked, but the premier was too cautious to claim it.
Warnings from Sydney University modelling, published by the ABC on August 26, of 6000 NSW cases a day by early October have never looked like materialising. The same modelling claimed NSW would face 40,000 cases a day when lockdown restrictions are lifted.
Any outlandish prediction of failure in NSW always gets a run in some parts of the media. In fact Berejiklian really is leading the way for Australia, her hand forced by the infectiousness of the Delta variant. As she told Peta Credlin on Wednesday night on Sky News, it was no surprise Delta took off first in Sydney given the city took more returning travellers than all the other states combined.
Yet many journalists, and particularly those at the ABC with safe, government-guaranteed pay packets, criticised the NSW approach throughout the first month of the present outbreak. They were sure Berejiklian was not locking down hard enough and had not locked down sooner.
She had tried to confine the lockdown to the city’s CBD, eastern and southern suburbs, which were the first areas affected when the virus was spread by an unvaccinated airport driver. The same strategy had worked in January on Sydney’s northern beaches. But the increased infectiousness of Delta forced Berejiklian to lock down all of Greater Sydney, the Blue Mountains, the Illawarra and the Central Coast on June 26.
Too many reporters in the weeks after that decision eagerly repeated Andrews’ self-serving lines about Sydney needing a Melbourne-style “ring of steel”. Andrews knew, these reporters believed, because his government had been the only one in the world to have defeated Delta during the state’s fifth outbreak. Except that may not be correct.
As Credlin said last week, that outbreak was largely the Kappa variant, with few Delta cases. Given Victoria’s sixth lockdown came on August 5 and lockdown five ended on July 27 it seems likely there were undetected Delta cases in the community at the end of the fifth lockdown, and Victoria had probably not “defeated Delta”.
That sort of free pass for a Labor leader is par for the course in much of the media these days. More surprising has been the tick given to Andrews for now taking the same line as NSW on vaccination being the way out of lockdown. Victoria has learned NSW was correct when Berejiklian said lockdowns and contact tracing could not defeat a variant twice as infectious as previous strains.
When Berejiklian in late July said her focus was moving from case numbers to vaccination, many at the ABC, led by health editor Norman Swan on News Breakfast on August 3, suggested she was planning a dangerous experiment on her citizens. Yet there was no such criticism about Andrews when he – correctly in my view – made the same vaccine calculation a few weeks later.
Swan was wrong. Last Tuesday on ABC’s 7.30 he reported on the opening up of Denmark at 74 per cent full vaccination. Turns out NSW was not conducting a world-first experiment. Denmark has been doing what Berejiklian plans to. Imagine that: a state health department with experts who know what’s happening in the rest of the world.
More worrying has been the failure until last week of much of the media to notice Victoria’s outbreak has been growing faster than the spread in NSW. Earlier this month, Credlin on Sky News and in her column in the News Corp Sunday newspapers nailed the issue.
Said Credlin last week of her September 3 story: “I looked at the two data sets out of day 30. What struck me was that Victoria’s new cases at 208 were over double where NSW was (on day 30) at 97.”
Testing on day 30 in NSW was at 77,587 compared with 48,572 in Victoria.
“The numbers for day 37 got worse in comparative terms,” Credlin said. “In NSW, Day 37 … saw 136 cases, 86,620 tests. In Victoria … new cases were 334 (so now almost triple), and half the tests of NSW at 42,998. Worse still were the vaccination rates – NSW 124,645 (day 37), 85,605 Victoria.”
By last Friday, Victoria’s relative performance was deteriorating further. New cases in Victoria on day 44 new totalled 511, compared with 172 on day 44 in NSW. Equivalent day 44 testing rates stood at 95,446 (NSW) and 55,476 (Vic).
“The actual gap (between outbreak numbers) has significantly widened between days 30, 37 and 44,” Credlin said on Friday.
The Nine papers picked up the Victorian angle in a piece by Caitlin Fitzsimmons on September 12. Fran Kelly followed on RN Breakfast the next day, interviewing Victorian epidemiologist Tony Blakely. Yet The Age back on August 25 had actually reported Deakin University epidemiologist Catherine Bennett and University of South Australia’s Adrian Esterman saying Victoria’s virus reproduction rate was higher than that in NSW.
Many journalists who bag Berejiklian, especially on Twitter, continue to operate as if the only KPI a premier should meet is Covid zero. They are about to learn Berejiklian is right. We need to learn to live with the virus, and vaccination is the pathway. Even Andrews has seen the light.
Unless WA and Queensland plan to keep their borders closed forever, their health systems are going to have to deal with outbreaks when NSW and Victoria open and international travel resumes.

Full text: At the same time, 51.9 per cent of the state’s population are now double dosed with the vaccination.
From Monday, residents in hotspot local government areas will be able to enjoy unlimited recreation and gather in groups of up to five fully vaccinated adults, with most restrictions in LGAs of concern to be aligned with other areas.
It comes as NSW recorded its deadliest day yet in the pandemic with 13 deaths recorded in people aged 40 and older, two of which were in people’s homes.
NED-3760-NSW’s new COVID restrictions
People in hotspot areas will be able to travel anywhere within their LGA — or within 5km from home if leaving their LGA — for shopping, exercise, and recreation.
Residents can travel anywhere in Greater Sydney as a guest at a small wedding.
Singles’ buddies can come from anywhere in Greater Sydney and hotspot LGA residents can be a nominated visitor for anyone in Sydney.
Authorised worker conditions requiring vaccination and travel permit requirements will remain.
“Everything will be the same across Greater Sydney, except for the list of authorised workers and the associated permits,” Premier Gladys Berejiklian said.

Local mayor celebrates easing of restrictions The Mayor of Cumberland has celebrated the easing of restrictions for hotspot LGAs as a major win for the community, saying it is “pleasing” the Premier finally heeded calls.
Clr Steve Christou was among 12 mayors who last week pleaded with Premier Gladys Berejiklian to reopen public pools, remove curfews and bring rules in hotspots in line with the rest of Sydney for weeks.
On Sunday, the Premier finally heeded these calls, announcing that from 12.01am on Monday the communities of Bayside, Blacktown, Burwood, Campbelltown, Canterbury-Bankstown, Cumberland, Fairfield, Georges River, Liverpool, Parramatta, Strathfield, and some suburbs of Penrith will face the same rules as the rest of Sydney.
“I’ve been advocating for equality for our LGA for months as the restrictions imposed were out of step with the rest of Sydney,” Clr Christou said.
“Last week, I was one of 12 mayors who met with the Premier to discuss our concerns. I made three requests: an end to curfews, the re-opening of public swimming pools and for the LGAs of concern to come out of restrictions equally with the rest of Sydney. Within days, all three of those have been delivered.
“Today the Premier acknowledged the disparity and huge impact that these lockdown restrictions have had on western Sydney. I’ve been highlighting this for months so it’s pleasing that the Premier has acknowledged this and that western Sydney is leading the way in vaccination rates.”

Victoria’s roadmap to freedom Tennis, basketball and other recreational sports could be reopened in Victoria as early as next week, with the government to free up outdoor activities when the state reaches 80 per cent single-dose vaccinations.
The expected date for this would be September 26.
VCE students are set to sit their GAT test on October 5, and Year 12, final-year VCAL and international baccalaureate students will be able to resume on-site learning.
From October 18, prep students will be allowed back to school three days a week, while gade 1 and 2 students can return two days a week.
More freedoms will be unlocked around October 26, when 70 per cent of Victoria’s eligible population is double-vaccinated.
The lockdown will be lifted and curfew will be scrapped.
All school students can return on-site at least part-time.
The hospitality sector will open for outdoor service, but only fully vaccinated people will be allowed to dine out, with a maximum of 50 patrons.
When Victoria hits 80 per cent full vaccination, indoor service will resume for 25 people.
Haircuts are back at 70 per cent but only for five people.
NED-4588-VIC-roadmap-out-of-lockdown
That jumps to 150 customers at 80 per cent, with beauty and personal care also returning.
Regional Victoria and Melbourne will come under the same plan once 80 per cent of the population aged over 16 is fully vaccinated, which is currently expected around November 5.
This will include allowing up to 10 people at your house and up to 150 fully vaccinated people being able to dine indoors.
Groups of 30 will be allowed outdoors.
Premier Daniel Andrews told Victorians to book an AstraZeneca jab because of concerns about Pfizer supplies.
He said it was “uncertain how much Pfizer is going to come to our country in October.”
“Go and book an AstraZeneca appointment,” he said.

ACT records 17 new Covid cases Canberra has recorded 17 new locally acquired Covid-19 cases, bringing the national capital’s outbreak to 619 cases.
Of the 17 new cases, five were in isolation for their entire infectious period and 12 were contagious in the community.
Eleven of the transmissions have been linked to existing cases while six remained under investigation.
A persistent increase in case numbers saw Canberra’s lockdown extended by another four weeks on Tuesday. It is now set to end on October 15.
Vaccination rate of 80 per cent not ‘freedom day’, AMA warns Australians are being cautioned by the nation’s peak medical body to not view the achievement of key vaccination milestones as “freedom day”.
The Australian Medical Association has cautiously backed the government’s national plan to reopen that nation but warned politicians against selling vaccination targets as a ticket to freedom.
“Achievement of the 70 per cent or 80 per cent vaccination targets in the national plan or the Doherty modelling cannot be regarded or promoted as being ‘freedom day’,” the AMA’s communique said on Sunday.
“These targets must be treated as incremental steps towards higher benchmarks that Doherty will provide further advice on.”
Under the national plan, restrictions for fully vaccinated individuals will be eased once 70 and 80 per cent of the Australian population aged 16 and older are fully vaccinated.
The nation is projected to reach the 70 per cent target in October.
The statement, backed by the body’s 35-member federal council, comes after the Doherty Institute provided updated advice to national cabinet on Friday.
National cabinet was told it would be prudent to maintain “medium” public health measures, such as stay-at-home orders, in areas of concern until an 80 per cent vaccination target was reached.
Advice from the AMA is in lock-step with the Doherty Institute’s advice, with the communique outlining that Australia cannot solely rely on a vaccination strategy.
“Public health measures including restrictions, social distancing, and personal hygiene, alongside testing, contact tracing and quarantine must remain part of the suite of measures used to effectively manage the pandemic,” the statement said.
The AMA said while lockdowns remained an effective tool, the economic and social cost was “not sustainable”.
“Lockdowns are an effective tool and, while we wait for vaccination rates to significantly improve, necessary to protect our health system and the community,” the statement said.
“However, the emergence of the Delta strain has shown that it is very difficult to achieve elimination through lockdowns and we know that they come at a significant social and economic cost that is not sustainable.”

Victoria’s new cases grow to 507 Victoria has recorded 507 new locally acquired Covid-19 cases on Sunday as new cases continue to rise throughout lockdown.
It’s the eighth straight day Victoria has recorded more than 400 new cases and fourth in a row above 500 as infections continue to trend upwards.
One new death was also announced on Sunday.
Eleven people have now died with Covid during the latest outbreak, with 831 lives lost since the start of the pandemic.
The health department did not say how many mystery cases there were or how many were in isolation during their infectious period.
Despite the rising cases, Premier Daniel Andrews is set to reveal Victoria’s road map out of lockdown later on Sunday.
Victorians will learn what new freedoms that will be able to enjoy once 70 per cent of the population is double vaccinated, which is predicted to be in late October.
Face-to-face school classes, outdoor dining and extended travel limits are expected to be some of the first restrictions eased.
Greater freedoms will then be put in place once the state reaches 80 per cent of people aged 16 and older with two doses of the vaccine, which is predicted to be in mid-November.
No new cases were recorded in hotel quarantine on Sunday. More than 20,790 primary close contacts remain in isolation in Victoria. There are now 5262 active cases in the state.

Nurse pressure forces ICU staffing review Staffing in intensive care units is set to be reviewed, with Health Minister Brad Hazzard issuing the order after meeting with frontline nurses.
Mr Hazzard, who described the meeting as “very valuable”, said it was clear ICU nurses and doctors worked in the most “difficult” and “challenging” of environments.
While the government had employed more nurses for ICUs than in the state’s history, staff had argued more were still needed.
Daily Telegraph – News Feed latest episode
“Our ICU nurses and doctors are the people we entrust our lives to when unfortunate circumstances befall us,” Mr Hazzard said.
“I have raised that issue with NSW Health and requested a review of staffing arrangements.”
Mr Hazzard met with a group of ICU nurses about their “grave” concerns in being able to look after patients adequately with existing staff amid the escalating Covid crisis.
The nurses, who are members of the NSW Nurses and Midwives’ Association, hail from Blacktown, Concord, Hornsby, Liverpool, Royal Prince Alfred and Westmead hospitals.
The meeting, which occurred online on Thursday and involved NSW Health Department officials, followed an open letter signed by more than 700 ICU nurses to Premier Gladys Berejiklian and Mr Hazzard calling for urgent staffing increases.

No return to pre-pandemic living ‘in a reasonable time frame’: JPMorgan

Full text: In a sober reading of the Doherty Institute modelling and what it means for the nation’s path away from restrictions, the investment bank said a carefully phased easing of restrictions was most likely amid the prospect of further lockdowns if the test, trace, isolate and quarantine (TTIQ) strategy becomes “sub-optimal”.
It also predicted case numbers in NSW could end up being nearly double the expected peak announced by state Premier Gladys Berejiklian this week, with daily cases surging well into October.
The Doherty modelling, released to the public last month, forms the basis of the government’s reopening plan and states that once 70 per cent vaccine coverage levels are reached in the adult population, lockdowns are unlikely to be needed to keep control of cases and hospitalisations, assuming no new strains, and as long as the TTIQ system keeps working.
But spiralling case numbers in NSW and Victoria could quickly threaten to overwhelm the system.
“We think sub-optimal TTIQ is a reasonable expectation for NSW and possibly VIC,” the JPMorgan team, led by senior insurance analyst Siddharth Parameswaran, warned.
“The Doherty modelling shows that if we open up at 70 per cent with a sub-optimal TTIQ, we would still on average spend 22 per cent of the first 180 days in full lockdown to try to control growth, or we would spend 55 per cent with moderate lockdowns to constrain growth to manageable levels.”
NSW case numbers could surge through September and well into October, based on the bank’s own modelling, reaching a peak of 3700 cases a day by mid-October before declining, the analysts said. This assumes the current rate of vaccination continues and with a vaccine efficacy of 75 per cent.
JPMorgan’s prediction is at odds with the NSW government’s modelling, released this week, which projects a likely peak in infections, at up to 2000 per day in the LGAs of concern, will be reached in the next week or so.
NSW reported 1220 new cases on Tuesday, down slightly on Monday’s figures, with eight deaths recorded.
The state on Saturday reached the 40 per cent double-dose vaccination mark for people aged 16 and over and is looking at easing restrictions in mid-October.
“Case growth is very strong, suggesting a higher peak in cases,” JPMorgan said.
“We have increased our forecast significantly for new cases per day as there has been stronger exponential growth in cases than we previously forecast.”
Hitting 3700 cases a day in October would pressure the hospital system, the analysts warned.
“Current caseloads in NSW are increasing and will reach levels that will significantly pressure the hospital system, and caseloads could remain elevated if restrictions are eased off, even if vaccination levels continue to increase.”
The investment bank expects NSW to hit its 70 per cent target by October 7, followed by 80 per cent fully vaccinated by October 19.
Victoria’s limited success against delta despite its strategy of going hard and early was a warning to other states pursuing a zero-Covid strategy, they said.
“Zero Covid will eventually be very difficult to maintain given the infectiousness of delta.
“Still, it makes sense for states like WA and Queensland to open borders very carefully/slowly given the greater freedoms their populations currently enjoy.”
A phased management of different levels of restrictions is the most likely scenario once the country gets to its 70 per cent vaccinated target, according to the banking analysts.
Density rules would apply but retail and schools would reopen, and travel would be allowed. Around 70 per cent of symptomatic cases would be in children, “but deaths would not follow infections due to their much lower susceptibility,” the analysts noted.
But there won’t be any sudden return to normality, they predicted.
“It is unlikely we will see life return to 2019 type-living without social distancing in a reasonable time frame.
“This is perhaps even more likely to ring true for the medical settings which, going forward it seems, will have to shift a significant component of emergency resources for an extended period of time to deal with elevated caseloads of Covid.”

State and federal politicians bickering over support as tourism industry bleeds ‘$7m a day’

Full text: In a blistering opinion piece published in today’s Cairns Post, Leichhardt MP Warren Entsch called on Premier Annastacia Palaszczuk to outline her plans for the Far North once the state reaches 80 per cent vaccination coverage and what financial support was forthcoming in the meantime.
“These are legitimate questions she needs to answer. My guess is nothing will be forthcoming except more fearmongering, misinformation and a good-old dose of blaming the Australian Government,” Mr Entsch said.
Repeated leaks of Covid-19 from hotel quarantine combined with what was until recently a sluggish vaccination rollout have put most of Australia’s east coast in lockdown, hammering tour operators dependent on domestic travel after the federal government closed the international borders in March 2020.

A spokesman for the Premier said the state government was supporting business, and that the federal government’s response to providing more support to Far North businesses was “met with a flat ‘no’.”
Caught up in the midst of the blame game are Far North families and businesses who rely on tourism to survive.
According to Tropical North Queensland Tourism, since the borders were closed last year, the international tourism market has been decimated, the region is losing $7 million a day out of its economy, 6000 staff have lost their jobs, and another 3150 are under threat between now and Christmas.
And to top it off, the region’s businesses have had just 72 days since March 2020 where they have not had to contend with some sort of state border restraint or restriction.
The industry has spent more than a month stridently advocating for either government to come up with some sort of wage support but none has so far been forthcoming.
On Sunday morning, the Premier appeared supportive of the national plan to reopen the country once all states hit the 80 per cent vaccination target for those eligible.
“We’ve been hearing extensively about the modelling of 80 per cent … and the reports of national cabinet. Absolutely we need to aim for 80 per cent and above,” Ms Palaszczuk said.
She also said there was more data and modelling coming to national cabinet from the Doherty Institute and that “what we were hearing about the 80 per cent plus vaccination rates for all of the country, was very encouraging”.
“You know, everyone wants to open up when its safe to open up but the key to that is that over 80 per cent, that 80 per cent and above vaccination rates.”

Full text: Tolerance for snap lockdowns and closure of state borders is diminishing. A survey by Compass Polling last week found seven out of 10 Australians want border closures to be nationally co-ordinated rather than allowing states to continue to go it alone. It is the view held by six out of 10 Queenslanders.
Annastacia Palaszczuk, however, refuses to let go of the state-versus-state, mate-versus-mate mentality she has adopted since the start of the pandemic. Her new threshold for business as usual is absurdly unachievable: the immunisation of infants with a vaccine not yet approved for use in children under 12 in a state where adults appear unusually hesitant to receive it themselves.
Queensland is firmly anchored at the bottom of the vaccine table alongside WA. By Friday night, 72.6 per cent of people in NSW had had one jab and 40.3 per cent had had two, compared to just 52.7 per cent and 34.1 per cent in Queensland. It begs the question who should be closing their borders against who.
One premier at least is prepared to have the honest discussion, long overdue, that all leaders will have to get around to eventually. The light at the end of the tunnel means “accepting Covid is part of our lives, accepting that, unfortunately, people will die”, said Gladys Berejiklian on Friday, “but they will be less likely to die if everybody is vaccinated. This is the reality”.
Deputy Labor leader Richard Marles says it's "important" for all state premiers to support the national plan to re-open the country. "It's important that we are working with all the states to get the country behind the national plan so we can get to a place to end lockdowns in a safe way," Mr Marles told Sky News Australia. Queensland Premier Annastacia Palaszczuk has been calling on the Doherty Institute to conduct further research on how opening borders early would impact children. Ms Palaszczuk on Friday doubled down on her concern for children facing the Delta variant and stressed the Queensland government was not abandoning the national plan. Mr Marles also said Ms Palaszczuk does support the federal government's national plan to re-open, despite making those comments. "What's important is that the federal government is working with the states to bring them along in terms of making sure the national plan is able to operate across very different circumstances which are being experienced in the different states across the country," he said. "It requires federal leadership, and it's federal leadership, to be frank, that we have not had from Scott Morrison from day one in respect to this."
The nature of the Delta variant means the number of active cases may rise higher, even when the stipulated vaccination rates are achieved, judging by the experience of others. Israel may be the promised land for the children of Abraham, but not for the vaccinated. Israel’s vaccination rate has reached 78 per cent of those 12 and over, but there were 1100 new cases per million last week compared to 134 per million in NSW.
The Doherty Institute modelling demonstrates that we can expect better protection with an over-16s vaccination rate of 70 per cent and better still at 80 per cent, but the protection gains grow marginally smaller. Part of the honest conversation premiers such as Palaszczuk are reluctant to have is that the vaccines are somewhat leaky.
How leaky they are is beginning to come clear in the weekly surveillance reports from the UK, which tracks and reports data far better than most. There is enough evidence to be confident that a single dose of AstraZeneca reduces the risk of showing symptoms by 55-70 per cent and the chance of dying by 75-85 per cent. A second dose appears to reduce the odds further, although the evidence is less firm.
The question yet to be answered to the satisfaction of British medical scientists is the likelihood that a vaccinated person will transmit the virus to someone else. Their conclusion, that “little evidence is available at present and results are inconclusive”, is hardly the reassurance for which we might have hoped.
The news from abroad, however, is less grim once we look beyond the raw case numbers. The picture is consistent: in the most vaccinated population, deaths are significantly less common and fewer people are treated in hospital. Covid-19 does, indeed, become more like the flu and even less like Ebola, which is something else the fear-mongering premiers find difficult to talk about. Having spent 18 months trying to scare us witless, they are finding it hard to change tack.
Queensland Premier Annastacia Palaszczuk apologises to the public for allowing NRL WAGs to fly into the state while thousands of residents were blocked from returning home during the quarantine pause, admitting it 'was not the right look'.
Perhaps they can start by un-fudging the figures, as the NSW government has started to do. Last week, we discovered the actual death toll from Covid-19 is almost certainly lower than the one that has been officially reported. NSW deputy chief health officer Jeremy McNulty acknowledged that dying with Covid-19 is not the same as dying of Covid-19 and that the distinction was now being made in the official count. Since most of those who die are elderly and have multiple comorbidities, it is an important detail when assessing the level of risk.
Coming to terms with coronavirus requires us to wrestle with the question of whether it was ever as bad as we thought it was and if the response was proportionate to the risk. The answer will almost certainly be no. Closing our external borders was demonstrably effective. So, too, was the targeted protection of the elderly, particularly in institutional care. The absence of large outbreaks in nursing homes for nearly a year is the main reason deaths in the latest outbreak are thankfully few.
Lockdowns are much harder to justify given the cost to economic and personal wellbeing, a cost that increases exponentially the longer they continue. The evidence they work is much less firm than we might like to think since there is seldom a reliable control group against which results can be compared. The mounting case numbers in NSW after more than two months of lockdown prove nothing. Some will argue the number of cases would have been higher if not for the lockdown, but that is a conclusion based on supposition, not evidence.
At what vaccination level these lockdowns should end is a political judgment, not one that can be based on science. It requires a level of courage few leaders have been prepared to muster so far in this pandemic. The wiser heads in government, however, will have surely concluded by now what is obvious from the experience abroad; that living with Covid-19 means living with an active threat to health, not just a theoretical risk. They will have concluded, too, that this episode in our national life was made more painful by a lack of preparation and the unresolved tensions in the Constitution that were taken as licence by some premiers to play politics at a time of national crisis. Now the pathway back to normality has been agreed upon, the next item on the agenda should be preparing for the next viral threat.

Two jabs key to unlocking Victorian events

Full text: Almost one million new doses of Pfizer and a plan to start vaccine passport trials allowing fully vaccinated people to ­attend events outdoors may deliver a spring break.
In a welcome relief from the state’s crippling lockdown, Premier Daniel Andrews said discussions with industry figures on the trials were “well and truly advanced”.
The Saturday Herald Sun has been told Victorians could be ­attending outdoor music and sporting events, pubs and restaurants within weeks under the trials.
Industry leaders have backed the pilot programs, ­revealing the digital passports would cement the state’s path out of the pandemic and could lead to significant crowds at the spring racing carnival.
NED-4476-Covid-19-Vaccine-Rates-Melbourne
Victorian Chamber of Commerce and Industry chief executive Paul Guerra said he believed such events could safely operate once 70 per cent of the state’s population had received one dose, which would be later this month.
“There’s still a chance to hold significant crowds at spring carnival. This is a race, so let’s use our race to signal that Victoria is open again,” he said.
The digital passport system, which Mr Guerra indicated could be linked to the Service Victoria app and the federal government’s vaccination certificate, has been touted as the genuine “path forward”.
“It would be as simple as you get a green tick when you check in and you get a green tick if you’ve been vaccinated,” he said.
“The person checking it at the venue only has to see two green ticks and you’re allowed in. You only need to look overseas to see that these passports are likely to be an integral part of opening up.”
Premier Daniel Andrews on Friday said the trials would provide an opportunity to ­ensure technology, processes and systems worked.
“They’ll happen very soon, and the discussions are well and truly advanced,” he said.
Australian Hotels Association Victorian branch chief executive Paddy O’Sullivan said the plans were promising.
“We will support anything that will open the doors of a pub or hotel,” Mr O’Sullivan said.
“Regional pubs and hotels are fighting to survive. We look for any opportunity to re-open and are willing to discuss models for vaccination-only staff and customers.”
It comes as Mr Andrews warned he would enforce a strict “lockout” for those refusing to get vaccinated against Covid-19 once double-dose thresholds had been reached. “What will become a bigger part of our response is a lockout of many venues for those who are not vaccinated,” he said.NED-4486-Vic-roadmap
“If you’re vaccinated, you are going to be able to participate in the economy, you’re going to be able to go to a pub, the cinema, to a sporting event, you’re going to be able to do all sorts of things.
“Far from being locked into your house, you will have freedoms that an unvaccinated person is not going to be able to do. They will be locked out of a whole range of venues ­because they could be vaccinated, and they’ve chosen not to.
“I am not going to lock down the whole state to protect people who wouldn’t protect themselves.”
Mr Andrews also hinted that more restrictions could be scrapped from September 23, once 70 per cent of first doses had been carried out.
“We are on track to beat that target and get there a bit earlier than planned so that is fantastic news,” he said.
Victoria recorded 208 new locally acquired cases and one death on Friday.
A man in his 60s from Altona North became the third fatality in a number of days. It’s not yet known if he had underlying health conditions or whether he was vaccinated.
Of the new cases, 96 were linked to known outbreaks, with contact tracers scrambling to find the sources of 112 mystery cases.
Two of the cases were ­detected in Shepparton, while 128 were centred in Melbourne’s northern suburbs, 48 in the western suburbs and 13 in the east.
Covid-19 commander Jeroen Weimar said he had become concerned about the way Covid-safe plans were being used in some workplaces.
This came after 20 cases were linked to a large construction site outbreak in Box Hill, while four cases were ­detected in a western suburbs distribution centre.
The state government flagged that home quarantining trials were in the works, and school ventilation system assessments were being done to make classrooms safer.
New geolocation technology – that would monitor home quarantining compliance – has also been said to be a realistic opportunity to bring home Victorians stranded in NSW.

PFIZER BOOST TO SPEED UP ROLLOUT Victoria is set to reach its 70 per cent vaccination target ahead of time after the federal government secured almost one million extra Pfizer doses for the state.
Thousands more Pfizer appointments will open up within days, giving the state an earlier exit from its harsh lockdown.
The state has been aiming to reach 70 per cent of the eligible population given one dose by September 23.
But the extra Pfizer doses could bring that forward by up to a fortnight at the current rate of vaccination.
Premier Daniel Andrews announced last week that the 5km travel ban would be eased to 10km and outdoor exercise increased from two to three hours a day when 70 per cent of the population have had one dose.
On Friday, Prime Minister Scott Morrison said Australia had inked a swap deal with the UK in which four million doses would be rushed Down Under. The vaccine will begin arriving in Australia on Sunday, with almost a million doses earmarked for Victoria.
Mr Morrison said the deal gave Australians four million reasons to be hopeful.
“The plane’s on the tarmac now – it will be leaving tomorrow, and those doses will be coming over the course of the next few weeks, which will see us double the Pfizer doses that we have during September,” he said.
The extra doses are in addition to the 131,000 extra doses coming to the state from the swap deal with Singapore.
Under the deals, Australia will receive 4.5 million extra doses immediately in return for doses due to arrive here later in the year which will not then be needed.
In the past week, 507,000 people in Victoria have been vaccinated, meaning the extra doses have the capacity to bring forward the state’s target of 70 per cent for full vaccination.
The national cabinet meeting on Friday was described by government sources as “very constructive” in comparison to last week’s more acrimonious meeting.
Most of the discussion focused on the Doherty Institute modelling, which is examining the likely impact on the nation’s health systems when the country abandons the current hard suppression strategy.
The government believes the modelling is likely to be released next week.
It was also reported that Australia’s first shipment of Moderna vaccines had been pushed out by two weeks.

Premier apologises over NRL flight as state records zero Covid cases

Full text: Her apology was issued at a press conference in which Chief Health Officer Jeannette Young responded angrily to journalists’ questioning about Covid-19 deaths and Deputy Premier Steven Miles accused the federal government of a ‘pile on’ over comments surrounding the Doherty modelling.
Ms Palaszczuk confirmed there had been no new cases of Covid-19 in the past 24 hours, and that there was minimal concern about the cases of two truckies positive with the virus in the state this week.
It comes after the state was on Covid alert on Thursday after a family entered the state from Covid-ravaged Melbourne. Members of the family tested negative for the virus.
Ms Palaszczuk said it was “good news” the state had a “double doughnut” day but again urged people to come forward for testing and to get vaccinated for Covid-19.
Ms Palaszczuk apologised for the controversial decision which allowed NRL players’ families to enter Queensland while the border was shut to thousands of desperate residents trying to get home.
Three days after The Courier-Mail revealed exemptions had been granted, and following days of sustained criticism both in the community and in Queensland Parliament, the Premier today conceded it wasn’t the right decision.
“It was not the right thing to do when we had the pause (on hotel quarantine),” she said.
“It shouldn’t have happened.
“Unfortunately, it did happen, and I extend my apologies to the public about that.”
The state government has defended the decision all week, insisting the families and officials were operating outside Queensland’s hotel quarantine cap - meaning they weren’t taking rooms off people coming home.
Sky News host Peter Gleeson has ripped into Queensland Premier Annastacia Palaszczuk for her "scandalous" policy decision to ignore her own government's health protocols to grant special entry for NRL families into the state."I mean I've never seen a more bizarre, scandalous, stupid, dumb decision to allow players' wives to come in while denying Queenslanders the opportunity to come back and reunite with their families," he said. "Today she's copped so much heat over it."Today she's come out with a little bit of a concession; she had to change the narrative."
Chief health officer Jeannette Young on Thursday also defended the decision, saying the NRL 100 per cent funded its bubble including accommodation, security and health care.
But the Premier today said, “It shouldn’t have happened when we had the reduction happening in our hotels.”
Pressed on why she hadn’t admitted it was the wrong decision earlier this week, in light of parliament sitting, Ms Palaszczuk said because other issues were being discussed.
Pressed further around the fact she was asked about the exemption during Question Time this week, the Premier said, “I don’t have the exact question on me sorry.”
Ms Palaszczuk said authorities had worked very hard over the last week to get the “pressure cooker” of the hotel caps down so that more Queenslanders could come home.
People trying to return home to Queensland have been told to check the Queensland Health website and that they will still need to have the correct paperwork.
Addressing criticism of her comments around Doherty modelling, the Premier rejected claims of “fear-mongering” and said it was “only fair and reasonable” to have a conversation about these issues.
“There is nothing wrong with asking decent questions about the safety of families,” she said.
She likened the conversation to the debate around the protection of older people that had seen the mandatory vaccination of aged care workers.
“It is not about being against a national plan. We are all for a national plan,” she said.
“So let’s have an educated national conversation about these issues.
“These are real issues and I think that we can come up with the answers.”
Ms Palaszczuk said she was not fear mongering.
“At the beginning of this pandemic we were very concerned about the elderly ... and now what we’re seeing in evidence out of the US it is the pandemic of the unvaccinated, a lot more children are presenting with Covid and a lot more children are ending up in ICU,” she said.
“I don’t want to have that happen here.
“This is about Queenslanders and having a conversation - what will we need to do?”
Ms Palaszczuk said national cabinet had agreed to look at this issue.
She said the fact her Labor colleagues in Canberra had distanced themselves from her comments was “a matter for them”.
“Queenslanders know me ... and I look forward to the day we can open up,” she said.
She said she looked forward to a time people could go on holiday and be reunited with loved ones, but vaccination rates weren’t there yet.
Deputy Premier Steven Miles described criticism from the federal government yesterday as a “pile on” not experienced for some time.
“Don’t fall for Scott Morrison’s marketing tactics,” he said of the Doherty modelling.
“This is much more complex than a number and a three-word slogan.”
He said it was clear the Prime Minister had “both his eyes on the election and no eyes on the outbreak ripping through Sydney right now”.
Queensland Deputy Premier Steven Miles criticises Prime Minister Scott Morrison saying he sent six of his team out yesterday to attack Premier Annastacia Palaszczuk in a 'pile on' not seen since the election.
Dr Young fired up when she was questioned over deaths related to Covid-19, saying she was a doctor and not comfortable with any deaths.
“I went into medicine to save lives,” she said.
And she denied making any political decisions.
“You’ve got my quite upset now,” she said.
“I don’t want to see the death of any Queenslanders,” she said, clarifying that that included deaths from smoking, obesity, road deaths and any disease, not just Covid.
She said she wouldn’t make any decision around the pathway to open up until “every single Queenslander has been given the opportunity to be vaccinated”.
Queensland chief health officer Dr Jeannette Young gets emotional during questioning by reporters about Covid deaths saying 'you've got me quite upset now'.
Dr Young also urged everyone 16 years or older to get vaccinated, saying it was the “best protection” as it was only a matter of time before the state had another outbreak.
Ms Palaszczuk announced that another 600 hotel quarantine places would be offered from Monday for families stuck in Victoria and NSW and unable to return home.
That’s on top of 50 rooms tomorrow.
But there were 3000 border passes that were cancelled when Queensland made the decision last week to impose a pause on the hotel quarantine program.
“As you did know, we did have a pressure cooker situation,” she said.
She said “having that respite” had made a lot of difference.
Health Minister Yvette D’Ath said Queensland’s vaccine rollout was more difficult than other states due to the decentralised nature of the state.
“We need to make sure we’re hitting those targets out in our rural and remote communities as well,” she said.
The state couldn’t just hit targets in the southeast if there were small communities at just 30 per cent, for example, she said.
Ms D’Ath said the Gold Coast school had reopened
As far as the comments about zero to 12-year-old’s, Ms D’Ath said it was important to remember how the virus had spread through the recent Indooroopiloly schools cluster “so it is important to have that conversation”.
She encouraged the public to read the Doherty modelling themselves.
The family at the centre of the latest Covid scare came to the attention of authorities are two children attending the Australian International Islamic College on the Gold Coast on August 31 said they had been to Melbourne, forcing the school to close.
Authorities believe the family, now in hotel quarantine, returned undetected via an inland route.
Queensland Police Commissioner Katarina Carroll described the family’s decision to travel to Melbourne as “incredibly disappointing”.
She said that police are still investigating the circumstances of how the family of five re-entered the state but they are believed to have come via back roads to cross the border.
“It is obviously incredibly disappointing.”
Commissioner Carroll said that police would be doing all they could to track the family’s movements through Melbourne and New South Wales.
“We will be investigating where they came from in Melbourne, but also travelled through New South Wales.”
“You can be assured that if there are any offences that they will be investigated.”
Commissioner Carroll said that the family has been co-operating but made clear that police were not afraid to take enforcement action.
“Thankfully, the family is co-operating, so that has been good progress in the last day or so,” she said.
“But if action needs to be taken, it certainly will be.”
Qld Vaccination rates
Late last night the school principal revealed the family’s tests were negative.
“It is with relief that I inform you that all results for the Gold Coast family who have been the subject of investigation have come back negative,” principal Christine Harman wrote to families.
Chief health officer Jeannette Young earlier confirmed a lockdown hinged on the results of the family’s testing.
Queensland had one local case on Thursday – a truck driver who went to NSW and was unknowingly infectious from Saturday to Wednesday.
Dr Young said she did not know what her level of concern was as yet. But she was “less concerned” about a truckie from NSW who spent 24 hours in the community from August 25-26, mainly at truck stops in Goondiwindi, Bundamba and Archerfield.
AIIC principal Christine Harman told parents she was working closely with authorities.
“Our college became aware that members of our Carrara campus community may have returned from a Covid-19 hotspot,” she said. “Based on our initial inquiries … we were unable to determine whether they had undertaken the mandatory hotel quarantine period of the manner by which they entered the state.
“As a result, we immediately took proactive and precautionary steps to safeguard our school community and contacted the appropriate authorities to investigate our concerns.”

Full text: PREMIER SLAMMED FOR ‘SELECTIVE’ USE OF DATA PREMIER Annastacia Palaszczuk has been accused of misrepresenting the number of Covid deaths Australia faces and undermining public confidence even as she called for “serious discussions” on the path forward.
But Chief Health Officer Dr Jeannette Young defended the Premier from political fire, arguing Queenslanders needed to “understand what the risks are”.
In a highly-charged parliamentary performance, Ms Palaszczuk relied on a single graph and extrapolated, worst-case scenario Doherty modelling that relied on a reopening model which is not being proposed by any jurisdiction to warn of the impending body count. “Doherty Institute modelling predicts that even with 70 per cent of the population vaccinated, 80 people will die each day from Covid once the outbreak reaches six months after it started,” she said.
“That is 2240 who will die each month.” Pointing to the situation in NSW, she repeatedly promised to protect Queenslanders, and asked LNP members if they were “on Queensland’s side or are you on the other side?” But claims of mass death and children being vulnerable under the national plan were blasted as “false, misleading and wrong” during a press conference with federal Health Minister Greg Hunt and Chief Medical Officer Paul Kelly.
Federal authorities say the figures used represented what would happen with no restrictions in place, but that the national cabinet plan was for restrictions, quarantine and strong test, trace and isolate measures to remain in place at a 70 per cent vaccination rate.
Dr Young defended Ms Palaszczuk’s “responsible” comments that were repeated in a tweet to 186,000 followers, telling reporters: “Our Premier has to make sure that our population in Queensland understands what the risks are.” “They’re the figures, you can see them on the website,” she said. “Well I believe it is (responsible),” she added.
“You’ve got to look at the extremes. If you look at the extremes you can then work out what you then need to do and that’s what modelling does for you.” Mr Hunt (left) disagreed that the Premier’s message was responsible. “She is selectively misusing the Doherty modelling, it breaches good faith and damages public confidence,” he said.
Mr Hunt said the Doherty Institute made it clear that “with optimal public health measures and no lockdowns this can be significantly reduced to 2787 infections and 13 deaths”.
Doherty Institute modelling shows if the country opened up at 70 per cent and the national plan was followed, the number of deaths in the first six months of an outbreak would be 13.
If there were no low level restrictions and test and trace measures were failing, in the worst case scenario deaths would be about 1457 in the first six months – lower than the Premier’s calculations.
Meanwhile, the Doherty Institute modelling specifically took into consideration children, Mr Hunt said following Ms Palaszczuk’s fears around the vulnerability of unvaccinated young children and calls for more modelling.
“The claim that children were not considered is false, wrong and inaccurate,” Mr Hunt said.
Queensland LNP Senator Matt Canavan said it was disgraceful for the Premier to use children as “blackmail” to justify harsh restrictions continuing.
Using a slang term for an entitled person who makes unjustified demands, he said Ms Palaszczuk was “fast becoming ‘the Karen’ of the coronavirus pandemic for her heartless approach”.
Chief Medical Officer Paul Kelly declined to address the Premier’s claims directly, to avoid politicisation of his federal role, but he said people needed to learn to live with Covid.
“There will be people that die from Covid,” Dr Kelly said.
He said there would be additional analysis around the Doherty Institute’s modelling presented at national cabinet on Friday, “looking at what we’re actually seeing on the ground in NSW”. “For example, starting at a base of cases,” he said.

Deaths, children become leaders' focus

Full text: Premiers have begun debating acceptable deaths while living with COVID-19 as a federal-state brawl over children's vaccinations is set to come to a head at national cabinet on Friday.
Premiers and chief ministers will be briefed on new modelling advice from the Doherty Institute, including on vaccinating children under 12, quarantine updates from Jane Halton and South Australia's home quarantine trial, and public health measures from Health Department secretary Brendan Murphy.
The discussion will turn to the transition plan.
Queensland Premier Annastacia Palaszczuk doubled down on her concerns about unvaccinated children, but Australia's chief medical officer Paul Kelly assured that children are still less severely affected than adults.
Just three out of 3 out of 3815 children aged under 12 infected with the Delta strain of COVID-19 in Australia have had severe illness, Professor Kelly said.
"My message is if you are a parent, particularly a parent of a younger child, get vaccinated. This is the way you can protect yourself and protect your children."
Health Minister Greg Hunt slammed the Queensland Premier for saying the Doherty Institute modelling showed that even with 70 per cent of the population vaccinated deaths could be as high as 80 per day six months after the outbreak.
"Selectively misusing the Doherty modelling breaches good faith and damages public confidence," he told reporters on Thursday.
But Premier Palaszczuk did not back away, reiterating demands for modelling on Covid's impact in the cohort.
Queensland may restore some restrictions lifted in recent weeks after a truck driver crossing from the NSW border tested positive after five days in the state, sparking new exposure sites. While the NSW government is contemplating easing restrictions despite new daily cases remaining in the thousands and seven new deaths.
Premier Gladys Berejiklian said "people will die" but Australia must accept it will never eliminate the virus.
"We can't pretend that we're separate nations within one nation," she said.
NSW became the first jurisdiction to reach 70 per cent of over-16s having had one dose of the vaccine, as efforts to spreading the use of existing doses in Victoria to maximise coverage means both Pfizer and AstraZeneca doses are now administered six weeks apart.

"It's really frustrating that reporting of this generally is just regurgitating what certain federal politicians are saying, suggests that 70 per cent is Freedom Day - it's not, it can't be."
New analysis from the Australia Institute's Richard Denniss noted that Doherty modellers could not be blamed for not anticipating the NSW government would do "such a bad job" at controlling an outbreak.
"But you can blame politicians and business leaders who are using the Doherty modelling to justify opening interstate travel when the modelling provides no clear evidence that it would be safe to do so."
Simplified assumptions in the model does not make it a bad model, he said, but using a model that assumes a problem cannot arise to affirm the lack of a problem was bad.
"Their modelling is based on a hypothetical national outbreak that is evenly spread across Australia, but the question that state premiers and the Prime Minister are now facing is what should the COVID-zero states do?
"It might be inconvenient to say this, but the Doherty modelling simply doesn't help answer that question."
A little over 36 per cent of over-16s across the country are now fully vaccinated. More than 330,000 doses were administered in the latest 24-hour snapshot, bringing the total to more than 20 million dose.
On Thursday the TGA advised of two more extremely rare blood-clotting deaths linked to AstraZeneca doses.
It comes as the TGA and the National COVID-19 Clinical Evidence Taskforce urged against acquiring or self-administering the horse medicine Ivermerctin.

Queensland Premier says thousands will die each month if borders open

Full text: The Queensland Premier cited preferred modelling from the Doherty Institute when making the claim, but many have rebuked the assumption of the data including the Federal Health Minister who said the misuse of the numbers “breaches good faith and damages public confidence”.
Ms Palaszczuk fired off a number of tweets on Thursday morning as she stood in state parliament and furiously defended her position.
“If NSW is the model of what lies in store for all of us, then serious discussions are needed,” Ms Palaszczuk tweeted.
“Doherty Institute modelling predicts, even with 70 per cent of the population vaccinated, 80 people will die each day six months after the outbreak.
“That’s 2240 who will die each month.”
But the Premier’s interpretation of the data has been criticised as inaccurate because she assumed the number of deaths a day will occur in perpetuity rather than peaking at 80 and then beginning to fall.
Therefore, the declaration of 2240 deaths, which is 80 deaths a day for 28 days, is an very unlikely occurrence based on the institute’s modelling.
The maximum number of deaths is also assumed as a worst-case scenario and is only applied when vaccination coverage sits at 70 per cent.
Ms Palaszczuk’s comments assume this percentage of vaccination will be in place for an extended period of time but it is considered the rate will climb to 80 per cent at a relatively steady pace.
Federal Health Minister Greg Hunt said the flawed interpretation of the data would serve to damage crucial communications to manage the health crisis.
“Selectively misusing the Doherty modelling breaches good faith and damages public confidence,” he told reporters.
The figures shared by Ms Palaszczuk were also played down by Gladys Berejiklian who said the numbers represented a potential loss of life across the nation which the NSW Premier said was similar to the number of annual deaths caused by the flu.
“I know this is a very difficult conversation to have,” she told reporters on Thursday morning.
“This is what will get us through, this is the light at the end of the tunnel — accepting covid is part of our lives, accepting that unfortunately people will die.
“But they will be less likely to die if everybody is vaccinated and this is the reality.
“That is why, as New South Wales is the largest state, we have often had to lead the debate on this, and often I have had to say something as a state leader, as difficult as it has been, it is to help all of us come together and manage the transition to living with covid-normal.”
The tweets come after the Queensland Premier was blasted by the Morrison government over her refusal to agree to a plan to open borders.
National cabinet was presented with modelling from the Doherty Institute recently which advised lockdowns and enforced border closures would no longer be needed when jab protection reaches a specific threshold.
But Ms Palaszczuk continues to defy instructions from federal counterparts, infuriating many senior Morrison government cabinet figures.
A steady stream of senior federal cabinet ministers tore into the Queensland Premier after she raised concerns on Wednesday about the need to vaccinate children, creating a new barrier to open borders.
Ms Palaszczuk also told parliament she wants more research into the impacts of Covid-19 on children and for this risk to be considered in the modelling.
“Unless there is an answer on how these young people are going to be vaccinated, you are putting this most vulnerable population at risk,” she said.
“You open up this state and you let the virus in here, every child under 12 is vulnerable.”
Home Affairs Minister Karen Andrews accused the Premier of “scaremongering” while Federal Treasurer Josh Frydenberg continued the assault on the state leader on Thursday.
“It‘s a desperate denial of the reality and is not based on the medical advice,” he told Sunrise.
“The medical advice is that we should vaccinated people aged 12 to 15 – which we’re doing.”

Full text: Premier Daniel Andrews has prompted dismay from some health experts and business groups with a more cautious than expected loosening of restrictions that could still mean Melbourne is locked down for months and recording 2000 daily coronavirus cases by October.
Mr Andrews announced yesterday that the current lockdown, Melbourne's sixth of the coronavirus pandemic, would not be eased for three more weeks.
The only restriction lifted was to reopen playgrounds, dashing hopes that Melbourne's curfew and the statewide five-kilometre travel restriction might also be removed as a first step on a pathway towards a more normal life.
On Tuesday the government had flagged a "modest" relaxation of restrictions and a road map out of lockdown based on the number of community transmission cases staying low, but Mr Andrews said yesterday that he had abandoned that plan when the state recorded an unexpectedly high 120 new cases.
"We've thrown everything at this, but it's now clear to us that we are not going to drive these numbers down - they are instead going to increase," he said. "Now it's up to us to ensure that they don't increase too fast and they don't increase too much."
The remaining restrictions will stay in place until 70 per cent of the eligible Victorian population has received at least one dose of vaccine, expected about September 23, before a further, slight easing of rules.
As of yesterday, about 57 per cent of Victorians had received one dose of the vaccine, while 35 per cent had been fully vaccinated.
The Premier insisted that at least some restrictions would need to remain until the national plan figure of at least 70 per cent of the eligible population receiving two doses of the vaccine had been reached, to prevent coronavirus cases overwhelming the healthcare system.
Industry groups derided Mr Andrews' announcement for its lack of an ambitious plan to revitalise the economy, while the state opposition slammed it as a "huge kick in the guts".
Innes Willox, chief executive of the national employer association Ai Group, contrasted NSW "outlining its ambitions to reopen Sydney's international border by November while Victoria announced plans to reopen playgrounds".
"It says it all really," Mr Willox said. "Our two largest states need to get on the same page as soon as possible and this will be best achieved by Victoria raising its aspirations for COVID freedom beyond such small mercies."
NSW reported 1116 new local coronavirus cases yesterday, the fifth consecutive day with cases above 1000. Another four women died from the virus.
Melbourne's playground ban has been overturned in recognition of the mental health impact of the prolonged lockdown on children.
But under the new rules, playgrounds will only be for children under 12 with one parent or carer, and adults will not be allowed to remove their masks to eat or drink. Playgrounds will also have QR codes for checking in.
"In the last two days, the number of cases, the nature of those cases, the depth of the seeding of this outbreak has become clear and the Chief Health Officer's advice to me and to the government has fundamentally changed," Mr Andrews said.
"The data and the evidence and the experts are very clear with us: we will not see those case numbers go down; they are going to go up. The question is by how many and how fast."
Melbourne's 9pm curfew will remain for now - a decision that some infectious diseases experts did not agree with.
"I do think the curfew could go," said Deakin University epidemiologist Catherine Bennett.
"It creates more mental pressure than anything you gain in terms of infection control.
Vast swaths of regional Victoria may be released from lockdown next week, but community leaders remain divided, with some frustrated that restrictions are not being lifted immediately and others favouring a gradual easing of rules. Melbourne community leaders were less equivocal.
State Opposition Leader Michael O'Brien said too many Victorians had sacrificed so much during what was meant to be a "short, sharp" lockdown.
"There's nothing in this for our schoolkids to get back in the classroom, there's nothing in this for businesses to get back open, there's nothing in this for families to see each other," he said.
Melbourne lord mayor Sally Capp said the latest lockdown extension was devastating news for Melbourne's small businesses at an incredibly tough time.
"Business owners are desperate to know when they can open their doors and welcome back customers," she said. "They are craving hope."
Victorian Chamber of Commerce and Industry chief executive Paul Guerra shared a similar frustration.
"We asked for a plan, a road map, ambition and hope," Mr Guerra said. "Instead, we got confirmation that most Victorian businesses will remain unable to trade for the foreseeable future."
University of Melbourne epidemiologist Tony Blakely, who early last week advocated a lighter lockdown to ease the mental health burden, said yesterday that Victoria was no longer in a position to ease any restrictions.
He said cases had been increasing on average by 5 per cent every day since last week and if the daily rise was faster than that by September 23, the government should consider halting its plans to ease further restrictions.
"The moonshot was if cases hadn't moved, and stayed at 40 per day, you could have relaxed restrictions slightly and let cases go up to 500 by the end of October," Professor Blakely said.
"We lost that headroom because cases are going up ... and the game has changed.
"If the virus was continuing on its current trajectory we are going to peak in October at 2000 a day. That's not a scenario we're looking forward to. We don't want to be relaxing restrictions now and giving the virus any more room to move.
"If it went from 5 per cent daily increase to even 6 or 7 per cent, at the end of October, that peak would be two or three times higher. We really are in a bind."
While acknowledging yesterday's coronavirus case numbers were "not great", Chief Health Officer Brett Sutton said Victoria's lockdown had averted a major crisis.
Recent Burnet Institute modelling for the Andrews government predicted more than 6000 additional COVID-19 cases, and 600 extra hospitalisations, had been avoided due to the stage 4 lockdown, which was implemented just a day after one new case was reported last month.
"Absolutely it's tough - three weeks seems like an eternity, that the light at the end of the tunnel is too dim and the tunnel is too long, but there is a light at the end of the tunnel," Professor Sutton said.
"There is a genuine pathway out of here that means we can take those small steps forward bit by bit and not have to take backwards steps again. But it is such hard work for parents, for kids, for whole families and for single people, for all of us who miss that human contact."
Parents and academics welcomed the government's decision to lift the ban on playgrounds, which was imposed two weeks ago amid fears about the spread of coronavirus among children .
"The playground ban was always a silly idea," said infectious diseases paediatrician Robert Booy. With Noel Towell,

Full text: Premier Gladys Berejiklian confirmed that 70 per cent of the eligible population had now received at least one dose of the Covid-19 vaccination.
More than seven million jabs have now been administered.
Ms Berejiklian thanked every NSW resident who has come forward to reach the milestone.
“We are the first state or territory to hit that (mark), and I can’t thank our people enough,” she said.
“It’s been a difficult couple of months, and the fact that people have heard the messages we’ve been giving and coming forward to get vaccinated and hitting that 70 per cent first dose is an outstanding achievement.”
As a result of the vaccination rates, residents of the 12 local government areas of concern will be able to exercise for unlimited time from Friday morning.
Gaps between the two doses suggest there are just weeks to go before the state can begin reopening, with modelling predicting the state will hit 70 per cent of fully vaccinated residents (over 16) on October 17.
However, Ms Berejiklian has hinted the rapid rate of vaccinations means the state could hit that figure before October 17.
Those receiving Pfizer must wait at least three weeks between doses, while the AstraZeneca vaccine has a minimum four week gap for areas with high rates of Covid transmission, and a 12-week gap as standard.
Ms Berejiklian said on Wednesday people could expect to dine out, have a drink at the pub and attend public events once the state reaches 70 per cent double doses.
She confessed there would likely be density requirements in venues, QR code check-ins which also showed whether a person was vaccinated and mask wearing would remain in certain settings.
On Thursday, Ms Berejiklian said she wanted to remind citizens that when the state achieves the 70 per cent double dose rate, NSW residents will be allowed to “do the things we’ve all been missing”.
“But I wan tot stress this – the privileges that we will extend at 70 per cent double dose are only for those who are double vaccinated,” she said.
“So get vaccinated now. Make sure you’ve got those protections in place.”
While pubs, restaurants and outdoor gatherings are expected to be among the restrictions eased at 70 per cent, it could be a while before indoor gatherings are given a green light.
Health advice suggests indoor gatherings and home visits are a hotbed for Covid-19 transmission.
“(We) always take a responsible approach,” Ms Berejiklian said on Wednesday.
“We know that indoor gatherings or people coming to your home are high risk.
“But outside of that, there are many, many things we can’t do now that we should be able to do when we have 70 per cent of the adult population vaccinated.”

Hospitals face ‘cycle of crisis’ with vaccine rates below 80pc

Full text: AMA president Omar Khorshid has written to Scott Morrison ­requesting new modelling based on the hospital system’s ability to cope with higher case numbers, saying unless there is an immediate increase in resourcing hospitals will be plunged into a “permanent cycle of crisis”.
“Despite lockdowns across many parts of the community, very low levels of influenza, and low levels of Covid-19 in most of the country, our hospitals are ­already at breaking point,” Dr Khorshid wrote. “As it stands, many of the process changes, protocols, staffing and policies ­required for the health system to remain functional during a substantial outbreak do not exist.
“Therefore, these are significant changes that need to be modelled, developed, and then enacted. Ultimately, the modelling should provide the basis for preparing our hospitals and the health workforce to handle increased patients – both from Covid-19, but also from the ­delayed care and increased chronic disease severity in our community, resulting from protracted lockdown periods.
“The modelling may also indicate that a higher level of community vaccination is required to ensure that the hospital sector ­remains functional once restrictions are eased. The AMA ­believes that it is likely that a vaccination rate higher than 80 per cent of the adult population is likely to be required, given the ­existing constraints on hospital capacity and staffing.”
The Doherty Institute modelled scenarios for various vaccination thresholds that may be seen once the nation begins to open up.
The institute said that once Australia reaches 70 per cent of the population fully vaccinated, the country would be able to begin to open up, but without ongoing public health measures there could be 385,983 symptomatic cases and 1457 deaths over six months. However, this would ­reduce in a best-case scenario to 2737 infections and 13 deaths if test, trace and isolate measures were continued.
COVID-19 Australia: Cumulative vaccinations by state
The AMA’s warning came as NSW recorded 1116 new locally acquired cases of Covid-19, with 150 patients in intensive care, 66 of whom required ventilation.
Dr Khorshid said although he believed expanded ICUs would be able to cope with increasing numbers of Covid-19 patients, there may be ongoing elective surgery suspensions.
“Public hospitals around the country before Covid were full to the brim and were unable to provide the care that the public ­requires,” he said. “The evidence for that is ambulance ramping and elective surgery delays.
“The only way hospitals can deal with the extra Covid demand is to reduce their normal activity. And the main target is elective surgery.
“In order to look after the people with Covid we’re going to compromise the care of everyone else. We are confident that we will be able to measure excess death down the track because of the ­impact of Covid on our broader health system, whether they be cancer deaths or heart disease deaths.”
The AMA is now calling for a new national health reform agreement to provide increased beds, extra staff and to address avoidable admissions in light of the pressure on hospitalised caused by Covid-19.
National cabinet is set to ­discuss hospital preparedness on Friday.

COVID plan concerns

Full text: Can the strained system cope?
Grave concerns have emerged over how Tasmania is placed to cope with the eventuality of borders reopening when COVID-19 vaccination rates across the country reach 70 to 80 per cent.
Health groups the Australian Medical Association and the Australian Nursing and Midwifery Federation expressed their concern that an over-reliance on a National Plan for COVID-19 could see an already under-the-pump state health system left decimated.
National Cabinet last week went into detail about the availability of ventilators and intensive care unit capacity throughout Australia.
Prime Minister Scott Morrison said, following the meeting, more work would be done on assessing health system capacities around the country.
He said the work would target the "health and hospital system capacity and workforce needs to address expected demands under the National Plan".
The National Plan was based on much-lauded Doherty Institute modelling which has stated the country can begin to return to a COVID-normal with country-wide vaccination rates of 70 to 80 per cent.
In essence, as has been widely discussed in the national sphere, vaccination rates would prove to slow the transmission of the virus, but would not immediately stop it altogether.
Mr Morrison was confident it was the way for Australia to move forward.
"We must adjust our mindset. Cases will not be the issue once we get above 70 per cent. Dealing with serious illness, hospitalisation, ICU capabilities, our ability to respond in those circumstances - that will be our goal," he said.
The Doherty Institute's report outlined how more work needed to be done to transfer its projections across state borders. As it drew conclusions from particular populations, it freely conceded change in the projections would occur in differing regions.
"We will consider the way in which state-based differences may require tailored adaptation of the national strategy," it said.
Speaking to media in the wake of the latest National Cabinet meeting Premier Peter Gutwein remained defiant in the face of the National Plan.
"I will never cede away the state's responsibility to act should we need to act," he said.
The Premier's reluctance to entirely endorse the National Plan was echoed by the AMA and the ANMF, who said Tasmania's health system was not relevant to the plan's modelling.
The Tasmanian health system's nuance was made evident by the modelling, and the latest state government dashboard data on elective surgery waitlists.
The modelling revealed across the state there were 41 Intensive Care Unit beds, while dashboard data showed 11,007 patients waiting for surgery and 1033 of them classified as needing surgery within 30 days.
AMA Tasmanian spokeswoman Dr Annette Barratt said the organisation was worried about how the state would cope with Delta COVID-19 cases indicated by the modelling, when considering the situation it was already in.
"The government has announced plans to cope with the inevitable Delta case in Tasmania, but we are concerned that our already stretched and exhausted health system may not be able to cope," she said.
"Tasmania needs to continue to do what is best for Tasmania, regardless of National Cabinet.
"The opening of our borders will need to be staged in such a way as to minimise the risk while continuing to have plans in place to prevent state-wide transmission. Uncontrolled outbreaks ... pose a major threat."
Similarly, Australian Nursing and Midwifery Federation Tasmania secretary Emily Shepherd said in a federal meeting last week fears were expressed about the federal government's reliance on the modelling.
"If we're suggesting we reach 80 per cent, we are accepting that 20 per cent of Tasmania's population could contract COVID-19, are we absolutely positive the health system is going to be able to respond? Realistically, the answer to that is no," she said.
The modelling was first initiated prior to the now developed understanding of the Delta variant of COVID-19, and Ms Shepherd said it was increasingly being acknowledged vaccination booster shots would be needed as a result of the virulence of the new strain.
"If we reach 70 and 80 per cent, is that the time we then need to consider booster shots? And are we operating under a false sense of security?" she said.
The concerns of both the AMA and ANMF carried through to the capacity of the Tasmanian health system to respond specifically to COVID-19 - with ventilators, ICU surge capacity and staffing expertise.
Information from the state government showed there were 267 ventilators currently in the state, with 100 more set to arrive, supplied by the federal government.
Dr Barratt questioned whether the surge planning in place - a potential 367 ventilators and 114 ICU beds - in Tasmania would be able to cope with an outbreak.
"We have sufficient ventilators, but insufficient staff trained to man them without putting other areas at risk if the outbreak was state-wide," she said.
Ms Shepherd said recently up-skilled workers operating without on the ground experience would add to current staffing shortages, meaning patients would need to prioritised and care outside of COVID-19 wards would likely be compromised.
A Tasmanian government health spokesperson said across the Tasmanian Critical Care Network there was confidence the state could respond to a potential surge in virus cases if required.
"There are several strategies in place to increase ICU capacity state-wide quickly if the need arises," they said.
"Through redeployment of ICU trained staff, we are confident staffing levels would be appropriate in the case of a surge."
The spokesperson was asked how many ICU trained nurses were enlisted in the Tasmanian Health Service, but they did not answer.

Living with COVID? Read the fine print

Full text: It pays to read the fine print. That was, essentially, what the Doherty Institute was saying last week when it released a statement clarifying the modelling it produced for the national cabinet's COVID strategy.
If you had been skimming news reports in recent days, it would have been easy to conclude that, based on the Doherty modelling, we will - mostly - be living a normal life, enjoying our previous "freedoms", when 70, then 80, per cent of Australians have been vaccinated.
That has certainly been suggested in Prime Minister Scott Morrison's messaging. The goal, he told a press conference last week, was to "help people overcome" their fears about a rise in cases and to treat COVID much as we treat influenza as we transition out of the pandemic into a post-vaccinated world.
"We should not delay it. We should prepare for it. We should not fear it. We should embrace it." Or, as he memorably told the Today show: "We can't stay in the cave."
Indeed. Victorians, who have now clocked up more than 200 days in actual hard lockdown, with no end in sight, know this more than anybody. We want out. But we also want to know, after all our hard work, after our celebrated doughnut days, what "living with COVID" will actually look like. And this is where the Doherty fine print comes in.
First, they make clear, we cannot expect a general lifting of restrictions. There will be no "freedom day". That lesson has been learnt from other countries, such as the UK, which now has almost 40,000 cases a day as a result of lifting restrictions, albeit with a much lower death rate than pre-vaccine.
In Israel, one of the most successful nations in fighting COVID, a June easing of restrictions that included lifting a rule on masks in public saw a spike from zero to nearly 10,000 cases a day now.
Some "light" health measures will remain indefinitely as will testing, tracing, isolating and quarantine measures.
The institute does not guarantee an end to lockdowns, only that they will be "unlikely" once vaccination thresholds are reached. Nor does it put a timeline on reopening the borders for overseas travel.
The emergence of the Delta variant in particular means "it won't be possible to maintain a situation where there are no cases at all". The focus, instead, "will shift to keeping the number of people going to hospital and dying at a minimum".
And what does that look like, exactly? With 70 per cent vaccine coverage of the adult population and "partial" public health measures, the Doherty predicts 385,983 symptomatic cases and 1457 deaths in six months. With "optimal" public health measures but still no lockdowns, they believe the numbers can be reduced to 2737 cases and 13 deaths in the same period.
Bottom line: opening up at 70-80 per cent means enduring some ongoing restrictions in return for a death rate that ranges from probably acceptable to possibly not. Polling last week suggests we're still squeamish about what that number looks like: most Australians support relaxing lockdowns at 70 per cent vaccinated, but only 27 per cent of those polled agreed with the premise that "we should open up and live with the infections and deaths".
How, then, to open up in an acceptable way, to convince the likes of WA and SA to lift their border closures in the knowledge that some of their citizens will inevitably be infected, but that it will be worth it?
As we reported yesterday, it likely means a life where checking in with QR codes is routine, and permanent, where outbreaks at places like hairdressers and restaurants are swiftly quashed. We can expect rapid testing for, possibly, schoolchildren and certainly for festival-goers. Employers may be able to require employees to be vaccinated. Masks will probably remain mandatory indoors.
Living with COVID in the future will look a lot like life today, (hopefully) just minus the lockdowns. That is what the Doherty modelling actually tells us.

Full text: It’s time for Australians – including the premiers – to face a tough truth
Australia is finally beginning the most important mental adjustment of this pandemic as it grasps what the rest of the world has known for months – that the ­unavoidable price of freedom from Covid-19 is the acceptance of death.
We are not talking about just a few deaths but many deaths, possibly in the thousands, if Australia is to join the rest of the Western world in opening up and resuming something approximating normal life.
It’s a jarring but necessary transition for a country that prided itself on a low death count during the deadliest phase of the pandemic last year and then became addicted to the fantasy idea that zero Covid was possible into the future.
This week saw a historic tipping point in Australia’s debate over the pandemic. For the first time, the momentum is clearly swinging towards accepting and understanding the need for deadly trade-offs to regain freedoms as soon as vaccination rates meet the threshold targets of 70 and 80 per cent of the eligible population.
The change in rhetoric is being led by the Morrison government, especially Josh Frydenberg. But the mood is also changing among epidemiologists, health professionals and business operators who are increasingly taking a broader view of the growing social, economic and health costs of endless lockdowns in NSW and Victoria.
It is also being powered by changing public opinion, as exhausted locked-down populations in NSW and Victoria realise the Delta variant cannot be contained and that there is no choice but to live with it.
Nothing better illustrated this changing debate than NSW Premier Gladys Berejiklian this week announcing an easing of restrictions of social gatherings on the same day as her state clocked up 1029 new Covid cases, a new national record.
But this mood shift is not yet a uniform one or a national one. The Morrison government and the NSW Premier are sharply at odds with the premiers of low-Covid states, especially Western Australia and Queensland, who have threatened to delay reopening if it means Covid coming into their state.
A very uncivil war is also being fought in suburbs across the country where the debate over freedoms versus health risks continues to pit neighbour against neighbour. Social media is a sewer of abuse as dominant left-leaning voices continue to portray lockdown critics as reckless granny killers.
The fast-growing pace of the vaccine rollout, after a disastrously slow start, has emboldened a previously cautious Morrison government to finally take more assertive leadership in trying to change the national psyche to accept the necessity of death as a price for reopening the country.
“The only long-term solution for Australia is to live with Covid, and people expect their leaders to be upfront with them as to what that means,” the Treasurer tells Inquirer.
“More cases, severe illness and, tragically, the loss of life will occur. People need to be conditioned to this reality given that, to date, states have used the bluntest of instruments, namely lockdowns, but in the process Australia has avoided the loss of life seen elsewhere.
“Now that we have the vaccine rollout gaining real momentum there is an alternative.” Scott Morrison, who says the country must “adjust” its mindset, has warned Australians will be stuck “in the cave forever” if any premiers abandon the agreed national plan to progressively ease Covid restrictions at 70 and 80 per cent vaccination rates.
WA and Queensland have baulked at reopening borders or ruling out lockdowns once the vaccination targets are reached, knowing that this will inject Covid into their state – especially if NSW continues to have high case numbers.
“Just because the NSW government has made a mess of it doesn’t mean the rest of us should suffer,” WA Premier Mark McGowan says.
“We should do everything we can to stay in the state we are currently in, and at the same time vaccinate like hell.” But the Prime Minister has, in effect called their bluff, by posing the logical question: “If not at 70 per cent and 80 per cent, then when?
“We must make that move and we must prepare to make that move and we must prepare the country to make that move,” Morrison says.
As Berejiklian says, a zero-Covid target by any state is “completely unrealistic”. “I don’t know any state or nation on the planet who abides by those rules,” she says. “It’s just not possible. We can’t pretend we’re special or very different from other places.” The bottom line is that McGowan and Queensland Premier Annastacia Palaszczuk are avoiding having an honest conversation with their own voters about the inevitable infections, illness and deaths that will be a consequence of Australia’s reopening.
The standoff has pushed the Doherty Institute, the modeller of the Covid national vaccination plan, into the spotlight after Queensland this week argued that the 70 and 80 per cent inoculation targets were not modelled on having such a large Covid outbreak in NSW.
It was a potentially perilous moment for the national reopening plan, but the plan remains intact after the institute publicly denied the claim, stating that its modelling is still valid even with higher case numbers in NSW and elsewhere.
The institute has also given Australians the first glimpse of the projected deaths involved in reopening once the initial 70 per cent vaccination target has been reached.
“Opening up at 70 per cent ‘with partial health measures’ we predict 385,983 symptomatic cases and 1457 deaths over six months,” the institute says.
This quote was spotlighted by the media and by those who support higher vaccination rates ­before reopening, but Health Minister Greg Hunt argued it was the second Doherty projection, involving “optimal” not “partial” health measures which was more relevant – “With optimal public health measures (and no lockdowns) this can be significantly reduced to 2737 infections and 13 deaths,” the Doherty Institute says.
The institute also places these projected deaths in context, pointing out that some 600 Australians die of the flu each year: “Any death is a tragedy but our health system can cope with this.” However, it did say there would be no “freedom day” like in Britain and any easing of restrictions would need to be a progressive one even after vaccination targets have been met.
The experience of other highly vaccinated nations – although not a direct apples-for-apples comparison – suggests infection rates and deaths upon reopening could be higher than the Doherty Institute estimates.
Britain, with 67 million people, has about 75 per cent over 12 years of age fully vaccinated and is currently experiencing about 33,000 new Covid cases a day with 100 daily deaths.
The United States, with 330 million people, has about 52 per cent fully vaccinated and is recording about 150,000 new cases a day with some 900 daily deaths. However, the key statistic in both of these countries – and also throughout the rest of Europe – is that more than 95 per cent of all Covid deaths are people who are unvaccinated by choice.
By the time Australia reaches the Doherty Institute vaccination targets, everyone over the age of 16 who wants a vaccine will have had the opportunity to have one. So the deaths that will occur here in Australia later this year when the country opens up will overwhelmingly be among those who have chosen not to get vaccinated.
A more balanced debate in Australia about the trade-off between Covid deaths and freedoms has been long overdue compared to the rest of the Western world where high infections and deaths are accepted as an unfortunate price for freedoms once people have had a chance to be vaccinated. The debate here is now being fast-tracked by the situation in NSW, where the uncontrolled Covid outbreak has led Berejiklian to rely on vaccination rates rather than suppression as the only realistic path to lifting the state’s lockdown.
This focus on vaccinations rather than new cases is now the most relevant statistic for Australians as they race towards the Doherty targets but most premiers have yet to adjust their thinking as they continue to fixate on case numbers.
Victoria also appears to have lost control of its Covid outbreak, with about 50 to 80 new cases a day dashing hopes of any reprieve from that state’s lockdown for many weeks and possibly months.
The inability of Victoria’s lockdown-prone Premier Daniel Andrews to quell the Delta outbreak in Melbourne, despite locking down early and hard, sends a message to the rest of the country that it is all but impossible to keep the highly infectious Delta variant out of large cities in the long term. But Andrews, who is easily the country’s least sympathetic premier when it comes to understanding the broader costs of lockdowns, shows no sign of following Berejiklian in relaxing lockdown rules in the face of ongoing infections.
Some epidemiologists are now softening their advice to account for this new Delta reality, even if some premiers refuse to listen.
University of Melbourne epidemiologist Professor Tony Blakely says it may be time to consider a “soft lockdown” in Victoria if the state cannot get below 40 cases a day by September 2.
He expressed concern about the impact of another prolonged lockdown on people’s mental health and the economy and says certain freedoms like bubbles between vaccinated households, industries resuming work and curfews being ditched could be part of the plan.
“I think we need a week as a civil society to start chatting about these things,” Blakely says.
But Andrews, who has not given up the notion of defeating the latest outbreak, rejected Blakely’s idea, saying Covid case numbers would inevitably rise under a softer lockdown.
This week another prominent infectious diseases expert, Professor Peter Collignon of Canberra’s ANU, also flagged the need to take a more balanced approach to the debate as Australia gets closer to the vaccination targets.
“We will need to start thinking about how our mindset will need to change if we want to not just minimise deaths but also minimise the many long-term social, education, psychological and economic impacts caused by severe restrictions to slow transmission,” he says.
“The Delta variant has made ‘zero Covid’ an unlikely sustainable long-term, or even medium-term strategy,” he adds.
Former deputy chief medical officer Nick Coatsworth now says he regrets that the country’s medical establishment did not more aggressively challenge those commentators and academics who for so long have called for an indefinite zero Covid strategy.
“We should have been a lot firmer. We needed stronger voices out there,” he says.
But the government’s plan for a unified national reopening is also being threatened by the growing disparity in vaccination rates around the country.
In NSW, where fear of catching Covid is highest, about 60 per cent of first doses have been delivered, putting the state on track to reach its 70 per cent double jab target around October 29 and 80 per cent around November 16.
Victoria is set to reach the 70 per cent full vaccination threshold around November 3 and 80 per cent around November 21. But the national laggards are the largely Covid-free states of Western Australia and Queensland which are sitting at around 46 per cent for the first dose.
At current rates, Queensland is not expected to reach a 70 per cent full vaccination rate until about December 4 and 80 per cent around December 28, while WA is not projected to reach 70 per cent until around November 11 and 80 per cent around November 29.
Unless this changes, the Morrison government will be faced with an uneven relaxation of restrictions around the country including the continued imposition of cross-border travel bans between Covid-free states and those with ongoing outbreaks, which will include NSW and probably Victoria.
With the country’s two biggest states in a prolonged lockdown, the Morrison government’s political fortunes are hugely dependent on reaching the Doherty Institute targets as quickly as possible.
As a new part of this plan, national cabinet this week examined proposals to encourage jabs by ­allowing fully vaccinated Australians to fly freely on planes and visit restaurants, sporting venues and bars under a uniform standard.
Polls show that such a move, which is similar in practice to a so-called vaccination passport, would be welcomed by most Australians if it restores many of the basic freedoms they have lost in lockdowns.
Recent opinion polls show that Australians, especially those in lockdowns, are now restless to open up as vaccination rates continue to rise.
A new poll taken for the Centre for Independent Studies found the NSW lockdown has sparked a marked shift in public attitudes ­towards Covid-19 restrictions. More than two-thirds of Australians, 71 per cent, now want restrictions and lockdowns to end as soon as possible or when vaccine targets are met and do not believe that returning to zero Covid-19 cases is possible. Only 10 per cent argue that everyone should be vaccinated before restrictions are lifted.
The dilemma for the Morrison government will be if full vaccination rates stall short of the 70 and 80 per cent rates.
Public opinion is unlikely to support ongoing lockdowns and restrictions regardless of the Doherty targets if every Australian who wants a vaccine has had the opportunity to get one. Failure to lift restrictions at this point would mean that the country was being held hostage by anti-vaxxers.
But for now, this remains a ­hypothetical problem for the government because the vaccine take up is strong and vaccine hesitancy is falling.
As Frydenberg puts it, the Doherty Institute plan is the only credible and safe way out of the country’s Covid crisis.
“The plan must be adhered to if we are going to give people hope,” he says. “The plan is the right plan and it is the agreed plan. The health of the Australian public and the economy depend on it being followed.”

Full text: With the NSW hospital system struggling to cope with surging ­Covid-19 infections and increasing hospitalisations, there are rising fears that public health systems could be stretched if the national cabinet plan was rushed.
A new taskforce, led by senior health officials from all jurisdictions, will report to national cabinet next Friday on public hospital and health system capacity, the support role of private hospitals and workforce management when frontline staff are forced to isolate.
Updated modelling presented by Doherty Institute professor Jodie McVernon, showed that under the three case scenarios modelled, as revealed by The Australian, there would be no need to change the national plan to end lockdowns at 80 per cent vaccination rate, even if Covid-19 cases were in the thousands.
It did, however, say that, at 70 per cent vaccination, some level of public health orders would be appropriate but would be favoured toward localised and targeted restriction as opposed to statewide lockdowns. But from that point, a gradual easing of restrictions would begin before a complete opening at 80 per cent.
Scott Morrison said that when Australia achieved 70 and 80 per cent vaccine coverage and moved out of the suppression phase, ongoing Covid-19 measures would be needed as the nation transitioned from harsh restrictions and lockdowns. The Prime Minister – who held a pre-national cabinet briefing in his office with senior advisers including chief medical officer Paul Kelly, Health Department secretary Brendan Murphy and vaccine co-ordinator John Frewen – said the reopening plan must support a cautious return to normal life.
“It’s about opening safely. It’s about opening smartly. It’s about opening in a way that is phased,” Mr Morrison said. “It all doesn’t happen on one day. It happens in Phase B, which is what I’d call a very soft, careful opening. And our task now is to ensure we get those careful settings, because I agree with the Doherty ­Institute that we have to be careful in 70 to 80 per cent. It’s a soft opening period, not a big opening period.”
The Doherty Institute will continue updating its scenarios and finalise new modelling on “optimisation of the public health measures and managing outbreak responses and scenarios to support vulnerable cohorts and areas with low vaccination uptake”.
Adoni Media Managing Director Leisa Goddard says for all of Premier Mark McGowan's "chest beating" about locking the state down, he really needs to focus on his public health care system amid WA hospitals on "code yellow". This comes following The West Australian reporting a ramping crisis in Western Australian hospitals. "WA hospitals have been on code yellow now for months which means that the ramping are unable to take patients in on and off now for months," Ms Goddard told Sky News host Peter Gleeson.
Health data presented to ­national cabinet revealed that Western Australia and South Australia were the most vulnerable to virus outbreaks because their vaccination rates remained low.
Modelling presented to state and territory leaders analysed the ­effective reproduction rate of the virus, taking into account Covid-19 restrictions and levels of vaccination. It showed the ACT and NSW, which have lockdowns in place and high vaccine take-up, had rates of 0.86 and 1.03 respectively. WA had a rate of 3.09, followed by South Australia on 2.45.
After announcing that two NSW truck drivers had entered WA and then learned they had tested positive to Covid-19 before crossing the border, Mr McGowan said the state wouldn’t open up to the country even if it remained Covid-free when it reached the 70 per cent vaccination threshold.
Following heated exchanges in the national cabinet meeting, Mr McGowan said there would still be one million unvaccinated West Australians at that stage and he would not risk their health.
“That’s the problem that jurisdictions that have no Covid face, and I raised that point today,” he said. “The idea that we just ­deliberately infect our citizens, if we have no Covid when we get to 70 per cent two-dose vaccination, I just can’t do.
“People would die and we would have huge dislocation. It’s different for other states that have Covid-positive people.”
Mr McGowan’s recommitment to keeping WA’s borders closed even when vaccination milestones are reached is a setback to Mr Morrison’s plans to reconnect the country.
The Premier defended vaccination rates in WA, which lag those of other states, noting that the state had agreed for additional doses to be prioritised for NSW.
“We haven’t had the additional supply,” he said. “I know we are getting attacked by people, the federal treasurer (Josh Frydenberg) has launched a bit of a spray today, but we didn’t get the additional supply that NSW got.
“Frankly it’s pretty unfair to be attacking a state that didn’t get additional supply for not being vaccinated at the same rate as a state that did. Once we get additional supply, we will roll it out.”
Prime Minister Scott Morrison says the federal government, through the National Health Reform Agreement, has ensured funding for New South Wales' hospitals has grown from $4.3 billion in 2012/13, to $8 billion in 2019/20. "That's an increase of some 86 per cent," Mr Morrison said. “An 86 per cent increase in the funding support that is coming from the federal government that is going into New South Wales' hospitals. "And under the new National Health Reform Agreement, the Australia government will provide $41.2 billion between 2021 and 24/25 for New South Wales' public hospitals."
Mr McGowan also announced that WA would send 260,000 N95 masks to support the NSW Delta outbreak crisis.
“It’s clear we need a national plan to assist if and when things get worse in NSW,” he said. “I raised that again at national cabinet today. It’s the compassionate, sensible thing to do.”
The national cabinet endorsed a plan to begin administering vaccines to children aged 12 to 15 from September 13 after the Australian Technical Advisory Group on ­Immunisation rubber-stamped jabs for teenagers on Friday.
Some states and territories argued that younger children should be included in the overall vaccination pool, which is currently 16 and over. Vaccination data for high school students will be included in public reporting.
Mr Morrison said that, under the second and third stages of the plan, baseline restrictions and “common sense” were required to protect Australians from the virus.
“But that doesn’t mean lockdowns,” he said. “I’ve already said on many occasions that where you have discrete communities or particularly vulnerable communities that may have very low levels of vaccination and so on, then of course, there is the actions that are available to states in those circumstances. But once you get particularly into Phase C, then you’re in a position to use those common sense measures.”
Mr Morrison said he expected the Qantas announcement that it planned to resume international flights in mid-December when vaccine rates hit 80 per cent would be an incentive for Australians to get jabbed. “Phase C of the plan enables Australians who are vaccinated to be able to leave Australia and return,” he said.

Problems not over when we get to 80pc

Full text: Opposition to lockdowns and a desire for an instant return to the full freedoms of pre-Covid life have always been there on the fringe. But this week it became mainstream.
This is for two reasons. Lockdowns have gone on so long that the damage they inflict has become more intense and widely recognised. More important, the late but rapid uptake of vaccination offers a real chance “to live with” Covid.
However, here are two unassailable facts and one fearless prediction. Nobody knows how this is going to play out, medically or politically. But it will certainly involve a lot of death, more than we are accustomed to dealing with.
And here’s the fearless prediction: every single prediction you hear or read (except this one?) will turn out to be wrong or radically incomplete.
No one will get everything they want. Very few Covid polemicists acknowledge facts inconvenient to their case. Thus, the love of liberty is a righteous sentiment. But you must never break a valid law, you must be governed by common sense and you must recognise that liberties conflict. Thus it is a liberty that no one be forced to take a vaccine. But it is also a liberty that workers are able to go to workplaces that don’t place their health at unnecessary risk. That might mean their employer requiring everyone to be vaccinated.
Living with the virus is a slippery concept. If we had decided last year to live with the virus we would have had Covid mortality rates comparable with other OECD countries.
According to federal Health Minister Greg Hunt, at the OECD average that would be 30,000 dead Australians. US or British death rates would have been nearer to 45,000.
Because we are an island we had the option of isolating and keeping deaths very low. But you cannot live like that forever. And the Delta variant is so much more contagious than the original virus that we can longer maintain that isolation.
Three COVID-19 patients in Concord Hospital in Sydney, Australia, shared their experiences battling the virus in footage published on August 18. Thirty-year-old Ramona, 50-year-old Fawaz, and 35-year-old Osama detailed how difficult their recovery has been, and urged fellow Australians to protect themselves. Pharmacy worker Ramona said she "could have contracted the virus from someone who didn’t want to get the vaccination.” Osama’s wife was in ICU at the time of recording, with his children also hospitalized, and Fawaz’s entire family of six children tested positive for the virus. Osama said he felt “close to death” at the peak of his illness in the footage, which was posted by Sydney Local Health District. Credit: Sydney Local Health District via Storyful
Now vaccines give us a way of moving out of that phase in relative safety by international standards. But that safety is extremely relative and is safety only by international standards. NSW Premier Gladys Berejiklian has long proposed that lockdowns can end definitively when we get to 80 per cent of eligible adults vaccinated. It will be really hard work to get to 80 per cent, but it’s a good figure and should be achievable in a nation with as much education, health infrastructure and native good sense as Australia.
But don’t think our problems are over when we get to 80 per cent. That 80 per cent of eligible adults equates to only 62 per cent of the total population. There are about 26 million Australians, so 62 per cent is a touch over 16 million. That leaves 10 million Australians who will be unvac­cinated even if we reach 80 per cent.
Nobody could respect the Doherty Institute more than I do, but its modelling, which is actually pretty cautious, necessarily based on all kinds of assumptions about things we cannot forecast, and also requires near perfect public health management by federal and state authorities, says opening up then might be safe.
But you know, that modelling could turn out to be as mistaken as every other prediction about this virus. We could easily face a devastating pandemic of the unvaccinated, as in the US.
National - 2021 - Covid Vaccination Stats
Don’t get me wrong. I certainly support more or less full opening up when we get to that vaccination level because lockdowns cannot go on forever. Premiers who continue to imply that we can live forever with almost no Covid deaths are dishonest or foolish or irresponsible or all three.
But opening up, even with 80 per cent of adults vaccinated, could be tough and tragic, and could involve a lot of death – far, far more than even the worst flu season. Nothing has been sillier through the entire course of the pandemic than the idea that Covid is just like a bad flu. The Economist magazine updated its estimate of global Covid deaths, based on calculations of excess mortality reports and some other inputs. Its estimate is that nine million to 18 million people have died worldwide from Covid. Nobody knows how many people died from the Spanish flu a century ago, but consensus estimates range from 25 million to 50 million.
Given that Covid has years to run, it is approaching the same league as the Spanish flu and, in numerical if not proportionate terms, may well turn out to have a bigger death toll.
Nor do we know how the virus will continue to mutate. The high school orthodox version of mutation is that a disease becomes more contagious but less deadly so that it doesn’t kill off its hosts and has more bodies to inhabit. However, like many high school orthodoxies, it just ain’t so. Smallpox killed a third of the people it infected and it lasted for thousands of years without ever becoming mild.
The Australian’s Foreign Editor Greg Sheridan says he thinks the next federal election will be “very close” and go “right down to the wire”. “No election is unlosable, no election is unwinnable,” Mr Sheridan told Sky News host Peta Credlin. “No political leader is unelectable”.
The Delta variant is a little more deadly, a little more able to evade vaccines and natural immunities, and a little more likely to hit young people, than the other variants. But its biggest evolutionary innovation is that it is wildly more contagious.
Lethality, transmissibility and vaccine evasiveness are always the three key questions about mutations. There may be some kind of in-built biological limit to how radically Covid can mutate, but we don’t know. Measles, polio and other diseases mutate quite a bit but haven’t been able to defeat vaccines. Our Covid vaccines are brilliantly good and the mRNA technology means they can be changed quickly to target new variants. But there is no guarantee Covid won’t mutate in a way that significantly smashes through the vaccines.
The evidence from Israel is that vaccine immunity significantly reduces in less than a year but can be restored with booster shots. So we will certainly need booster shots and might need them more than once a year.
NSW has 113 Covid patients in intensive care. That’s equivalent to two big hospital ICUs. Indeed two big hospitals, Westmead and Blacktown, have refused to take any more Covid patients for 24 hours. With 10 million unvaccinated Australians, and a new variant just a fraction more vaccine evasive, and with early vaccine recipients finding their immunity fading, you could imagine 500, or 1000, people in ICU beds in NSW, even with 80 per cent vaccinated.
Then you confront the health system being overwhelmed. Whatever we’ve said about no more lockdowns, any government will respond to that situation with tough restrictions, whether they’re called lockdown or something else.
The debate this week has been realistic and good, but don’t for a moment think that anything is settled.

Full text: 13 Cabs chief operating officer Stuart Overell said the option would be available to passengers in as soon as two weeks through its booking app.
But drivers who did not wish to be vaccinated against Covid-19 would be moved into delivery roles where contact with other people was limited.
“We are collecting the vaccination certificates of all of our drivers at the moment, and 20 per cent of active drivers responded in just two days last weekend,” Mr Overell said.
“Two weeks will give us a good sense of where we’re at – because of the staggered vaccine rollout in various states it’s proving a challenge for some of our drivers to book in for a vaccination.
“Victoria prioritised taxi drivers from the start, so we expect most Victorian drivers to be vaccinated in a fortnight, whereas it hasn’t been a priority for our drivers in Queensland for example – we don’t want to penalise anyone for things outside of their control.”
Mr Overell said the response from drivers to getting vaccinated had been “overwhelming” but said 5 per cent of drivers had “no intention” to get the jab.
“We do have a plan to move them into our delivery business which is contactless and a safer role for those who don’t wish to get vaccinated,” he said.
Mr Overell said demand among passengers who wanted fully vaccinated drivers had surged in the past few weeks as the national conversation on the Covid-19 jab rollout ramped up.
Doherty Institute modelling suggests there would be less chance of harsh Covid-19 restrictions such as lockdowns when 70-80 per cent of the country’s population is fully vaccinated.
The commonwealth has framed its vaccine advice to Australians based on the modelling.
“It’s a very common conversation with our passengers – they’ll frequently contact our call centre requesting fully vaccinated drivers and requesting proof drivers are fully vaccinated,” Mr Overell said.
“We believe this is the right thing to do for our business and the right thing to do for Australia.”
About 30.04 per cent of the country’s eligible population has been fully vaccinated.
That figure is likely to hit 80 per cent by mid-November, according to the Department of Health.

Full text: ● What the states and federal government is fighting about: National cabinet agreed on a road map out of Covid-19. In that road map, restrictions and lockdowns would ease when 80 per cent of people are fully jabbed, but some state leaders are now arguing they won’t do that.
● Australia’s road map out of Covid-19, a refresher: Four phases. We are now in Phase A, or “vaccinate, prepare, pilot”, where the goal is to suppress Covid-19 and reduce transmission while ramping up the jab rollout.
Phase B hits when 70 per cent of people aged 16 and older are fully vaccinated. At this point, there will still be Covid-19 restrictions and lockdowns, but at “lower levels” then there are now.
Phase C hits when 80 per cent of people aged 16 and older are fully jabbed. Only highly targeted lockdowns, such as closing off a specific suburb, will be used and only as a last resort. Measures such as mask-wearing, social distancing, and QR code check-ins will remain.
Phase D is “post-vaccination”, when international borders will completely reopen and Covid-19 vaccine booster shot programs start. This is still far off.
● What the Doherty Institute modelling says about Phase C: At 80 per cent vaccine coverage, assuming measures such as Covid-19 testing, tracing, and isolating cases are working well, there would be seven deaths from the virus over a six-month period in an outbreak and 1160 infections. But if the containment measures were struggling, even at 80 per cent jab coverage, about 996 people would die and 230,164 Covid-19 cases would be recorded in an outbreak over six months.
Remember, national cabinet were aware of this when they agreed to the road map. ● Why the state leaders are freaking out: The Doherty Institute’s numbers were based on an outbreak kicking off at 30 cases in the community, not hundreds as is currently being experienced in NSW. State leaders say they need updated modelling to understand the impacts of opening up at 80 per cent if there are hundreds of cases and whether our health measures can keep up. Federal boffins says this is a misunderstanding of math, and really the modelling will not change very much.
● What’s happening now: National cabinet has ordered updated modelling which they will receive on Friday. Basically the Doherty Institute boffins will go back and figure out what Phase C would look like if we go in at a higher rate of transmission, depending on whether the test, trace, isolate measures hold up.

How to stop spread of Delta: jab all teenagers

Publication info: Weekend Australian ; Canberra, A.C.T. [Canberra, A.C.T]. 21 Aug 2021: 1.

Full text: Vaccinating more than three million children and teenagers under the age of 15 would likely halve the long-term spread of Covid-19.
New University of Melbourne modelling – which comes as Scott Morrison awaits advice on ­extending the national vaccination ­program to those aged as young as 12 – predicts that the move could make lockdowns one-third less likely.
The new modelling, led by ­epidemiologist Tony Blakely, estimates that vaccinating children from the age of five and up would halve the infection rate that Australia is likely to see once interstate borders are opened.
The nation’s vaccine coverage targets should no longer assume children were significantly less likely to be infected with Covid-19, Professor Blakely said.
NSW Premier Gladys Berejiklian said on Friday her government would introduce harsher restrictions across Greater Sydney, with masks required to be worn outdoors.
But it will be the millions of residents across 12 local government areas in the city’s west and southwest who will face the strictest measures. From Monday, there will be a 9pm curfew with only one hour of exercise permitted, officials said.
Victoria is also on the brink of stricter restrictions after Premier Daniel Andrews warned that the state’s outbreak was close to ­“spiralling out of control”. In a late-night statement, a government spokesman said: “All options are on the table.” There were 644 Covid-19 cases recorded in NSW and 55 in Victoria on Friday, with both states ­bracing for higher infections.
The rate of vaccinations has risen sharply since the start of ­August. Under the national road map out of the pandemic, lockdowns and border closures would be used rarely once vaccine coverage hit 80 per cent. Restrictions would begin to be eased, however, as coverage reached 70 per cent.
Data analysts have estimated that – if the current pace is maintained – 70 per cent of those aged 16 and over could be fully vaccinated by November 3 and 80 per cent by November 21.
If children were included in the targets, 80 of the population aged over 12 could be fully vaccinated by November 29.
“Our seven-day average daily doses is a whopping 251,050,” said data analyst Juliette O’Brien.
“Assuming this warp speed continues, we would easily hit the target of having 80 per cent of over 16s fully vaccinated by November 21.” The Prime Minister, who is ­expected to receive advice from the Australian Technical Advisory Group on Immunisation about ­extending the program this week, suggested that the 80 per cent coverage target would not be changed to include those aged ­between 12 and 15, even if they were made eligible for the vaccine.
“The recommendation from the Doherty Institute did not ­include and actually specifically did not include 12 to 15s and did not consider it necessary (that they) be included in those overall vaccination rates to trigger when you can move to the next phases,” Mr Morrison said.
“So when we continue to report figures, it’ll be based on the population 16 and above.” State governments are ­increasingly concerned about the spread of the Delta variant among young people , with one-third of cases in NSW in those aged under 19 and a quarter of cases in Victoria in children aged under nine.
NSW health department figures show that 32 per cent of the Covid-19 cases diagnosed in the state in the past two weeks have been in those aged under 19, with 778 cases in children nine and under and 1111 cases in those aged between 10 and 19.
In Victoria, one-quarter of ­active cases of Covid-19 are in children aged under nine years old.
Victoria’s deputy chief health officer Ben Cowie said: “This is a completely different epidemiological pattern than what we’ve seen previously.” Despite his modelling taking in children as young as 5, Professor Blakely said it was more than achievable to have everyone aged over 12 vaccinated by the end of the year.
“I think the adult vaccination is going extremely well and I don’t see why, if we really wanted to, we couldn’t double vaccinate all school kids by Christmas,” Professor Blakely said.
“We might even be able to get a single shot into all primary school kids as well.” NSW’s chief health officer, Kerry Chant, said this week parents should not to send children to school or childcare centres ­unless they had no other choice, citing concerns over the rapid spread of the coronavirus in the younger age groups.
Despite the concerns, health experts say it is rare for children to become seriously ill from Covid-19 and a recent study published in prestigious academic journal The Lancet put the risk of children suffering long-term ­effects of the virus at 1.7 per cent.
The rate of a child under four years of age being hospitalised was 1.7 per cent, NSW health figures show, and 0.9 per cent for those aged between 5 and 11.
University of Sydney infectious diseases paediatrician Robert Booy said the key reason children made up such large proportions of diagnosed cases of Covid-19 during the Delta wave was because they were unvaccinated, rather than there being anything in particular about the strain that made it more transmissible in children.
“It’s not a question of Delta honing in on children, it’s a question of Delta honing in on people who are unvaccinated,” Professor Booy said.
“Covid is much milder in children and although a small percentage might be hospitalised, the risk of severe disease even without vaccinating children remains very low.” The New Zealand government announced on Friday it would begin to vaccinate children aged 12 to 16.
In Australia, 11.5 per cent of teenagers aged between 16 and 19 have received a first dose of vaccine and 3.9 per cent are fully vaccinated.
Mr Morrison said a youth vaccination program was already being developed with the assistance of state and territory governments. Extending the vaccination program to children aged 12 would add about 1.25 million children to the 20.6 million currently eligible to receive a vaccine.
“We need to run that in parallel, of course, with the national vaccination program, of which it will form a part,” Mr Morrison said on Friday.

“Assuming this warp speed continues, we would easily hit the target of having 80 per cent of over 16s fully vaccinated by November 21.” The Prime Minister, who is ­expected to receive advice from the Australian Technical Advisory Group on Immunisation about ­extending the program this week, suggested that the 80 per cent coverage target would not be changed to include those aged ­between 12 and 15, even if they were made eligible for the vaccine.
“The recommendation from the Doherty Institute did not ­include and actually specifically did not include 12 to 15s and did not consider it necessary (that they) be included in those overall vaccination rates to trigger when you can move to the next phases,” Mr Morrison said.
“So when we continue to report figures, it’ll be based on the population 16 and above.” State governments are ­increasingly concerned about the spread of the Delta variant among young people , with one-third of cases in NSW in those aged under 19 and a quarter of cases in Victoria in children aged under nine.
NSW health department figures show that 32 per cent of the Covid-19 cases diagnosed in the state in the past two weeks have been in those aged under 19, with 778 cases in children nine and under and 1111 cases in those aged between 10 and 19.
In Victoria, one-quarter of ­active cases of Covid-19 are in children aged under nine years old.
Victoria’s deputy chief health officer Ben Cowie said: “This is a completely different epidemiological pattern than what we’ve seen previously.” Despite his modelling taking in children as young as 5, Professor Blakely said it was more than achievable to have everyone aged over 12 vaccinated by the end of the year.
“I think the adult vaccination is going extremely well and I don’t see why, if we really wanted to, we couldn’t double vaccinate all school kids by Christmas,” Professor Blakely said.
“We might even be able to get a single shot into all primary school kids as well.” NSW’s chief health officer, Kerry Chant, said this week parents should not to send children to school or childcare centres ­unless they had no other choice, citing concerns over the rapid spread of the coronavirus in the younger age groups.
Despite the concerns, health experts say it is rare for children to become seriously ill from Covid-19 and a recent study published in prestigious academic journal The Lancet put the risk of children suffering long-term ­effects of the virus at 1.7 per cent.
The rate of a child under four years of age being hospitalised was 1.7 per cent, NSW health figures show, and 0.9 per cent for those aged between 5 and 11.
University of Sydney infectious diseases paediatrician Robert Booy said the key reason children made up such large proportions of diagnosed cases of Covid-19 during the Delta wave was because they were unvaccinated, rather than there being anything in particular about the strain that made it more transmissible in children.
“It’s not a question of Delta honing in on children, it’s a question of Delta honing in on people who are unvaccinated,” Professor Booy said.
“Covid is much milder in children and although a small percentage might be hospitalised, the risk of severe disease even without vaccinating children remains very low.” The New Zealand government announced on Friday it would begin to vaccinate children aged 12 to 16.
In Australia, 11.5 per cent of teenagers aged between 16 and 19 have received a first dose of vaccine and 3.9 per cent are fully vaccinated.
Mr Morrison said a youth vaccination program was already being developed with the assistance of state and territory governments. Extending the vaccination program to children aged 12 would add about 1.25 million children to the 20.6 million currently eligible to receive a vaccine.
“We need to run that in parallel, of course, with the national vaccination program, of which it will form a part,” Mr Morrison said on Friday.

Full text: The Labor Senator revealed her daughter Evie is “feeling pretty unwell and understandably worried about what this means for her and for the rest of her family”.
“Our household remains in strict quarantine until ACT Health advises us that we don’t need to isolate anymore,” Ms Gallagher said in a statement posted to Twitter.
“The rest of our family, including myself, have all returned negative tests. I am lucky as I am fully vaccinated. Unfortunately too many Australians have not had that opportunity.”
Ms Gallagher, who as chair of the Senate’s Covid-19 Committee has been highly critical of Australia’s response to the pandemic, did not indicate how her daughter was exposed to the virus.
“Here I sit tonight, where after doing everything right for 18 months, like millions of other families right around Australia — I am left with my children completely vulnerable to Covid-19,” she added.
FREEDOM TRIGGER REVEALED AS NSW HAS 452 CASES, 1 DEATH NSW has recorded 452 new Covid infections and one death as the outbreak continues to wreak havoc across the state.
Of the new cases, at least 50 were infectious in the community.
It comes as more than 10 million Australians have had at least one Covid jab, Health Minister Greg Hunt said, revealing a new daily record for vaccinations.
NSW Premier Gladys Berejiklian said more than 152,000 people got tested before hinting at the fact people who are vaccinated could have some additional freedoms as early as next month.
“That’s why I ask people to make sure they get vaccinated,” she said.
“There will be opportunities to consider what things we’ll be able to offer the community in September and October, which will be our most challenging months and I just thank the community for the way in which you’ve responded to date.”
The premier referred to the government’s target of reaching six million vaccines in arms by the end of August.
“(Reaching that target) will mean that we can consider opportunities for people who are fully vaccinated in September and October,” Ms Berejiklian said.
“And I’ll be able to convey that as soon as we get closer to August 28 and as soon as we know where things are at in terms of case numbers and areas of concern.”
She said the city’s west and southwest areas continue to remain “the generators of most cases”.
“We ask everybody in those suburbs to be especially careful (and) not to leave home unless you have to.
Ms Berejiklian flagged Blacktown, Seven Hills, Merrylands, Guildford, Auburn, Bankstown and Greenacre as particular areas of concern.
Of the new cases, 129 were linked to a known case or cluster including 105 household contacts and 24 close contacts.
At least 323 cases remain under investigation.
A woman in her 70s from western Sydney died at Westmead Hospital overnight.
More than 50 per cent of NSW residents have now had at least one dose of the Covid vaccine.
Ms Berejiklian said at least 75 per cent of new cases were people younger than 40.
“That’s why those extra jabs we receive from the Commonwealth will be put straight into the arms of 16 to 39 year olds in the local government areas of concern,” the premier said.
“That will protect them and their loved ones and also anyone coming into contact with them in a workplace. That is critical.”
A case was also revealed in Broken Hill, some 1200km from Sydney, NSW Health’s Dr Jeremy McAnulty confirmed.
“The person has been infectious for some days and has been in Broken Hill and Wilcannia,” he said.
“Contact tracing is under way and identified (close or casual) contacts are being tested and isolating.
“Work is continuing to identify the potential source of that infection.”
The person was infectious between August 13 and 16, the local health department said in a statement.
Fragments of Covid were also detected in the sewage at Broken Hill on August 12.
The number of people issued with infringement notices in the last 24 hours reached 579.
“If you’re going to breach public health orders anywhere in this state, you will be caught,” NSW Police Deputy Commissioner Gary Worboys said.
There have been 8654 local infections since June 16 when the outbreak began.
Sixty-nine people are in intensive are with 24 needing ventilation.

VICTORIA RECORDS 24 NEW CASES, MYSTERY INFECTIONS GROW Several bayside suburbs have emerged as a new Covid-19 hot spot as Melbourne battles a worsening virus outbreak.
Premier Daniel Andrews said further positive cases were emerging in the inner city local government areas of Port Phillip, Glen Eira, Bayside, and particularly the suburb of East St Kilda.
Chief health officer Brett Sutton said authorities were seeing mystery cases pop up across the region.
“Glen Eira and the City of Port Philip are areas of concern, we are seeing mystery cases here,” Professor Sutton said.
“There are dozens of exposure sites now in those areas.”
Mr Andrews urged anyone experiencing symptoms in those areas to get tested.
“That’s over and above anyone who has gone to the website, looked and seen that they were at a tier one or tier two exposure site,” he said.
“Anyone in Bayside, Glen Eira or the Port Philip local government areas who are experiencing symptoms, please come forward and get tested and please don’t delay in doing so.
“You will be playing a really big and important part in our pandemic response and in our collective fight against this thing.”
There are testing sites at Albert Park Lake, Prahran Town Hall, The Alfred hospital and Brighton Golf Course.
Mr Andrews said a number of cases were a risk to public health.
“A number of those cases have been out and about, they have been a risk to public health because they have been moving in community while infectious,” he said.
Victoria recorded 24 new locally acquired Covid-19 cases on Tuesday as the number of mystery cases grew again.
Melbourne was plunged into even tougher restrictions overnight as the dreaded 9pm to 5am curfew returned and the city’s sixth lockdown was extended.
The state’s health department confirmed the new local cases about 8.30am, and revealed three were mystery infections.
They said 21 of the 24 new local cases could be linked to existing outbreaks but only 14 positive people were in isolation during their infectious period.
At least 17 mystery cases have been reported in the past five days as contact tracers face a race against time to determine how Melburnians are acquiring the virus.
It comes as an angry Mr Andrews said the strengthened lockdown would be in place until September 2.
The exercise exemption to leave home has been made tighter with it only allowed with one other household member and dependants.
Playgrounds, basketball courts, skate parks and exercise equipment despite the fact that it is outdoors will also be closed.
Permits for authorised work and education will come back from 11.59pm on Tuesday and large construction projects will be reduced to 25 per cent of the workforce, while smaller projects will have a maximum of five workers.
“We are at a tipping point, we see too many cases, we see too many mystery cases,” Mr Andrews said
““There is simply no option today but to further strengthen this lockdown and to, on the advice of the chief health officer, extend it for a further two weeks.”
There are now more than 540 exposure sites in multiple suburbs across metropolitan Melbourne.
There are 227 active cases across the state, up from 205 on Monday.
One new case were recorded in hotel quarantine on Tuesday.

TWO NEW CASES IN QLD Queensland has recorded two new cases of Covid-19 on Tuesday.
One case was linked to the Indooroopilly cluster and one is in hotel quarantine. Both have been in isolation while infectious.
Premier Annastacia Palaszczuk said the police presence guarding the Queensland-NSW border would be beefed up.
Ms Palaszczuk said 25 extra officers would be stationed on the western end of the Queensland and New South Wales border to prevent southerners defying stay-at-home orders and attempting to cross into the state.
“That’s a big police presence along our border to make sure we do everything we can to keep Queenslanders safe,” she said.

AUSTRALIA BUYS 1M PFIZER DOSES FROM POLAND Poland has sold one million Pfizer Covid vaccine doses to Australia as part of a “responsible policy of solidarity”, the Polish health minister said on Sunday.
Health Minister Adam Niedzieslki said that Poland’s vaccine purchases “allow us to meet the needs of our citizens and support others in need”.
Polish ambassador to Australia Michal Kolodziejski said: “In these tough times for our Australian friends, Poland has decided to share with Australia one million doses of Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine, with immediate delivery”.
Prime Minister Scott Morrison announced the major boost to Australia’s vaccine rollout, as
415 new cases of Covid were recorded in NSW on Sunday and four more deaths.
He said the vaccines were arriving “later tonight” and throughout the week. “In days, these jabs will start going into the arms of Australians,” Mr Morrison said at a press conference.
Mr Morrison said the new one million Pfizer doses will be targeted at Australians aged 20 to 39 years of age as they were identified in the Doherty modelling as peak transmitters for Covid-19.
“Five-hundred-and-thirty thousand of these doses will be prioritised for express delivery to the 12 Sydney local government areas where the COVID-19 outbreak continues to grow.”
Mr Morrison said the rest of the doses would be allocated to the other states and territories on a per capita basis.
“This allocation is based directly on the advice I received from the chief medical officer, Professor Kelly, his advice is based on the Doherty modelling and other work they have done about the transmissibility of the virus in those most affected areas and how they can be addressed through these additional doses,” he said.
“This will give everybody aged 20 to 39 in the 12 LGAs the opportunity to be vaccinated.”
Poland has fully vaccinated around 55 per cent of its population, but the rate of vaccinations has slowed sharply in recent months and many vaccination centres have been closed due to low demand.
Opinion polls indicate that up to a quarter of Poles are either opposed to vaccination or hesitant about getting one.
‘NO NEED TO BE OUT FOR HOURS’ Mr Morrison directly addressed the lockdown in NSW, urging residents not to socialise outside bluntly saying “do not do it”.
“My plea to fellow Sydneysiders is to stay at home. Stay at home. Only leave any absolute you have to,” the Prime Minister said.
“There is no need to be out for hours and hours per day. I know the rules provide for it, but please do not do it,” he added.
“We have been seeing the case numbers rise in Sydney and in New South Wales each day, and that is totally concerning.
“I need you to stay at home, and you needed more vaccines from us. More vaccines are underway, they will be that next week. So I need Sydneysiders to stay home.”
Mr Morrison insisted the lockdown was the key to containing NSW’s Covid crisis.
“Lockdown has to work. It must work and is why I implore people across Sydney, stay at home,” Mr Morrison said.
“Don’t get down to the beach for hours or meet up with others walking in pairs apart and catching up anyway.
“We all know what we’re talking about. Don’t do it. Please don’t do it. It is up to all of us … to make this lockdown work.”

Covid-19 Australia: Mark McGowan hits back after Scott Morrison accuses him of acting ‘against the country’s interests’

Full text: Under Mr McGowan’s plan, border closures and lockdowns will remain an option in WA even after vaccination rates reach 80 per cent.
But Mr Morrison says pursuing a zero Covid policy is “running down the (national Covid-19) plan” and “discouraging people to get vaccinated.”
“It has never been the job to get to zero Covid,” Mr Morrison told the Today show on Monday.
Speaking on the ABC, Mr Morrison stressed that Mr McGowan’s plan “wasn’t what was agreed in national cabinet” and his claims contradicted modelling by the Doherty Institute on when it was safe to phase out lockdowns and restrictions.
“Once you get to 80 per cent vaccination, it is against the country’s interests not to open up,” he said.
Mr Morrison said state and federal governments had made a “deal” with the Australian people that restrictions would ease once vaccination rates reached 70 to 80 per cent.
But Mr McGowan said Mr Morrison was “wrong” — and even pulled out a copy of the road map to show reporters.
“I think people need to read it. It says lockdowns are possible at 80 per cent vaccination. It says the same thing at 70 per cent vaccination,” the Premier said.
“They would be more targeted, which is obviously what we’ve all agreed.”
Mr McGowan said he answered questions about the issue on July 30 and was maintaining his position.
“I said that lockdowns remain a tool that the states can use even at 70 per cent or 80 per cent vaccination rate because that’s what’s in the national plan agreed by national cabinet,” he said.
“Also I said on July 30 that the state would keep, as part of our weapons, interstate borders ... I stand by that.
“I think that’s accepted by the High Court. I got the agreement of national cabinet on that. We will do what’s required to protect the people of this state.”
It comes after Mr McGowan told Sky News on Sunday that his “preferred option” was “zero Covid”.
“That’s what we’ll attempt to do,” Mr McGowan said.
When asked if he would maintain a hard border with NSW if the state never achieved zero Covid cases, Mr McGowan said: “We retain that right. Obviously, I’d prefer not to.
“When they get down to zero or minimal spread, then we can look forward to opening the border.”
Mr Morrison said the Doherty Institute had made it clear that once the 70 and 80 per cent vaccination targets had been reached, the entire country could start to reopen.
“When you hit 70 per cent – that’s when people who are vaccinated would be exempted from various restrictions,” Mr Morrison told the ABC.
“That’s when you’re managing hospitalisation and you start saying goodbye to lockdowns.
“Once you hit those (vaccination) levels, it is neither in our health or economic interests to go down that (zero Covid) path.”
Mr McGowan said he did not understand why it was controversial to say he wanted minimal or no cases of Covid-19.
“For some reason, probably because there’s a fanatical desire by some people in NSW to protect the NSW government, we’re under attack,” he said.
“I think they need to have a look at the management of NSW rather than the management of WA.”
Mr McGowan said he wanted to support NSW, which was why he backed the eastern state getting extra doses of the vaccine.
“I’m getting criticised over east ... for saying I prefer not to have Covid. What’s the alternative? NSW? Is that what they want?
“This sort of defence by the Sydney press core of NSW is getting a bit ridiculous.
“Their management of this issue has meant that they now have mass cases all over NSW, they’re costing the taxpayers of Australia countless billions of dollars of all states, they’ve got people dying.
“I don’t want us to be like NSW and we’ve done everything we can to avoid it ... and what we’ve successfully done because of our industry is fund the bail out for NSW.”
He went on further to liken the situation to Groundhog Day.
“These are the same arguments that were raised last year when we kept the state safe. We avoided the problems of Victoria, we were under assault every single day,” Mr McGowan said.
“Now, NSW is a basket case, so WA is under assault again.”

Businesses groups urge McGowan to ‘stick to the plan’ to reopen Australia

Full text: Mr McGowan doubled down on his eradication approach at the weekend, saying his state would not tolerate any Covid-19 cases or deaths.
He also signalled he would mandate vaccinations in some sectors such as the mining and port industries.
His statement puts him at odds with Scott Morrison, who said there would be no requirement to make Covid-19 jabs compulsory unless governments’ health advisers advocated for a mandate in a specific industry.
Mr McGowan’s comments on an elimination strategy come just weeks after national cabinet agreed to a plan that Australia would open up when 80 per cent of the eligible population was fully vaccinated. The plan, based on Doherty Institute modelling, outlined that at an 80 per cent target, lockdowns would almost entirely end and international travel would restart.
Australian Chamber of Commerce and Industry chief executive Andrew McKellar said the nation’s business sector was desperate for a nationally consistent approach for reopening the country. “We would really urge all leaders to stick to the plan and not pre-empt the situation that we may face in two or three months time. ” he said.
Mr McKellar said the primary focus should be boosting the vaccination rate, with only 25 per cent of eligible Australians fully vaccinated against Covid-19. “That’s the message business is looking for – that people have to get vaccinated,” he said. “It’s the right thing to do and the best thing if you want to be able to go about your everyday life.”
Business Council of Australia chief executive Jennifer Westacott said an elimination strategy was “simply unrealistic” if the ­nation wanted to return to normality. “It’s critical we tie greater freedoms to vaccination,” she said. “We can’t have premiers saying an 80 per cent vaccination target will be meaningless. What is the purpose of national cabinet’s decision and the Doherty modelling, which gave very clear milestones?”
Mr McGowan said states retained the right to put in place border restrictions and lockdowns but they would be eased once the vaccination rate increased. “When you get to 70, perhaps 80, if there is a lockdown it might be a lesser area rather than the entire metropolitan area. It might be a country town rather than an entire region,” he said.
Mr McGowan also predicted WA would have a “strong border” in place with NSW until the end of the year and could maintain border restrictions with the state even after it passed its 80 per cent threshold. “When they get down to zero or minimal spread, then we can look forward to opening the border,” he said.

Full text: The premiers continue to run their agendas. And the premiers are divided. On a bleak Sunday NSW Premier Gladys Berejiklian admitted reality, saying it was “not possible” to eliminate Covid cases, while West Australian Premier Mark McGowan boasted that even at 80 per cent vaccination, his goal would still be “zero” cases and he would attempt to achieve that.
Sydney and Perth are divided by more than the Nullarbor; they have different Covid experiences and have conflicting views on the national cabinet opening-up strategy that Scott Morrison worked long and hard to secure.
Berejiklian’s aim is to find a “normal” life by vaccination – living with the virus, its cases and its deaths, restoring freedoms and economic life. Yet McGowan’s post-vaccination goal is a virus free utopia, guaranteed to be wildly popular in the West.
The biggest threat to Morrison’s 70-80 per cent nationwide strategy is Berejiklian’s inability to contain the Delta variant. If NSW still has hundreds of cases when it reaches the 70 per cent vaccine threshold other premiers will simply refuse to open in unison with NSW. Any national reopening strategy will be fatally compromised. A chaotic situation will unfold.
Beyond the NSW problem is the opposing problem of McGowan’s contradictory vision. McGowan, like all three ALP premiers, attacks Berejiklian’s lockdown as too weak and says her remarks about opening threaten the national cabinet decision. Yet it is McGowan who trashes the spirit and purpose of the national cabinet agenda while upholding its letter.
The entire purpose of the four stage 70-80 per cent vaccination plan, based on Doherty Institute modelling, is to move Australia as one nation across all states and territories into an easing of restrictions, lockdowns and closed borders by accepting that Covid cases will exist but that hospitalisation and deaths can be managed as the nation learns to live with the virus.
This is Morrison’s mantra. It is what the Doherty modelling sought to achieve. Yet McGowan in his SkyNews interview on Sunday had different goals. He will remain a zero-Covid premier despite any 80 per cent stellar vaccine rate, ready to resort to whatever powers are needed from lockdowns to border closures because the West “can’t run the risk” of being infiltrated by Delta.
The Australian's Editor-at-Large Paul Kelly says NSW coronavirus numbers are "alarming" with the trend continuing to increase which is now a "threat" to the national recovery.
McGowan will be cheered at home. But for most states, NSW being the most obvious, total elimination is not tenable. Berejiklian intends significant easing at the 70 per cent and 80 per cent thresholds. That means living with cases in the community and seeking a return to some form of freedom normality.
If McGowan is serious, then Australia risks a “two nation” fate divided by the Nullarbor, with contested methods of coping with Covid in late 2021 and possibly running far into 2022.
When pressed about fighting Covid, McGowan said “some” measures “might ease” in WA at the high vaccination levels. This premier is not for turning.
Reinforcing the west’s separate path is its dismal vaccination rate. On first jabs NSW scores 51 per cent compared with WA’s 41.6 per cent, while on both jabs NSW rates at 26.5 per cent compared with WA at 22.5 per cent.
The West’s figures are alarming in their own right, suggesting a distinct lack of urgency.
They are doubly alarming because the national cabinet plan says the transition from one stage to the next depends upon two conditions: the vaccination target being reached nationally and in each jurisdiction. There seems no escape.
The premiers are running the show with likely alarming consequences for our unity, our cohesion and our national economy.

Reopening in danger unless cases hit zero

Full text: Australia's plan to reopen and move beyond lockdowns this year will be in jeopardy unless NSW drives COVID-19 case numbers close to zero in addition to hitting vaccination targets of 70 and 80 per cent of the adult population.
Victoria and other states could return to a COVID normal if those vaccination targets were reached and case numbers remained low but NSW would be shut out by the rest of the country.
If the country did open up at 70 per cent vaccination with daily cases in the hundreds, as they were in NSW yesterday, modelling from the Doherty Institute suggests 385,000 cases and almost 1500 deaths could occur in six months.
To avoid thousands of cases a day, states and territories would be required to continue using border closures and lockdowns, even after hitting 70 and 80 per cent vaccination rates.
By comparison, reopening with low or no cases at 70 per cent vaccination would bring 2737 infections and 13 deaths over six months.
Under the national four-phase reopening plan based on the Doherty Institute modelling, lockdowns would be "unlikely but possible and targeted" at 70 per cent, then "highly targeted only" with minimum baseline restrictions at 80 per cent. Domestic border closures would also become unnecessary.
As NSW Premier Gladys Berejiklian increasingly highlights vaccination as her state's key tool out of lockdown, Victorian Health Minister Martin Foley emphasised that moving to a world without lockdowns was only possible with "zero or low cases" nationwide.
"Victoria has to do its bit. Queensland has to do its bit. Every state and territory has to do its bit. The biggest challenge is clearly NSW," he said yesterday. "I would encourage NSW to take all the measures it needs to to drive those numbers down ... we can't have that level of confidence until all of us have achieved the preconditions that the Doherty modelling is predicated on."
Nic Rebuli, a researcher at the UNSW School of Population Health who worked on the Doherty Institute modelling, said in his view anything above 100 cases a day was probably too high to consider moving beyond border closures and lockdowns, even at 70 per cent vaccination.
"There are two criteria to reopen in line with those targets. The first is obviously vaccine coverage. The other is low cases," Dr Rebuli said. "NSW's hope is if they can get vaccines to more at-risk areas, such as essential workers, they can bring transmission down while also increasing vaccination rates."
Among federal Coalition MPs, there is a widespread view that NSW will not be able to return to zero cases and that vaccination is the state's way out of the pandemic. Sydney MPs Dave Sharma, Jason Falinski and Fiona Martin and Queensland senator Matt Canavan all told The Sun-Herald NSW was unlikely to return to zero cases - a view also held by two members of federal cabinet.
With more than 100,000 jabs now being administered a day, Ms Berejiklian has estimated NSW will hit 70 per cent double-dose vaccination by late October and 80 per cent by mid-November.
However, Melbourne University epidemiologist Professor Tony Blakely said that, even with a stage four, statewide lockdown, it was difficult to see the state returning to zero cases before November or December, given the extent of transmission. "From there, there is a question over whether they might just choose to live with it. When vaccination coverage is higher it is easier, we believe, to achieve elimination then as it tips the balance your way," he said.

Full text: Gladys Berejiklian is weighing freedom incentives for vaccinated people despite concerns for emerging hotspots as NSW records 344 new cases and two deaths. Meanwhile, Dubbo will join other NSW regions by going into lockdown at 1pm today.
Daniel Andrews has extended Melbourne’s “seven day” lockdown by seven days after Victoria recorded 20 new community-acquired cases of coronavirus in the 24 hours to midnight on Tuesday.
Cairns and Yarrabah will be released from lockdown at 4pm on Wednesday, after Queensland recorded four new locally acquired cases of Covid-19 all linked to the Indooroopilly cluster in Brisbane’s inner west.
Richard Ferguson, Ewin Hannan 11.30pm: PM ‘must make call on mandatory jabs’
Scott Morrison and the national cabinet face urgent demands from business and unions to take control of workplace vaccinations, with ACTU secretary Sally McManus warning the shifting of responsibility for mandatory jabs to employers is a “recipe for division, resentment and confusion”.
The Prime Minister will not endorse compulsory vaccination and has left individual employers to test in court the legality of any vaccine mandates they ­implement, telling parliament it was a matter for premiers to take the “necessary decisions” to thwart the Delta strain.
The push for greater guidance on vaccine mandates came as tensions flared on Wednesday at food processor SPC, the first business in Australia to make jabs compulsory, with the company accusing unions of creating “fear and confusion” among workers.

Matthew Westwood 10.50pm: Season a bust for ballet company
The Australian Ballet has postponed the remainder of this year’s Melbourne season, ­including local premieres of Harlequinade and Anna Kar­enina, due to the uncertainty about Covid restrictions.
The company was to open with performances of Romeo and Juliet on August 27, which would have been its homecoming to Arts Centre Melbourne after almost 18 months of cancelled performances.
Melbourne’s extended lockdown and uncertainty about possible future restrictions have affected many arts and entertainment companies, including Melbourne Theatre Company and the Melbourne Symphony Orchestra.

Natasha Robinson 10.05pm: ‘Complacent’ Kiwis slow on uptake
New Zealand has come under heavy criticism for the slow pace of its vaccine rollout and failure to vaccinate its port workers as complacency bred by low case numbers is blamed for the government “dropping the ball”.
Almost half of New Zealand’s port workers are yet to receive a single dose of a vaccine, despite being designated a highest priority group for vaccination. The elderly in aged-care facilities are also not yet all vaccinated.
New Zealand ranks at the bottom of OECD countries in the pace of its vaccine rollout, with about 21.5 per cent of the eligible population (16-year-olds and up) fully vaccinated, behind Australia, which has 23.7 per cent fully vaccinated.
New Zealand faced similar ­issues to Australia in the early ­stages of its rollout, with supply of the Pfizer vaccine — which it is using to vaccinate its entire population — initially constrained. Like Australia, the country’s medical regulator did not approve vaccines for emergency use so the process of approval took longer than in the US and the UK.
David Murdoch, a professor at the University of Otago, said there had been a lack of urgency in New Zealand on the part of the government and the population regarding vaccines.
“I think complacency is potentially a big issue,” Professor Murdoch said. “A lot of public life looks fairly normal apart from the travel, so it can be a bit easy to revert to previous behaviours and not think getting vaccinated ­urgently is an issue.”

Marc Daalder 9.20pm: NZ ‘must stay the course and keep Covid out’
New Zealand should attempt to keep Covid-19 out of the country indefinitely, even after the population is largely vaccinated, the Ardern government’s expert ­advisory group says.
In a marked departure from the rest of the world, the panel said a combination of vaccination and low-level border measures should prevent the virus from becoming endemic in New Zealand.
The panel, which was tasked by Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern with formulating a post-pandemic plan, said there should be no change from the strategy of eliminating the coronavirus.
Any reopening would be contingent on completing the vaccination rollout and it would occur in phases, the panel led by epidemiologist David Skegg said.
One of the few other concrete recommendations was to narrow New Zealand’s travel bubbles with Australia and the Cook ­Islands to only include vaccinated travellers once the rollouts in each country were progressed.
Ms Ardern will outline her government’s response to the recommendations on Thursday.
That response is likely to shine a spotlight on the country’s sluggish immunisation program.

Rhiannon Down 8.35pm: Fears of going under while awaiting rescue
Businesses are pleading with the NSW government to get financial support flowing, with almost half of all applicants having not ­received anything as the Sydney lockdown enters its seventh week.
There are currently 100,722 ­applicants, from a total of 214,009, waiting to receive a share of $1.1bn worth of support payments, ­including Covid-19 business grants, micro-business grants and JobSaver payments, according to Service NSW.
Less than a third of applications for the Covid-19 business grant, which offers one-off payments of up to $15,000, have been processed, with just 36,876 approvals from 112,258 ­applications.
Premier Gladys Berejiklian on Wednesday apologised to those who had experienced delays and said Service NSW hoped to have dealt with “most of the backlog” by next Friday, despite just 12,062 applications being processed on Tuesday.
Extra Silky owner Nina Lee said she has been waiting for four weeks to hear about her appli­cations for the Covid-19 business grant and JobSaver to keep her inner-west Petersham hair salon afloat. “It’s looking like we won’t survive at the moment,” she said.
“I am fortunate to have a loyal customer base and there will be customers on the other side, but looking at my bank account at the moment, it’s looking serious.”

Michael McKenna 7.50pm: Premier sticks with secrecy on polling
A shroud of secrecy has been thrown over taxpayer-funded polling on Covid restrictions ­ordered by the Palaszczuk government amid allegations it was used by Labor strategists to shape its re-election campaign last year.
Queensland Premier Annastacia Palaszczuk on Wednesday refused to explain why more than $528,000 in polling won’t be released.
Contract documents for the monthly polling, which ALP insiders said was used by campaign strategists ahead of the October 31 election, show it was designed by advisers within Department of Premier and Cabinet to “help guide decision making” about state Covid restrictions.
The polling by Labor-favoured market researcher Ipsos Public Affairs also involved polling into the government’s Covid-19 strategy across a regional, Labor-held marginal seat targeted by the ­opposition ahead of the election. Ms Palaszczuk has repeatedly said Covid-related restrictions imposed by her government were based solely on health advice and dismissed suggestions she had ­ordered the polling to ensure her decisions were popular.
But Ms Palaszczuk has refused to release the polling reports, which also involve focus group analysis, saying it was only conducted to inform advertising on Covid measures.
“It was market research and sentiment testing and, no, it won’t be released,” said Ms Palaszczuk during her Wednesday morning press conference. She again ­refused to explain why.

Joseph Lam 7.10pm: Western NSW areas placed in lockdown
NSW Health has placed several LGAs surrounding Walgett into lockdown to protect a nearby population that could be particularly vulnerable to Covid-19.
The Western NSW LGAs of Bogan, Bourke, Brewarrina, Coonamble, Gilgandra, Narromine and Warren joined Walgett in a snap seven-day lockdown from 7pm on Wednesday.
All residents are required to stay home until at least August 19 unless they have a reasonable excuse to leave, said NSW Chief Health Officer Dr Kerry Chant.
No social visitors or family friends who live outside a resident’s household are able to visit. However, carers and those fulfilling compassionate reasons are exempt from this rule as are intimate partners who do not live together.
Western NSW’s stay-at-home orders are already in place across much of the state including Greater Sydney, Dubbo, Tamworth, Northern Rivers, Armidale, Newcastle, Lake Macquarie, Maitland, Port Stephens, Singleton, Dungog, Muswellbrook and Cessnock.
Joseph Lam 6.33pm: Walgett plunged into snap seven-day lockdown
The Walgett Shire LGA will enter a snap lockdown from 7pm on Wednesday after a local man who travelled to Dubbo tested positive for Covid-19.
The news of a positive case has sparked fears among local leaders — as almost one third of the town’s residents are indigenous and may be more at risk to the coronavirus.
A 2016 ABS census showed Walgett had 6107 people, of whom 29.4 per cent were indigenous.
Walgett’s increased restrictions will initially last seven days as contact tracers search for any further spread.
NSW Health fear the man, who was tested on August 7 and returned a positive test on Wednesday, may have been infectious since August 5.
“The person is also known to have been in Dubbo and Bathurst during their infectious period,” Western NSW Local Health District said.
Member for Barwon Roy Butler said he was concerned for his community.
“The news I have feared the most is confirmation of a Covid infection in a Barwon river town,” he said.
“These communities have many people with underlying health issues and often under resourced health services.”
Joseph Lam 6.01pm: Review to stop residents travelling outside Sydney
The NSW government is reportedly reviewing public health orders and looking to potentially impose harsher restrictions to target those who have been travelling outside of Sydney.
The news arrived after cases have been reported in both Albury and Byron Bay, both of which included Sydneysiders travelling to those areas.
Authorities will target “grey” areas in public health orders which allow those with second homes to travel outside of greater Sydney, according to 10 News.
The NSW Police Minister has reportedly “flagged” calling for extra support from the ADF, which will be discussed in meetings over the next 48 hours.
Sky News Political Editor Andrew Clennell says a full New South Wales lockdown is under consideration after the coronavirus spread to Dubbo.
Joseph Lam 5.38pm: Man charged after Sydney health worker assaulted
A 50-year-old man whose alleged abuse of a 31-year-old healthcare worker at a suburban Sydney Covid-19 testing site prompted several patients to exit their vehicles and come to her rescue has been arrested and charged.
The Telopea man allegedly used a mobile device to film himself punch the younger worker’s face, to dislodge her mask and to shout profanities about vaccines about 4pm on Monday at the Kissing Point road testing site in Dundas, some 21km northwest of the CBD.
After fleeing on foot as patients came to the rescue of the woman, Cumberland Police arrested the man at his Shortland Street home about 10.30am on Wednesday. He has been charged with common assault, two counts of possess prohibited drug and breach of the public health orders. He has been granted conditional bail to attend Parramatta Local Court next month.
NSW Police have also arrested a 39-year-old Wollongong man who has been charged with two counts of “throw missile” at a female police officer and her horse.
Police allege the Woonona man, who was arrested on Tuesday afternoon about 3.20pm at his Watergum Way home, travelled to Sydney to participate in an unauthorised protest on Saturday, July 24.
He has been charged with riot, assault police and not complying with a notice of direction.
Police allege he threw horse manure and a pot plant at a mounted police officer and her hose.
He has been refused bail and appeared at Wollongong Local Court on Wednesday.
Anton Nilsson 5.23pm: ‘No records’ of NSW teacher vaccinations
NSW education officials have no idea how many teachers have been vaccinated even as preparations continue to bring year 12 students back to Sydney classrooms.
Authorities have also revealed they have no clue how many individuals will be out and about as a result of classrooms reopening.
The admissions came a day after the NSW chief health officer said she’d provided clear advice to the government that it would be unsafe to have students moving around the city.
The chief of the teachers’ union said the push for face-to-face lessons for year 12 students, planned to begin August 16, was “premature and ill-conceived”.

Staff Reporters 4.50pm: Infected Sydney man charged over Byron trip
A Rose Bay man will face court in September after being charged with breaching public health orders by leaving Sydney and visiting Byron Bay and surrounding areas.
Police will lay charges against a man with Covid-19 who is in Lismore Base Hospital. He has been accused of breaching public health orders.
Zoran Radovanovic , 52, who is being treated for Covid-19 in a Lismore hospital, was issued with a Future Court Attendance Notice this afternoon on seven offences.
He was granted strict conditional bail to appear at Lismore Local Court on September 13.
His alleged presence in the community while infected forced the Byron Shire, Richmond Valley, Lismore, Ballina and the Northern Rivers to go into a snap seven day lockdown.
The man allegedly drove with his two children to Byron and was in the Northern Rivers community for four days while infectious last week, during which time he allegedly did not comply with QR code check in requirements at venues.
It is not clear if the man knew he was infectious or not.
Joseph Lam 4.35pm: A breakdown of NSW Covid-19 cases
NSW has recorded 5091 Covid-19 cases over the past four weeks to 8pm Tuesday, August 10.
Of those cases, more than 40 per cent were recorded in the south west Sydney health district, over a quarter were recorded in western Sydney health district and 15 per cent were recorded in Sydney (central) health district.
Covid-19 cases in NSW
The Southwest Sydney LGA of Canterbury Bankstown was home to the majority of cases, recording 23 per cent – or 1176 cases.
The second highest number of cases was recorded in Fairfield, with 800, followed by Cumberland (718 cases), Liverpool (462 cases), Blacktown (439 cases), Campbelltown (227 cases), Penrith (223 cases), Parramatta (199 cases), Georges River (131 cases), Bayside (122 cases) and the Inner West (79 cases).
While Canterbury Bankstown recorded the highest number of cases, the LGA has also performed 70,000 more tests than any other LGA, undertaking 297,457 tests over the past four weeks.
Fairfield has performed the second highest number of tests at 227,423 followed by Blacktown with 174,418, Cumberland with 154,348, Liverpool with 152,336. All other LGAs performed less than 100,000 tests over the same period.
Joseph Lam 4.20pm: Covid case forces Bathurst jail into lockdown
Bathurst correctional centre has been thrusted into a precautionary lockdown after a young inmate tested positive for Covid-19.
Infectious disease specialist and former Deputy Chief Health Officer, Dr. Nick Coatsworth, responds to MP George Christensen's controversial COVID claims in Parliament.
Several staff and inmates are now in isolation after the inmate, a 27-year-old who arrived on Saturday and has been granted bail on Monday, tested positive.
“Bathurst Correctional Centre has today been placed into a precautionary lockdown after receiving a positive COVID-19 test result from a fresh custody inmate,” a Corrective Services NSW spokeswoman said.
“The CSNSW COVID command post is working with staff to identify anyone who has had contact with the inmate.”
Rachel Baxendale 4.10pm: Police probe home invasion attempt
Victorian Police are investigating after a man allegedly impersonated a health department authorised officer conducting a home quarantine check in an attempted home invasion.
A woman has told Nine News she was approached at her home by a main claiming to be an authorised officer, who then asked her to perform sexual acts to get out of quarantine.
Nine News has reported that the man had information which police believe was legitimate on an iPad he was carrying.
Prime Minister Scott Morrison’s comment that the COVID-19 vaccine rollout is ‘not a race’ was a “big mistake”, according to Sky News Political Editor Andrew Clennell. “We know that, a lot of Australians in lockdown are latching onto that,” Mr Clennell said. Opposition Leader Anthony Albanese has further criticised Mr Morrison’s recent comments that “it doesn’t matter how you start the race, it’s how you finish the race”.
The Australian has sought comment from police.
Victorian Covid logistics chief Jeroen Weimar said he was aware of a police investigation “into someone impersonating an authorised officer and seeking to enter into the home.”
“That must be an incredibly distressing and frightening experience for the individual concerned, and I extend my sympathies to her,” Mr Weimar said.
“Let me be very clear. Authorised officers, when they make home visits, there are three things we should all be aware of: they will always be in uniform, they will always have appropriate identification, and they will never under any circumstances seek entry into your home.
“So please, if you are being visited as part of our home visit program, by one of our authorised offers, ask for their ID, check their uniform and if they ask to get into your home, shut the door.”
Asked whether he believed the content on the alleged home invader’s iPad was legitimate health department information, Mr Weimar said the matter was the subject of a police investigation.
“We’re working very closely with the investigation team. I can’t comment on that active investigation at the moment,” he said.
Remy Varga 4pm: Man assessed after heckling Dan Andrews
A man has been hospitalised after repeatedly screaming at Victorian Premier Daniel Andrews during a press conference on Wednesday.
A Victoria Police spokeswoman confirmed a 51-year-old Brunswick man had been taken to hospital for assessment after being apprehended by protective service officers at 12.40pm.
“Protective Service Officers apprehended a man behaving erratically at a press conference at Treasury Place, Melbourne about 12.40pm today. (11 August),” she said. “A 51-year-old Brunswick man was taken to hospital for an assessment.”
Lisa Allen 3.30pm: Gerry Harvey’s $35m Dubbo punt
Multibillionaire retailer Gerry Harvey might be close to 82 years of age and built a retail ­empire worth $3.3bn worth of Harvey Norman stores, constructed houses, and developed land subdivisions, but he has never before ventured into apartment towers – particularly 400km from Sydney in the heart of the Central West.

Jack the Insider 3.07pm: Bending NSW’s ring of aluminium
Welcome to Premier Gladys Berejiklian’s ring of aluminium, a lockdown that permits people to leave the greater Sydney area and wander around in other people’s homes in regional New South Wales.
By the way, the current lockdown laws in greater Sydney also permit real estate agents to conduct inspections of rental properties. If you rent, there is at least a prospect that landlords and agents will insist on conducting in person inspections on the premises. They are legally entitled to do so up to four times a year. Are these agents obliged to be vaccinated? Are there any requirements on them to enter the premises wearing a mask? Social distancing? Even splashing on a bit of hand sanitiser? Nope.
In a sense it was only a matter of time before regional New South Wales was at risk.
That’s not to cheer on the ring of steel almost fetishistically demanded by Victorian Premier Dan Andrews. The talk of heavy metal lockdowns cannot work in Sydney without causing great hardship across the country. Sydney is not Melbourne and the idea of police roadblocks and routine inspections of vehicles along major arterial roads out of Sydney would cause immense supply chain delays of basic foodstuffs across the country. Sure, Australia would be right for toilet paper, much of which is manufactured and distributed in Victoria but just about any other basic foodstuff and household item you can think of comes either from or through Sydney.
Now Covid-19 has come to Byron Bay. Take three drops of Wolf’s bane and five of essence of Monk’s hood administered under the tongue at the rise of the next new moon.

Max Maddison 2.51pm: Look closer to home for crazy conspiracies, ALP told
Scott Morrison has moved again to distance his government from the “crazy rubbish conspiracies” of Nationals MP George Christensen , but Health Minister Greg Hunt says Labor should look closer to home.
After being asked by opposition whip Chris Hayes what the federal government was doing to combat the “dangerous spread” of misinformation by QAnon during the pandemic, Mr Morrison said his government would have “no association” with Mr Christensen’s comments.
“Mr Speaker, crazy rubbish conspiracies have no place when it comes to the public health of this country and this government will have no association with it as we demonstrated yesterday in this House,” Mr Morrison told question time on Wednesday afternoon.
After being handballed the question, Mr Hunt pointed to comments made by Labor’s candidate for Higgins, Michelle Ananda-Rajah , an outspoken AstraZeneca critic.
“Professor Skerritt said if AstraZeneca (hadn’t been used for vaccination) in NSW, there would have been deaths in their dozens every day, unfortunately, there are those that have spread material and information that does not accord with the high standards,” Mr Hunt said.
“Quote, the issue is the rest of the country is going to be offered a lower efficacious vaccine, the AstraZeneca. Quote, we are about to unleash 51 million doses of AstraZeneca, it is the Labour Party’s candidate for Higgins.”

Max Maddison 2.33pm: Labor ‘undermining national Covid plan’
Scott Morrison has accused Labor of “undermining” the national Covid plan, after the opposition said he had failed to keep promises he made to Australians stuck overseas.
Opposition health spokesman Mark Butler asked the Prime Minister why he had failed to deliver on his announcement that the 40,000 Australians stuck overseas “would be home by Christmas” .
Mr Morrison used the question to attack Labor, saying he had merely said he “wanted” all Australians to be around the table by Christmas.
“I don’t know why that would be a point at which the government would be attacked by the opposition. I simply don’t understand it,” Mr Morrison told questiontTime on Wednesday afternoon.
“The Delta strain has changed everything. That is the position understood and agreed by premiers, chief ministers and myself. Together we are implementing the national plan, the Labor Party is undermining the national plan.”

Ellie Dudley 1.50pm: Full list of areas affected by Dubbo lockdown
Eight suburbs in the Dubbo LGA will exist under strict stay at home orders for at least the next seven days, after Covid-19 was detected in the community.
The outer west region of NSWwas plunged into a week-long lockdown after two cases were detected in the community.
The areas of Dubbo, Wellington, Wongarbon, Geurie, Brocklehurst, Stuart Town, Mumbil and Eumungerie are those that are affected by the new public health orders.
Similar conditions apply to the regional areas of Tamworth and Armidale, in north west NSW, although no new cases were recorded in the area on Wednesday.
The Upper Hunter region will likely have their lockdown extended beyond August 12, after 14 new cases of Covid-19 were reported in the community on Wednesday.

Rachel Baxendale 1.33pm: Where Melbourne’s infections come from
Of 118 active coronavirus cases in Victoria on Wednesday, 100 have emerged since last Wednesday and have predominantly been linked to western suburbs outbreaks centred on a Hobsons Bay teacher who works at Al-Taqwa College in Truganina, and a Maribyrnong man who works in a Derrimut warehouse.
Three active cases are in overseas arrivals in hotel quarantine, while the remaining 15 are linked to the outbreaks which sparked Victoria’s fifth lockdown last month.
There is now just one person in a Victorian hospital with coronavirus, who is not in intensive care.
About 13,800 primary close contacts have been linked to the current cases, up 1700 since Tuesday and linked to almost 299 exposure sites, predominantly in Melbourne’s west but also in the bayside, outer eastern and northern suburbs.
Approximately 1000 primary close contacts linked to older sites were released from quarantine on Tuesday having submitted negative Day 13 tests.
The latest exposure sites include Tabcorp Park in Melton in Melbourne’s outer northwest, the Royal Flagstaff apartment complex in West Melbourne, the Vision apartment complex in Elizabeth Street in Melbourne’s CBD, and Brimbank shopping centre in Deer Park.
A full list is available on the health department website.
Of Victoria’s 20 new community-acquired cases on Wednesday:
- One is a student at Al-Taqwa College and a further five are household members of students at the school. All six were isolating while infectious;
- Five are household contacts from students at Mount Alexander College. All five were isolating while infectious;
- Four are linked to the Caroline Springs shopping centre, bringing the total number linked to the centre to 25. The latest four cases include two linked to the Jolly Miller cafe, one to the YPA real estate, and one to the Edwards Sourdough bakery. Of the four, two were isolating while infectious;
- Five cases are not currently linked to any known outbreaks, although Covid logistics chief Jeroen Weimar said authorities were “confident” they could establish links in coming days. Of these five, three are a family from the City of Melton in Melbourne’s outer northwest, including two parents and a child. The child was already in isolation as a contact of another primary close contact, although that contact is yet to test positive for the virus. The remaining two cases are a father and son who live in the City of Melbourne. The son is a Grade One student at St Michael’s Primary School in North Melbourne. While is not believed to have been infectious while at school prior to last week’s lockdown, his class has been deemed a Tier 1 exposure site and the school Tier 2. The father is a health care worker who last worked at the Melbourne Children’s Eye Clinic at the Royal Children’s Hospital last Monday. Patients and staff are being contacted and a small section of the wider hospital has been deemed a Tier 2 site, with attendees required to get tested and isolate until they receive a negative result.
Mr Weimar said the Caroline Springs Shopping Centre and Melton were areas of key concern for authorities.
“We now have 13 active cases in the City of Melton area, six of those are new cases today,” he said.
“We are doing a lot of work around Melton high street, a number of retail sites (with) 13 exposure sites already listed.
“I expect to see more during the course of the day. My callout to anyone who is using Melton as part of their retailing activity, please come forward and get tested.
“Five of the cases today are cases we were not aware of before they came through yesterday. We became aware because people did the right thing: They got symptoms, they got tested.”
Mr Weimar said authorities remained concerned about sustained waste water detections in Broadmeadows, Glenroy and Jacana in Melbourne’s northwest.

Staff writers 12.51pm: Rose Bay man, 52, to be charged over Byron Bay visit
A man will be served a Future Court Attendance Notice today for breaching public health orders after he visited the Byron Bay and surrounding areas.
Victorian Premier Daniel Andrews says permits will be required from 1pm on Thursday for residents who want to move within the border bubble with New South Wales. ‘It is important that we not only limited movement but that we have the clearest picture of who is moving within that border bubble,” he said. The permits will be available from Thursday but will not be enforced until 6pm on Friday. “If this virus can get from Sydney to Byron Bay to Dubbo to Armidale to Tamworth, then only a fool would think that it couldn't get to Albury," he said. “It absolutely can and that’s why we need to go beyond just a bubble. “We need to have permits so that people can apply once, have their permit, and then we have a clear sense of who is moving in those border towns.”
Following inquiries, including appeals for public assistance, the 52-year-old man from Rose Bay will be charged after he allegedly travelled from Sydney to Byron Bay and the surrounding area, without a reasonable excuse and in contravention of the public health orders.
The Future Court Attendance Notice will be served on the man at the Lismore Base Hospital with strict bail conditions.
He will appear at Lismore Local Court on Monday 13 September 2021.
Inquiries are ongoing.

Rachel Baxendale 12.06pm: Andrews update interrupted by yelling interlopers
Two men have been tackled to the ground by protective services offices after disrupting the Andrews government’s Covid press conference on Wednesday.
One man yelled “Premier Daniel Andrews ” repeatedly, while another made reference to Health Minister Martin Foley .
One of the men continued to yell loudly and nonsensically for minutes after being detained, with Mr Andrews, Covid logistics chief Jeroen Weimar and chief health officer Brett Sutton at times barely audible above the loud but wordless noise.
The men were on an outdoor level above the press conference, which is being held at the back of the Premier’s office at 1 Treasury Place.
At one stage Mr Andrews acknowledged one of the interlopers, saying: “No one else can hear me because of the amazing contribution you’re making up there... We’ll keep you safe too.”
Journalists at the press conference say the man had waited at Treasury Place ahead of the 11am media briefing, filming police and asking for written notes to be passed on to the Premier.
The man is now accusing police of having injured his leg in detaining him, while police have indicated they believe he is feigning the injury.
Mr Andrews said he did not know “what was going on” with the man.
“No. We do not know if it is even about Covid,” Mr Andrews told the press conference.
“It’s somebody who I think has wanted to speak to me for some time, but I don’t know who it is.
“The point I made before is that if you support me or not, I will do everything I can to protect you from this virus.
“Shouting does not work against this virus. Interrupting anyone does not work against this virus.
“Like I said the other day - if frustration and anger was effective against coronavirus, we would all be double dosed by now. It does not work. “People are entitled to their views. That is fine. But whether you support me and my team or not, we will do everything we can, every hour of the day, to keep you safe.”

Rachel Baxendale 12.02pm: Andrews flags more AZ in Victoria’s clinics
Daniel Andrews has foreshadowed the expansion of AstraZeneca vaccinations at state-run clinics in Victoria.
The Premier’s comments follow news that Victorian GPs are administering fewer than half the number of AstraZeneca vaccinations as their NSW counterparts, and after the Andrews government made AstraZeneca available to under-40s at six metropolitan and three regional vaccination hubs from Monday.
On Tuesday, 23,811 people were vaccinated at Victoria’s state-run hubs.
Victorian Premier Danial Andrews says the state’s lockdown will be extended for a further seven days as several “mystery cases” have appeared. Mr Andrews said Victoria recorded 20 locally acquired cases of COVID-19 overnight with six out in the community while infectious and 15 linked to current outbreaks. “There are a number of mystery cases and cases still being investigated, that really is the most important number,” he said. “That’s why sadly today the Cabinet of the government, we have met, and we have determined to accept the advice of the chief health officer to extend it for a further period of seven days to 11:59 pm next Thursday.” Mr Andrews said reopening was “simply not possible” due to the Delta variant and if the state was to end lockdown, case numbers could end up like Sydney. “I’d love to be standing here announcing that we are coming out of lockdown this coming Thursday, that is simply not possible, we need to go until next Thursday, that is the public health advice.” “There are too many cases and too cases the origins which are not clear to us, too many unanswered questions, too many mysteries for us to safely come out of lockdown now.”
“We’ve seen really strong uptake in those additional AstraZeneca appointments that we brought online and the eligibility expansion from 18-39,” Mr Andrews said.
“I can, not today, but quite soon speak to further expansions of the AstraZeneca program, further expansions to the hub model so we can get even more people vaccinated over the next month or so.”
Mr Andrews urged those eligible for any vaccine, including AstraZeneca to get vaccinated as soon as possible.
“As the chief health officer said yesterday, the best vaccine is the one you can access today,” he said.
“That makes a huge contribution to us getting to the other side of the lockdowns, getting to the other side with a very different set of rules.
Mr Andrews said approximately 7000 AstraZeneca and 30,000 Pfizer bookings had been made in the past 24 hours.

Ellie Dudley 11.56am: Shoebridge questions politically loaded: Hazzard
NSW health minister Brad Hazzard has defended his actions in a parliamentary inquiry into the government’s handling of the Covid-19 pandemic, after he was criticised for cutting off chief health officer Kerry Chant in her questioning.
NSW Health Minister Brad Hazzard has rejected assertions the state government acted too late in curbing Greater Sydney’s COVID-19 outbreak, telling a parliamentary inquiry acted “very expeditiously” to enforce citywide lockdowns. Greater Sydney is currently into its seventh week of stay-at-home restrictions with no end in sight after the state recorded its highest daily total of 356 new cases in the past 24 hours. Pressed by Greens MP David Shoebridge on the 10-day delay in locking down, Mr Hazzard replied: “What you’re missing is the seven LGAs in the eastern suburbs were a bit like the Northern Beaches, they responded very well and very quickly”. “When those cases went out to West Hoxton, that was not seen initially, and that came out of the Joh Bailey hair salon. “That was on June 23 and at June 26 was when we went not the lockdown so everything was done very expeditiously so it’s not quite the way you’re seeing it, you’re seeing it from the 16th.” Chief Health Officer Dr Kerry Chant admitted chains of transmission had gone undetected following the spread of the Delta variant outside of Sydney’s east. Dr Chant said the initial Bondi outbreak was “actually brought under control” until things spiralled after it was introduced into southwestern Sydney. “Obviously, with looking back, there was a chain of transmission that was not detected, and that was also playing into the mind that we needed to lockdown,” she said. “So all I can say is that we were looking closely at the information available, working with our public health networks, and provided advice to government on a range of strategies. “The outbreak was actually brought under control in southeastern Sydney, it was really around when it got introduced into southwestern Sydney that we saw the escalating case numbers and I think, to be fair, it needed a different response in southwestern Sydney.”
Mr Hazzard fired up at Greens legislative council member David Shoebridge as he questioned Dr Chant on the timing of the advice she provided to the government.
Mr Hazzard angrily interrupted Mr Shoebridge, saying: “David, David, we are in the middle of a pandemic and you’re just asking questions that are just aimed at having a go.”
Asked on Wednesday about his response to Mr Shoebridge’s questioning, Mr Hazzard said he took issue with questions that were asked “in a political way”.
“The questions were loaded politically, with not necessarily the logical outcome,” he said.
“They were drawing their own conclusions.”
“Some of the questions were very good but some were a little challenging on that front.
“I guess I would say Dr Chant works very hard, extremely hard and so does the whole public health team, and I think challenging...her integrity in terms of her decision making was not appropriate.”

Ellie Dudley 11.54am: Cloud hangs over return to school timeline
Premier Gladys Berejiklian has been unable to outline a timeline for schools to return, saying the highly-infectious Delta strain is a major risk to students.
Year 12 students in low risk areas of Sydney will return to school on Monday, while those in southwest and western Sydney will not be permitted to go back.
Premier Gladys Berejiklian says New South Wales has recorded 344 new local COVID cases and two deaths related to the Delta outbreak. An unvaccinated man in his 90s died in hospital and an unvaccinated man in his 30s with underlying health conditions also passed away. “We do want to stress that the man in his 30s did have other conditions as well,” Ms Berejiklian said during a media conference on Wednesday. “But notwithstanding that, he obviously succumbed to COVID.” Ms Berejiklian also flagged case numbers were beginning to decline in the Fairfield and the Canterbury-Bankstown local government areas. “However, the adjoining local government areas, or the suburbs adjoining those areas of Bayside, Burwood, and the Inner West are starting to have an increase in cases,” she said. “They’re not at high levels yet, but we don’t want them to get higher. “Please note if you live in those suburbs around the Bayside, Burwood and Inner West councils, please be on extra alert, come forward for testing. “We don't want to have to include you in those local governments of concern, but we may have to do if case numbers don't at least stabilise or start going down.”
For other students, the timeline of when they will return to school is unknown.
“When schools will return will depend on the next few weeks,” Ms Berejiklain said.
“How much we can control the case numbers until the end of August (will indicate) what life looks like in September and October.
“The reason why we will have some level of confidence in talking about that at the right time - it’s a bit premature now - but in a few weeks we’ll have a better idea of what September and October looks like because we will be able to see a consistent rate of vaccination.
“We’ll have a better idea of whether we’ll hit the 6 million target and the 70 per cent target after that.”

Ellie Dudley 11.40am: Premier maintains 50pc vaccination rate target
NSW Premier Gladys Berejiklian has rejected the suggestion she was giving “false hope” to Sydneysiders by saying restrictions could be eased at a 50 per cent vaccination rate.
NSW chief health officer Kerry Chant told an inquiry into the government’s handling of the pandemic on Tuesday that it was her preference for the state to achieve 70 per cent of vaccination coverage, per the advice of modelling provided to the national cabinet last week, before restrictions are substantially eased.
But Ms Berejiklian has repeatedly said restrictions would be eased when 50 per cent of the population had been vaccinated, and doubled down on her claims on Wednesday.
“It is important to say to people that if we have higher rates of vaccination there’s every chance you can do something more than what you can today,” she said.
“If we can incentivise people to say, if you are fully vaccinated you might be able to undertake an activity which you can’t now, well that is a positive. I think most people would appreciate that.”

Ellie Dudley 11.30am: Hotspot fears over Sydney’s inner-west
NSW chief health officer Kerry Chant says health authorities fear Covid-19 could be spreading out of high risk areas and into the inner west.
Health authorities have refocused their efforts away from the Fairfield local government area in southwest Sydney as cases in the area begin to decline.
The drop in cases in the area, however, comes with news that the hotspot areas are shifting.
“What we are seeing is the growth of case numbers in other areas, and we need to redouble our efforts in those areas to achieve the same impact we have seen and the Fairfield area,” Dr Chant said.
“For instance, in the inner west and the areas around Cumberland are still very high. Bayside, Georges River - particularly the edges of those suburbs - that border onto the (high-risk) suburbs, and Strathfield as well.
“As the Premier has indicated, we are watching them closely. It is important that everybody knows there is an increase in cases in those areas, and for them to come out and get tested and assist us with control.”
Asked whether it would be more effective to apply the same strict restrictions that currently apply to southwest and west Sydney to all greater Sydney LGAs as the virus continues to spread, Dr Chant said residents seem to respond better when a targeted approach is taken.
“What we have seen is the community responding when we tell them specific areas,” she said.
“It is very hard for the community if we are talking about cases in an area where there hasn’t been any cases. Whereas, if we can explain that these are the areas where we are seeing cases then we get a greater response.”

Ellie Dudley 11.19am: NSW on course for 80pc vaccinated by mid-November
NSW is set to have 80 per cent of residents fully vaccinated by mid-November, says Premier Gladys Berejiklian .
Up to 4.5 million doses of the vaccine have been administered to NSW residents, as the state strives for 6 million doses by the end of the month.
Vaccination rates in NSW
“With 6 million jabs by the end of August, if achieved, there will be opportunities for us in parts of the communities where cases are low and vaccination rates are high for them to do more than they do today,” Ms Berejiklian said.
“That is what we are working towards and something that our government is very keen to make possible.”
The Doherty report, which governs timelines for national cabinet, outlines that restrictions can be drastically eased when the country hits an 80 per cent vaccination rate.
Ms Berejiklian said the state will reach that by mid-November.
“According to the Doherty report, that is when life gets back to normal, that is when we have a different approach to Covid, when freedoms that we had will be in place,” she said.
Rachel Baxendale 11.13am: Melbourne lockdown extended another seven days
Victorian Premier Daniel Andrews has extended Melbourne’s “seven day” lockdown by seven days.
The decision comes after just 20 of 100 coronavirus cases linked to the outbreaks which emerged a week ago were in quarantine for the duration of their infectious period, and as five “mystery” cases were discovered overnight.

Ellie Dudley 11.07am: Dubbo to go into lockdown from 1pm today
Premier Gladys Berejiklian has confirmed the region of Dubbo in central west NSW will enter a seven day lockdown from 1pm on Wednesday.
The lockdown comes as two new cases were detected in the area overnight, and two schools were closed as a result.
Two schools in regional New South Wales have been locked down after a member of the Dubbo community tested positive for COVID. Dubbo West Public School and Macquarie Anglican Grammar School have been closed for deep cleaning. The positive case was identified after the individual became symptomatic on August 9 and presented for testing on August 10. Dubbo MP Dugald Saunders said nine close contacts who have been identified to date are in isolation and either have been tested or will be tested as soon as possible. Investigations and contact tracing are continuing as it is not yet known how the transmission occurred.
“I understand community leaders have already been advised of that,” Ms Berejiklian said.
“The lockdown will occur from 1pm today.”
No new cases were detected in Armidale, Tamworth or the Northern Rivers region, but 14 new cases were detected in the Hunter New England region.
Ms Berejiklian said due to the new cases in the Hunter New England region, it “doesn’t look like it will come out of lockdown” on Thursday as previously expected.
Ellie Dudley 11.01am: NSW records 344 new cases, two deaths
NSW has recorded 344 new locally-acquired cases of Covid-19 as infections across the state continue to spread.
At least 65 of the cases were active in the community for the entirety of their infectious period, Premier Gladys Berejiklian said.
“I want to stress, over the last two days we have seen a surge in the number of cases and are expected to continue,” she said.
New daily cases in New South Wales
Two deaths were recorded overnight in NSW residents.
A 30-year-old man who had underlying heart conditions died in hospital after contracting the virus.
An 80-year old-man with Covid-19 has also died.
Around 119,000 tests were conducted in the 24 hours to 8pm last night.
The Premier said cases in the Fairfield and Canterbury-Bankstown area are starting to come down.

Ellie Dudley 10.33am: Palaszczuk ‘won’t release’ polling information
Queensland Premier Annastacia Palaszczuk has again refused to release polling information into her government’s handling of the pandemic.
The Australian revealed on Wednesday the Palaszczuk government conducted taxpayer-funded polling into their Covid-19 strategy across a regional, Labor-held marginal seat targeted by the opposition ahead of last year’s state election.
Intensive “qualitative” interviews were commissioned with hundreds of residents in the Livingstone Shire – almost exclusively in Labor’s seat of Keppel – just days after a newspaper poll showed it was in danger of falling to the Liberal National Party.
Ms Palaszczuk said the polling was “market research and sentiment testing” and “no, it won’t be released.”
“(It won’t be released) because every state and the federal government has also done the exact same market research and sentiment testing,” she told Wednesday’s press conference.
When pressed for a reason as to why she wouldn’t release the information, Ms Palaszczuk said: “Go and ask all the other state premiers and the prime minister.”

Ellie Dudley 10.11am: Cairns to be released from lockdown at 4pm
Cairns and Yarrabah will be released from lockdown at 4pm on Wednesday, after Queensland recorded four new locally acquired cases of Covid-19 all linked to the Indooroopilly cluster in Brisbane’s inner west.
The far north regions will exist under the same restrictions that currently apply to southeast Queensland until August 22.
“Of course, the Cairns residents will also have to be wearing those masks, just as they do down here in southeast Queensland, and, of course, the high school students will need to wear masks as well,” Premier Annastacia Palaszczuk said.
All cases detected in Brisbane had been in isolation for the entirety of their infectious period which was “exactly what we want to be seeing”, she added.
A total of 23,099 tests were conducted across the state on Wednesday.
Ms Palaszczuk was speaking from a new vaccination hub at Brisbane Convention and Exhibition Centre which opened today and will vaccinate 1500 per day.
New daily cases in Queensland, from July 25, 2021
Queensland chief health officer Jeannette Young has urged residents in Cairns and Yarrabah to remain vigilant for Covid-19 symptoms as they emerge from lockdown today.
The regions in far north Queensland were put under strict stay at home orders for three days after a reef pilot and a taxi driver were found to have been infected with the virus.
Dr Young said the health authorities could “definitively confirm” the reef pilot, who passed the virus onto the taxi driver, had been infected on July 23 from a New Zealand ship.
A number of additional exposure sites had been released in regards to the taxi driver he then infected, causing Dr Young to issue a stern warning to those in Cairns.
“It’s really important that you still come forward and get tested, and anyone in Cairns with any symptoms at all, as you have been doing the last few days,” she said.
Dr Young said it was “still important” to have ongoing restrictions to stop further spread of the virus.
The following restrictions will apply to the area:
Mask wearing at all times (including workplaces) except when eating or drinking, or exercising with your household or one other person.
Schools will reopen, with all staff and high school students wearing masks
10 people in your home, including people who live there
20 people at a wedding ceremony or funeral service
Businesses and venues with one person per four square metres, or 50 percent capacity with seated, ticket allocations
Community sports and activities are restricted and, in some cases, not permitted.
Avoid travelling to regional Queensland
Visitors allowed to hospitals, aged care and disability accommodation

Rachel Baxendale 10.04am: Andrews deciding on lockdown extension
With 20 new coronavirus cases in Victoria on Wednesday, five of which are under investigation for a source of acquisition, Melburnians know their “seven day” lockdown will not be ending after seven days.
The issue is how long the extension is likely to be.
A meeting is under way on Wednesday morning between the Andrews government and health officials to make that decision, with a seven day extension considered most likely.
Premier Daniel Andrews will hold a press conference later on Wednesday to announce the decision.
Mr Andrews and Health Minister Martin Foley have repeatedly indicated decisions on the duration of lockdowns will primarily be determined on the basis of the number of recent cases infectious in the community.
Of 100 cases linked to the most recent outbreaks since they emerged a week ago, only 20 have been in quarantine throughout their infectious period.

Rachel Baxendale 9.56am: Victoria adds more than 40 new exposure sites
Victoria’s number of coronavirus exposure sites has grown by more than 40 over the past 24 hours to hit 291 on Wednesday morning.
Victoria’s lockdown is set to end on Thursday, but an extension is looking likely after 20 new local cases were recorded on Tuesday. Only five of the 20 cases were in isolation during their infectious period. Premier Daniel Andrews would like the numbers to be much lower before restrictions are eased and leading epidemiologists have indicated figures need to be in the single digits before the lockdown is lifted. However, the government gave no indications yesterday as to whether the lockdown would be extended.
While a shopping centre in Caroline Springs in Melbourne’s outer west remains the site of greatest concern to authorities, having been linked to at least 25 cases across numerous stores, sites have also recently been identified in Melbourne’s bayside and north.
Sites have recently been listed in Hoppers Crossing, Williams Landing, Deer Park, Hillside, Aintree, Melton, Melton West, Caroline Springs, Cairnlea, Taylors Lakes and Maribyrnong in the west, Flemington in the inner northwest and Preston in the north, as well as in bayside Brighton and nearby Elwood.
Public transport routes including trains and buses in Melbourne’s west have also been listed.
Investigations are ongoing after a doctor who works at the Royal Children’s Hospital tested positive on Tuesday.
It is understood the doctor did not work at the hospital while infectious, but may have treated patients in private rooms nearby.
The full list of exposure sites is available on the health department website.

Ellie Dudley 9.42am: Premiers, health authorities set to deliver Covid updates
State health authorities across Australia will front the media this morning to provide updates on their respective Covid-19 outbreaks.
Queensland’s premier Annastacia Palaszczuk will hold a press conference at 10am alongside the state’s health minister Yvette D’Ath and chief health officer Jeannette Young .
Queensland recorded three new cases of Covid-19 on Monday, all linked to the cluster in Brisbane’s inner-west.
Cairns and Yarrabah in the state’s far north are on track to be released from their three-day snap lockdown on Wednesday, after they were placed under strict stay at home orders on Sunday due to a taxi driver infected with Covid-19 was infectious in the community for up to 10 days.
Queensland has opened its first mass vaccination hub, which by the end of the week will be providing 3,000 vaccinations per day. There is a long wait list, with 230,000 people across the state having registered with Queensland Health to receive the vaccine. The centre, in Brisbane, is focused on Pfizer in particular with AstraZeneca being left to pharmacies and GPs. The hub is the first in Queensland and bookings are essential.
No new cases have been discovered in association with the taxi driver, who has been linked to a positive case in a reef pilot detected in far north Queensland last week.
NSW Premier Gladys Berejiklian will provide an update at 11am, after the state recorded 356 new locally acquired cases of Covid-19 on Monday and three deaths.
No additional cases were detected in the Byron Shire on Tuesday despite an infected traveler from Sydney visiting a number of locations and sending the area into a seven day lockdown.
That could change today after exposure sites in the far north coastal town were released by NSW Health on Tuesday afternoon.
No new cases were found in Tamworth or Armidale in north west regional NSW, but reports from Wednesday morning show a positive case in a Dubbo school may plunge the region in the central west into lockdown.
Victorian authorities are expected to provide their state’s update this morning, but are yet to set a time.
The southern state recorded 20 new cases of the virus on Wednesday, 15 of which have been linked to existing infections, and five are still under investigation.
While 14 were in quarantine throughout their infectious period, six were not.

Up to 120 people were turned away from a pop up vaccination hub in Bankstown in Sydney’s southwest, says opposition housing spokesman and federal member for Blaxland Jason Clare .
The Bankstown Sports Club walk-in vaccine clinic in was opened last week for southwest Sydney residents to get their jab, as the virus continues to rage through the area.
Mr Clare said lengthy queues were regular for the clinic, and more medical staff were needed to assist with the new demand.
“Long queues here at Bankstown Sports Club “pop up” Vax Hub,” Mr Clare wrote on Twitter.
“People are keen to get the vaccine – but we need more medical staff here.
“The other day we had to turn 120 people away because there isn’t enough medical staff to jab everyone.”
Southwest Sydney currently has the second lowest vaccination rate in the state, with only 17 per cent of all residents fully protected against Covid-19.

Robert Gottliebsen 9.04am: Bosses dilemma: To mandate jabs or not
Employers in Australia face a terrible dilemma over whether to make Covid-19 vaccinations compulsory for all employees on a work site including offices.
On one hand, those heading in that direction, such as SPC and airlines, are being threatened with union work bans, unfair dismissal claims and a raft of other actions.
But on the other, as I will explain below, the occupational heath and safety rules in each case demand that employers create a safe workplace.
Directors, Cabinet ministers and top management of both private and government activities who do not provide a safe workplace face long jail sentences in most states and territories and in Victoria they could be given a 25-year sentence if there is a death.
There is an answer to the problem.

Rachel Baxendale 8.55am: Lockdown hopes fade as Victoria records 20 cases
Victoria has recorded 20 new community-acquired cases of coronavirus in the 24 hours to midnight on Tuesday.
Of the 20, only 15 have been linked to current outbreaks, with the remaining five under investigation.
While 14 were in quarantine throughout their infectious period, six were not.
No source of acquisition has yet been confirmed for either of the Victorian community outbreaks which emerged last week.
The first cases to appear from each outbreak last week were a teacher in her 20s from Hobsons Bay who works at Al-Taqwa College, and a Maribyrnong man who works at a warehouse in Derrimut - all in Melbourne’s west.
Authorities continue to investigate whether the warehouse worker’s cluster may have been sparked by illegal contact with a family who were in home isolation having recently returned from hotel quarantine in NSW.
Wednesday’s 20 cases follow 20 on Tuesday, 11 on each of Monday and Sunday, Sunday, an outbreak peak of 29 on Saturday, and six each on Friday and Thursday, following short-lived celebrations of zero last Wednesday.
New daily cases in Victoria, from July 10, 2021
There have now been 323 community acquired cases since two incursions from NSW sparked Victoria’s fifth lockdown last month, of which 100 cases are linked to the most recent outbreaks, which sparked a sixth lockdown on Thursday.
There are currently 118 active cases, including up to three active cases acquired overseas.
As of Tuesday, there were two people in Victorian hospitals with coronavirus, none of whom were in intensive care.
The latest cases come after 41,571 tests were processed on Tuesday, compared with 34,892 on Monday, 38,987 on Sunday, 38,179 on Saturday, 43,618 on Friday 29,631 on Thursday, 27,279 on Wednesday, and 30,117 last Tuesday.
Victoria’s testing record is 59,355 tests on July 20.
Max Maddison 8.39am: PM’s claim lockdowns over by Christmas ‘heroic’
Deputy opposition leader Richard Marles has cast doubt on Scott Morrison’s assertions that the country will be over the worst of the Covid outbreak by Christmas, labelling his claims “heroic”.
With vaccination rates increasing across the country, the Prime Minister has flagged that the vaccination thresholds outlined in modelling by the Doherty Institute could be hit by the end of the year, enabling life to return to normal.
But Mr Marles questioned the likelihood of those claims, saying the Morrison government had already “failed us at every step”, and question
Every Australian right now is understanding that our vaccination rise is the worst in the developed world. That we have about 18 per cent of our country fully vaccinated. That is a function of this government’s complacency,” Mr Marles told ABC’s Radio National on Wednesday morning.
“This government got it wrong, in relation to dedicated quarantine facilities. This government got it wrong in relation to the way in which it set up its logistics for actually vaccinating people. Being far too slow to embrace mass vaccination centers.”

Ellie Dudley 8.32am: ‘Loophole that allowed man to get to Byron must close’
NSW Police Minister David Elliott has dodged a question over tightening the health orders that currently permit residents to travel to inspect real estate, after a Sydney man allegedly scouting property in Byron Bay spread Covid-19 north.
NSW Police are investigating the incident, but Mr Elliott said he was “sick to death of people flouting the rules” directly referencing anti-lockdown protesters who stormed Sydney CBD last month.
“I am not convinced...that some of the dramas that we have with these numbers aren’t a result of that protest three weeks ago,” he told Channel 9’s Today.
“It’s too much of a coincidence that we had 3500 (people) that (said) they wanted to increase Covid cases to 1000 a day and we are still seeing the numbers (increase).”
Mr Elliott said it was a “matter for the health minister” if directives governing property inspections or movement between multiple residences should be changed.
“If that is a loophole in the public health order, the Health Minister has to take advice and make a legal decision as to whether or not that loophole is closed,” he said.
Mr Elliot said the rules were simple: Comply, or “get pinged”.

Max Maddison 8.03am: I can’t muzzle Christensen, says Joyce
Deputy Prime Minister Barnaby Joyce has condemned comments made by his Nationals colleague George Christensen in parliament, but says there’s not much he can do about his controversial anti-Covid comments.
Mr Christensen drew serious criticism from across the political spectrum after he used a speech in the House of Representatives on Tuesday to espouse Covid conspiracy theories, claiming that masks and lockdowns don’t work, and labelling health workers “dictatorial medical bureaucrats.
The Morrison government is facing its worst electoral position since the Black Summer bushfires in the latest opinion poll. An exclusive Newspoll - published in the Australian - shows support for Prime Minister Scott Morrison's handling of the pandemic has dropped to 48 per cent. The Coalition and Labor remain steady in the primary vote at 39 per cent. Labor remains in the lead over the Coalition at 53 to 47 per cent in two-party preferred stakes. Scott Morrison remains the preferred prime minister despite falling by two points. Anthony Albanese's approval rating has increased by three points to 36 per cent.
The Nationals leader said he condemned the comments, and added he had spoken to Mr Christensen “last night”, but asserted he had little resource to stop Mr Christensen, outside of “muzzling him”.
“I’ve had conversations but that doesn’t mean he’s the slave of anybody,” Mr Joyce told ABC’s Radio National on Wednesday morning. “I’m open to ideas of how we stop him from saying things he wants to say”
“I respect his right to his opinion, it is not my opinion, and the sort of belief that you can therefore tell another person what to say from that point forward, is obviously patently absurd.”

Ellie Dudley 7.30am: Joyce to counsel Christensen over Covid remarks
Agriculture Minister David Littleproud has condemned anti-mask comments from Nationals MP George Christensen , and has left question marks over his place in parliament as it stands.
In a speech to parliament on Tuesday, Mr Christensen controversially condemned mask wearing and lockdowns, arguing they did not work.
Mr Christensen announced in April he would not contest the next election, in a shock decision he attributed to the “broken” state of Australian politics, but Mr Littleproud said his comments left his position in parliament on shaky ground.
“It’s not right the information he’s putting across and, therefore, George needs to make a decision about the role he plays... not only in the National Party but in government” Mr Littleproud told ABC News Breakfast.
.
“It’s important that there isn’t confusion around messages. We cannot make the medical and scientific decisions as governments without the medical advice of those experts.”
Mr Christensen would be “counselled” by Nationals Leader Barnaby Joyce , Mr Littleproud said.
Labor leader Anthony Albanese moved a motion condemning Mr Christensen’s comments, arguing they were aimed at spreading misinformation and undermining Australia’s Covid-19 response.
The motion was widely supported by other Nationals MPs.

Ellie Dudley 7.25am: Lockdown looms for Dubbo after new case
Another NSW regional centre could be put under lockdown, after a positive Covid-19 case was detected at a school in Dubbo in the central west.
A member of the school community at Dubbo West Public School has tested positive for the virus, health and education officials told the ABC.
While it is not yet understood how the transmission occurred, nine close contacts have already been identified and are in isolation.
The school has been closed for the day and staff and students have been told to self isolate until further advice is received.
Fragments of the virus have also been detected in local sewerage samples.
The NSW government is now considering plunging the Dubbo and Wellington local government areas into a snap lockdown, according to reports from the ABC.
It comes after several regions in the state’s north, including Tamworth and Armidale, were forced into lockdown in the past week.

Ellie Dudley 7.20am: Brisbane opens first mass vaccination hub
Brisbane’s first mass vaccination hub will open today, and will administer over 1000 doses per day.
The new centre has been established at Brisbane Convention and Exhibition Centre and will be open seven days a week from 8.30am to 4.30pm.
Premier Annastacia Palaszczuk said initially, 1000-1500 doses per day would be administered on site.
By Saturday, Queensland Health predict 3000 doses per day will be administered at BCEC.
“Vaccinations are vital to ending this pandemic. I encourage all Queenslanders to register for a vaccination,” Ms Palaszczuk said earlier this week.
Queensland is responsible for delivering around 30 per cent of the state’s vaccinations and the Federal Government is responsible for delivering 70 per cent.

Ellie Dudley 7.00am: Canavan defends Christensen over lockdown claims
Queensland Senator Matt Canavan has voiced his support for controversial MP George Christensen who claims that masks and lockdowns do not work against Covid-19.
In a brief speech to parliament just before question time on Tuesday, Mr Christensen called for an end to measures such as masks and lockdowns, arguing they were totally ineffective.
Senator Canavan said, while he did not agree with Mr Christensen’s stance on masks, he would “defend” his right to speak his mind
“I first of all want to say I defend every right of any Australian including members of Parliament to express their views, I don’t think they should be silenced on these issues,” he told Channel 9’s Today.
“Secondly I don’t agree with George on masks but I do agree with him on lockdowns.”
“It’s not that I don’t think (lockdowns) reduce the spread of the virus, but lockdowns come with a whole lot of other costs which are going uncited at the moment. Like mental health impacts, locking up kids in potentially abusive households. The lack of flexibility and compassion to people who might want to see a dying relative in their last moments.”
Senator Canavan said the strict public health measures that have been enforced have forced Australians to “lose their humanity”.

Ellie Dudley 6.50am: Mall alert puts Vic freedom at further risk
Melbourne residents’ hopes they’ll be released from lockdown on Friday has been dealt a further blow after a busy suburban shopping mall in the city’s outer west was identified as a high-risk venue for potential exposure of Covid-19 and all staff who worked over a four day period were asked to isolate.
Victoria Premier Daniel Andrews is today expected to extend the seven day lockdown after 15 of the 20 cases recorded on Tuesday were found to be infectious in the community.
The Caroline Springs Shopping Centre had already made the list last week, after an infected case visited numerous stores, forcing many other shoppers into “casual contact” status.
Now, anyone who worked at any store in the centre between August 2 and August 5 has been asked to get tested immediately and isolate for 14 days.
A total of 48 new exposure sites were added to the health department’s list on Tuesday, as the state recorded 20 new cases of Covid-19.
Only five of the cases were isolated during their infectious period.

Ellie Dudley 6.30am: Fears as positive cases visit popular Newcastle nightspots
A number of popular Newcastle social venues have appeared on NSW Health’s ever growing list of venues of potential exposure, raising concerns a superspreading event may occur.
Residents of the area are bracing themselves for a wave of new cases, after thirteen were detected in the Upper Hunter area on Tuesday and the virus continues to surge through the region.
The new venues listed by NSW Health are “the epicentre of young adult social life in Newcastle CBD”, Peter Jolly, a Triple M broadcaster in the region told news.com.au.
Anyone who visited the following venues at the times listed has been classified as a close contact and must be tested and isolate for 14 days.
Newcastle: Queen’s Wharf Hotel, 150 Wharf Street, Sunday August 1 8.15pm to 9.20pm
Charlestown: Central Leagues Club, 8 Bula Street, Monday August 2 12pm to 5pm, Tuesday August 3 5.30pm to 9.20pm, Wednesday August 4 4.40pm to 8.45pm
Newcastle: Honeysuckle Social, 11 Honeysuckle Drive, Thursday August 5 12.10pm to 1.50pm
Another high-risk location was identified in southwest Sydney. Those who were at the venue at the time stipulated should be tested and isolate for 14 days.
Bardwell Valley: Silver Jubilee Park Children’s Playground, Alsace Avenue, Saturday August 7 3.15pm to 5pm
Up to 577 new venues have been added to the health department’s list of places of potential transmission, largely from parts of southwest and west Sydney.

Anne Barrowclough 5.55am: Sydney traveller probed amid exemption claim doubts
The Sydney man who took the virus to Byron Bay is being investigated by police amid doubts over his claims he had an exemption to travel.
Police were originally told the 52-year-old from the city’s eastern suburbs had an exemption to look at properties in the region, the Daily Telegraph reports. However police are set to ramp up their probe of the man’s movements once NSW Health are fully appraised of them.
The man, whose movements sparked a week long lockdown for Byron Bay, Richmond Valley, Lismore and Ballina, is being treated for the virus in Lismore Base Hospital, while his two teenage children have also tested positive.
Byron Mayor Michael Lyon told the Telegraph he hoped the man would be charged over his movements.
“As I understand, this bloke may be charged,” he said. Certainly, it’s justified in this case. People are frustrated, outraged, it’s causing economic hardship, we’ve had some big impacts because of lockdown and other areas because of tourism. This is a hella blow.”

Yoni Bashan 5am: Hospitality industry pushes for mandatory vaccines
The hospitality industry is calling for mandatory Covid-19 vaccinations as a pathway out of lockdown, as cases climbed to record levels in NSW on Tuesday and as officials continued to weigh vaccination targets as a method of gradually easing restrictions.
A poll conducted by Restaurant and Catering Australia and provided to The Australian shows a majority of businesses want the ability to compel staff to be vaccinated before coming to work, with 63 per cent of restaurant, bar and hotel owners backing the move.
Some 62 per cent of these venues said the federal government should mandate Covid-19 vaccinations for the general public, when asked how to summarise their position.
NSW Premier Gladys Berejiklian says there is “no evidence” tougher lockdown restrictions on Greater Sydney will help curb the state’s ongoing outbreak.
The polling was released to The Australian as the state recorded 356 new cases of the virus, including three deaths, and as conservative NSW Liberal MPs debated the contentious issue of mandatory jabs in a partyroom meeting.
Tuesday’s case numbers marked a new record since the NSW outbreak began on June 16, with 97 people identified as being infectious in the community and another 157 cases still under investigation for their isolation status.
Conservative Liberals have been seeking to introduce legislation banning the NSW government and businesses from com­pelling people to have the vaccine, arguing that doing so would be an assault on their individual rights and liberties.
NSW Premier Gladys Berejiklian says the state government has always said its strategy is to get “as close to zero as we can” when it comes to cases infectious within the community.

Michael McKenna 4.45am: Palaszczuk targets marginal seat with Covid polling
Annastacia Palaszczuk ’s office conducted taxpayer-funded polling into the government’s Covid-19 strategy across a regional, Labor-held marginal seat targeted by the opposition ahead of last year’s state election.
Intensive “qualitative” interviews were commissioned with hundreds of residents of the Livingstone Shire – almost exclusively in Labor’s seat of Keppel – just days after a newspaper poll showed it was in danger of falling to the Liberal National Party.
The shire, which also includes a small stretch of the One Nation-held seat of Mirani, was the only region set aside for special attention in a series of monthly “waves” of statewide polling ordered by Ms Palaszczuk’s department into Covid-19 restrictions and her government’s handling of the outbreak.
On Tuesday, Ms Palaszczuk again refused to release any of the ongoing research – which has so far cost taxpayers’ $528,000 – as ALP insiders said it was used to help shape the government’s re-election strategy.

Patrick Commins 4.30am: Delta variant dashing consumer, business hopes
Business and consumer confidence has collapsed under the weight of Delta lockdowns, as sentiment turned negative for the first time since 2020.
NAB’s monthly business survey showed operating conditions and confidence “deteriorated sharply” in July.
The bank’s corporate sentiment index plunged by 19 points to -8 points and was “now well below average”, NAB said, where a reading below zero signals more pessimists than optimists.
Operating conditions for Australian firms deteriorated across the mainland, according to the survey, falling 14 points to 11 points – still above the historical average of six points. There was a particularly savage drop of 31 points to two points in NSW, while South Australia also experienced a large fall.
Treasurer Josh Frydenberg says the Australian economy will bounce back as it has done before.
NAB chief economist Alan Oster said “the survey shows that the strength in the business sector seen in early to mid-2021 has faded on the back of fresh disruptions in the economy, but it has not yet deteriorated to the lows seen in early 2020”.

Joseph Lam 4.35pm: A breakdown of NSW Covid-19 cases
NSW has recorded 5091 Covid-19 cases over the past four weeks to 8pm Tuesday, August 10.
Of those cases, more than 40 per cent were recorded in the south west Sydney health district, over a quarter were recorded in western Sydney health district and 15 per cent were recorded in Sydney (central) health district.
Covid-19 cases in NSW
The Southwest Sydney LGA of Canterbury Bankstown was home to the majority of cases, recording 23 per cent – or 1176 cases.
The second highest number of cases was recorded in Fairfield, with 800, followed by Cumberland (718 cases), Liverpool (462 cases), Blacktown (439 cases), Campbelltown (227 cases), Penrith (223 cases), Parramatta (199 cases), Georges River (131 cases), Bayside (122 cases) and the Inner West (79 cases).
While Canterbury Bankstown recorded the highest number of cases, the LGA has also performed 70,000 more tests than any other LGA, undertaking 297,457 tests over the past four weeks.
Fairfield has performed the second highest number of tests at 227,423 followed by Blacktown with 174,418, Cumberland with 154,348, Liverpool with 152,336. All other LGAs performed less than 100,000 tests over the same period.
Joseph Lam 4.20pm: Covid case forces Bathurst jail into lockdown
Bathurst correctional centre has been thrusted into a precautionary lockdown after a young inmate tested positive for Covid-19.
Infectious disease specialist and former Deputy Chief Health Officer, Dr. Nick Coatsworth, responds to MP George Christensen's controversial COVID claims in Parliament.
Several staff and inmates are now in isolation after the inmate, a 27-year-old who arrived on Saturday and has been granted bail on Monday, tested positive.
“Bathurst Correctional Centre has today been placed into a precautionary lockdown after receiving a positive COVID-19 test result from a fresh custody inmate,” a Corrective Services NSW spokeswoman said.
“The CSNSW COVID command post is working with staff to identify anyone who has had contact with the inmate.”
Rachel Baxendale 4.10pm: Police probe home invasion attempt
Victorian Police are investigating after a man allegedly impersonated a health department authorised officer conducting a home quarantine check in an attempted home invasion.
A woman has told Nine News she was approached at her home by a main claiming to be an authorised officer, who then asked her to perform sexual acts to get out of quarantine.
Nine News has reported that the man had information which police believe was legitimate on an iPad he was carrying.
Prime Minister Scott Morrison’s comment that the COVID-19 vaccine rollout is ‘not a race’ was a “big mistake”, according to Sky News Political Editor Andrew Clennell.“We know that, a lot of Australians in lockdown are latching onto that,” Mr Clennell said. Opposition Leader Anthony Albanese has further criticised Mr Morrison’s recent comments that “it doesn’t matter how you start the race, it’s how you finish the race”.
The Australian has sought comment from police.
Victorian Covid logistics chief Jeroen Weimar said he was aware of a police investigation “into someone impersonating an authorised officer and seeking to enter into the home.”
“That must be an incredibly distressing and frightening experience for the individual concerned, and I extend my sympathies to her,” Mr Weimar said.
“Let me be very clear. Authorised officers, when they make home visits, there are three things we should all be aware of: they will always be in uniform, they will always have appropriate identification, and they will never under any circumstances seek entry into your home.
“So please, if you are being visited as part of our home visit program, by one of our authorised offers, ask for their ID, check their uniform and if they ask to get into your home, shut the door.”
Asked whether he believed the content on the alleged home invader’s iPad was legitimate health department information, Mr Weimar said the matter was the subject of a police investigation.
“We’re working very closely with the investigation team. I can’t comment on that active investigation at the moment,” he said.
Remy Varga 4pm: Man assessed after heckling Dan Andrews
A man has been hospitalised after repeatedly screaming at Victorian Premier Daniel Andrews during a press conference on Wednesday.
A Victoria Police spokeswoman confirmed a 51-year-old Brunswick man had been taken to hospital for assessment after being apprehended by protective service officers at 12.40pm.
“Protective Service Officers apprehended a man behaving erratically at a press conference at Treasury Place, Melbourne about 12.40pm today. (11 August),” she said. “A 51-year-old Brunswick man was taken to hospital for an assessment.”

Multibillionaire retailer Gerry Harvey might be close to 82 years of age and built a retail ­empire worth $3.3bn worth of Harvey Norman stores, constructed houses, and developed land subdivisions, but he has never before ventured into apartment towers – particularly 400km from Sydney in the heart of the Central West.

Jack the Insider 3.07pm: Bending NSW’s ring of aluminium
Welcome to Premier Gladys Berejiklian’s ring of aluminium, a lockdown that permits people to leave the greater Sydney area and wander around in other people’s homes in regional New South Wales.
By the way, the current lockdown laws in greater Sydney also permit real estate agents to conduct inspections of rental properties. If you rent, there is at least a prospect that landlords and agents will insist on conducting in person inspections on the premises. They are legally entitled to do so up to four times a year. Are these agents obliged to be vaccinated? Are there any requirements on them to enter the premises wearing a mask? Social distancing? Even splashing on a bit of hand sanitiser? Nope.
In a sense it was only a matter of time before regional New South Wales was at risk.
That’s not to cheer on the ring of steel almost fetishistically demanded by Victorian Premier Dan Andrews. The talk of heavy metal lockdowns cannot work in Sydney without causing great hardship across the country. Sydney is not Melbourne and the idea of police roadblocks and routine inspections of vehicles along major arterial roads out of Sydney would cause immense supply chain delays of basic foodstuffs across the country. Sure, Australia would be right for toilet paper, much of which is manufactured and distributed in Victoria but just about any other basic foodstuff and household item you can think of comes either from or through Sydney.
Now Covid-19 has come to Byron Bay. Take three drops of Wolf’s bane and five of essence of Monk’s hood administered under the tongue at the rise of the next new moon.

Max Maddison 2.51pm: Look closer to home for crazy conspiracies, ALP told
Scott Morrison has moved again to distance his government from the “crazy rubbish conspiracies” of Nationals MP George Christensen , but Health Minister Greg Hunt says Labor should look closer to home.
After being asked by opposition whip Chris Hayes what the federal government was doing to combat the “dangerous spread” of misinformation by QAnon during the pandemic, Mr Morrison said his government would have “no association” with Mr Christensen’s comments.
“Mr Speaker, crazy rubbish conspiracies have no place when it comes to the public health of this country and this government will have no association with it as we demonstrated yesterday in this House,” Mr Morrison told question time on Wednesday afternoon.
After being handballed the question, Mr Hunt pointed to comments made by Labor’s candidate for Higgins, Michelle Ananda-Rajah , an outspoken AstraZeneca critic.
“Professor Skerritt said if AstraZeneca (hadn’t been used for vaccination) in NSW, there would have been deaths in their dozens every day, unfortunately, there are those that have spread material and information that does not accord with the high standards,” Mr Hunt said.
“Quote, the issue is the rest of the country is going to be offered a lower efficacious vaccine, the AstraZeneca. Quote, we are about to unleash 51 million doses of AstraZeneca, it is the Labour Party’s candidate for Higgins.”

Max Maddison 2.33pm: Labor ‘undermining national Covid plan’
Scott Morrison has accused Labor of “undermining” the national Covid plan, after the opposition said he had failed to keep promises he made to Australians stuck overseas.
Opposition health spokesman Mark Butler asked the Prime Minister why he had failed to deliver on his announcement that the 40,000 Australians stuck overseas “would be home by Christmas” .
Mr Morrison used the question to attack Labor, saying he had merely said he “wanted” all Australians to be around the table by Christmas.
“I don’t know why that would be a point at which the government would be attacked by the opposition. I simply don’t understand it,” Mr Morrison told questiontTime on Wednesday afternoon.
“The Delta strain has changed everything. That is the position understood and agreed by premiers, chief ministers and myself. Together we are implementing the national plan, the Labor Party is undermining the national plan.”

Ellie Dudley 1.50pm: Full list of areas affected by Dubbo lockdown
Eight suburbs in the Dubbo LGA will exist under strict stay at home orders for at least the next seven days, after Covid-19 was detected in the community.
The outer west region of NSWwas plunged into a week-long lockdown after two cases were detected in the community.
The areas of Dubbo, Wellington, Wongarbon, Geurie, Brocklehurst, Stuart Town, Mumbil and Eumungerie are those that are affected by the new public health orders.
Similar conditions apply to the regional areas of Tamworth and Armidale, in north west NSW, although no new cases were recorded in the area on Wednesday.
The Upper Hunter region will likely have their lockdown extended beyond August 12, after 14 new cases of Covid-19 were reported in the community on Wednesday.

Of 118 active coronavirus cases in Victoria on Wednesday, 100 have emerged since last Wednesday and have predominantly been linked to western suburbs outbreaks centred on a Hobsons Bay teacher who works at Al-Taqwa College in Truganina, and a Maribyrnong man who works in a Derrimut warehouse.
Three active cases are in overseas arrivals in hotel quarantine, while the remaining 15 are linked to the outbreaks which sparked Victoria’s fifth lockdown last month.
There is now just one person in a Victorian hospital with coronavirus, who is not in intensive care.
About 13,800 primary close contacts have been linked to the current cases, up 1700 since Tuesday and linked to almost 299 exposure sites, predominantly in Melbourne’s west but also in the bayside, outer eastern and northern suburbs.
Approximately 1000 primary close contacts linked to older sites were released from quarantine on Tuesday having submitted negative Day 13 tests.
The latest exposure sites include Tabcorp Park in Melton in Melbourne’s outer northwest, the Royal Flagstaff apartment complex in West Melbourne, the Vision apartment complex in Elizabeth Street in Melbourne’s CBD, and Brimbank shopping centre in Deer Park.
A full list is available on the health department website.
Of Victoria’s 20 new community-acquired cases on Wednesday:
- One is a student at Al-Taqwa College and a further five are household members of students at the school. All six were isolating while infectious;
- Five are household contacts from students at Mount Alexander College. All five were isolating while infectious;
- Four are linked to the Caroline Springs shopping centre, bringing the total number linked to the centre to 25. The latest four cases include two linked to the Jolly Miller cafe, one to the YPA real estate, and one to the Edwards Sourdough bakery. Of the four, two were isolating while infectious;
- Five cases are not currently linked to any known outbreaks, although Covid logistics chief Jeroen Weimar said authorities were “confident” they could establish links in coming days. Of these five, three are a family from the City of Melton in Melbourne’s outer northwest, including two parents and a child. The child was already in isolation as a contact of another primary close contact, although that contact is yet to test positive for the virus. The remaining two cases are a father and son who live in the City of Melbourne. The son is a Grade One student at St Michael’s Primary School in North Melbourne. While is not believed to have been infectious while at school prior to last week’s lockdown, his class has been deemed a Tier 1 exposure site and the school Tier 2. The father is a health care worker who last worked at the Melbourne Children’s Eye Clinic at the Royal Children’s Hospital last Monday. Patients and staff are being contacted and a small section of the wider hospital has been deemed a Tier 2 site, with attendees required to get tested and isolate until they receive a negative result.
Mr Weimar said the Caroline Springs Shopping Centre and Melton were areas of key concern for authorities.
“We now have 13 active cases in the City of Melton area, six of those are new cases today,” he said.
“We are doing a lot of work around Melton high street, a number of retail sites (with) 13 exposure sites already listed.
“I expect to see more during the course of the day. My callout to anyone who is using Melton as part of their retailing activity, please come forward and get tested.
“Five of the cases today are cases we were not aware of before they came through yesterday. We became aware because people did the right thing: They got symptoms, they got tested.”
Mr Weimar said authorities remained concerned about sustained waste water detections in Broadmeadows, Glenroy and Jacana in Melbourne’s northwest.

Staff writers 12.51pm: Rose Bay man, 52, to be charged over Byron Bay visit
A man will be served a Future Court Attendance Notice today for breaching public health orders after he visited the Byron Bay and surrounding areas.
Victorian Premier Daniel Andrews says permits will be required from 1pm on Thursday for residents who want to move within the border bubble with New South Wales. ‘It is important that we not only limited movement but that we have the clearest picture of who is moving within that border bubble,” he said. The permits will be available from Thursday but will not be enforced until 6pm on Friday. “If this virus can get from Sydney to Byron Bay to Dubbo to Armidale to Tamworth, then only a fool would think that it couldn't get to Albury," he said. “It absolutely can and that’s why we need to go beyond just a bubble. “We need to have permits so that people can apply once, have their permit, and then we have a clear sense of who is moving in those border towns.”
Following inquiries, including appeals for public assistance, the 52-year-old man from Rose Bay will be charged after he allegedly travelled from Sydney to Byron Bay and the surrounding area, without a reasonable excuse and in contravention of the public health orders.
The Future Court Attendance Notice will be served on the man at the Lismore Base Hospital with strict bail conditions.
He will appear at Lismore Local Court on Monday 13 September 2021.
Inquiries are ongoing.

Rachel Baxendale 12.06pm: Andrews update interrupted by yelling interlopers
Two men have been tackled to the ground by protective services offices after disrupting the Andrews government’s Covid press conference on Wednesday.
One man yelled “Premier Daniel Andrews ” repeatedly, while another made reference to Health Minister Martin Foley .
One of the men continued to yell loudly and nonsensically for minutes after being detained, with Mr Andrews, Covid logistics chief Jeroen Weimar and chief health officer Brett Sutton at times barely audible above the loud but wordless noise.
The men were on an outdoor level above the press conference, which is being held at the back of the Premier’s office at 1 Treasury Place.
At one stage Mr Andrews acknowledged one of the interlopers, saying: “No one else can hear me because of the amazing contribution you’re making up there... We’ll keep you safe too.”
Journalists at the press conference say the man had waited at Treasury Place ahead of the 11am media briefing, filming police and asking for written notes to be passed on to the Premier.
The man is now accusing police of having injured his leg in detaining him, while police have indicated they believe he is feigning the injury.
Mr Andrews said he did not know “what was going on” with the man.
“No. We do not know if it is even about Covid,” Mr Andrews told the press conference.
“It’s somebody who I think has wanted to speak to me for some time, but I don’t know who it is.
“The point I made before is that if you support me or not, I will do everything I can to protect you from this virus.
“Shouting does not work against this virus. Interrupting anyone does not work against this virus.
“Like I said the other day - if frustration and anger was effective against coronavirus, we would all be double dosed by now. It does not work. “People are entitled to their views. That is fine. But whether you support me and my team or not, we will do everything we can, every hour of the day, to keep you safe.”

Rachel Baxendale 12.02pm: Andrews flags more AZ in Victoria’s clinics
Daniel Andrews has foreshadowed the expansion of AstraZeneca vaccinations at state-run clinics in Victoria.
The Premier’s comments follow news that Victorian GPs are administering fewer than half the number of AstraZeneca vaccinations as their NSW counterparts, and after the Andrews government made AstraZeneca available to under-40s at six metropolitan and three regional vaccination hubs from Monday.
On Tuesday, 23,811 people were vaccinated at Victoria’s state-run hubs.
Victorian Premier Danial Andrews says the state’s lockdown will be extended for a further seven days as several “mystery cases” have appeared. Mr Andrews said Victoria recorded 20 locally acquired cases of COVID-19 overnight with six out in the community while infectious and 15 linked to current outbreaks. “There are a number of mystery cases and cases still being investigated, that really is the most important number,” he said. “That’s why sadly today the Cabinet of the government, we have met, and we have determined to accept the advice of the chief health officer to extend it for a further period of seven days to 11:59 pm next Thursday.” Mr Andrews said reopening was “simply not possible” due to the Delta variant and if the state was to end lockdown, case numbers could end up like Sydney. “I’d love to be standing here announcing that we are coming out of lockdown this coming Thursday, that is simply not possible, we need to go until next Thursday, that is the public health advice.” “There are too many cases and too cases the origins which are not clear to us, too many unanswered questions, too many mysteries for us to safely come out of lockdown now.”
“We’ve seen really strong uptake in those additional AstraZeneca appointments that we brought online and the eligibility expansion from 18-39,” Mr Andrews said.
“I can, not today, but quite soon speak to further expansions of the AstraZeneca program, further expansions to the hub model so we can get even more people vaccinated over the next month or so.”
Mr Andrews urged those eligible for any vaccine, including AstraZeneca to get vaccinated as soon as possible.
“As the chief health officer said yesterday, the best vaccine is the one you can access today,” he said.
“That makes a huge contribution to us getting to the other side of the lockdowns, getting to the other side with a very different set of rules.
Mr Andrews said approximately 7000 AstraZeneca and 30,000 Pfizer bookings had been made in the past 24 hours.

Ellie Dudley 11.56am: Shoebridge questions politically loaded: Hazzard
NSW health minister Brad Hazzard has defended his actions in a parliamentary inquiry into the government’s handling of the Covid-19 pandemic, after he was criticised for cutting off chief health officer Kerry Chant in her questioning.
NSW Health Minister Brad Hazzard has rejected assertions the state government acted too late in curbing Greater Sydney’s COVID-19 outbreak, telling a parliamentary inquiry acted “very expeditiously” to enforce citywide lockdowns. Greater Sydney is currently into its seventh week of stay-at-home restrictions with no end in sight after the state recorded its highest daily total of 356 new cases in the past 24 hours. Pressed by Greens MP David Shoebridge on the 10-day delay in locking down, Mr Hazzard replied: “What you’re missing is the seven LGAs in the eastern suburbs were a bit like the Northern Beaches, they responded very well and very quickly”. “When those cases went out to West Hoxton, that was not seen initially, and that came out of the Joh Bailey hair salon. “That was on June 23 and at June 26 was when we went not the lockdown so everything was done very expeditiously so it’s not quite the way you’re seeing it, you’re seeing it from the 16th.” Chief Health Officer Dr Kerry Chant admitted chains of transmission had gone undetected following the spread of the Delta variant outside of Sydney’s east. Dr Chant said the initial Bondi outbreak was “actually brought under control” until things spiralled after it was introduced into southwestern Sydney. “Obviously, with looking back, there was a chain of transmission that was not detected, and that was also playing into the mind that we needed to lockdown,” she said. “So all I can say is that we were looking closely at the information available, working with our public health networks, and provided advice to government on a range of strategies. “The outbreak was actually brought under control in southeastern Sydney, it was really around when it got introduced into southwestern Sydney that we saw the escalating case numbers and I think, to be fair, it needed a different response in southwestern Sydney.”
Mr Hazzard fired up at Greens legislative council member David Shoebridge as he questioned Dr Chant on the timing of the advice she provided to the government.
Mr Hazzard angrily interrupted Mr Shoebridge, saying: “David, David, we are in the middle of a pandemic and you’re just asking questions that are just aimed at having a go.”
Asked on Wednesday about his response to Mr Shoebridge’s questioning, Mr Hazzard said he took issue with questions that were asked “in a political way”.
“The questions were loaded politically, with not necessarily the logical outcome,” he said.
“They were drawing their own conclusions.”
“Some of the questions were very good but some were a little challenging on that front.
“I guess I would say Dr Chant works very hard, extremely hard and so does the whole public health team, and I think challenging...her integrity in terms of her decision making was not appropriate.”

Ellie Dudley 11.54am: Cloud hangs over return to school timeline
Premier Gladys Berejiklian has been unable to outline a timeline for schools to return, saying the highly-infectious Delta strain is a major risk to students.
Year 12 students in low risk areas of Sydney will return to school on Monday, while those in southwest and western Sydney will not be permitted to go back.
Premier Gladys Berejiklian says New South Wales has recorded 344 new local COVID cases and two deaths related to the Delta outbreak. An unvaccinated man in his 90s died in hospital and an unvaccinated man in his 30s with underlying health conditions also passed away. “We do want to stress that the man in his 30s did have other conditions as well,” Ms Berejiklian said during a media conference on Wednesday. “But notwithstanding that, he obviously succumbed to COVID.” Ms Berejiklian also flagged case numbers were beginning to decline in the Fairfield and the Canterbury-Bankstown local government areas. “However, the adjoining local government areas, or the suburbs adjoining those areas of Bayside, Burwood, and the Inner West are starting to have an increase in cases,” she said. “They’re not at high levels yet, but we don’t want them to get higher. “Please note if you live in those suburbs around the Bayside, Burwood and Inner West councils, please be on extra alert, come forward for testing. “We don't want to have to include you in those local governments of concern, but we may have to do if case numbers don't at least stabilise or start going down.”
For other students, the timeline of when they will return to school is unknown.
“When schools will return will depend on the next few weeks,” Ms Berejiklain said.
“How much we can control the case numbers until the end of August (will indicate) what life looks like in September and October.
“The reason why we will have some level of confidence in talking about that at the right time - it’s a bit premature now - but in a few weeks we’ll have a better idea of what September and October looks like because we will be able to see a consistent rate of vaccination.
“We’ll have a better idea of whether we’ll hit the 6 million target and the 70 per cent target after that.”

Ellie Dudley 11.40am: Premier maintains 50pc vaccination rate target
NSW Premier Gladys Berejiklian has rejected the suggestion she was giving “false hope” to Sydneysiders by saying restrictions could be eased at a 50 per cent vaccination rate.
NSW chief health officer Kerry Chant told an inquiry into the government’s handling of the pandemic on Tuesday that it was her preference for the state to achieve 70 per cent of vaccination coverage, per the advice of modelling provided to the national cabinet last week, before restrictions are substantially eased.
But Ms Berejiklian has repeatedly said restrictions would be eased when 50 per cent of the population had been vaccinated, and doubled down on her claims on Wednesday.
“It is important to say to people that if we have higher rates of vaccination there’s every chance you can do something more than what you can today,” she said.
“If we can incentivise people to say, if you are fully vaccinated you might be able to undertake an activity which you can’t now, well that is a positive. I think most people would appreciate that.”

Ellie Dudley 11.30am: Hotspot fears over Sydney’s inner-west
NSW chief health officer Kerry Chant says health authorities fear Covid-19 could be spreading out of high risk areas and into the inner west.
Health authorities have refocused their efforts away from the Fairfield local government area in southwest Sydney as cases in the area begin to decline.
The drop in cases in the area, however, comes with news that the hotspot areas are shifting.
“What we are seeing is the growth of case numbers in other areas, and we need to redouble our efforts in those areas to achieve the same impact we have seen and the Fairfield area,” Dr Chant said.
“For instance, in the inner west and the areas around Cumberland are still very high. Bayside, Georges River - particularly the edges of those suburbs - that border onto the (high-risk) suburbs, and Strathfield as well.
“As the Premier has indicated, we are watching them closely. It is important that everybody knows there is an increase in cases in those areas, and for them to come out and get tested and assist us with control.”
Asked whether it would be more effective to apply the same strict restrictions that currently apply to southwest and west Sydney to all greater Sydney LGAs as the virus continues to spread, Dr Chant said residents seem to respond better when a targeted approach is taken.
“What we have seen is the community responding when we tell them specific areas,” she said.
“It is very hard for the community if we are talking about cases in an area where there hasn’t been any cases. Whereas, if we can explain that these are the areas where we are seeing cases then we get a greater response.”

Ellie Dudley 11.19am: NSW on course for 80pc vaccinated by mid-November
NSW is set to have 80 per cent of residents fully vaccinated by mid-November, says Premier Gladys Berejiklian .
Up to 4.5 million doses of the vaccine have been administered to NSW residents, as the state strives for 6 million doses by the end of the month.
Vaccination rates in NSW
“With 6 million jabs by the end of August, if achieved, there will be opportunities for us in parts of the communities where cases are low and vaccination rates are high for them to do more than they do today,” Ms Berejiklian said.
“That is what we are working towards and something that our government is very keen to make possible.”
The Doherty report, which governs timelines for national cabinet, outlines that restrictions can be drastically eased when the country hits an 80 per cent vaccination rate.
Ms Berejiklian said the state will reach that by mid-November.
“According to the Doherty report, that is when life gets back to normal, that is when we have a different approach to Covid, when freedoms that we had will be in place,” she said.
Rachel Baxendale 11.13am: Melbourne lockdown extended another seven days
Victorian Premier Daniel Andrews has extended Melbourne’s “seven day” lockdown by seven days.
The decision comes after just 20 of 100 coronavirus cases linked to the outbreaks which emerged a week ago were in quarantine for the duration of their infectious period, and as five “mystery” cases were discovered overnight.

Ellie Dudley 11.07am: Dubbo to go into lockdown from 1pm today
Premier Gladys Berejiklian has confirmed the region of Dubbo in central west NSW will enter a seven day lockdown from 1pm on Wednesday.
The lockdown comes as two new cases were detected in the area overnight, and two schools were closed as a result.
Two schools in regional New South Wales have been locked down after a member of the Dubbo community tested positive for COVID. Dubbo West Public School and Macquarie Anglican Grammar School have been closed for deep cleaning. The positive case was identified after the individual became symptomatic on August 9 and presented for testing on August 10. Dubbo MP Dugald Saunders said nine close contacts who have been identified to date are in isolation and either have been tested or will be tested as soon as possible. Investigations and contact tracing are continuing as it is not yet known how the transmission occurred.
“I understand community leaders have already been advised of that,” Ms Berejiklian said.
“The lockdown will occur from 1pm today.”
No new cases were detected in Armidale, Tamworth or the Northern Rivers region, but 14 new cases were detected in the Hunter New England region.
Ms Berejiklian said due to the new cases in the Hunter New England region, it “doesn’t look like it will come out of lockdown” on Thursday as previously expected.
Ellie Dudley 11.01am: NSW records 344 new cases, two deaths
NSW has recorded 344 new locally-acquired cases of Covid-19 as infections across the state continue to spread.
At least 65 of the cases were active in the community for the entirety of their infectious period, Premier Gladys Berejiklian said.
“I want to stress, over the last two days we have seen a surge in the number of cases and are expected to continue,” she said.
New daily cases in New South Wales
Two deaths were recorded overnight in NSW residents.
A 30-year-old man who had underlying heart conditions died in hospital after contracting the virus.
An 80-year old-man with Covid-19 has also died.
Around 119,000 tests were conducted in the 24 hours to 8pm last night.
The Premier said cases in the Fairfield and Canterbury-Bankstown area are starting to come down.

Ellie Dudley 10.33am: Palaszczuk ‘won’t release’ polling information
Queensland Premier Annastacia Palaszczuk has again refused to release polling information into her government’s handling of the pandemic.
The Australian revealed on Wednesday the Palaszczuk government conducted taxpayer-funded polling into their Covid-19 strategy across a regional, Labor-held marginal seat targeted by the opposition ahead of last year’s state election.
Intensive “qualitative” interviews were commissioned with hundreds of residents in the Livingstone Shire – almost exclusively in Labor’s seat of Keppel – just days after a newspaper poll showed it was in danger of falling to the Liberal National Party.
Ms Palaszczuk said the polling was “market research and sentiment testing” and “no, it won’t be released.”
“(It won’t be released) because every state and the federal government has also done the exact same market research and sentiment testing,” she told Wednesday’s press conference.
When pressed for a reason as to why she wouldn’t release the information, Ms Palaszczuk said: “Go and ask all the other state premiers and the prime minister.”

Ellie Dudley 10.11am: Cairns to be released from lockdown at 4pm
Cairns and Yarrabah will be released from lockdown at 4pm on Wednesday, after Queensland recorded four new locally acquired cases of Covid-19 all linked to the Indooroopilly cluster in Brisbane’s inner west.
The far north regions will exist under the same restrictions that currently apply to southeast Queensland until August 22.
“Of course, the Cairns residents will also have to be wearing those masks, just as they do down here in southeast Queensland, and, of course, the high school students will need to wear masks as well,” Premier Annastacia Palaszczuk said.
All cases detected in Brisbane had been in isolation for the entirety of their infectious period which was “exactly what we want to be seeing”, she added.
A total of 23,099 tests were conducted across the state on Wednesday.
Ms Palaszczuk was speaking from a new vaccination hub at Brisbane Convention and Exhibition Centre which opened today and will vaccinate 1500 per day.
New daily cases in Queensland, from July 25, 2021
Queensland chief health officer Jeannette Young has urged residents in Cairns and Yarrabah to remain vigilant for Covid-19 symptoms as they emerge from lockdown today.
The regions in far north Queensland were put under strict stay at home orders for three days after a reef pilot and a taxi driver were found to have been infected with the virus.
Dr Young said the health authorities could “definitively confirm” the reef pilot, who passed the virus onto the taxi driver, had been infected on July 23 from a New Zealand ship.
A number of additional exposure sites had been released in regards to the taxi driver he then infected, causing Dr Young to issue a stern warning to those in Cairns.
“It’s really important that you still come forward and get tested, and anyone in Cairns with any symptoms at all, as you have been doing the last few days,” she said.
Dr Young said it was “still important” to have ongoing restrictions to stop further spread of the virus.
The following restrictions will apply to the area:
Mask wearing at all times (including workplaces) except when eating or drinking, or exercising with your household or one other person.
Schools will reopen, with all staff and high school students wearing masks
10 people in your home, including people who live there
20 people at a wedding ceremony or funeral service
Businesses and venues with one person per four square metres, or 50 percent capacity with seated, ticket allocations
Community sports and activities are restricted and, in some cases, not permitted.
Avoid travelling to regional Queensland
Visitors allowed to hospitals, aged care and disability accommodation

Rachel Baxendale 10.04am: Andrews deciding on lockdown extension
With 20 new coronavirus cases in Victoria on Wednesday, five of which are under investigation for a source of acquisition, Melburnians know their “seven day” lockdown will not be ending after seven days.
The issue is how long the extension is likely to be.
A meeting is under way on Wednesday morning between the Andrews government and health officials to make that decision, with a seven day extension considered most likely.
Premier Daniel Andrews will hold a press conference later on Wednesday to announce the decision.
Mr Andrews and Health Minister Martin Foley have repeatedly indicated decisions on the duration of lockdowns will primarily be determined on the basis of the number of recent cases infectious in the community.
Of 100 cases linked to the most recent outbreaks since they emerged a week ago, only 20 have been in quarantine throughout their infectious period.

Rachel Baxendale 9.56am: Victoria adds more than 40 new exposure sites
Victoria’s number of coronavirus exposure sites has grown by more than 40 over the past 24 hours to hit 291 on Wednesday morning.
Victoria’s lockdown is set to end on Thursday, but an extension is looking likely after 20 new local cases were recorded on Tuesday. Only five of the 20 cases were in isolation during their infectious period. Premier Daniel Andrews would like the numbers to be much lower before restrictions are eased and leading epidemiologists have indicated figures need to be in the single digits before the lockdown is lifted. However, the government gave no indications yesterday as to whether the lockdown would be extended.
While a shopping centre in Caroline Springs in Melbourne’s outer west remains the site of greatest concern to authorities, having been linked to at least 25 cases across numerous stores, sites have also recently been identified in Melbourne’s bayside and north.
Sites have recently been listed in Hoppers Crossing, Williams Landing, Deer Park, Hillside, Aintree, Melton, Melton West, Caroline Springs, Cairnlea, Taylors Lakes and Maribyrnong in the west, Flemington in the inner northwest and Preston in the north, as well as in bayside Brighton and nearby Elwood.
Public transport routes including trains and buses in Melbourne’s west have also been listed.
Investigations are ongoing after a doctor who works at the Royal Children’s Hospital tested positive on Tuesday.
It is understood the doctor did not work at the hospital while infectious, but may have treated patients in private rooms nearby.
The full list of exposure sites is available on the health department website.

Ellie Dudley 9.42am: Premiers, health authorities set to deliver Covid updates
State health authorities across Australia will front the media this morning to provide updates on their respective Covid-19 outbreaks.
Queensland’s premier Annastacia Palaszczuk will hold a press conference at 10am alongside the state’s health minister Yvette D’Ath and chief health officer Jeannette Young .
Queensland recorded three new cases of Covid-19 on Monday, all linked to the cluster in Brisbane’s inner-west.
Cairns and Yarrabah in the state’s far north are on track to be released from their three-day snap lockdown on Wednesday, after they were placed under strict stay at home orders on Sunday due to a taxi driver infected with Covid-19 was infectious in the community for up to 10 days.
Queensland has opened its first mass vaccination hub, which by the end of the week will be providing 3,000 vaccinations per day. There is a long wait list, with 230,000 people across the state having registered with Queensland Health to receive the vaccine. The centre, in Brisbane, is focused on Pfizer in particular with AstraZeneca being left to pharmacies and GPs. The hub is the first in Queensland and bookings are essential.
No new cases have been discovered in association with the taxi driver, who has been linked to a positive case in a reef pilot detected in far north Queensland last week.
NSW Premier Gladys Berejiklian will provide an update at 11am, after the state recorded 356 new locally acquired cases of Covid-19 on Monday and three deaths.
No additional cases were detected in the Byron Shire on Tuesday despite an infected traveler from Sydney visiting a number of locations and sending the area into a seven day lockdown.
That could change today after exposure sites in the far north coastal town were released by NSW Health on Tuesday afternoon.
No new cases were found in Tamworth or Armidale in north west regional NSW, but reports from Wednesday morning show a positive case in a Dubbo school may plunge the region in the central west into lockdown.
Victorian authorities are expected to provide their state’s update this morning, but are yet to set a time.
The southern state recorded 20 new cases of the virus on Wednesday, 15 of which have been linked to existing infections, and five are still under investigation.
While 14 were in quarantine throughout their infectious period, six were not.
Ellie Dudley 9.31am: Staff crisis as people turned away from Sydney vax hub
Up to 120 people were turned away from a pop up vaccination hub in Bankstown in Sydney’s southwest, says opposition housing spokesman and federal member for Blaxland Jason Clare .
The Bankstown Sports Club walk-in vaccine clinic in was opened last week for southwest Sydney residents to get their jab, as the virus continues to rage through the area.
Mr Clare said lengthy queues were regular for the clinic, and more medical staff were needed to assist with the new demand.
“Long queues here at Bankstown Sports Club “pop up” Vax Hub,” Mr Clare wrote on Twitter.
“People are keen to get the vaccine – but we need more medical staff here.
“The other day we had to turn 120 people away because there isn’t enough medical staff to jab everyone.”
Southwest Sydney currently has the second lowest vaccination rate in the state, with only 17 per cent of all residents fully protected against Covid-19.

Robert Gottliebsen 9.04am: Bosses dilemma: To mandate jabs or not
Employers in Australia face a terrible dilemma over whether to make Covid-19 vaccinations compulsory for all employees on a work site including offices.
On one hand, those heading in that direction, such as SPC and airlines, are being threatened with union work bans, unfair dismissal claims and a raft of other actions.
But on the other, as I will explain below, the occupational heath and safety rules in each case demand that employers create a safe workplace.
Directors, Cabinet ministers and top management of both private and government activities who do not provide a safe workplace face long jail sentences in most states and territories and in Victoria they could be given a 25-year sentence if there is a death.
There is an answer to the problem.

Rachel Baxendale 8.55am: Lockdown hopes fade as Victoria records 20 cases
Victoria has recorded 20 new community-acquired cases of coronavirus in the 24 hours to midnight on Tuesday.
Of the 20, only 15 have been linked to current outbreaks, with the remaining five under investigation.
While 14 were in quarantine throughout their infectious period, six were not.
No source of acquisition has yet been confirmed for either of the Victorian community outbreaks which emerged last week.
The first cases to appear from each outbreak last week were a teacher in her 20s from Hobsons Bay who works at Al-Taqwa College, and a Maribyrnong man who works at a warehouse in Derrimut - all in Melbourne’s west.
Authorities continue to investigate whether the warehouse worker’s cluster may have been sparked by illegal contact with a family who were in home isolation having recently returned from hotel quarantine in NSW.
Wednesday’s 20 cases follow 20 on Tuesday, 11 on each of Monday and Sunday, Sunday, an outbreak peak of 29 on Saturday, and six each on Friday and Thursday, following short-lived celebrations of zero last Wednesday.
New daily cases in Victoria, from July 10, 2021
There have now been 323 community acquired cases since two incursions from NSW sparked Victoria’s fifth lockdown last month, of which 100 cases are linked to the most recent outbreaks, which sparked a sixth lockdown on Thursday.
There are currently 118 active cases, including up to three active cases acquired overseas.
As of Tuesday, there were two people in Victorian hospitals with coronavirus, none of whom were in intensive care.
The latest cases come after 41,571 tests were processed on Tuesday, compared with 34,892 on Monday, 38,987 on Sunday, 38,179 on Saturday, 43,618 on Friday 29,631 on Thursday, 27,279 on Wednesday, and 30,117 last Tuesday.
Victoria’s testing record is 59,355 tests on July 20.
Max Maddison 8.39am: PM’s claim lockdowns over by Christmas ‘heroic’
Deputy opposition leader Richard Marles has cast doubt on Scott Morrison’s assertions that the country will be over the worst of the Covid outbreak by Christmas, labelling his claims “heroic”.
With vaccination rates increasing across the country, the Prime Minister has flagged that the vaccination thresholds outlined in modelling by the Doherty Institute could be hit by the end of the year, enabling life to return to normal.
But Mr Marles questioned the likelihood of those claims, saying the Morrison government had already “failed us at every step”, and question
Every Australian right now is understanding that our vaccination rise is the worst in the developed world. That we have about 18 per cent of our country fully vaccinated. That is a function of this government’s complacency,” Mr Marles told ABC’s Radio National on Wednesday morning.
“This government got it wrong, in relation to dedicated quarantine facilities. This government got it wrong in relation to the way in which it set up its logistics for actually vaccinating people. Being far too slow to embrace mass vaccination centers.”

Ellie Dudley 8.32am: ‘Loophole that allowed man to get to Byron must close’
NSW Police Minister David Elliott has dodged a question over tightening the health orders that currently permit residents to travel to inspect real estate, after a Sydney man allegedly scouting property in Byron Bay spread Covid-19 north.
NSW Police are investigating the incident, but Mr Elliott said he was “sick to death of people flouting the rules” directly referencing anti-lockdown protesters who stormed Sydney CBD last month.
“I am not convinced...that some of the dramas that we have with these numbers aren’t a result of that protest three weeks ago,” he told Channel 9’s Today.
“It’s too much of a coincidence that we had 3500 (people) that (said) they wanted to increase Covid cases to 1000 a day and we are still seeing the numbers (increase).”
Mr Elliott said it was a “matter for the health minister” if directives governing property inspections or movement between multiple residences should be changed.
“If that is a loophole in the public health order, the Health Minister has to take advice and make a legal decision as to whether or not that loophole is closed,” he said.
Mr Elliot said the rules were simple: Comply, or “get pinged”.

Max Maddison 8.03am: I can’t muzzle Christensen, says Joyce
Deputy Prime Minister Barnaby Joyce has condemned comments made by his Nationals colleague George Christensen in parliament, but says there’s not much he can do about his controversial anti-Covid comments.
Mr Christensen drew serious criticism from across the political spectrum after he used a speech in the House of Representatives on Tuesday to espouse Covid conspiracy theories, claiming that masks and lockdowns don’t work, and labelling health workers “dictatorial medical bureaucrats.
The Morrison government is facing its worst electoral position since the Black Summer bushfires in the latest opinion poll. An exclusive Newspoll - published in the Australian - shows support for Prime Minister Scott Morrison's handling of the pandemic has dropped to 48 per cent. The Coalition and Labor remain steady in the primary vote at 39 per cent. Labor remains in the lead over the Coalition at 53 to 47 per cent in two-party preferred stakes. Scott Morrison remains the preferred prime minister despite falling by two points. Anthony Albanese's approval rating has increased by three points to 36 per cent.
The Nationals leader said he condemned the comments, and added he had spoken to Mr Christensen “last night”, but asserted he had little resource to stop Mr Christensen, outside of “muzzling him”.
“I’ve had conversations but that doesn’t mean he’s the slave of anybody,” Mr Joyce told ABC’s Radio National on Wednesday morning. “I’m open to ideas of how we stop him from saying things he wants to say”
“I respect his right to his opinion, it is not my opinion, and the sort of belief that you can therefore tell another person what to say from that point forward, is obviously patently absurd.”

Ellie Dudley 7.30am: Joyce to counsel Christensen over Covid remarks
Agriculture Minister David Littleproud has condemned anti-mask comments from Nationals MP George Christensen , and has left question marks over his place in parliament as it stands.
In a speech to parliament on Tuesday, Mr Christensen controversially condemned mask wearing and lockdowns, arguing they did not work.
Mr Christensen announced in April he would not contest the next election, in a shock decision he attributed to the “broken” state of Australian politics, but Mr Littleproud said his comments left his position in parliament on shaky ground.
“It’s not right the information he’s putting across and, therefore, George needs to make a decision about the role he plays... not only in the National Party but in government” Mr Littleproud told ABC News Breakfast.
.
“It’s important that there isn’t confusion around messages. We cannot make the medical and scientific decisions as governments without the medical advice of those experts.”
Mr Christensen would be “counselled” by Nationals Leader Barnaby Joyce , Mr Littleproud said.
Labor leader Anthony Albanese moved a motion condemning Mr Christensen’s comments, arguing they were aimed at spreading misinformation and undermining Australia’s Covid-19 response.
The motion was widely supported by other Nationals MPs.

Ellie Dudley 7.25am: Lockdown looms for Dubbo after new case
Another NSW regional centre could be put under lockdown, after a positive Covid-19 case was detected at a school in Dubbo in the central west.
A member of the school community at Dubbo West Public School has tested positive for the virus, health and education officials told the ABC.
While it is not yet understood how the transmission occurred, nine close contacts have already been identified and are in isolation.
The school has been closed for the day and staff and students have been told to self isolate until further advice is received.
Fragments of the virus have also been detected in local sewerage samples.
The NSW government is now considering plunging the Dubbo and Wellington local government areas into a snap lockdown, according to reports from the ABC.
It comes after several regions in the state’s north, including Tamworth and Armidale, were forced into lockdown in the past week.

Ellie Dudley 7.20am: Brisbane opens first mass vaccination hub
Brisbane’s first mass vaccination hub will open today, and will administer over 1000 doses per day.
The new centre has been established at Brisbane Convention and Exhibition Centre and will be open seven days a week from 8.30am to 4.30pm.
Premier Annastacia Palaszczuk said initially, 1000-1500 doses per day would be administered on site.
By Saturday, Queensland Health predict 3000 doses per day will be administered at BCEC.
“Vaccinations are vital to ending this pandemic. I encourage all Queenslanders to register for a vaccination,” Ms Palaszczuk said earlier this week.
Queensland is responsible for delivering around 30 per cent of the state’s vaccinations and the Federal Government is responsible for delivering 70 per cent.

Ellie Dudley 7.00am: Canavan defends Christensen over lockdown claims
Queensland Senator Matt Canavan has voiced his support for controversial MP George Christensen who claims that masks and lockdowns do not work against Covid-19.
In a brief speech to parliament just before question time on Tuesday, Mr Christensen called for an end to measures such as masks and lockdowns, arguing they were totally ineffective.
Senator Canavan said, while he did not agree with Mr Christensen’s stance on masks, he would “defend” his right to speak his mind
“I first of all want to say I defend every right of any Australian including members of Parliament to express their views, I don’t think they should be silenced on these issues,” he told Channel 9’s Today.
“Secondly I don’t agree with George on masks but I do agree with him on lockdowns.”
“It’s not that I don’t think (lockdowns) reduce the spread of the virus, but lockdowns come with a whole lot of other costs which are going uncited at the moment. Like mental health impacts, locking up kids in potentially abusive households. The lack of flexibility and compassion to people who might want to see a dying relative in their last moments.”
Senator Canavan said the strict public health measures that have been enforced have forced Australians to “lose their humanity”.

Ellie Dudley 6.50am: Mall alert puts Vic freedom at further risk
Melbourne residents’ hopes they’ll be released from lockdown on Friday has been dealt a further blow after a busy suburban shopping mall in the city’s outer west was identified as a high-risk venue for potential exposure of Covid-19 and all staff who worked over a four day period were asked to isolate.
Victoria Premier Daniel Andrews is today expected to extend the seven day lockdown after 15 of the 20 cases recorded on Tuesday were found to be infectious in the community.
The Caroline Springs Shopping Centre had already made the list last week, after an infected case visited numerous stores, forcing many other shoppers into “casual contact” status.
Now, anyone who worked at any store in the centre between August 2 and August 5 has been asked to get tested immediately and isolate for 14 days.
A total of 48 new exposure sites were added to the health department’s list on Tuesday, as the state recorded 20 new cases of Covid-19.
Only five of the cases were isolated during their infectious period.

Ellie Dudley 6.30am: Fears as positive cases visit popular Newcastle nightspots
A number of popular Newcastle social venues have appeared on NSW Health’s ever growing list of venues of potential exposure, raising concerns a superspreading event may occur.
Residents of the area are bracing themselves for a wave of new cases, after thirteen were detected in the Upper Hunter area on Tuesday and the virus continues to surge through the region.
The new venues listed by NSW Health are “the epicentre of young adult social life in Newcastle CBD”, Peter Jolly, a Triple M broadcaster in the region told news.com.au.
Anyone who visited the following venues at the times listed has been classified as a close contact and must be tested and isolate for 14 days.
Newcastle: Queen’s Wharf Hotel, 150 Wharf Street, Sunday August 1 8.15pm to 9.20pm
Charlestown: Central Leagues Club, 8 Bula Street, Monday August 2 12pm to 5pm, Tuesday August 3 5.30pm to 9.20pm, Wednesday August 4 4.40pm to 8.45pm
Newcastle: Honeysuckle Social, 11 Honeysuckle Drive, Thursday August 5 12.10pm to 1.50pm
Another high-risk location was identified in southwest Sydney. Those who were at the venue at the time stipulated should be tested and isolate for 14 days.
Bardwell Valley: Silver Jubilee Park Children’s Playground, Alsace Avenue, Saturday August 7 3.15pm to 5pm
Up to 577 new venues have been added to the health department’s list of places of potential transmission, largely from parts of southwest and west Sydney.

Anne Barrowclough 5.55am: Sydney traveller probed amid exemption claim doubts
The Sydney man who took the virus to Byron Bay is being investigated by police amid doubts over his claims he had an exemption to travel.
Police were originally told the 52-year-old from the city’s eastern suburbs had an exemption to look at properties in the region, the Daily Telegraph reports. However police are set to ramp up their probe of the man’s movements once NSW Health are fully appraised of them.
The man, whose movements sparked a week long lockdown for Byron Bay, Richmond Valley, Lismore and Ballina, is being treated for the virus in Lismore Base Hospital, while his two teenage children have also tested positive.
Byron Mayor Michael Lyon told the Telegraph he hoped the man would be charged over his movements.
“As I understand, this bloke may be charged,” he said. Certainly, it’s justified in this case. People are frustrated, outraged, it’s causing economic hardship, we’ve had some big impacts because of lockdown and other areas because of tourism. This is a hella blow.”

Yoni Bashan 5am: Hospitality industry pushes for mandatory vaccines
The hospitality industry is calling for mandatory Covid-19 vaccinations as a pathway out of lockdown, as cases climbed to record levels in NSW on Tuesday and as officials continued to weigh vaccination targets as a method of gradually easing restrictions.
A poll conducted by Restaurant and Catering Australia and provided to The Australian shows a majority of businesses want the ability to compel staff to be vaccinated before coming to work, with 63 per cent of restaurant, bar and hotel owners backing the move.
Some 62 per cent of these venues said the federal government should mandate Covid-19 vaccinations for the general public, when asked how to summarise their position.
NSW Premier Gladys Berejiklian says there is “no evidence” tougher lockdown restrictions on Greater Sydney will help curb the state’s ongoing outbreak.
The polling was released to The Australian as the state recorded 356 new cases of the virus, including three deaths, and as conservative NSW Liberal MPs debated the contentious issue of mandatory jabs in a partyroom meeting.
Tuesday’s case numbers marked a new record since the NSW outbreak began on June 16, with 97 people identified as being infectious in the community and another 157 cases still under investigation for their isolation status.
Conservative Liberals have been seeking to introduce legislation banning the NSW government and businesses from com­pelling people to have the vaccine, arguing that doing so would be an assault on their individual rights and liberties.
NSW Premier Gladys Berejiklian says the state government has always said its strategy is to get “as close to zero as we can” when it comes to cases infectious within the community.

Michael McKenna 4.45am: Palaszczuk targets marginal seat with Covid polling
Annastacia Palaszczuk ’s office conducted taxpayer-funded polling into the government’s Covid-19 strategy across a regional, Labor-held marginal seat targeted by the opposition ahead of last year’s state election.
Intensive “qualitative” interviews were commissioned with hundreds of residents of the Livingstone Shire – almost exclusively in Labor’s seat of Keppel – just days after a newspaper poll showed it was in danger of falling to the Liberal National Party.
The shire, which also includes a small stretch of the One Nation-held seat of Mirani, was the only region set aside for special attention in a series of monthly “waves” of statewide polling ordered by Ms Palaszczuk’s department into Covid-19 restrictions and her government’s handling of the outbreak.
On Tuesday, Ms Palaszczuk again refused to release any of the ongoing research – which has so far cost taxpayers’ $528,000 – as ALP insiders said it was used to help shape the government’s re-election strategy.

Patrick Commins 4.30am: Delta variant dashing consumer, business hopes
Business and consumer confidence has collapsed under the weight of Delta lockdowns, as sentiment turned negative for the first time since 2020.
NAB’s monthly business survey showed operating conditions and confidence “deteriorated sharply” in July.
The bank’s corporate sentiment index plunged by 19 points to -8 points and was “now well below average”, NAB said, where a reading below zero signals more pessimists than optimists.
Operating conditions for Australian firms deteriorated across the mainland, according to the survey, falling 14 points to 11 points – still above the historical average of six points. There was a particularly savage drop of 31 points to two points in NSW, while South Australia also experienced a large fall.
Treasurer Josh Frydenberg says the Australian economy will bounce back as it has done before.
NAB chief economist Alan Oster said “the survey shows that the strength in the business sector seen in early to mid-2021 has faded on the back of fresh disruptions in the economy, but it has not yet deteriorated to the lows seen in early 2020”.

Full text: LIVING with Covid-19 long-term will require an ongoing ­national contact tracing and testing plan as medical experts focus on emerging new treatments, amid hopes one day there will be a simple pill to fight the virus.
Two additional deputy chief health officers have been appointed to help the Commonwealth: former Queensland deputy chief health officer Sonya Bennett will oversee a national strategy for contact tracing, while GP Steph Davis will focus on mental health and vaccine modelling.
Dr Davis said even when Australia reaches vaccination rates of 70 and 80 per cent, modelling by the Doherty Institute showed an ongoing testing and tracing capacity would be needed to live with the virus.
“All of that is going to be going for a while to make sure that we can keep the virus at (manageable) levels,” she said.
In the future chief medical officer Professor Paul Kelly (pictured) is hopeful a super-effective treatment for Covid-19 will be developed.
“The real game changer for this will be, when we have a normal pill like we do for … influenza … to give people early in the illness or even indeed to ­prevent illness,” he said.
“That pill does not exist at the moment in the world.” Prof Kelly said as soon as medicines are developed and “shown to be useful” in treating Covid-19, health officials would work to make them available in Australia.
Prof Kelly will also meet with health experts today to develop clinical guidance for use of a new monoclonal antibody drug Sotrovimab, which Australia has purchased for treating Covid-19 pending Therapeutic Goods Administration (TGA) approval.
“I’m starting a process this week with clinical colleagues to look at clinical guidelines,” he said. “This medicine is not for everybody, it is an antibody (that) will be mostly aimed at people that are not vaccinated, it will be mostly for people who are at highest risk of severe disease, and it needs to be given early in the treatment.” It comes as South Australia recorded two new cases on Sunday – a woman in her 30s and a child, who both acquired their infection overseas and have been in a medi-hotel since their arrival. A woman in her 80s and a man in his 70s remain in the Royal Adelaide Hospital in a stable condition.
SA Health recorded just 4900 Covid-19 tests on Saturday. Chief public health officer Nicola Spurrier said testing is crucial to residents enjoying fewer restrictions.
“Our testing rates should be significantly higher than that seen over the past week,” she said. “I urge everyone to get tested if they experience any symptoms whatsoever. A Covid-19 test should go hand-in-hand with any cold or flu-like symptoms so we can keep one step ahead of any outbreak.”

Unmasking the truth about the path to freedom

Author: Kelly, Paul

Full text: Australians face a grim four-month period until November. Personal trauma and economic pain will intensify. There is no sign of progress for NSW in its protracted lockdown. Victoria has entered its sixth lockdown. Southeast Queensland may get a reprieve this week.
Apprehension is deepening across the country. For many in lockdown each day resembles a reoccurring misery. The frustration arises from the lack of progress, the sense the Delta strand is outpacing our health resources. Politicians fight and medical experts pontificate. There is no immediate escape – but there is an escape.
Things will get better. This view is founded in science not just hope. The problem is that things may get worse before they get better. And when they get better the virus won’t be gone. The fight against Covid will merely take a new form with the public far better protected, in full vaccinated armour.
There are no certainties. But the best way to understand the coming trade-offs remains the pathway endorsed by national cabinet based on Doherty Institute modelling and Treasury analysis released this week.
Here are some relevant questions and answers.
Q: What vaccination rate delivers assured herd immunity?
A: As Professor Jodie McVernon from the Doherty Institute said, there is no “magic number”, no ­binary cut-off that delivers “life as normal”. This is not the way to think. Vaccination coverage is a continuum. Every person vaccinated helps to reduce transmission. Doherty modelling suggests having rates at 70-80 per cent means the need for long, stringent measures and lockdowns will be “substantially reduced”.
McVernon told Inquirer: “With Delta and the vaccines that we have we never get to this magic number where the reproduction number or transmission potential is one or less, meaning that outbreaks would not take off. But we can still significantly restrain the spread of the virus with vaccination. It is definitely our pathway out of the cycle of lockdown.”
The point is that all these ­options are suboptimal. That’s the reality. “The vaccines we have are good but no vaccines are perfect,” McVernon said.
How long before the 70-80 per cent double dose rates can be achieved?
Scott Morrison expects to reach 70 per cent later this year, perhaps by November. Program co-ordinator, Lieutenant General John Frewen said there was a “really good opportunity” to hit 70 per cent and even “potentially” 80 per cent this year. Government research suggests 77 per cent of people have no problem with vaccines. Above this, it gets harder.
Frewen said 80 per cent demands a “concerted effort”. Doherty modelling had 70 and 80 per cent reached at November 1 and 22. With lockdowns operating as incentives, an 80 per cent target should be feasible this year – a bonus from current hardship. One problem is lagging states, notably Western Australia.
What happens at 70 and 80 per cent coverage?
The virus is not beaten. But at this point the main trade-off kicks in: because the rates of severe ­infection are reduced, stringent measures and lockdowns can be reduced. At 80 per cent, the plan is that lockdowns would not be needed for entire states and extended areas, though localised, targeted lockdowns could still be needed.
But the Doherty modelling reveals the ongoing importance of the “test, trace, isolate and quarantine” (TTIQ) capability. This stays as a permanent feature of our health system, public policy and social life. It is vital for public ­protection. Vaccination alone ­cannot solve the problem. Thinking that it can will lead to failure. Vaccination is necessary but not sufficient.
“There is no one fix to this virus,” McVernon said. “We are ­relying on the synergies of intervention to support each other. We have to keep going with the public health TTIQ response and vaccination will markedly assist that.” Vaccination is “a very big part of the answer but it is not the whole answer”.
How significant is the difference between 50-60 per cent vaccination and 70-80 per cent?
This difference looms large in the modelling. It suggests that opening up at the 50-60 per cent range would be dangerous folly. This is a stark warning to politicians, ­notably to NSW Premier Gladys Berejiklian who earlier in the week was talking about some easing of restrictions at August 29 when, she hopes, NSW reaches 50 per cent coverage (yet that is just one dose).
“At 50 and 60 per cent we anticipate rapidly growing outbreaks that would be very difficult to control and would require stringent social measures,” McVernon said. By that she means Victoria’s phase four lockdown from 2020. Can you imagine the devastating impact if half the population was vaccinated but a massive lockdown was still required?
Two conclusions flow from this. Vaccination cannot be Sydney’s solution before November, hence the need for its lockdown to work. And the entire country faces the prospect of “on and off” lockdowns for the next three to four months.
Even assessing the 70 per cent vaccination scenario, McVernon said the public health (TTIQ) response would be vital to ensure what might “otherwise be a bushfire” was kept to a “controlled backburn”. The Doherty modelling opening-up scenario had infections running four times as great at 50 per cent compared with 80 per cent and deaths running about seven times as great.
What does the modelling say about the demands from conservatives and libertarians for the current lockdowns to be abandoned or seriously eased at this point?
It suggests the risks would be enormous, bordering on the reckless. Obviously, no premier would ­contemplate such action for the obvious reason – the vaccination coverage is not high enough. Any such action would run counter to all the official health advice.
How great is the change in public mindset required to move from the lockdown to vaccination phase?
It is significant and won’t be easy. Morrison’s language now is that we must “learn to live with the virus”. His hope once phase 3 is reached – the 80 per cent phase – is that the public will perceive this as “not unlike living with an infectious disease like the flu”. This involves a dramatic shift in outlook, but one Australians must make.
Chief Medical Officer Paul Kelly said the transformation involved moving from the current phase – suppression designed to eliminate any community transmission – to a new phase where “we need to accept” hospitalisation, ICU admissions and deaths, accepting them as part of living with the virus and seeking to limit its impact. It means moving away from the goal of eliminating any community transmission.
How can the vaccine rollout be geared to minimise transmission of the virus?
The Doherty modelling is strong on this point. It shows the way people are vaccinated is critical. The peak spreaders of Covid-19 are people in the 20-39 years age range. They bring it home either to their children or their parents. McVernon said the original road map – targeting the older and most vulnerable – was correct. We had been right to focus on risk reduction as the priority.
But from this point, the recommendation is to focus on transmission. “Immunising younger people and reducing transmission is critical to maximising the gains of a whole population program,” McVernon said. The aim is to bring forward vaccination of the 30-39 age group to the start of September and the 16-29 group to early in ­October. By the time of any shift to stage 3, the vaccination rate for those aged 60 years and older should be 90 per cent.
How can Australia try to “normalise” the battle against the virus going into 2022?
The essential means is by vaccination. This is the road towards a new normal. There is a possible stumbling block – the demon of another more transmissible variant. Yet further vaccination boosters will continue to be rolled out in 2022 and 2023. Morrison uses the context of the flu to seek a path ­towards normalisation and to ­prepare the public for the renewed debate about hospitalisation, ICU admissions and death rates.
Average annual deaths from ­influenza over 2016-19 were 642. Comparisons with flu can work providing the combined impact of all interventions succeeds in limiting community transmission. The “sweet spot” in the Doherty modelling shows that by combining a “transmission-reducing” vaccine rollout with an effective TTIQ public health capability and a high vaccination target, the health outcomes could be improved around 100-fold or more.
They key is to get right the three key policies – the high vaccination coverage, the strong TTIQ health response, and the vaccine rollout. It is interventions working together that matter.
Is the government pledged to giving special exemptions to those Australians who get vaccinated?
Morrison is pledged to this principle but he believes its implementation rests with the premiers, business and various institutions. The PM said the national road map from phase 2 (the 70 per cent trigger) provides for exemptions for vaccinated people. Presumably this will apply before the end of 2021. Such exemptions will only become far more prominent under phase 3 (the 80 per cent trigger).
ScoMo’s vaccination road map to the election
The justification is clear: the vaccinated are a lower public risk. There is a public interest and ethical basis for exemptions. Majority public support can be assumed. But Morrison’s initial response is that these public health issues lie within the realm of the states.
The federal government has no plan to pass new laws on the subject of exemptions. Morrison said on Friday Australia has no mandatory vaccination policy and businesses and institutions need to make their own judgments.
Obviously, business must ensure it acts on a legal basis in whatever actions it takes.
What incentives might be given to encourage people to be vaccinated?
Decisions on this are still awaiting. Frewen said this week that “demand is still exceeding supply”, while Morrison said late Friday the vaccine rollout has turned the corner there are still supply issues. Morrison and Frewen say the main incentive for vaccination is the practical impact of people doing the right thing, protecting their health and safeguarding their ­family and friends.
Frewen said down the track a range of options will be assessed, including cash and lotteries. But Morrison drew a line in the sand this week. He savaged Opposition Leader Anthony Albanese’s $300 cash payment for anybody getting vaccinated. Morrison declared this a vote of “no confidence” in the integrity of Australians. He will fight it and seek to hang this idea around Labor’s head.
Does the Doherty report have any relevance for the ongoing ­debate over the type of vaccine, AstraZeneca versus Pfizer?
Its findings are dramatic and deserve great publicity. Full AZ vaccine coverage is comparable to full Pfizer coverage in reducing death and hospitalisation. In terms of reducing hospitalisation, AZ rates at 86 per cent compared with Pfizer at 87 per cent. On the ICU admission measure they also compare at 86 per cent to 87 per cent. On deaths AZ reduction effectiveness is 90 per cent compared with 92 per cent for Pfizer. “We have two highly effective vaccines,” McVernon said.
What can Australia learn from the current overseas experience?
McVernon said she felt the current northern hemisphere experience validated the argument being put to national cabinet: “When we look at countries that have reopening to this Freedom Day concept, the Netherlands within two weeks was going back to restrictions in bars, nightclubs and restaurants because even at a reasonable high level of coverage – but lower that we are aspiring to – they saw ongoing social measures were needed to rein in the virus.”
The point is Australia rejects totally any idea that freedom is possible by abandoning the testing, tracing, isolating, quarantining and some social restrictions that have defined the past 18 months. The modelling shows these capabilities are essential and Australians need to understand this point.
What happens over the next several months before we reach the 70-80 per cent targets?
The national cabinet has agreed that during this “suppression” phase the response must be “early, stringent, short lockdowns”. This is now the universal view among Australian governments held by the PM, premiers, the Doherty ­Institute and Treasury.
Morrison has changed his stance on lockdowns because the Delta variant has changed everything. While Morrison backed the initial reluctance of Berejiklian to lock down, he now warns that ­lockdown is the “primary tool” in Sydney. Morrison will support ­premiers, such as Victoria’s Dan Andrews, resorting to the short, tough lockdown.
Morrison’s message is that while the suppression phase lasts, it is the premiers who will take the decisions and carry the responsibility for lockdowns – yet nobody will forget it’s all still a function of the delayed vaccine rollout.

Full text: NSW has recorded 291 new locally-acquired cases of Covid-19 as infections continue to spread.
Queensland has recorded 10 new cases of Covid-19 in the past 24 hours, boosting hope that the lockdown will lift on Sunday.
Victoria has recorded six new coronavirus cases in the 24 hours to midnight on Thursday.
Hundreds of protesters chanting ‘no more lockdowns’ and ‘sack Dan Andrews’ have clashed with police in wild scenes in Melbourne’s CBD last night. The protests took place as Victoria was plunged into sixth lockdown over two new Covid-19 clusters that may have been spread by an illegal party.
Joseph Lam 9.30pm: New NSW exposure sites named
A burlesque lounge and a venue in Sydney’s popular Tramsheds are among the latest venues to be added to NSW Health’s list of Covid-19 exposure sites.
Those who have visited the following venues during the listed times is a close contact who must get tested and isolate for 14 days since they attended, regardless of the result.
Hamilton: Corset Bar and Supper Club, 104 Beaumont Street: Wednesday, July 28, from 7.30pm to 10pm
St Marys : Easy Script Compound Pharmacy, 38 Queen Street: Monday, August 2, All day; Tuesday, August 3, All day
Forest Lodge: Fish and Co Tramsheds, 1 Dalgal Way: Saturday, July 24, from 1.20pm to 2.00pm
Mackenzie Scott 9.00pm: More pharmacies recruited for rollout
Getting the Covid-19 vaccine in southeast Queensland has been made easier, with more than 100 pharmacies granted permission to administer vaccines.
The state’s excess AstraZeneca supply has been redistributed across 113 pharmacies in a move expected to boost vaccination ­levels. The new sites join the 181 locations already operating in rural and regional areas across Queensland where there are gaps in the vaccine rollout.
Acting president of the Pharmacy Guild of Australia’s Queensland branch, Chris Owen, said the addition of new jab locations would be “a big shot in the arm” to the rollout. “The most important thing is that we have to have more access points with more available ­appointments,” Mr Owen said. “When there’s a surge in demand, if you don’t have enough access points, then they’re just gonna lead to a log jam.”
The number of pharmacies included in the Queensland rollout is expected to balloon to 800 by the end of this month.

Ewin Hannan 8.45pm: Pre-strike lockouts ruled to be unlawful
Unions have successfully challenged a Fair Work Commission decision that backed the right of employers to lock out workers ­before they took legal industrial action.
A commission full bench ­majority upheld an appeal by the Australian Manufacturing Workers Union, finding a pre-emptive lockout of Tasmanian workers by frozen food giant McCain was unlawful under the Fair Work Act.
ACTU president Michele O’Neil said the outcome was “an important win for workers around the country as it makes clear that companies cannot use lockouts as a pre-emptive ­weapon to intimidate workers seeking a fair deal”.
McCain Foods workers at the company’s Smithton operations were locked out after the AMWU gave notice employees intended to take protected industrial action in response to an earlier two-day lockout by the company.

Ewin Hannan 8.10pm: Fair Work to rule on mandatory vaccines
The Fair Work Ombudsman will soon release updated guidance about the issue of employers seeking to mandate covid vaccinations of workers..
The FWO noted that Mr Morrison said on Friday that the government’s advice was there might be situations where it was reasonable for employers to require an employee to be vaccinated.
“This advice included considering issues such as the reasonableness of any employer direction and the application of anti-discrimination laws,” the FWO said.
“The Prime Minister acknowledged that ultimately employers need to consider these issues and make their own decisions appropriate to their workplace.”
The FWO said it would be guided by applicable laws and judicial decisions, enforceable government directions such as public health orders, and advice issued by Commonwealth, state and territory agencies.
Patrick Commins 7.20pm: Economy can defy Delta: RBA
The Reserve Bank is optimistic higher vaccination rates will free Sydney from its current lockdown by October and a sharp bounce back will return the economy to its pre-Delta trajectory as soon as March next year.
With more than 15 million Australians under stay-at-home ­orders, RBA governor Philip Lowe also told a parliamentary committee it was “quite unlikely” the country would plunge into a double-dip recession over the second half of this year.
However, he couldn’t “rule out two quarters of negative growth if the health situation deteriorates”, and forecast “further brief (and less severe) restrictions” throughout the December quarter and limited lockdowns into 2022.
“We’ve got to traverse a difficult few months … but the experience here and elsewhere is that once the health situation is brought under control the economy bounces back quickly,” Dr Lowe said.

Olivia Caisley 7.10pm: ‘Older Aussies should encourage grandkids to vax’
Former governors-general are calling on Australia’s youth to get vaccinated in the fight against Covid-19 after Doherty Institute modelling showed deaths and hospitalisations would be nearly halved under a strategy to vaccinate all adults as opposed to older people first.
As NSW recorded a record 291 cases, of which at least 50 were ­active in the community, Peter Cosgrove said jabs were the pathway back to normality.
“There is no doubt the best way we can protect one another and get back to normal is through vaccination. So my advice is that everybody should get both vaccinations and thus protect their families, their communities and all Australians,” Sir Peter said.
“In particular, I send this plea to younger Australians: you’re our nation’s future so get vaccinated.”

Nicholas Jensen 6.20pm: Deadly Delta spin-offs ‘a possibility’
As the Delta variant continues to drive a global surge in coronavirus cases, infectious disease experts are warning that potentially more transmissible and vaccine-resistant strains could emerge where inoculation levels are low.
While the World Health Organisation has identified four “variants of concern”, the Alpha, Beta, Gamma and Delta strains, experts remain concerned about four further “variants of interest” – Lambda, Eta, Kappa and Iota – which could prove even more transmissible.
The WHO has convened urgent discussions concerning the prospect of a new, more lethal variant arising, after leaked documents from the US Centres for Disease Control urged officials to “acknowledge the war has changed”.
The documents concluded that vaccine breakthroughs and “more community spread” could become a reality if inoculations stagnated, citing unpublished research that showed the Delta variant might be able to transmit as easily among the vaccinated population as the unvaccinated.

Max Maddison 5.25pm: Employers can mandate jabs for ‘at risk’ employees
Scott Morrison says employers may be able to mandate vaccinations for their staff when they’re at “great risk” of contracting the virus.
Citing advice from the Solicitor-General, the Prime Minister said while employers would still have to abide by the “rule of law”, there was scope for mandating vaccinations under occupational health and safety.
“Where an employee maybe at great risk of actually contracting the virus, the employer would be in those circumstances seeking to afford some protection for their staff and the upholding perhaps in their view their obligations regarding the occupational health and safety of their staff,” Mr Morrison said.
“For those who are working in an area where they’re taking care of very vulnerable people, what is another set of circumstances.”
He said another circumstance was where employees were in “regular contact” with the public.
Max Maddison 5.17pm: Some employers ‘may mandate jabs, subject to law’
The Prime Minister has flagged some instances where employers may be able to mandate vaccinations for their staff.
“People like airline workers, where they are coming in contact with people carrying the virus,” he said.
“The second are those who may be working with people who are vulnerable, and consideration are given to aged care workers and others who are coming into close contact with those who are vulnerable and it may be that the business would take a decision in that respect, and the third tier of those who are in that position are those who may be public-facing in their day – public retail, supermarkets, essential occupations where there is a lot of contact.”
But he noted these circumstances would be subject to the law.
“Again, these are all legal decisions that have to pass a reasonable test and ultimately decided by the courts, and employers need to consider those matters very carefully if they are looking to make directions of that nature,” he said.
Anne Barrowclough 5.14pm: CMO: NSW needs circuit breaker
Chief Medical Officer Paul Kelly has defended Sydney’s lockdown saying that without the lockdown and higher uptake of vaccinations “this would have been much higher rates of illness, hospitalisation and death up to now.
However, he added Sydney needs a circuit breaker to get control of the rocketing numbers.
“There is no sense that is heading rapidly towards zero which is what remains our national approach at the moment. There is clearly a need for a circuit breaker. I’ve had many discussions with my colleague in New South Wales around that. What else could be done to increase the speed of people being diagnosed, the compliance with those public health measures and crucially, an increase in vaccination in those areas. New South Wales needs to stay the course and look for those new ways of increasing and improving that situation,” he said.
Max Maddison 5.05pm: National cabinet agrees Covid plan
The national cabinet has “fully agreed” to live with the virus once 70 per cent of the population is vaccinated, ensuring lockdowns will be limited to isolated occasions and cast aside once the country reaches 80 per cent, but refrains from allowing workplaces to mandate vaccinations for employers.
With Victoria entering its sixth lockdown on Friday, the entire eastern seaboard of the country was plunged back into draconian stay-at-home orders. But Scott Morrison said Premiers had “fully agreed” to severely curtail the use of the measure once the population had effective coverage.
“Today it was confirmed and fully agreed that the national plan, that pathway to the position where we live with this virus,” the Prime Minister told a press conference on Friday afternoon.
He said while employers could make a “reasonable directive” for employees to get vaccinated, any direction would have to be “consistent with the law”.
“But ultimately employers need to consider these matters and make their own decisions remembering we do not have a mandatory vaccination policy in this country,” he said.
Joseph Lam 4.35pm: Morrison due to give national cabinet update
The Prime Minister is due to give an update after national cabinet at around 4.40pm.
Paige Taylor 4.30pm: Alerts as Covid traces found in Broome sewage
The unexpected discovery of weak traces of Covid-19 in wastewater in the remote Kimberley town of Broome has prompted health authorities to urge locals with symptoms to get tested.
There have been no known cases of coronavirus in the Kimberley since April 2020, when an outbreak among doctors and nurses in Broome and the inland town of Halls Creek caused panic. About 42 per cent of the region’s 34,000 residents are indigenous and many live in overcrowded housing. The Kimberley Aboriginal Medical Service feared that if Covid-19 got into a remote community, it would infect many vulnerable people with underlying health conditions before anyone realised.
“The West Australian Department of Health is calling on people in the Broome township area to get tested if they have Covid-19 symptoms after the state’s wastewater surveillance program detected weak traces of the virus in Broome township,” the WA Health Department wrote in a statement on its website on Friday afternoon.
“This unexpected finding does not necessarily indicate there is a positive case in the community. However, people (regardless of age) with even the mildest of symptoms are asked to get tested as soon as possible as a precaution.
“Symptoms of COVID-19 include fever, cough, sore throat, runny nose, shortness of breath, headache, and loss of smell or taste.
“Once tested, people should return home and remain there until a negative test result is received.”
The department says finding traces of the virus in wastewater samples could mean there are active cases nearby; an active case has passed through the area recently; or that a historical case has recently been in the area - people can continue to shed the virus for several weeks after they recover from Covid-19, even when they are no longer infectious.
Courtney Gold 4.10pm: 54 Aussies die from Covid abroad
New figures, obtained under Freedom of Information laws and first reported by the ABC, reveal 54 Australian citizens have died from Covid-19 while abroad as at mid-May this year.
The deaths span 27 countries, including France, India, Indonesia, the US and the UK.
Limited quarantine capacity has stymied the ability of Australians to return home since the borders were closed in March last year. In June, the number of international arrivals was halved in to reduce the pressure the system faced under the Delta strain of Covid-19.
National cabinet was forced to cut arrivals after a series of breaches from hotel quarantine saw the highly infectious variant to seep into the community. It meant only 3035 passengers would be allowed to enter Australia each week instead of 6070.

Joseph Lam 3.45pm: No new cases in WA, SA
Western Australia recorded no new Covid-19 cases over the past 24-hour period.
The state has called on those in Broome, more than 2000km north of Perth, to present for testing after the state detected Covid-19 fragments in a local wastewater system.
South Australia also recorded no new cases of Covid-19 in the same period.
Adam Creighton 3.00pm: Gates lauds Australia’s ’best practice' Covid response
US tech titan Bill Gates has lauded Australia’s Covid-19 response as world’s best practice and played down the relevance of investigations into the origins of Sars-Cov2.
The Microsoft founder, speaking on US cable TV on Wednesday, said investigations into the origins of Sars-Cov2, which have become highly controversial among scientists and fuelled tension between China and the US and Australia, wouldn’t change “the need for masks and vaccines”.
“he last paper I saw showed evidence against lab leak, but yes we should investigate these things, but it’s not directly tied to particular actions to save lives,” he said.
Gates, whose personal wealth is in excess of $162 billion, also called for a “very different regimen so all countries can get on top of cases very quickly and be more like Australia than Europe or the US ended up being”.

Matthew Denholm 1.55pm: NSW residents ‘fleeing to Tas, leasing homes’
People from NSW are “fleeing” to Tasmania and leasing properties on the island to meet quarantine residency requirements, says Premier Peter Gutwein.
Mr Gutwein said the practice was placing pressure on the state’s quarantine capacity, with some NSW residents willing to pay the quarantine fee to escape their Covid-19 stricken state.
“We’ve actually got people who are fleeing NSW that have leased properties here in Tasmania so that they have a valid Tasmanian address,” Mr Gutwein said on Friday.
“They have work to go to in many cases. They are actually fleeing and quite happy to pay the quarantine fee. That’s what is putting pressure on our (quarantine) hotel system.”

Courtney Gold 1.50pm: Loophole closed for overseas Aussies
Australians who normally live abroad will no longer be given an automatic exemption to leave the country if they return for a holiday or to visit loved ones.
Since March last year, all Australians seeking to leave Australia have had to apply for an exemption to do so. Exemptions can only be granted for employment, medical treatment not available in Australia, compassionate or compelling grounds, unavoidable personal business, or if your travel was in the national interest.
Until now, if an Australian citizen was ordinarily a resident in another country, they were automatically exempt.
But this week Health Minister Greg Hunt quietly expanded the restrictions to include Australian citizens or permanent residents. From August 11, Australians who ordinarily live in another country will also have to apply for an exemption to leave the country.

Ellie Dudley 1.45pm: National cabinet to discuss vaccine rollout
As almost 16 million Australians remain in lockdown, National Cabinet will meet today to discuss the vaccine rollout and supply.
The meeting will commence this afternoon between leaders from Australia’s states and territories and the Prime Minister Scott Morrison.
It is expected the leaders of Victoria, NSW and Queensland will request more doses of the Pfizer vaccine to have their population inoculated as soon as possible.
The leaders are also going to discuss the next steps forward out of the pandemic, given the national target that 80 per cent of people aged over the age of 16 need to be fully immunised before the country returns to pre-pandemic freedoms.
Mr Morrison will address a press conference after the meeting.
Queensland will be represented by director-general Rachel Hunter, while premier Annastacia Palaszczuk is still in hotel quarantine and as deputy premier’s are not permitted to attend the regular meetings.
Ellie Dudley 1.30pm: New alerts over Lake Macquarie shopping centre
A Lake Macquarie shopping centre has emerged as a high-risk exposure site, forcing hundreds of residents into isolation.
Charlestown Square, three hours north of Sydney, has been identified as a venue of potential exposure, with all shoppers who were at the mall on July 29 between 3pm and 6pm classed as a casual contact.
Casual contacts must be tested for the virus immediately, and isolate until a negative test result has been received.
A number of stores at the shopping village have been added to the close contact list, meaning anyone who visited them at the indicated time must immediately be tested and isolate for 14 days.

David Charter 1.20pm: US plans to reopen to fully vaxxed visitors
Foreign visitors to the United States may have to be fully vaccinated against the coronavirus.
The White House was considering the requirement as a condition of opening up travel again, a spokesman said. He added that vaccination would be part of a “phased approach” to easing travel restrictions for foreigners but that there was no timeline for lifting the transatlantic travel ban introduced by President Trump in March last year.
President Biden has resisted giving hints on when general travel from the UK, Ireland and continental Europe will be resumed. A discussion about reopening was held at the G7 summit in Cornwall in early June but the rise of the more infectious Delta variant has stalled plans.
Biden is also hardening his line on requiring vaccinations domestically. Lloyd Austin, the Defence Secretary, is expected to recommend as early as today (Friday) that they will be mandated for all 1.3 million US troops on active duty. About 64 per cent of US forces are fully vaccinated compared with 60.7 per cent of adult Americans.

Matthew Denholm 1.00pm: No new cases in Tasmania
Tasmania has not recorded any new coronavirus cases, after 1640 tests in the past 24 hours.
However, Premier Peter Gutwein warned the state was still “vigilant” following a case in quarantine detected on Thursday, forcing 200 people into isolation.
Remy Varga 12.45pm: Protesters ‘risk extending lockdown’
Industry Minister Martin Pakula says he finds anti-lockdown protesters “infuriating” and risks extending stay at home orders.
Mr Pakula said he wished people would get information from credible sources instead of “uninformed Facebook warriors.”
“It makes me really angry and I think it makes a lot of people really angry.... I just wish people would stop taking their information from uninformed Facebook warriors,” he said.
Australian Industry Group CEO Innes Willox says many businesses in Victoria feel “betrayed” by the announcement of the state’s sixth lockdown. “Many feel betrayed by what’s going on here, doesn’t matter what amount of government support is provided," Mr Willox told Sky News Australia. "Doesn’t mean that businesses can open, doesn’t mean they can trade, it doesn’t give them any certainty going forward." He says there is a “great concern” there will be continued “on and off” lockdowns for at least the rest of the year. "And there’s still enormous uncertainty emanating from our political leaders around how we get out of this. “We’re in a pretty dark tunnel … and there’s not a lot of light at the end of it.”
Remy Varga 11.55am: $400m funding package for Vic business
A new $400 million funding package for lockdown smashed Victorians businesses jointly funded by the Commonwealth and state governments has been unveiled.
More than 90,000 businesses will be eligible for automatic payments of $2,800 and further hardship funds will be made available.
New payments of between $5,000 to $20,000 will be made to nearly 9,000 hospitality venues across Australia, with the amount depending on capacity.
Federal Treasurer Josh Frydenberg said the money would help cushion the impact of the latest lockdown in Victoria.
“Since the start of the pandemic the federal government has delivered more than $45 billion to Victorian families and businesses to support them in their hour of need,” he said.
Eligible workers can access the COVID-19 Disaster Payments
The funding is in addition to the $400 million in joint funding announced last week.
Victorian Industry Minister Martin Pakula said the new money would help businesses pay their bills and plan for a recovery.
“Decisive action is required to tackle this incredibly infectious strain of coronavirus, but we know it doesn’t come without a cost,” he said.
Victoria has recorded six new coronavirus cases on the state’s first day of its sixth lockdown, with all cases infectious in the community. “One of these is the housemate of the index case. The housemate is a cleaner, and the public health team are investigating the movements of that person,” Health Minister Martin Foley said. “I can confirm that he worked at the Epworth Hospital in Richmond, as a cleaner in the administration area, not in the wards, and we’re working with that hospital to assess who he may have come in contact with. “The other two related cases are close contacts that live in a different household to the index case, one of these attends the Warringa Park specialist school, a particularly important school that looks after some of our most vulnerable kids.”
Ellie Dudley 11.50am: Covid Zero ‘still NSW aspiration’ but vax the key
NSW Premier Gladys Berejiklian hasn’t given up on the dream of “Covid Zero”, but says vaccinations are the “key” to getting the state out of lockdown.
The state recorded its highest number of daily cases since the pandemic began on Friday, dimming hopes that NSW would ever get back to a state of no cases.
“It is obviously a challenge to get down to that number but (Covid Zero) has to be our aspiration,” Ms Berejiklian said.
“We have to try to get down as low as we can but what I do want to say is that the government will be looking at two things: where the case numbers are at but also our vaccination rates.”
“Even though we may not be going back to life pre-COVID or pre-this outbreak, we can have more freedom once we get those vaccination rates up and that is the key.”
Remy Varga 11.45am: Vic ‘precarious’ as outbreaks flare up
Victorian Health Minister Martin Foley says the state is in a “precarious” as outbreaks flare up in Melbourne.
He said a Sydney man who tested positive travelled with a valid entry permit to Melbourne before flying to Launceston on the same day.
Mr Foley said the man was detained upon arrival in Launceston and tested before he was sent back to Sydney. He then tested positive.
Ellie Dudley 11.42am: Health system ‘under stress but urgent needs met’
NSW health minister Brad Hazzard has repeated claims that the state’s health system is “under stress”, but is adamant health workers “are doing a great job.”
There are currently 304 COVID-19 cases admitted to hospital, with 50 people in intensive care, 22 of whom require ventilation.
“Certainly, anybody who thinks the health system in any country where we have a Delta variant is not under stress is kidding themselves,” Mr Hazzard said.
“Of course it is under stress but our health professionals are doing a great job.”
But despite Mr Hazzard’s claims, NSW chief health officer Kerry Chant said “anyone’s urgent health needs would be met by our health system.”
“We have a very large hospital system and a very integrated hospital system.,” she said.
“We certainly have increased capacity and when we cease elective surgery, that frees up that capacity.”
Remy Varga 11.40am: Three Vic cases linked to Maribyrnong cluster
Victorian Health Minister Martin Foley says of the four new cases reported on Friday, three are linked to the Maribyrnong outbreak.
One, the housemate of the Derrimut factory worker, worked as a cleaner in the administration area at the Epworth Hospital in Richmond.
Another case attends the Warringah Park special school in Hoppers Crossing, which has been closed for deep cleaning.
Three of the cases are linked to the Hobson’s Bay outbreak, two of which were reported yesterday.
The remaining case lives with the Hobson Bay couple.
Ellie Dudley 11.36am: Twelve Punchbowl KFC staff test positive
Twelve staff members at a KFC in southwest Sydney have tested positive for Covid-19, NSW chief health officer Kerry Chant says.
The Punchbowl chicken shop joined NSW Health’s ever growing list of potential exposure sites, sending any customers who walked through the door during that seven day period into 14 day quarantine.
Asked whether chains like KFC should stay open, Dr Chant said: “This is about a balance of access to food and other things that people need.”
“My major point would be that you minimise your exposure in those settings, minimise your shopping,” she said.
“You should be out of your house for the minimal time and please don’t go out unnecessarily, and don’t use shopping as a social event in any way.”
Anyone who visited the KFC at 1323/1325 Canterbury Road at any time on the following days should immediately be tested and quarantine for 14 days regardless of the result.

Angelica Snowden 11.35am: Vic police: no proof of rule breaking
Victoria police say the Department of Health has not referred any instances of possible rule breaking to investigators as authorities work to uncover the source of the state’s latest outbreak.
Premier Daniel Andrews insinuated on Thursday night an illegal gathering between different households could have sparked the spread of Covid-19 again.
But Victoria Police assistant commissioner Luke Cornelius said his team had not received any requests to investigate a breach of the chief health officer’s rules as yet.
“I can say to you in relation to what might or might not have occurred or led to the current outbreak, I can say to you, we’ve had no referrals,” he said.
“On every occasion where the Department of Health has referred a matter to us for enforcement action, or for investigation we have pursued that investigation.
“In relation to any breaches that might be identified by authorised Officers ... we stand ready to take those referrals and take appropriate action.”
Mr Andrews on Thursday night said contact tracers were investigating whether a man in his 20s from Maribyrnong, in the state’s north west, had visited relatives who recently left NSW hotel quarantine.
“It may well be the case they have been visited, against the rules, by a positive case,” he said.
Ellie Dudley 11.30am: Victim caught Covid from Liverpool hospital staff member
The woman who died after catching Covid in Liverpool hospital was exposed to the virus through a staff member who was carrying the virus while on the job.
CHO Kerry Chant said the infected person brought it into the hospital unknowingly. She said there were no positive Covid-19 patients in the same ward as the woman, who was reportedly in hospital for kidney problems.
Ellie Dudley 11.25am: ‘Be patient’: Berejiklian defends contact tracers
NSW premier Gladys Berejiklian has denied claims that the state’s contact tracers are not keeping up with the current amount of cases.
Ms Berejiklian deflected an accusation that people who spent time with positive cases have not been alerted to the infection until almost 14 days after the possible infection.
“The contact tracing team has been expanded,” she said.
“But we also need to rely on people to tell us where they have been. Sometimes it takes more than one interview.
‘It is not our preference to wait. We do believe that is the exception. We do ask for patience though and we have no doubt that as the number of cases increase, that means that resources are stretched further.”
Ellie Dudley 11.25am: High risk Year 12s ‘won’t be disadvantaged’
NSW premier Gladys Berejiklian has assured HSC students in southwest and west Sydney will not be disadvantaged in their upcoming exams.
Year 12 students from eight LGAs will not be permitted to return to school on August 16, while the rest of their cohort across Sydney will recommence face-to-face learning.
But Ms Berejiklian said the education and health departments have been working together to make sure every HSC student has equal opportunity to succeed.
“No student setting the HSC, whether they live in New South Wales, will be disadvantaged, which is why we will be giving those students in those eight local areas the opportunity to get the vaccine from Monday next week,” she said.
“We hope students and families will have conversations and make sure they provide the opportunity for the student to come forward and get vaccinated.
“It is important because we know it is a requirement that they have to set a public examination for HSC.”
Ellie Dudley 11.20am: High risk Year 12 students told ‘get vaccinated now’
NSW health minister Brad Hazzard has encouraged Year 12 students in Sydney’s eight high risk LGAs to be vaccinated at Qudos Bank Arena.
Mr Hazzard said the HSC students were being given a “golden opportunity” to be vaccinated with the Pfizer vaccine ahead of their trial exams.
“You are being given a golden opportunity to attend the Qudos Bank Arena next week,” he said.
“We’ve seen the most amazing stars in the Qudos Bank Arena, I think there has been Lana Del Rey, Keith Urban, P!nk, Madonna, you have a chance to go to that stadium next week and get some gold by getting your first vaccination.”
Ellie Dudley 11.17am: Two new cases in Newcastle as lockdown starts
Two new cases of Covid-19 have been detected in the Newcastle area, as the upper Hunter region begins its first full day of a week-long lockdown.
Both have been linked to existing cases.
“There have been two new cases of Covid-19 in the Newcastle area,” NSW chief health officer Kerry Chant said.
“The two new cases in the Newcastle area means that there have now been seven cases in the region.”
One of the cases is a woman in her 60s who has been linked to a known case on the central coast.
The second is a woman in her 20s who is a household contact of the case in Newcastle announced on Thursday.
No new cases were detected on the central coast.
Ellie Dudley 11.14am: Unvaccinated NSW woman in 60s dies
NSW has recorded one new death associated with the latest outbreak in a woman in her 60s.
The woman was unvaccinated and caught the virus at Liverpool hospital. She is the second person to die after contracting the virus from the outbreak at the hospital in southwest Sydney.
“Can I personally extend my sympathies to her loved ones, it must be a very challenging time for them,” NSW chief health officer Kerry Chant said.
Her death marks the 22nd for the state, not including the 28 year old man who contracted Covid-19 before dying, but whose death is under investigation.
New daily cases in New South Wales
Ellie Dudley 11.10am: High risk LGA Year 12s won’t return to school
NSW premier Gladys Berejikilian confirmed year 12 students in the eight-high risk LGAs in southwest and west Sydney would not return for school on August 16 as planned.
Ms Berejiklian said schools in the areas would not return to face-to-face learning “for the foreseeable future” until later advised.
“It won’t be normal classes but certainly it will be a level of presence to ensure that no students are disadvantaged in terms of acquiring their qualifications,” she said.
“Trials will be done at home and at least it means that there is certainty and all students know they will qualify for the HSC.”
“Importantly, from Monday next week, Qudos Bank Arena, HSC students in those eight local government areas will be invited to get the Pfizer jab.”
However, students outside the high risk areas will commit to a “flexible model” for their HSC.
Ellie Dudley 11.06am: Cases increased most in Canterbury-Bankstown
NSW premier Gladys Berejiklian has flagged the Canterbury-Bankstown area as “the area where cases are increased the most.”
“All the suburbs and the Canterbury-Bankstown Mayor area really need to be on extra alert,” she said.
Ms Berejiklian said there would be “more police on the ground” due to people not complying with the health orders.
“We are seeing too many people frequent certain shopping areas and perhaps not doing the right thing, so police will be more present in the Canterbury-Bankstown local government area to ensure compliance and we have to make sure that happens,” she said.
Ellie Dudley 11.03am: Worst day yet with 291 cases in NSW
NSW has recorded 291 new locally-acquired cases of Covid-19 as infections in greater Sydney continue to spread.
At least 50 cases were active in the community for the entirety of their infectious period, which Premier Gladys Berejiklian said indicated “high case numbers” would continue for the “next few days.
Around 110,000 tests were conducted in the 24 hours to 8pm last night.
Rachel Baxendale 10.50am: Wangaratta mayor: Just one positive case in sewage
The mayor of Wangaratta says his understanding of Covid-19 detections in the town’s sewage differs from what Premier Daniel Andrews told Victorians on Thursday.
In justifying a statewide lockdown rather than a greater Melbourne one, Mr Andrews highlighted the recent detection of coronavirus fragments at a wastewater treatment facility in the town, 240km northeast of Melbourne, just off the Hume Highway.
“We have a sewerage test that has detected Covid-19 in the northeast, Wangaratta, a sewerage test has pinged, firstly positive, then it went negative, now it’s gone positive again,” Mr Andrews said on Thursday.
“We have some reason to believe there is COVID-19 in that community or has been in that community.”
On Friday, Wangaratta mayor Dean Rees told The Australian he understood there had been just one positive detection, followed by two negatives.
“The situation from our health authorities here out of North East Health is that we had a positive, then two negatives after that,” Mr Rees said.
“There seems to be a disconnection between what the Premier’s saying and what we’re being told at a local government level by our local authorities.”
Asked on Thursday how he could justify locking down communities as far from Wangaratta and Melbourne as Mildura and Mallacoota, Mr Andrews said Victoria had “tried limited lockdowns last year”.
“It didn’t work. I will leave you to judge whether targeted lockdowns in other parts of the country at the moment are working,” the Victorian Premier said in a veiled reference to NSW.
“You can make those judgments. I am following the advice of our experts, that is it is all in for seven days and if we all work really hard, we can get out of it.”
Anglica Snowden 10.35am: 15 arrested over Melbourne anti-lockdown protests
At least 15 people were arrested after wild anti-lockdown protests took place in the Melbourne CBD on Thursday night, Victoria police say.
Assistant commissioner Luke Cornelius slammed the behaviour of hundreds of people who set off flares and allegedly assaulted a police officer after the state was plunged into a sixth lockdown.
“(A police officer) was pushed over by protesters, and then allegedly kicked while he was on the ground,” assistant commissioner Cornelius said.
“Thankfully that member suffered only minor cuts and abrasions and he didn’t require medical attention,” he said.
“I have to say though, kicking a police officer while he is down is a dog act.”
A contingent of violent protesters have consistently hijacked the illegal gatherings to pursue their own “strange” agendas against police, assistant commissioner Cornelius said.
“The protestors we saw last night were similar in terms of the mix of people protesting the city weekend before last. There were concerned mums and dads and business owners who are very concerned about how the lockdowns are impacting their lives,” he said.
“But there is absolutely a hardcore element of people who see this as an opportunity to pick a fight with police.
“Our very particular beef is with his hardcore element of violent criminals who kick a police officer while he’s down, who assaulted police officers, who attack members of the mounted mounted branch behind their back.”
Victoria police are not aware of planned protests this weekend, but are prepared to deploy officers into the city again should they need to.
Ellie Dudley 10.30am: Western Sydney teen ‘took virus to Lake Macquarie’
An infected teenager who illegally travelled from western Sydney to Lake Macquarie allegedly spread the virus in the community.
As contact tracers continue to chase positive infections in the upper Hunter region, health officials identified a party at Blacksmiths Beach last Friday evening as the source of the northern outbreak.
It is understood the teenager attended the party and spread the virus to another person at the event who then travelled to school.
NSW’s chief health officer Kerry Chant on Thursday said the virus had been traced from the Lake Macquarie party back to western Sydney.
“We now think that the source extended from a gathering on Blacksmiths beach on Friday night,” Dr Chant said.
“We believe that there may have been people there from Greater Sydney and that’s how it was introduced. We believe there are linkages back to western Sydney.”

Charlie Peel 10.20am: Half of Queensland’s new cases are children
Half of Queensland’s new Covid-19 cases reported on Friday morning were children, increasing pressure on the state government to consider whether masks will become mandatory for school students.
About half of the 89 cases in the cluster linked to schools in Brisbane’s inner-west have been among children. The government is considering mandating masks for high school students and children in the older primary school grades.
Chief health officer Jeannette Young said masks had proved to be an effective measure in preventing the spread of the delta variant of the virus.
“These have made an enormous difference, they really and truly have,” Dr Young said.
“With Delta, we know that it is when people are breathing and interact in, and it can take only seconds for that transmission to happen.”
Dr Young said masks, testing, contact tracing and lockdowns had been key to the Queensland response to the outbreak.
“It’s those things that will keep us safe and enable us, hopefully, and I’d genuinely am hopeful that we will be able to lift this on Sunday, but if we don’t do all those things that will make it really difficult to lift Sunday,” she said.
Only two of the 10 new locally-acquired cases of Covid had spent any time in the community while infectious, but that was during the lockdown.
“That is all very reassuring but we’ve got to keep it up for the next few days, we are not there yet,” Dr Young said.
New daily cases in Queensland, from July 25, 2021
Charlie Peel 10.05am: Hopes of lockdown release as Qld records 10 new cases
Queensland has recorded 10 new cases of Covid-19 in the past 24 hours, boosting hope that the lockdown of 11 local government areas in the state will be lifted on Sunday.
All of the new cases were locally acquired and among household contacts linked to the cluster spreading through schools in Brisbane’s inner-west.
Deputy Premier Steven Miles said the result was “encouraging” but it was too early to know whether the lockdown would be lifted on schedule.
“We did 48,028 test samples in the last 24 hour period, which is also a very, very good result,” Mr Miles said.
“So across the metrics that we are monitoring most closely, the number of cases, the fact that they are linked, the number of infectious days in the community and testing levels, this is a very, very encouraging set of results for the 24-hour period.”
Rebecca Urban 9.55am: Back to classrooms for some Sydney Year 12s from Aug 16
Year 12 students in parts of Greater Sydney will be able to return to school campuses from August 16 under a new Covid-safe plan unvielled by the state government on Friday.
However, students living or learning in the eight local government areas of concern, including Blacktown, Campbelltown, Canterbury-Bankstown, Cumberland, Fairfield, Georges River, Liverpool and Parramatta, will be required to continue to learn remotely, with a return deemed too risky.
A flexible operating model for schools, announced by Education Minister Sarah Mitchell, will provide an the opportunity for HSC students to access their schools safely for essential classes, wellbeing support and check-ins during their final year.
School assessments and trial exams will be completed at home.
The plan, which comes amid fierce opposition from both the NSW Teachers Federation and the Independent Education Union, will enable individual schools to leverage their physical spaces and timetables to minimise mixing between students and support physical distancing and will only involve small groups of students at any one time.
Ms Mitchell said the government would continue to follow health advice while prioritising HSC students to access their schools for essential education and wellbeing support where this cannot be delivered online. “Education is essential, and we must provide our HSC students the opportunity to receive the curriculum and wellbeing support they need during the last few months of their schooling,” Ms Mitchell said.
“A comprehensive and flexible model will allow schools to provide HSC students essential lessons and check-ins with teachers sensibly and safely.”
The government also plans to pursue its plans to vaccinate Year 12 students.
Schools in the areas of concern will be asked to prepare for HSC students’ return in the coming weeks, allowing time for their vaccinations to be given and take effect.
Health Minister Brad Hazzard said vaccines were essential to our recovery.
“The vaccination hub for HSC students living or learning in the eight LGAs opens on Monday, and we strongly encourage every eligible student to take up the opportunity to protect themselves and their loved ones,” Mr Hazzard said.
Qudos Bank Arena will be available from 9 August as a vaccination hub for Year 12 students in the eight local government areas of concern.
The NSW Teachers Federation is meeting on Friday to discuss the plan and has not ruled out strike action.
Ellie Dudley 9.40am: Qld update 10am, NSW 11am
State health authorities across Australia will front the media this morning to provide updates on their respective Covid-19 outbreaks.
Queensland’s deputy premier Steven Miles will hold a press conference at 10am alongside the state’s health minister Yvetter D’Ath and chief health officer Jeannette Young.
Queensland recorded 16 new cases of Covid-19 on Thursday, all of which had been linked to schools in Brisbane’s inner west, and only three of the cases spent time in the community while infectious.
NSW Premier Gladys Berejiklian will provide an update at 11am, after the state recorded the worst day since the latest outbreak began.
The state recorded 262 new cases and five deaths on Thursday, in the worst day the state has seen since the beginning of the pandemic.
The Hunter and upper Hunter regions northwest of Sydney were also put into a seven day lockdown from 5pm Thursday after high levels of the virus and five cases were found in the area.
Victorian authorities are expected to provide their state’s update this morning, but are yet to set a time.
The southern state entered its sixth lockdown since the beginning of the pandemic on Thursday after eight new cases were detected in the community.

Ellie Dudley 9.21am: NRL won’t mandate Covid-19 vaccine for players
NRL players will not be subject to compulsory vaccinations, Australian Rugby League Commission chairman Peter V’landys says.
Asked whether he would mandate the vaccine for players, following the lead of fruit and vegetable processor SPC, Mr V’landys said the sport “certainly won’t be doing that.”
“Players have got freedoms and liberties and religious beliefs so it’s a bit had to have a blanket policy on everyone,” he told 2GB radio on Friday morning.
“Although, last year when we had the flu vaccination, 99 per cent of our players vaccinated voluntarily, only one per cent didn’t.
“The problem that players are going to have is travelling between states and into other countries if you don’t vaccinate. So that’s the concern, if I was a player that didn’t want to vaccinate.”
Rachel Baxendale 8.50am: Infected cleaner worked three days at medical centre
One of Victoria’s latest coronavirus cases is in a cleaner who worked for three days while likely infectious at the Epworth Medical Centre, adjacent to the Epworth Hospital in Richmond in Melbourne’s inner east.
The medical centre has confirmed the cleaner worked in consulting rooms on levels six and eight of the building after hours on Monday, Tuesday and Wednesday nights.
In a statement they said they had prepared for the possibility and had enacted their Covid plan.

Ellie Dudley 8.31am: Fraud charge after tradie fakes positive Covid test
A tradesman from the south coast of NSW has been charged with fraud after allegedly texting his boss to say he could not work in Newcastle because he had Covid-19.
The 23-year-old messaged his employer at 4.15am on Monday, and his co-workers were told to immediately get tested and isolate, police say.
Several venues near his place of employment were deep cleaned.
The man allegedly sent another message to his boss later that day to say his second test had returned a negative result.
Wollongong Police District Commander, Acting Superintendent Brad Ainsworth, said NSW Health had called the man to press for more information.
“As the term goes, they put the acid on him straight away to say their records don’t add up,” he told 2GB radio on Friday morning.
The man was arrested at Wollongong Police Station around 1pm yesterday and was charged with conveying false information that a person or property is in danger.
“He’ll have to front up and face the music,” Acting Superintendent Ainsworth said. “I believe, quite amazingly, his boss is quite understanding and potentially forgiving of him.”
The offence carries a maximum penalty of five years’ imprisonment, if found guilty.
He was granted bail and will face Wollongong Local Court on September 14.

Rachel Baxendale 8.29am: Six new cases in Victoria, all in community
Victoria has recorded six new coronavirus cases in the 24 hours to midnight on Thursday.
This includes two cases mentioned by authorities yesterday, bringing the total number of cases since new unlinked cases emerged on Wednesday to 12.
While all six new cases have been linked to previously reported cases, none were in quarantine while infectious.
Thursday’s cases included three cases who were in quarantine during their infectious period and linked to a traffic controller at the Moonee Valley racecourse testing centre who tested positive for the virus last week.
A further two cases on Thursday related to a teacher in her 20s who lives in Hobsons Bay in Melbourne’s inner southwest at works at Al-Taqwa College in Truganina in the outer west, and her partner who works as an optometrist in Caroline Springs and plays for Newport in the local AFL competition.
The two cases confirmed later on Thursday and included in Friday’s numbers relate to a household linked to the Hobson’s Bay couple, who live nearby in Altona North
Thursday’s final case — as yet unlinked to any others — is in a man who lives in Maribyrnong in Melbourne’s inner west, and works in a warehouse further out in Derrimut.
Details of Friday’s further four cases are expected to be confirmed at a press conference on Friday morning.
New daily cases in Victoria, from July 10, 2021
The latest outbreak follows short-lived celebrations on Wednesday after Victoria recorded zero locally-acquired infections for the first time since the state’s fifth lockdown last month.
Victoria had four locally-acquired cases on Tuesday, two on Monday, four on Sunday, two on Saturday, and an outbreak peak of 26 on Thursday July 22.
Victoria’s total number of community acquired cases since two incursions from NSW emerged almost four weeks ago is now 232.
There are currently 75 active cases, including up to three active cases acquired overseas.
At least 154 of those infected during the current outbreaks have recovered, and more are expected to do so in coming days.
As of Thursday, there were seven people in Victorian hospitals with coronavirus, including two in intensive care on ventilators.
The latest cases come after 29,631 tests were processed on Thursday, up slightly from 27,279 on Wednesday, but down from 30,117 on Tuesday.
There were 22,217 tests processed on Monday, 21,417 on Sunday, 25,779 on Saturday and 32,760 last Friday.
Victoria’s testing record is 59,355 tests on July 20.
Max Maddison 8.14am: ‘Compelling reason to leave’ needed: expat loophole closes
The Morrison government has barred expatriate Australian citizens from returning to the countries they call home without the need for permission, after a rule enabling people to leave the country without an exemption was quietly closed.
Until yesterday, Australians who were residents overseas had an automatic exemption to leave as they pleased, if they could provide documentation proving they lived abroad when the country’s international borders slammed shut.
But the federal government has moved to close the “loophole” on Thursday, meaning that a person now needs to demonstrate to the Australian Border Force Commissioner a “compelling reason for needing to leave Australian territory”.
An amendment to the Biosecurity Determination said the measures were designed to “reduce pressure on Australia’s quarantine capacity, reduce the risks posed to the Australian population from Covid-19, and assist in returning vulnerable Australians back home”.
“Since the commencement of the Overseas Travel Ban Determination in March 2020, those persons who fall into this category have had substantial time in which to take action under the exemption. The exemption was not intended to enable frequent travel between countries,” the explanatory statement said.

Rachel Baxendale 8.12am: Year 6 student tests positive at second Melbourne school
A coronavirus case has been detected at a second school in Melbourne’s southwest.
Heathdale Christian College has notified the school community overnight that a positive case has been confirmed in a Year Six student at its Werribee campus.
The case comes after a teacher at Al-Taqwa College in Truganina tested positive on Wednesday.
Both Heathdale campuses have closed until further notice, with classes cancelled on Friday.
“Due to cross-campus contact, anyone who was on either campus on Tuesday, Wednesday or Thursday this week must self-isolate and get tested for Covid-19,” the school said in a statement issued overnight.
“Students and teachers in Years Five and Six AND their households must continue to quarantine for 14 days even if they test negative and will be contacted by the public health unit or department.
“Further information will be emailed today.”
Ellie Dudley 7.46am: Passenger virus alerts over two Virgin flights to Melbourne
Passengers on two Virgin flights have been deemed close contacts by the Victorian health department as concerns over the state’s new clusters continue to grow.

Ellie Dudley 7.30am: Mayor blasts Gladys for taking vaccines from regions
Lake Macquarie Mayor Kate Fraser has blasted the NSW government for taking Pfizer doses away from the area to distribute to HSC students in Sydney.
The Lake Macquarie region has been plunged into a seven-day lockdown, along with seven other areas, after detections of the virus and new cases were located in neighbouring LGAs.
Ms Fraser said there was “a lot of frustration” when the vaccines were taken away from locals for year 12 students in southwest and west Sydney, which has been exacerbated by the latest restrictions.
“There was a lot of anger because I think we can’t afford to have people spend too much time trying to get an appointment for a vaccine and be told it has been cancelled at the last minute,” she told Channel 9’s Today.
“We lost 5500 vaccines and we need them now and we can see this morning that there are long queues for testing at our testing centres, so that is another issue we have up here as well.”
The other local government areas also under the same stay-at-home orders that apply to greater Sydney include Newcastle, Maitland, Port Stephens, Cessnock, Dungog, Singleton and Muswellbrook.

Ellie Dudley 7am: Why lock down entire state: Dutton asks Andrews
Defence Minister Peter Dutton has slammed the Victorian government for choosing to lock down the entire state over eight cases, saying premier Daniel Andrews should have left unaffected areas out of the new restrictions.
Mr Andrews announced Victoria’s lockdown would commence from 8pm last night, as contact tracers scramble to identify the source of two unlinked coronavirus clusters.
Regional Victoria and unaffected LGAs in Melbourne are included in the stay-at-home orders.
But Mr Dutton took issue with the decision to lock down the entire state, instead praising Queensland’s approach.
“I don’t agree with the whole of Victoria being locked down,” he told Channel 9’s Today.
“In Queensland they have taken the decision to go for a defined number of Local Government areas and that has worked effectively.
“That seems to be the approach as it’s refined over the course of the last 18 months to be a very good one.”

Ellie Dudley 6.30am: National wrap – millions of Aussies wake up in lockdown
Fifteen million Australians will wake up in lockdown on Friday, as the highly infectious Delta variant of Covid-19 continues to spread across the nation.
News came late Thursday that Victoria would enter its sixth lockdown since the beginning of the pandemic in order to get on top of a new outbreak in
The announcement came as Victoria recorded eight cases on Thursday as contact tracers scramble to identify the source of two unlinked coronavirus clusters.
The lockdown will last seven days and includes regional Victoria.
The regular five reasons to leave home will apply — getting the food and the supplies you need, exercising for up to two hours, care or caregiving, authorised work or education if you can’t do it from home, to get vaccinated at the nearest possible location.
Schools will be closed for face-to-face learning.
Victorians are waking up to their sixth lockdown just nine days after their fifth, amid concerns over two mystery Covid clusters. Under the restrictions, residents can only leave their homes for purposes which include essential work or shopping, exercise, and care or caregiving. Around 2,500 staff and students at Al-Taqwa College in Melbourne’s west are racing to get tested after a female teacher worked while infectious. This school was at the centre of a major outbreak during last year’s second wave. The teacher’s partner is now also infected, as well as two of his family members in another household. Victorian residents are due to have spent more than 190 days in lockdown since the pandemic began.
NSW recorded 262 new cases and five deaths on Thursday, in the worst day the state has seen since the beginning of the pandemic.
The Hunter and upper Hunter regions northwest of Sydney entered a seven day lockdown from 5pm Thursday after high levels of the virus and five cases were found in the area.
Two of the cases were students at Maitland Christian School which has since been closed for cleaning.
Meanwhile, Queensland recorded 16 new cases of Covid-19 on Thursday which had all been linked to the Indooroopilly cluster.
There were no new cases linked to the reef pilot who tested positive in Cairns earlier in the week.
Queensland’s chief health officer Jeannette Young says the results of the lockdown in the state’s southeast have surpassed her expectations, boosting hope that stay-at-home restrictions could be lifted on Sunday.
Only four of the state’s 16 new cases were infectious while in the community, down from 14 infectious community cases on Wednesday.

Daniel Sankey 5.10am: ‘Free Victoria’: Protesters storm Melbourne’s CBD
Hundreds of protesters chanting ‘no more lockdowns’ and ‘sack Dan Andrews’ have clashed with police in wild scenes in Melbourne’s CBD last night.
The protesters, many maskless, converged on Flinders Street station at 7pm, just an hour before the state went into its sixth lockdown over two new Covid-19 clusters.
They marched into Swanston Street and circled the CBD, some lighting flares as they walked.
A heavy police presence was called in to move on the protesters, with at least one arrest made.
One protester told The Herald Sun he was angered by Victoria’s sixth lockdown.
“We can’t keep going through this, we are losing our livelihoods,” the man from Melbourne’s southeast said.
Business owner James from Melbourne’s north said he had lost his livelihood.
“How can any business survive through this, I’ve lost everything.”
Hundreds of protesters have taken to the streets of Melbourne clashing with police over the states sixth lockdown. The protesters rallied in Melbourne's CBD chanting "free Victoria" – calling for the Premier to be sacked.

Rachel Baxendale 5am: Scramble to identify source of latest clusters
Victorian health authorities are investigating allegations of illegal gatherings and possible links to NSW hotel quarantine as they try to identify the source of two unlinked coronavirus clusters that have sparked the state’s sixth lockdown.
Six new Covid-19 cases were recorded in Victoria’s official numbers for Thursday, with another two confirmed during the course of the day.
Three of the cases were in quarantine during their infectious period and linked to a traffic controller at the Moonee Valley racecourse testing centre who tested positive for the virus last week.
Victoria will enter into a week-long lockdown from 8pm on Thursday, Premier Daniel Andrews has announced.
Another two are related to a teacher in her 20s who lives in Hobsons Bay in Melbourne’s inner southwest and works at Al-Taqwa College in Truganina in the outer west, and her partner who works as an optometrist in Caroline Springs and plays for Newport in the local Australian football competition. The two cases confirmed later on Thursday relate to a household linked to the Hobson’s Bay couple.
The final case – so far unlinked to others – is a man who lives in inner west Maribyrnong and works in a warehouse further out in Derrimut.
Asked whether the Hobsons Bay couple had caught the virus at an illegal party attended by the traffic controller, Premier Daniel Andrews said: “We are not certain of that.”
Covid logistics chief Jeroen Weimar said authorities were aware of a “story going around about allegations of illegal parties”.
As Victoria enters its sixth lockdown, Liberal MP Tim Smith says it will be "231 days" of lockdown by the end of it and he's not sure Melbourne's CBD can recover.

Geoff Chambers 4.45am: Delta variant’s pall draped over three states
Australia has suffered its worst day in dealing with the Covid-19 ­pandemic in a year, with NSW recording the nation’s highest number of deaths since last October, Victoria and Queensland gripped by mystery cases and the highly contagious Delta variant leaking across state borders.
More than 15 million people are under lockdown after Victoria joined NSW and Queensland by announcing a week of stay-at-home orders to ­suppress the ­expanding Delta outbreak.
The Victorian and Tasmanian governments held crisis meetings on Thursday after new Covid-19 cases emerged in the states, while NSW reported a record 262 daily infections and five deaths. Gladys Berejiklian extended Sydney’s lockdown to the Hunter and Upper Hunter regions to suppress transmissions.
The Australian’s Editor-at-Large Paul Kelly says the people of Australia are now “really being tested”.
Federal and state health officials are bracing for the situation to worsen in coming weeks.
With more than 20 per cent of eligible Australians fully vaccinated, the federal government will send additional Pfizer vaccines to NSW and bring forward jabs for Queensland in response to the Brisbane outbreak.
Tasmanian authorities were scrambling to “track and trace” the state’s first Covid-19 case in nine months, after an alleged law-breaking NSW resident brought the virus to Launceston.
The Tasmanian government cancelled Sunday’s Collingwood-Hawthorn AFL game, due to be held in Launceston, and shut its border to quarantine-free arrivals from Victoria for seven days. Further public health measures could be applied in coming days.
Sky News Political Editor Andrew Clennell says there was “something of a prediction” from the federal government there could be rolling short, sharp lockdowns until the end of the year when vaccination targets are reached.
Read the full story here.
Australian Industry Group CEO Innes Willox says many businesses in Victoria feel “betrayed” by the announcement of the state’s sixth lockdown. “Many feel betrayed by what’s going on here, doesn’t matter what amount of government support is provided," Mr Willox told Sky News Australia. "Doesn’t mean that businesses can open, doesn’t mean they can trade, it doesn’t give them any certainty going forward." He says there is a “great concern” there will be continued “on and off” lockdowns for at least the rest of the year. "And there’s still enormous uncertainty emanating from our political leaders around how we get out of this. “We’re in a pretty dark tunnel … and there’s not a lot of light at the end of it.”

Full text: Scott Morrison this week said reaching the 70 per cent threshold by the end of the year was ­“absolutely achievable” if “we all turn up to the task and we have a gold medal run till Christmas”.
Jarden chief economist Carlos Cacho said that the pace of vaccination would ramp up in October with the arrival of more Pfizer doses. With the pace of the rollout no longer limited by supply from that point, Mr Cacho then looked at the experience of other advanced economies to project when Australia might reach thresholds laid out by the ­Doherty Institute.
That epidemiological modelling identified a national vaccination rate of 70 per cent of the adult population (aged 16 and over) as the point at which the country could begin to manage Covid-19 outbreaks without ­resorting to lockdowns, or Phase B of the government’s transition plan. At 80 per cent, in Phase C, hardline health measures ­become even less likely and fully vaccinated Australians would be able to escape remaining ­restrictions.
Mr Cacho said he expected the national 70 per cent threshold to be achieved by November or December, and the 80 per cent threshold by January or February next year.
“While it is possible that the recent surge in vaccinations can be maintained and see Sydney reach the 70 per cent threshold by early to mid-September, we think a more likely outcome is some moderation after reaching 50-60 per cent and achieving the 70 per cent threshold in late September to early October, with lockdowns potentially remaining in place until then,” he said.
Deutsche Bank chief economist Phil Odonaghoe, who compared vaccination rollouts across eight OECD countries, said that “while vaccine supplies and strategies vary significantly across the group, a hopeful sign is that even the slowest in the group to reach the threshold, Hungary, did so on a timeline that could see Australia reach its (70 per cent) target in early November”.
“If Australia can match the ­average rollout speed of our group of eight, (Iceland, Chile, ­Israel, Canada, Spain, Belgium, the UK and Hungary) the first threshold could be reached on October 8,” he said.
Even at the current trajectory – and without any acceleration – seven in 10 Australians would be fully inoculated by December, Mr Odonaghoe said.
NAB economist Taylor ­Nugent said “a plausible acceleration in the rollout based on international experience suggests we could get to 70 per cent by late October and 80 per cent by mid-November”.

Covid has changed us culturally

Full text: The extraordinary importance and respect given to the vaccine modelling by the Doherty Institutue is justified, but also an indicator of the striking currents in our culture, revealed and accelerated by Covid.
Across the Western world, the public has for decades been losing faith in government and government institutions. This has resulted in a relentless quest for non-political institutional authority that governments can deploy in convincing the public.
I don’t mean necessarily convincing the public of the utility of particular policy measures but just convincing them of the broad contours of reality. In the first part of the Covid outbreak the chief medical officer of Australia, and his counterparts, the chief health officers in the states, had automatic credibility. They were sober folks, not playing in the ego and celebrity lanes that politicians occupy, and they knew what they were talking about.
But as the crisis wore on, their authority has eroded. This is mostly unfair. One of the central features of Covid is that no one, no one at all, can accurately predict what will happen. No one can guess with assurance how the virus will mutate, what other countries will do, how effective vaccines will be and for how long.
But the health officials’ loss of credibility is a bit their own fault, too. Innocent of the vices of celebrity but also its subtle temptations and countless traps, some of them became too smug and happy at their own status as players in the game of politics. The worst moment for them all, and in my view perhaps the most irresponsible statement by any senior official in the whole Covid saga, was when Queensland’s Jeannette Young, in a blatant slap at Scott Morrison, said young people “might die” if they had the AstraZeneca vaccine.
Non-political authority and credibility, in our vitriolic and hyper-partisan public culture, is an immensely valuable asset. Those who, for whatever reason, possess it are frankly fools if they throw it away needlessly. Once it’s lost, it’s very hard to recover.
At the same time, there have been irresponsible campaigns waged against health bureaucrats and officials simply because they are not infallible. On Covid, no one is infallible.
The Doherty Institute, partly because of the genuine high quality of its work, but also partly through happenstance, is almost uniquely fitted to hold and project public credibility. First, its work is genuinely world class.
Second, in this highly personalised media age, it is associated with a captivating individual, Peter Doherty. He is a Nobel prizewinner, which, translating broadly, makes him for the public roughly the equivalent of a 100m freestyle Olympic gold medallist who also broke a world record. On top of that, Doherty’s manner is that of a knockabout Aussie bloke. That’s the way we like our heroes.
The Doherty Institute guards its reputation. Its senior personnel, such as the estimable Jodie McVernon, will talk to the media to help educate them but will avoid topics on which Doherty is engaged in not yet finalised research, and will resolutely refuse to be political. That is a very smart discipline, much as we journalists love the maverick pontificator.
Once, the Christian churches, the judiciary, even the police all had non-political moral authority. But they have all been dimin­ished or politicised in different ways. Governments are often guilty in this. To take an overseas example, before the Brexit referendum the British government convinced the UK Treasury to predict that if Brexit won there would be an immediate, severe recession. Brexit duly won, but there was no recession. So Treasury advice was seen as politicised baloney and its credibility with the British people is diminished, probably forever.
Very often it’s advice given in the interests of what is seen as a moral cause that does the most damage. There are countless Australian examples. Many elements of the federal climate bureaucracy have for years and years been massively overstating what the Chinese government has done, or even undertaken, to combat climate change to convince Australians that we are laggards. But – and this distinction is crucial – it is one thing to be sensibly sceptical about exaggerated claims in politicised advice. It is another thing altogether to come to the nihilistic view that nothing any government agency says can ever be trusted. That is an extremely dangerous and profoundly mistaken view for a sizable minority of the community to adopt.
Thus one of the very worst cultural outcomes of Covid in Western societies is that elements of the paranoid right are becoming indistinguishable from elements of the nutty left in their disconnection from reality and their willingness to break the law and encourage violence in demonstrations. Covid should be uniting us as we face a common enemy in the virus, but it is dividing us instead. This happened 100 years ago in the Spanish flu as well.
It is said that no country handles adversity better than Australia, but no country handles good fortune as poorly. Overall, we have had, until this NSW outbreak, good fortune in this pandemic, by international stand­ards. Our Covid death rate has been among the world’s lowest and most of the time, except for the limits on international travel, we have led a relatively normal life.
But quite soon, notwithstanding the tremendous hope in vaccination, life will likely get harder, not easier. I have the greatest possible respect for the Doherty Institute, but all modelling is extremely fallible. The institute is doing good work to educate us to realise we need 70 per cent of eligible adults vaccinated and ongoing social distancing measures of considerable significance to keep Covid deaths at the level of a very bad flu season.
In truth, the evidence of Florida and Britain and numerous other much-vaccinated jurisdictions, while not directly comparable and involving somewhat lower vaccination rates than Doherty proposes, is not altogether encouraging. Moreover, the virus could mutate to become both more contagious and more deadly than Delta, just as Delta is more contagious and more deadly than previous strains. We could have the maximum practical vaccination rate of 70 or even 80 per cent, and still, quite plausibly, face thousands and thousands of Covid deaths and extreme stress on the health system. That’s not an argument for permanent lockdown. It is an argument for understanding there are no guarantees, the Covid future is intensely uncertain and at some point we will probably have to face up to a lot of Covid deaths compared with our run so far. That means there are big cultural adjustments ahead. I hope we’re up to it.

James Morrow: Australians still unclear of way forward in Covid battle

Full text: The dilemma was captured in two extraordinary spectacles this past week.
First, there was Prime Minister Scott Morrison standing out front of the Lodge last Friday night in full nation-building mode, setting what might generously be called ambitious vaccination targets of 70 and 80 per cent, with a road map to get us out of this endless rinse and repeat cycle of lockdowns.
This when Israel, which leads the world in jabbing its citizens, has barely cleared 62 per cent double dosed – and with a big head start too.
Then, Monday morning, it was Queensland Chief Health Officer Jeannette Young’s turn.
Coming across more dotty aunt who spends too much time on Facebook than respected medical official, and having recently plunged much of her state into a lockdown so draconian AFL players were forced from the field mid-play, Young pulled the handbrake on the PM’s moon shot vaccination program.
“I said I didn’t want 18-year-olds to have AstraZeneca and I still don’t,” she said Monday.
“Even now.”
Young would go on to soften her stance just a bit but, in the process, she revealed the biggest problem with the government’s road map.
Far beyond asking us to hit marks no other nation has been able to achieve, or being way too vague about dates or when we will stop letting health bureaucrats decide what “low-level restrictions” we still have to live with, the real problem is that it relies on the good will of states like Queensland, Victoria, and WA to stick with the program.
Hence the problem. Which is it going to be, Australia? In or out?
Obviously we cannot stay locked up forever. But it is a huge challenge for the Prime Minister, whose only really reliable ally in the push to re-open Australia is Gladys Berejiklian – and even they have been at loggerheads over just how Sydney’s present lockdown is going to end.
Given Treasury’s new quick-smart disaster relief payments scheme which takes the financial pressure off, and the fact that the PM’s election hopes ride on him coming through as “Mr 80%”, it’s not hard to imagine Labor premiers working to derail reopening just as they have done so much to derail national cabinet.
But in opening up the country again, psychology will play as much a part as politics.
Australia’s Covid experience has been different to most other nations. Because we have had barely any deaths compared to other nations since the start of the pandemic, we also now have far less tolerance for any deaths at all as we see the pandemic out.
Daily Telegraph – News Feed latest episode
And, despite all the businesses smashed and psyches wrecked and opportunities and time gone forever, there are plenty of people who for a variety of reasons like the lockdown life.
For many, particularly those in well-paid work-from-home jobs, restrictions have offered a sense of safety and security. For some, Covid has even become a sort of substitute religion, with health officers the new high priests and heretics who flout the rules are to be burned at the stake of social media.
Recall that WA’s Mark McGowan, who has proposed making a hard border with the rest of the country permanent, and Queensland’s Annastacia Palaszczuk, who said “in Queensland we have Queensland hospitals for our people”, romped it in at their respective elections.
Neither premier’s opponents dared to run on a platform of ending border restrictions, despite their well-reported absurdities and cruelties. Voters loved them and were just happy to be “kept safe”.
But nothing is forever and rapidly rising vaccination rates will quickly undermine Fortress Australia’s foundations.
As the number of Australians with both jabs approaches 50 per cent, calls will rise for more exemptions from border closures and other restrictions.
One good way to manage this would be to seek modelling on more than just the costs of lockdowns, as was presented to back up the Doherty Institute’s targets on Tuesday.
Putting the cost of minimising Covid against the cost of keeping international and domestic borders closed, personal uncertainty, mental health damage, lost classroom time, and so much else, would provide the evidence needed to lower targets, or reframe them again towards protecting the vulnerable.
After all, almost every death in the current Sydney outbreak has been among the elderly and unvaccinated.
More talk about how we deal with risk in a free society would also help.
For the last 18 months, the tension between saving lives and living life has always been resolved by coming down on the side of safety.
But that cannot go on forever, and if we begin to enshrine the “right” not to be infected with Covid as the starting point for all our thinking, we will trample a lot of other freedoms as well.

Covid rules ‘must stay’

Full text: COVID-19 containment measures will be needed to prevent 2000 deaths a year even once 80 per cent of the adult population is vaccinated, according to Australia’s plan to live with the virus.
The Doherty Institute’s modelling, used by the national cabinet to set its vaccination target to reopen the country, confirms snap lockdowns will be the best way to stop the Delta variant until 70 per cent of Australians over 16 have received both vaccinations.
Once that target is reached, crowd caps at major events and density limits in offices and hospitality venues will still be required – costing the economy $140m a week – and rapid testing, tracing, isolation and quarantine will need to be maintained.
The modelling says if Australia reaches 80 per cent vaccination coverage and these measures are properly implemented, the nation could live a Covid-normal life, with 1160 symptomatic cases over six months and just seven deaths.
But if these containment measures fail – even with four out of five adults vaccinated – the institute predicts Australia would be hit by 230,164 symptomatic infections over a six-month outbreak, with 7699 people admitted to hospital and 996 losing their lives.
Prime Minister Scott Morrison, who released the modelling on Tuesday, said Covid-19 would “never be eliminated” and “common sense precautions” would help Australia live with the virus.
“I have great faith in the Australian people to get this country vaccinated,” he said.
The Pfizer vaccine is expected to be made available to people in their 30s from early September, after the institute identified young adults as the main spreaders of the virus.
The vaccine is expected to be approved for children aged 12 to 15 within weeks, although the institute’s modelling indicated bringing it forward for them would not have a major effect on reducing transmission of the virus.
Professor Jodie McVernon, from the institute, said immunising young adults was critical.
“They will bring Covid home to their children, they will take it home to their own parents, and this is the group now where we’re proposing the reorientation of the strategy,” she said.
Under the plan, Australians aged 16 to 29 will get their shots from early October.
One in five Australians over 16 is already fully vaccinated, and with one million doses now administered every six days, the government is confident the 70 per cent target will be reached by Christmas.
Health Minister Greg Hunt said the latest research showed 79 per cent intended to be fully vaccinated by then.
The Doherty report urged a “precautionary approach” on setting a national vaccine target, given Australia’s ability to slow transmission of the virus varied across the regions, depending on the effectiveness of health responses and whether people followed ongoing restrictions.
It said further work was needed on localised vaccine targets and restrictions. Mr Morrison said the baseline restrictions suggested by the institute’s model were not prescriptive and would be debated by the national cabinet.
Treasury modelling found that at a vaccination rate of 50 per cent, the lowest cost strategy to control the virus was strict lockdowns accompanied by ongoing baseline restrictions, which would cost $570m a week.
Low-level restrictions required at a 70 per cent rate would cost $200m a week, or $140m a week to manage the virus with vaccination rates higher than 80 per cent.
Chief medical officer Professor Paul Kelly said the country would need to shift out of the suppression phase once the vaccine rollout moved ahead.
“We do need to accept that there will be cases. We need to accept that there will be hospitalisations, there will be ICU admissions and there will be deaths,” he said.
The institute’s analysis also strongly backed the Melbourne-made AstraZeneca vacc­ine, finding it was 86 per cent effective at reducing hospital admissions and 90 per cent effective at preventing deaths – virtually the same as the Pfizer vaccine.
After Labor proposed a $300 payment to everyone vaccinated before December 1, Mr Morrison said that was a “vote of no confidence” in Australians. “This is a serious public health crisis, it is not a game show,” he said.

LIVING WITH COVID-19 In a six-month nationwide Covid-19 outbreak, this is how the Doherty Institute expects the virus will spread, based on different levels of vaccination coverage.
LIKELIHOOD OF LOCKDOWNS If tracing, testing, isolation and quarantine measures are working at an optimal level, the nation would need to be in lockdown 35 per cent of the time if only half the adult population is fully vaccinated. The likelihood of lockdowns becomes zero once more than 70 per cent are vaccinated.
IF CONTAINMENT MEASURES ARE STRUGGLING This forecast assumes tracking, tracing, isolation and quarantine measures are only partially effective as the virus spreads. With 25,756 hospital ward beds and 1964 ICU beds available nationwide, hospitals would be overrun by Covid-19 patients, causing chaos for patients with other health problems.
VACCINE COVERAGE 50% 60% 70% 80% Symptomatic infections 1,124,136 703,688 309,362 230,164 Ward admissions 49,242 27,542 13,698 7,699 ICU admissions* 11,844 6,296 2,966 1,628 Deaths 10,443 4,702 1,908 996
IF CONTAINMENT MEASURES ARE WORKING This forecast assumes tracking, tracing, isolation and quarantine measures are performing at an optimal level as the virus spreads. The hospital system would have the capacity to keep up with Covid-19 cases.
VACCINE COVERAGE 50% 60% 70% 80% Symptomatic infections 113,553 6,551 2,762 1,160 Ward admissions 4,132 227 96 40 ICU admissions* 953 52 22 9 Deaths 726 39 17 7
BASELINE RESTRICTIONS These scenarios assume these health rules are maintained: ■ 2sqm density rule in hospitality venues ■ 1.5sqm density rule in offices ■ Crowd caps on major events ■ Schools and childcare open as normal ■ Interstate travel allowed without border closures ■ No stay-at-home orders

Full text: A revised vaccine strategy will fast-track jabs for adults under 40, considered the “peak transmitters” of the Delta strain, while nearly halving coronavirus deaths and hospitalisations under a 70 per cent inoculation target.
New health modelling guiding Australia’s post-pandemic recovery shows the retention of high-level testing, tracing and quarantine measures is critical to improving national health outcomes, while Treasury analysis shows that achievement of higher vaccination rates can reduce the cost of lockdowns by more than $400m a week.
After unveiling the vaccine thresholds needed to guide Australia through national cabinet’s four-phase reopening plan, the Prime Minister said on Tuesday new Doherty Institute modelling showed that deaths, hospitalisations and infection rates would be on par with the flu once Australia achieved a vaccination rate of 80 per cent.
The Doherty report, which recommends low-level social restrictions throughout the four-step reopening plan, found “rapid epidemic growth is expected at 50 and 60 per cent vaccine coverage” before transmission substantially reduces by the 70 and 80 per cent targets.
Mr Morrison said the focus of governments and health officials would shift when Australia moved out of the current suppression phase, with the second and third stages of the national cabinet strategy envisaging a “change in what we’re managing”.
“The plan shifts in phase B, and further in phase C, where our focus is on managing hospitalisations, serious illness, and of course avoiding those fatalities,” Mr Morrison said.
“Those outbreak scenarios which Doherty modelled indicate that when you get to that 80 per cent (target) … then you are dealing with a scenario that is not unlike living with an infectious disease like the flu.” Doherty Institute director of epidemiology Jodie McVernon said the modelling showed that, if some social measures were kept in place and public health capacity was maintained, Australia could reduce adverse outcomes 100-fold. In the first 180 days of a breakout with 70 per cent of the population vaccinated, only 16 people would die if effective tracing, testing and quarantine arrangements were in place. However, this would rise to nearly 2000 deaths if ineffective arrangements were in place.
Professor McVernon said mask wearing was not included in the Doherty Institute’s analysis of ongoing Covid-19 restrictions, which focused on social-­distancing measures.
“The types of restrictions that we’ve described and consider in terms of the transmission potential are really around something where there are no stay-at-home orders, there are some social-­distancing rules and the two-square-metre rule,” Professor McVernon said.
“There’ll be caps on numbers of people in stadiums and workplaces and things like that. “ Lieutenant-General John Frewen, commander of the national vaccine rollout, said on Tuesday he had developed a plan to get younger cohorts vaccinated sooner with Australians aged 30-39 brought forward to this month and the 16-29 age group from October.
“That is absolutely able to be accommodated within the campaign plan and we’re looking to bring on 30 to 39s, which is the next-highest priority as one of the key transmissibility groups from the end of this month, start of September,” he said.
Mr Morrison said the shift to vaccinate all adults had progressed from an initial focus on inoculating the “most vulnerable in the community”, with the modelling showing deaths and hospitalisations would be nearly halved under a strategy to vaccinate all adults as opposed to focusing on the oldest Australians first.
Modelling of the “all adults” vaccination strategy shows that 3084 people would be admitted to intensive care and 1984 people would die in the first 180 days of a major breakout, assuming a 70 per cent vaccination rate and only basic restrictions and tracing capabilities.
However, in the same scenario focusing on vaccinating the oldest citizens first, there would be 5002 ICU admissions and 3563 people would die.
Professor McVernon said the data showed it was imperative to encourage Australians aged 20 to 39 to get vaccinated. “This is the group now where we’re proposing the reorientation of the strategy,” she said.
Treasury also released updated forecasts on Tuesday, based on the Doherty Institute vaccine scenarios, which outlined the impacts of Covid-19 restrictions and different levels of vaccine coverage on economic growth.
Josh Frydenberg said that if stage four restrictions, similar to those imposed in Victoria last year, were enforced across the country, the hit to GDP would be $3.2bn a week. Under stage three restrictions, the cost would be $2.35bn a week. The Treasurer said the ongoing cost of managing Covid-19, based on four scenarios between 50 and 80 per cent vaccine coverage, would range between $140m a week under stage three of the reopening plan and $570m a week if only half of eligible Australians were fully vaccinated.
“These numbers underline the imperative of Australians getting vaccinated,” Mr Frydenberg said.
“It is the way out of this crisis and it is the way to avoid in the future longer, more severe lockdowns. The second key finding or outcome from the economic analysis is that the economic cost comes down significantly, if governments work quickly to get on top of the virus. Early interventions, short, sharp lockdowns are the most cost effective way to handle the virus.
“What Treasury has found is that, at 50 and 60 per cent vaccination rates, it’s five times more costly should governments not move early to get on top of the virus. And that’s the short, sharp lockdowns that we’re now seeing in Queensland, that we’ve seen in Victoria and that was seen in South Australia.” In relation to transmission, the Doherty Institute report said the focus should be on vaccinating the 20 to 39 age group rather than on children. “Expanding the vaccine program to the 12-15 year age group has minimal impact on transmission and clinical outcomes for any achieved level of vaccine uptake,” it said.
Pressed on NSW Premier Gladys Berejiklian’s ambition to increase the state’s vaccine coverage to 50 per cent before considering an end to the Greater Sydney lockdown, Mr Morrison said the Doherty research showed that “short, sharp” lockdowns were required. “In terms of breaking out of a lockdown, that is a different set of factors,” he said. “There is no doubt that, as vaccination rates rise, that tempers the ability of the virus to spread.” Chief medical officer Paul Kelly said the existing strategy of “suppression with no community transmission” was designed to avoid severe illness and minimise pressure on hospitals.

Full text: COVID-19 containment measures will be needed to prevent 2000 deaths a year even once 80 per cent of the adult population is vaccinated, according to Australia’s plan to live with the virus.
The Doherty Institute’s modelling, used by the national cabinet to set its vaccination target to reopen the country, confirms snap lockdowns will be the best way to stop the Delta variant until 70 per cent of Australians over 16 have received both vaccinations.
Once that target is reached, crowd caps at major events and density limits in offices and hospitality venues will still be required – costing the economy $140m a week – and rapid testing, tracing, isolation and quarantine will need to be maintained.
The modelling says if Australia reaches 80 per cent vaccination coverage and these measures are properly implemented, the nation could live a Covid-normal life, with 1160 symptomatic cases over six months and just seven deaths.
But if these containment measures fail – even with four out of five adults vaccinated – the institute predicts Australia would be hit by 230,164 symptomatic infections over a six-month outbreak, with 7699 people admitted to hospital and 996 losing their lives.
Prime Minister Scott Morrison, who released the modelling on Tuesday, said Covid-19 would “never be eliminated” and “common sense precautions” would help Australia live with the virus.
“I have great faith in the Australian people to get this country vaccinated,” he said.
The Pfizer vaccine is expected to be made available to people in their 30s from early September, after the institute identified young adults as the main spreaders of the virus.
The vaccine is expected to be approved for children aged 12 to 15 within weeks, although the institute’s modelling indicated bringing it forward for them would not have a major effect on reducing transmission of the virus.
Professor Jodie McVernon, from the institute, said immunising young adults was critical.
“They will bring Covid home to their children, they will take it home to their own parents, and this is the group now where we’re proposing the reorientation of the strategy,” she said.
Under the plan, Australians aged 16 to 29 will get their shots from early October.
One in five Australians over 16 is already fully vaccinated, and with one million doses now administered every six days, the government is confident the 70 per cent target will be reached by Christmas.
Health Minister Greg Hunt said the latest research showed 79 per cent intended to be fully vaccinated by then.
The Doherty report urged a “precautionary approach” on setting a national vaccine target, given Australia’s ability to slow transmission of the virus varied across the regions, depending on the effectiveness of health responses and whether people followed ongoing restrictions.
It said further work was needed on localised vaccine targets and restrictions. Mr Morrison said the baseline restrictions suggested by the institute’s model were not prescriptive and would be debated by the national cabinet.
Treasury modelling found that at a vaccination rate of 50 per cent, the lowest cost strategy to control the virus was strict lockdowns accompanied by ongoing baseline restrictions, which would cost $570m a week.
Low-level restrictions required at a 70 per cent rate would cost $200m a week, or $140m a week to manage the virus with vaccination rates higher than 80 per cent.
Chief medical officer Professor Paul Kelly said the country would need to shift out of the suppression phase once the vaccine rollout moved ahead.
“We do need to accept that there will be cases. We need to accept that there will be hospitalisations, there will be ICU admissions and there will be deaths,” he said.
The institute’s analysis also strongly backed the Melbourne-made AstraZeneca vacc­ine, finding it was 86 per cent effective at reducing hospital admissions and 90 per cent effective at preventing deaths – virtually the same as the Pfizer vaccine.
After Labor proposed a $300 payment to everyone vaccinated before December 1, Mr Morrison said that was a “vote of no confidence” in Australians. “This is a serious public health crisis, it is not a game show,” he said.
RITA PANAHI, PAGE 17
LIVING WITH COVID-19 In a six-month nationwide Covid-19 outbreak, this is how the Doherty Institute expects the virus will spread, based on different levels of vaccination coverage.
LIKELIHOOD OF LOCKDOWNS If tracing, testing, isolation and quarantine measures are working at an optimal level, the nation would need to be in lockdown 35 per cent of the time if only half the adult population is fully vaccinated. The likelihood of lockdowns becomes zero once more than 70 per cent are vaccinated.
IF CONTAINMENT MEASURES ARE STRUGGLING This forecast assumes tracking, tracing, isolation and quarantine measures are only partially effective as the virus spreads. With 25,756 hospital ward beds and 1964 ICU beds available nationwide, hospitals would be overrun by Covid-19 patients, causing chaos for patients with other health problems.
VACCINE COVERAGE 50% 60% 70% 80% Symptomatic infections 1,124,136 703,688 309,362 230,164 Ward admissions 49,242 27,542 13,698 7,699 ICU admissions* 11,844 6,296 2,966 1,628 Deaths 10,443 4,702 1,908 996
IF CONTAINMENT MEASURES ARE WORKING This forecast assumes tracking, tracing, isolation and quarantine measures are performing at an optimal level as the virus spreads. The hospital system would have the capacity to keep up with Covid-19 cases.
VACCINE COVERAGE 50% 60% 70% 80% Symptomatic infections 113,553 6,551 2,762 1,160 Ward admissions 4,132 227 96 40 ICU admissions* 953 52 22 9 Deaths 726 39 17 7
BASELINE RESTRICTIONS These scenarios assume these health rules are maintained: ■ 2sqm density rule in hospitality venues ■ 1.5sqm density rule in offices ■ Crowd caps on major events ■ Schools and childcare open as normal ■ Interstate travel allowed without border closures ■ No stay-at-home orders

Full text: AstraZeneca v Pfizer - Doherty
Protection rates among older Australians are edging up. About 80 per cent of people over 70 have had one jab, more than 40 per cent are fully vaccinated. The comparative figures for ages 16 and older are just under half those levels. In view of the NSW and Queensland lockdowns, and the easy spread of Delta, we need to catch up urgently. And we are. More than 200,000 people were vaccinated in the 24 hours to Tuesday afternoon. Australians, who traditionally are strong supporters of childhood immunisation, appear to be rolling up their sleeves, despite initial supply problems with the vaccines and some mixed messaging.
A new lightning response vaccination unit to step up vaccines in areas suffering infection outbreaks promises to be an effective part of the Morrison government’s battle plan. The new National Response Option will be dispersed nationally and be on call to move quickly to support states and territories by providing between 2000 and 3000 additional vaccinations daily across two weeks. It will include about 50 clinical staff as well as support staff. Such a practical initiative should help get vaccine numbers up during outbreaks when citizens become deeply concerned about the virus. It makes eminently more sense than Anthony Albanese’s proposal to pay out $300 in public money to every Australian, regardless of their means, who gets vaccinated by December 1. Such a $6bn cash splash would set a bad precedent for future vaccine campaigns. It also reveals a tawdry disregard on the part of the opposition in terms of what motivates Australians and for common sense. The “bubble without a thought”, as the Prime Minister described it, put the opposition on the back foot during question time on Tuesday. Some countries are dallying with the idea of financial inducements to maintain vaccine momentum. But protecting their health, and that of their families, is the incentive that motivates most people to be vaccinated. So does the prospect of resuming life as it was until 18 months ago, especially freedom of movement, in Australia and overseas. Bonus frequent-flyer points and discounts could be handy sweeteners if businesses want to provide them.
While the nation’s path to protecting itself against Covid is becoming clearer, many Queenslanders are frustrated and anxious, feeling stranded in a different bubble.
Vaccination rates by SA4
On Monday, as the outbreak in Queensland’s southeast worsened, chief health officer Jeannette Young repeated her comments discouraging young people from having the AstraZeneca ­vaccine. “I said I didn’t want 18-year-olds to have AstraZeneca and I still don’t,” Dr Young said. Epidemiologists and federal officials repudiated her comments, which were at odds with official advice from the Australian Technical Advisory Group on Immunisation. ATAGI recommends all adults in hotspots should “strongly consider” speaking to their doctor about being vaccinated. Deputy chief medical officer Michael Kidd said the southeast Queensland outbreak, which has put 11 local government areas under lockdown, met the threshold to be considered significant. University of Queensland ­infectious diseases expert Paul Griffin said authorities needed to be careful to avoid increasing vaccine hesitancy. On Tuesday, Dr Young shifted her rhetoric slightly. She said she believed the state was “on the verge of a large outbreak” and conceded “now is the time” people under 60 should consider talking to their GPs about having AstraZeneca.
With 10 of 16 new Delta cases revealed on Tuesday occurring in primary and secondary students, including five children under 10, the Brisbane outbreak poses new challenges. As it unfolds, epidemiologists are looking at the possibility of new advice on masks and vaccine guidelines. As the world has seen before, the virus has a track record of producing unexpected, nasty surprises.

South Australians stranded in NSW struggle to return; 40 per cent of SA adults have first vaccine

Full text: In the first day of new SA restrictions after the statewide lockdown ended, more than 1700 people are stuck in NSW due to hard border closures.
SA Health has approved 200 permits to travel over the border as it drafted in staff from across the agency.
The state government is investigating a repatriation plan for stranded residents but no details have been released.
Current restrictions, authorised by Police Commissioner Grant Stevens, ban travel for SA residents in NSW except those in a cross-border corridor, essential workers and some permitted arrivals.
They must get SA Health travel exemptions.
The corridor is limited to Broken Hill and SA communities such as Manna Hill, Olary, Tikalina and Cockburn.
New directions, which Mr Stevens as state co-ordinator approved from 12.01am Thursday, also banned people who completed 14 days of quarantine in NSW without an SA Health exemption.
Restrictions were placed on federal MPs and staff.
Those who visited the ACT in the past 14 days must self-quarantine for 14 days and Covid test on days 1, 5 and 13.
Commonwealth MPs or staff who visited NSW in the past fortnight must also isolate but may be ordered into a medi-hotel. They must also be tested. The rules apply to transit through Sydney Airport.
Transit through Brisbane or Melbourne airports is allowed.
The rules were enforced on Wednesday night after NSW Premier Gladys Berejiklian announced a four-week extension to the greater Sydney lockdown in a desperate attempt to control its escalating virus crisis.
Its five-week lockdown hit a grim new record of 177 cases on Wednesday, 46 of whom were infectious in the community.
Fleurieu Peninsula resident Kathryn Pentecost said she was “devastated and hopeless”.
Dr Pentecost, 64, of Delamere, travelled to NSW on June 24 for work and family reasons – a day before the Sydney lockdown – and is staying with a friend in the Blue Mountains. She said her efforts to apply for an exemption had been in vain, adding she felt “completely abandoned”.
“It’s really that uncertainty of feeling like you’re a forgotten human,” she said.
“The longer I’m in NSW, the longer I’m at risk.”
The mother of another stranded Sydney woman, who declined to be named due to her sensitive job, accused authorities of being heartless.
She said her daughter was a returning resident, travelling for work, was fully vaccinated and could isolate but had no family support in Sydney.
“It appears when you are fully vaccinated it doesn’t necessarily put you at any particular advantage other than you probably won’t die from Covid,” she said.
The state’s Covid-19 transition committee will on Thursday review NSW and Victorian border rules, a raft of new restrictions – including mask use – and health advice about the Modbury cluster of 19 cases.
Chief public health officer Nicola Spurrier reported a second day of zero cases linked to the outbreak as more than 5000 people remain in quarantine. Some of the almost 80 exposure sites have been downgraded or removed.
Prof Spurrier said she was “concerned” for those stranded but said decisions were based on risk, location and request, prioritising critical health or end-of-life situations.
“We’re really looking at this in terms of humanitarian risks and making sure that we deal with everybody,” she said.
Asked if she should apologise, she replied: “You know this whole problem has been caused by a virus, I don’t think it’s really for me to apologise. Everybody is trying to do the right thing. I’ve got a certain responsibility.”
An SA Health spokeswoman said travel exemptions were considered individually, based on local epidemiology and community transmission data.
“At this stage the vaccination status of an individual is not included in the criteria used to consider cross-border exemptions,” she said.
Premier Steven Marshall said authorities mitigated risk.
“Some of the stories are heartbreaking and I acknowledge that,” he said. Mr Stevens has boosted quarantine checks.
COVID-19 Stats - Horizontal with Lazy Load

Race is on to get jab done Almost 40 per cent of South Australia’s 1.4 million adults have received their first dose of Covid-19 vaccine, which is among the nation’s best rates, official new figures show.
But fewer than a fifth are fully protected with two jabs.
Commonwealth Health Department figures show SA’s rate of 39.84 per cent of the adult population having a first dose is the second highest of mainland states.
Victoria’s is 40.89 per cent while Tasmania is highest at 47 per cent, ahead of the ACT on 46 per cent.
SA’s second-dose rate of 17.63 per cent ranks middle of all states, with Queensland and Western Australia lower.
SA ranks among the worst for protecting people older than 70, despite more than three quarters having a first jab.
Vaccine doses rollout across age groups
More than a quarter of SA adults in their 40s are fully vaccinated, which is among the nation’s best rates for that age group, according to the federal breakdown published nationally for the first time.
Only a small percentage of those aged under 40 have been vaccinated due to not being eligible in metropolitan areas.
Separate state government figures show a 15 per cent surge in vaccine doses during the lockdown – 79,609 were administered, compared with 69,143 jabs the previous week.
Chief public health officer Nicola Spurrier said the key to preventing outbreaks was having people aged between 16 and 40 – especially those younger than 30 – jabbed.
Only those in this age bracket living in regional SA can access a Pfizer vaccine.
Prof Spurrier said SA’s rollout was restricted by commonwealth supply constraints.
“Our team is going to be ready to get everybody vaccinated as soon as possible, once we have more vaccines,” she said.
“I will really be celebrating the day that we can open up … to every adult.”
Latest supply details were unavailable.
Premier Steven Marshall said being vaccinated was “our doorway out of the pandemic”.
“It is fantastic to see South Australians continue to embrace the vaccine and roll up their sleeves when it is their turn,” he said.
A new priority Pfizer vaccine clinic for residential aged-care staff will open at Enfield on Thursday. Another will open at Fullarton on Monday that will also jab disability care workers.
Labor is urging the state government to better promote the vaccine rollout.
Opposition Leader Peter Malinauskas said a series of ideas to boost rates, released on Thursday, included diverting advertising money. An official $1.195m infrastructure campaign was better spent highlighting jab benefits, he said.
“We’ve been right to be going hard and … early with lockdowns but we’re wrong to be going slow and late on the vaccination rollout,” he said.
Prime Minister Scott Morrison suggested Australians could largely be free of Covid-19 restrictions by Christmas if vaccine targets were reached.
He said lockdowns would likely “become a thing of the past” by the end of the year.
Mr Morrison said Australia had supply, distribution, pharmacists, GPs and local clinics to provide every person older than 16 a jab this year.
“We make a gold-medal run all the way to the end of this year,” he said. SA Health wants at least 80 per cent of local adults vaccinated by October.
“Lockdowns become a thing of the past when you’re at that level,” said Mr Morrison, who last week apologised for the sluggish rollout.
Doherty Institute modelling will help develop benchmarks on when restrictions could ease based on vaccination rates.
The modelling will be presented to national cabinet on Friday.

Getting the lockdown low-down

Publication info: Sunday Age ; Melbourne, Vic. [Melbourne, Vic]. 25 July 2021: 18.

Full text: Restricting freedom of movement comes with huge costs but scientists believe locking down will remain an essential weapon in our pandemic armoury, reports Liam Mannix.
At first it seemed like madness, a storyline out of a dystopian film. In Wuhan, a city of millions, only a couple of days before Chinese New Year, the streets were empty. People were confined to their houses. Masks became mandatory.
At the time it seemed like it couldn't happen here. Yet without a vaccine or effective treatments, that was the only tool China had to control the spread of COVID-19. And as the virus spread, so did the lockdowns.
COVID-19 is passed on when humans do what humans do: interact, face to face. Lockdowns ask us to fight the virus by quelling our basic instinct.
"That's why the virus is so effective, because it exploits our very humanness. Lockdowns ask us to be very anti who we naturally are," says Dr Jason Thompson of the University of Melbourne, who worked on the Victorian government's epidemic modelling.
Make no mistake, lockdowns come with enormous costs: damage to the economy, damage to mental health, damage to individual liberties.
Which makes it important to ask: do they actually work? Are there alternatives?
Do lockdowns work?
This seems like a straightforward question. It's not.
The problem is in the framing - work to do what? What works for some people won't work for others. Some prioritise the protection of life, others mental health, still others freedom or the economy. It might sound cold, but governments every day must weigh up the value of the lives of their citizens - for example, when deciding which drugs and medical treatments to subsidise.
"There are areas where trying to weigh human life is repugnant," Dr Hugh Breakey, a moral philosopher based at Griffith University, told The Age last year. "Lockdowns don't fall into that easy case."
Let's focus on one goal, the one governments cite when they send us into lockdowns: stopping the virus spread. Do lockdowns stop the spread? National and international evidence suggests they do.
"Lockdowns appear to be very effective - in Australia and all around the world," says Dr Nick Scott, head of modelling and biostatistics at the Burnet Institute. This is particularly the case when compared to not locking down.
And University of Sydney COVID-19 modeller Professor Mikhail Prokopenko says: "I think it's important to tell people that the restrictions that we all have been enduring have saved nearly 50,000 lives, in comparison to similar countries like the UK or US. Feel free to quote me on that."
Three studies in leading scientific journals Nature, Science, and Nature Communications all conclude measures associated with lockdowns, such as closing businesses and banning people from gathering, do work to cut the spread of the virus. This shouldn't be a surprise.
"[Lockdowns] stop movement. If you stop humans contacting humans, that transmission slows," says Professor Caroline Miller, director of the Health Policy Centre at the South Australian Health and Medical Research Institute.
But do lockdowns save lives?
"Please know every individual effort you made today and everything you'll do tomorrow and every day will save lives," Victoria's Premier Daniel Andrews said as the state headed back into lockdown in June.
Is this true? A lockdown that stops a virus while leading to a large number of non-virus deaths - say, from suicide - is a failure on that metric. So could it be the cure becomes worse than the disease?
The data shows Australia and New Zealand experienced no excess mortality in 2020. To put that another way: we experienced a pandemic that has killed almost 4.1 million people, and Australia saw no appreciable rise in deaths. South Korea, Taiwan, and Thailand - all lockdown countries - also experienced few to no extra deaths.
Brazil, Sweden, Russia and parts of the US, which largely eschewed lockdown measures, had large numbers of deaths.
Some countries that locked down and managed to avoid a major outbreak reduced their total number of deaths from all causes. Fewer people died than an average non-COVID year, mostly because flu deaths were cut out.
"The best current evidence suggests lockdowns cut deaths from non-COVID causes. Suicide deaths and accidental deaths stay the same or go down in most cases," says University of Wollongong epidemiologist Gideon Meyerowitz-Katz.
OK, but what about all the harms caused by lockdowns?
Overall, psychological distress increased during Australia's lockdowns; Victoria's mental health worsened more than other states, with rises in distress, loneliness and a fall in life satisfaction. However, there has been no increase seen in suicides, and as Victoria's restrictions eased mental health improved.
There are other harms. People missed medical appointments, scans and checkups. In a report from September 2020, conservative think tank the Institute of Public Affairs claimed lockdowns destroy "the dignity of work". Indeed, Victoria's unemployment rate jumped above 7 per cent in the middle of 2020's lockdown. The already disadvantaged bear the brunt of lockdown the hardest; and people aged between 20 and 29 both carry the brunt of infections and the brunt of unemployment caused by lockdowns, despite having a much lower chance of dying from the virus compared to older people.
Government debt will dramatically increase, with some worrying future generations will have to pay that back (not all economists share that concern).
But Victoria's economy appears to have recovered at a dramatic pace. Unemployment has now fallen below 4.5 per cent, one of the lowest marks in a decade.
The other question about harms is this: how much of this is caused by lockdowns and how much by the pandemic itself? That is hard to disentangle. Mental health in Melbourne during last year's second wave worsened, but were people struggling with the lockdown or with the thousands of COVID-19 cases and hundreds of deaths? Were they avoiding medical appointments because of lockdown, or because they were worried about heading to a crowded hospital with a COVID ward?
A clever bit of research suggests the pandemic itself does play a big role. Two economists analysed mobility in border zones in the US, comparing states that had a lockdown against adjacent states that did not. People on either sides of the borders behaved almost the same, suggesting it is fear of the virus, not government orders to stay home, that most affects behaviours.
What about Delta? Does that change the game?
Early evidence suggests Delta significantly undermines how well our lockdowns work. If our goal remains the same - stopping circulation of the virus and therefore saving lives - we may need to lock down harder than before.
Delta is about 60 per cent more infectious than the Alpha variant, which was perhaps 50 per cent more contagious than the version of the virus that first emerged in Wuhan. The more infectious the virus, the harder it is to control.
We can see this in federal government modelling. On average, an outbreak in Sydney at the moment of the original strain would have an effective reproduction number - how many people each infected person infects - of 0.91. That would quickly bring the outbreak to a stop. With Delta, that number is 1.7, which means the outbreak will continue to grow. "Delta has completely changed it, totally changed it," says Professor George Milne of the University of WA, who is providing official COVID-19 modelling to the WA and Queensland governments.
Milne is so worried about Delta he is working on modelling what he terms "stage 5" lockdown measures, more draconian than any introduced so far, in which large numbers of people may be banned from leaving home altogether. "Nobody goes out the door."
More worrying are what his models say about Sydney's current outbreak: current lockdown measures simply will not be enough to bring case numbers down to zero.
That troubling claim is supported both by federal government modelling and the work of an independent modelling group led by Prokopenko. In a study that has not yet been peer reviewed, published this week, his team found 80 per cent of people in Sydney needed to comply with social distancing to stop the spread; at present, that figure sits at 40 per cent.
"People are saying the current lockdown measures in NSW will put a cap on cases. Our results do not suggest that," says Milne.
All models are wrong, scientists like to say, but some are useful. They are only as accurate as the data we can put in, and Delta only emerged in March. Sydney's current situation is the first time Australia has faced a significant Delta outbreak. It remains to be seen how well current restrictions can bring it under control.
Sydney lived for a long time without a lockdown. Why?
Experts offer two possible explanations. First, the earlier strains were easier to contain without a lockdown. And it is possible Sydney had better contact tracing and public health infrastructure, although - beyond repeated claims from politicians of "gold standard" contact tracing - there is little hard evidence to prove that is the case, says Dr Driss Ait Ouakrim, an epidemiologist and COVID-19 modeller at the University of Melbourne.
Which leads to the second explanation: luck. "I know there was a narrative about how their contact tracing was gold standard. There is no evidence for that. I think it was a large part luck," says Ait Ouakrim.
Unwilling to accept that? Consider modelling by the Burnet Institute: introducing a single infection into a model of Melbourne and running it 1000 times suggests even with zero restrictions, more than half the time it goes nowhere - and the other half the time you get an outbreak. Such is the random nature of the virus.
"With the original strain, the majority of the time you were safe, but it also depends on how many times you roll the dice - and so now [with Delta] these numbers are a bit worse," says the institute's Dr Nick Scott.
How will full vaccination rates change things?
Vaccines have long been seen as our path out of lockdown. In July, Prime Minister Scott Morrison said we would eventually be able to treat the virus "like the flu". He outlined a four-phase plan to get back to normal. Phase 3 "means no more lockdowns", he said.
But even though we have a vaccine for various strains of the flu, it is a more serious problem than we give it credit for: about 530 Australians die from it every year. In 2019, it was the ninth-leading cause of death.
Even if we vaccinated 80 per cent of Australians against COVID-19, allowing it to run through the country entirely unchecked would still lead to a significant number of deaths, Burnet Institute modelling suggests. With a more contagious virus that cuts the effectiveness of our vaccines, such as Delta, still more people would die.
"With the Delta variant, even with high vaccine coverage we are going to require an ongoing public health response to COVID in the long term," says Scott. "Because people can still become infected when they are vaccinated, even with high vaccine coverage there can be an epidemic among the unvaccinated population. Vaccines are unlikely to be the silver bullet that does away with restrictions."

Full text: EXPLAINERWe are being asked to do something against human nature, but it's our social ways that spread the virus, writes Liam Mannix.
At first it seemed like madness, a storyline out of a dystopian film. In Wuhan, a city of millions, only a couple of days before Chinese New Year, the streets were empty. People were confined to their houses. Masks became mandatory.
At the time it seemed like it couldn't happen here. Yet without a vaccine or effective treatments, that was the only tool China had to control the spread of COVID-19. And as the virus spread, so did the lockdowns.
COVID-19 is passed on when humans do what humans do: interact, face to face. Lockdowns ask us to fight the virus by quelling our basic instinct.
"That's why the virus is so effective, because it exploits our very humanness. Lockdowns ask us to be very anti who we naturally are," says Dr Jason Thompson of the University of Melbourne, who worked on the Victorian government's epidemic modelling.
Make no mistake, lockdowns come with enormous costs: damage to the economy, damage to mental health, damage to individual liberties.
Which makes it important to ask: do they actually work? Are there alternatives? How did Sydney manage to avoid one for so long, while Melbourne has had five? And what will the rise of Delta, and our growing number of vaccinations, mean for lockdowns in the future?
Do lockdowns work?
This seems like a straightforward question. It's not.
The problem is in the framing - work to do what? What works for some people won't work for others. Some prioritise the protection of life, others mental health, still others freedom or the economy. It might sound cold, but governments every day must weigh up the value of the lives of their citizens - for example, when deciding which drugs and medical treatments to subsidise.
"There are areas where trying to weigh human life is repugnant," Dr Hugh Breakey, a moral philosopher based at Griffith University, told the Herald last year. "Lockdowns don't fall into that easy case."
Let's focus on just one goal, the one governments cite when they send us into lockdowns: stopping the virus' spread.
Do lockdowns stop the virus spreading? The best national and international evidence suggests they do.
"Lockdowns appear to be very effective - in Australia and all around the world," says Dr Nick Scott, head of modelling and biostatistics at the Burnet Institute. This is particularly the case when compared to not locking down.
And University of Sydney COVID-19 modeller Professor Mikhail Prokopenko agrees: "I think it's important to tell people that the restrictions that we all have been enduring have saved nearly 50,000 lives, in comparison to similar countries like the UK or US. Feel free to quote me on that."
Three studies in leading scientific journals Nature, Science, and Nature Communications all conclude measures associated with lockdowns, such as closing businesses and banning people from gathering, do work to cut the spread of the virus.
This shouldn't be a surprise. "[Lockdowns] stop movement. If you stop humans contacting humans, that transmission slows," says Professor Caroline Miller, director of the Health Policy Centre at the South Australian Health and Medical Research Institute.
Do they save lives?
"Please know every individual effort you made today and everything you'll do tomorrow and every day will save lives," Victoria's Premier Daniel Andrews told his state as it headed back into lockdown in June.
Is this true? A lockdown that stops a virus while leading to a large number of non-virus deaths - say, from suicide - is a failure on that metric. So could it be the cure becomes worse than the disease?
The data shows Australia and New Zealand experienced no excess mortality in 2020. To put that another way: we experienced a pandemic that has killed almost 4.1 million people, and Australia saw no appreciable rise in deaths. South Korea, Taiwan, and Thailand - all lockdown countries - also experienced little to no extra deaths.
Brazil, Sweden, Russia and parts of the United States, which largely eschewed lockdown measures, had large numbers of deaths; in the States, COVID-19 became the leading cause of death for several months in 2020 and 2021.
Some countries that locked down and managed to avoid a major outbreak actually reduced their total number of deaths from all causes. Fewer people died than an average non-COVID year, mostly because flu deaths were cut out.
"The best current evidence suggests lockdowns cut deaths from non-COVID causes. Suicide deaths and accidental deaths stay the same or go down in most cases," says University of Wollongong epidemiologist Gideon Meyerowitz-Katz.
What about Delta? Does that change the game?
Early evidence suggests Delta significantly undermines how well our lockdowns work.
If our goal remains the same - stopping the circulation of the virus and therefore saving lives - we may need to lock down harder than ever before.
Delta is about 60 per cent more infectious than the Alpha variant of the virus, which in turn was perhaps 50 per cent more contagious than the version of the virus that first emerged in Wuhan. The more infectious the virus, the harder it is to control.
We can see this in federal government modelling. On average, an outbreak in Sydney at the moment of the original strain would have an R-eff - how many people each infected person infects - of 0.91. That would quickly bring the outbreak to a stop.
With Delta, that number is 1.7, which means the outbreak will continue to grow. "Delta has completely changed it, totally changed it," says Professor George Milne of the University of WA, who is providing official COVID-19 modelling to the WA and Queensland governments.
Milne is so worried about Delta he is working on modelling what he terms "stage 5" lockdown measures, more draconian than any introduced so far, in which large numbers of people may be banned from leaving their houses altogether. "Nobody goes out the door."
More worrying are what his models say about Sydney's current outbreak: current lockdown measures simply will not be enough to bring case numbers down to zero.
That troubling claim is supported both by federal government modelling and the work of an independent modelling group led by Prokopenko. In a study that has not yet been peer reviewed, published this week, his team found 80 per cent of people in Sydney needed to comply with social distancing to stop the spread; at present, that figure sits at 40 per cent.
"People are saying the current lockdown measures in NSW will put a cap on cases. Our results do not suggest that," says Milne.
All models are wrong, scientists like to say, but some are useful. They are only as accurate as the data we can put in, and Delta only emerged in March. Sydney's current situation is the first time Australia has faced a significant Delta outbreak. It remains to be seen how well current restrictions can bring it under control.
Sydney managed for a long time without a lockdown. Why?
Experts offer two possible explanations. First, the earlier strains were easier to contain without a lockdown. And it is possible Sydney had better contact tracing and public health infrastructure, although - beyond repeated claims from politicians of "gold standard" contact tracing - there is little hard evidence to prove that is the case, says Dr Driss Ait Ouakrim, an epidemiologist and COVID-19 modeller at the University of Melbourne.
Which leads to the second explanation: luck."I know there was a narrative about how their contact tracing was gold standard. There is no evidence for that. I think it was a large part luck," says Ait Ouakrim.
Unwilling to accept that? Consider modelling by the Burnet Institute: introducing a single infection into a model of Melbourne and running it 1000 times suggests even with zero restrictions, more than half the time it goes nowhere - and the other half the time you get an outbreak. Such is the random nature of the virus.
"With the original strain, the majority of the time you were safe, but it also depends on how many times you roll the dice - and so now [with Delta] these numbers are a bit worse," says the Institute's Dr Scott.

Full text: For the next four months Australians should expect to endure more snap lockdowns, with experts predicting further outbreaks of the highly contagious Delta variant.
Scientists warn that suppressing Delta, which is thought to be twice as infectious as the Wuhan coronavirus strain circulating last year in Victoria, is nearly impossible.
They argue each Delta outbreak must be crushed back to zero cases with "accelerated" public health measures, including lockdowns.
University of Melbourne researcher Jason Thompson, who provided epidemic modelling to the Victorian government during last year's second wave of COVID-19, said the extremely contagious Delta was a new era of the pandemic.
"With Delta, you either have no case or you have lots of cases," he said. "To keep those cases to very low numbers, you have to implement lockdowns even faster than before."
Dr Thompson suspects lockdowns may be called more quickly and frequently until millions more can be vaccinated.
Rather than prolonged lockdowns drawn out over months, fast, snap lockdowns, lasting roughly a week, could be enough to curtail outbreaks if they are enforced early. "For example, you might have five, seven-day lockdowns versus one, six-month lockdown," he said. "This is where we are at unfortunately ... until we build immunity through vaccination." He said Delta's spread was "like running a video at three times the normal speed".
Melbourne University clinical epidemiologist Professor Nancy Baxter said further lockdowns were inevitable until vaccine rates surged to 80 per cent or the country fixed its leaky quarantine system.
"Every potential vulnerability we have in the system, Delta is just more able to take advantage of that," Professor Baxter said.
"'We barely have anyone vaccinated. We don't have any natural immunity from COVID having been in our community before and now we're dealing with the most transmissible, possibly most virulent COVID variant ever."
Even the way we exit lockdowns has changed with Delta.
"If it is still smouldering and you release restrictions it will quickly ignite again," Dr Thompson said.
"You have to know exactly where all your cases are before you ease restrictions."
University of Melbourne epidemiologist Tony Blakely, who has led scientific modelling that predicted what might happen in Australia under hundreds of varying scenarios, estimates the chance of going into lockdown each time new infections of Delta arise is roughly the same now as it was this time last year.
This is in spite of significant improvements to contact tracing and widespread mask-wearing across Victoria. Despite being in the thick of the coronavirus pandemic for more than 18 months, Professor Blakely said even he had been surprised that fleeting transmission at an AFL match at the MCG had spawned more cases.
But computational epidemiologist Mikhail Prokopenko from the University of Sydney warned that repeated, short lockdowns were not viable.
He said once Delta was eliminated, uninterrupted weeks or months of economic and social activity could be used to vaccinate as many people as possible.

Full text: Health Minister Greg Hunt says economic and mental health support for NSW residents will likely be finalised today, as South Australia closes its border to Sydney. NSW recorded 112 new local cases to 8pm on Sunday. Experts warn a further four week lockdown is the only way to get NSW numbers down. Melbourne’s CBD economy will not return to pre-Covid levels until late 2024 or early 2025.

Rhiannon Down 11.20pm: New sites on Sydney exposure list
Food outlets, a bank branch, and a medical centre, as well as a dozen public transport routes, are among the latest venues to be added to NSW’s list of exposure sites, stoking fears Tuesday will be another day of high case numbers.
The growing list includes a string of locations concentrated in Sydney’s west, such as: Westpac Fairfield at the Neeta City Shopping Centre, Ware Street Medical Practice also in Fairfield, Cedar Valley Meats in Yagoona, Mr Shawarma in Greenacre, the Valley Plaza Priceline in Green Valley, Roselands Fruit World and Mataam Al Mandi in Lakemba.
Cycling shop 99 Bikes in Bondi Junction was also added to the list along with a dozen bus routes reaching almost every corner of Sydney including Fairfield, Zetland, Kareela, Neutral Bay, Forest Lodge, Redfern and Beaconsfield.
Schnitz Broadway in Glebe, Kmart, Big W and Pharmacy 4 Less at Bankstown Central, Malatang Restaurant at Hurstville Central, Australia Post, Westfield Bondi Junction, Coles Fairfield West and the Kmart at the Casula Mall were added as casual contact locations.
The Wetherill Park and Oran Park Woolworths, the 7-Eleven service station in Camperdown and Centennial Park’s Centennial Homestead Café, were also added to the list.
Patrick Commins 10.20pm: Lockdown threatens economic comeback
The national economy will “go backwards” this quarter if Sydney’s lockdown extends beyond six weeks, economists say, with major additional support for affected businesses and workers now “critical” to securing an anticipated bounce-back once restrictions are lifted.
As Treasury officials prepare a joint federal/state package expected to include a reinstatement of the business cashflow boost for small businesses and potentially an expansion of the eligibility criteria of the commonwealth Covid disaster relief payment, Monday’s news of a further 112 cases triggered expectations that the lockdown could drag on into late July or even early August.
Prior to the latest outbreak of the more virulent Delta variant of the virus, private sector analysts had pencilled in real GDP growth of around 1 per cent over the three months to September, implying output would lift by about $5bn.

Rachel Baxendale 9.40pm: Melbourne apartments on exposure list
An apartment building in Maribyrnong, in Melbourne’s west, has become Victoria’s latest coronavirus exposure site, after removalists who later tested positive for the virus worked there.
Anyone who visited the residential part of Ariele apartments at 7 Thomas Holmes St, Maribyrnong, between 1pm and 11.50pm last Thursday is considered a Tier 1 contact, and must isolate for a fortnight.
Anyone who has visited the apartments at any point since is considered a Tier 2 contact, and must get tested and isolate until they receive a negative result.
Three removalists from Sydney are understood to have collected furniture from one of the apartments last Thursday.
They transported the furniture to South Australia on Friday, when one of the removalists was contacted by NSW contact tracers, alerting him that he was a close contact of a positive case.
The removalist got tested on his return to Sydney on Saturday and returned a positive test result on Sunday.
On Monday a second removalist also tested positive.

Rhiannon Down 8.55pm: Active cases list hits 770
The nation has 770 active cases of Covid-19 after 112 were recorded on Monday in NSW, according to the latest snapshot.
A total of 126 people are in hospital with the coronavirus and the total death toll for the pandemic has climbed to 911 after the passing of a woman in her 90s was reported on Sunday.
More than 22 million Covid-19 tests have been received since the start of the pandemic, after 139,699 jabs were reported in the past 24 hours.
It comes as the government confirmed economic and mental health support packages for NSW will be completed in the “very near future”.

Rhiannon Down 8.20pm: Ex-Pfizer chief questions rollout
Former Pfizer global research president John LaMattina has criticised the federal government’s vaccine rollout, admitting he would be “disappointed” if he was an Australian left waiting to be immunised at this stage in the pandemic.
Dr LaMattina said the “wheels came off” Australia’s vaccination rollout when the federal government failed to secure more doses of mRNA vaccines in November, as reports of the vaccine’s high efficacy rates emerged.
“If I was an Australian and seeing the rest of the world getting all these vaccine
doses and my country was late to the party, I’d be a little disappointed, to say the least,” he told the ABC’s 7.30 program on Monday night.
“And it wasn’t as if they were blindsided. So Pfizer came in June and July of last year and offered different things and they were rebuffed basically.
“I would think in a global pandemic — and I’m not a politician, I’m not a government official — but I would think you keep a watchful eye on whatever is happening and be prepared to make a quick move if something would have changed your thinking, be it a new vaccine or extraordinary potency of the mRNA vaccine.
“So I think that’s sort of the responsibility of government officials.”
Dr LaMattina said he understood the federal government passed on making multiple supply deals in the early days of the pandemic, but was “not sure that was a terrible mistake” until later in the year when the government still failed to act.
“Once November rolled around and Pfizer Moderna revealed the extraordinary efficacy of their vaccines, I would have thought that Australia, like many other countries, would have gone right away back to Pfizer and said, ‘Ok, we’re interested now’,” he said.
“Assuming the FDA approves your vaccine and demonstrates safety and efficacy, we
want enough vaccine to really inoculate 80 per cent, 90 per cent of people in Australia over the age of 18.
“So I think my personal view is to ask them where the wheels fell off a little bit.”

Rachel Baxendale 8.10pm: Victorian exposure list grows
The Victorian Health Department has listed two new coronavirus exposure sites in Melbourne’s north, indicating at least one member of a family who recently returned from Sydney left their home in defiance of home quarantine requirements for red zone returnees.
One member of the family, who has since tested positive for coronavirus, drove back to Melbourne from Sydney on July 8.
The other three family members, one of whom has also tested positive, had flown home on July 4.
Anyone returning to Victoria from a red zone must quarantine at home for a fortnight, with receiving medical care and getting a coronavirus test the only acceptable reasons for leaving the house.
Coles Craigieburn Central has been listed as a Tier 1 exposure site for the period between 5.28pm and 6.38pm on Saturday.
Metro Petroleum in Broadmeadows has been listed as a Tier 2 exposure site for the period between 1.19pm and 2.04pm on Sunday.
Anyone who has visited a Tier 1 site must quarantine at home for a fortnight, while those who have visited a Tier 2 site must get tested and isolate until they receive a negative test result.

Rhiannon Down 7.25pm: Shorten pans ‘most hands-off PM since federation’
Bill Shorten has criticised the government’s vaccine rollout, accusing Scott Morrison of being the “most hands-off Prime Minister since federation”.
“At the end of the day, we’ve got people in Sydney who are locked down,” the former opposition leader told the ABC on Monday.
“People are making sacrifices. They’re not able to go to work.
“They do expect the promise to be kept by their politicians and the state and federal governments.
“And the reality is there’s two promises for the sacrifices that hard working Sydneysiders and Melburnians have made previously, it is this — the government will get people vaccinated. “And they will provide financial support for people. Now neither of that has been forthcoming adequately in this latest outbreak.”
Mr Shorten said the government needed to provide financial support to casual workers as a matter of urgency, as it prepares to release an economic and mental health support package for NSW.
“They go to work, infect people, on the other hand they stay at home and starve,” he said. “It’s a terrible choice.”
The government has introduced the Covid-19 disaster payment, which kicks in once restrictions have been in place for more than seven days. It provides $325 for those who have lost less than 20 hours of work and $500 for those who have lost more than 20 hours of work.

Erin Lyons 7.00pm: Thousands dob in lockdown rule breakers
Sydneysiders are not afraid to dob in fellow residents caught breaching lockdown measures.
More than 3000 calls were made to Crime Stoppers over the weekend alone from community members concerned about Covid behaviour.
About 40,000 calls had been made since the start of the pandemic, NSW Police Commissioner Mick Fuller said.
“It is a stark reminder that most of the community gets the issue. They get the health orders and the significance of them,” he said.
Officers have been out in force, especially in the southwestern suburbs, as the virus continues to spread across the city.
Dozens of new cases have been linked to the Fairfield local government areas, with the deadly Delta variant mainly spreading between families, friends and colleagues of infected Sydneysiders.
“While Fairfield is an area of concern at the moment, we are also looking at other areas across Sydney, including Bondi and Sutherland,” Mr Fuller said.
“Police will continue to conduct business inspections with an additional focus of compliance with QR code requirements.”
He confessed there had been a notable improvement in behaviour, particularly when it came to mask wearing.
But Police Minister David Elliott warned that Sydneysiders were “not out of the woods yet”.
“We have a way to go and I urge every person to continue to limit their movements to limit the spread of this devastating virus,” he said.
A total of 105 PINs were issued on Sunday, with 16 people copping a $200 fine for failing to wear a mask.

Rhiannon Down 6.30pm: Nationwide vaccine jabs top 9.1 million doses
The nation’s vaccine rollout has surpassed 9.1 million doses after 51,848 jabs were administered in the past 24 hours, amid a dramatic jump in Sydney’s case numbers.
More than half a million doses have been administered by the federal system after 14,550 jabs were administered in the 24 hours bringing the total to 5,172,741 jabs, according to the Department of Health.
This figure includes 4,711,565 jabs which have been administered by primary care, while 3,977,076 jabs have been administered by the states and territories.
NSW, which recorded 112 cases on Monday, administered 11,467 jabs in the last 24 hours, bringing the states total to 1,053,060.
Victoria continued to hold the lead, with 10,860 jabs in the past day, pushing its total to 1,277,146.
Just 506 jabs were delivered to disability and aged care facilities yesterday, bringing the sector’s total to 461,176 jabs.

Finn McHugh 5.40pm: More than half aged care workers yet to get first jab
More than half of the nation’s aged care workers are yet to receive their first Covid-19 vaccine dose, despite the virus rampaging through aged care homes.
Workers will be forced to receive the vaccine to remain employed at aged care centres, where Australia has suffered the vast majority of its Covid-19 deaths.
But just two months from the federal government’s September 17 deadline, Health Minister Greg Hunt conceded just 107,000 of the cohort, roughly 40 per cent, had received their first dose.
He denied the federal government was running out of time, insisting that number was “increasing significantly every day”.
“We have a series of ways to ensure that all those vaccinations … can be achieved so everybody is in a position to take that up,” he told reporters on Monday.
Over 213,000 aged care residents across Australia have been fully vaccinated, and another 33,000 have received their first dose.
But national cabinet also agreed in June to mandate vaccinations in the aged care sector over fears unvaccinated workers could transfer the virus to Australia’s most vulnerable.
That decision was on Friday reaffirmed by all states and territories, except Victoria.
Prime Minister Scott Morrison said only Victoria’s chief health officer, not Premier Daniel Andrews, had the authority to make the decision.
More than 894,000 vaccines were administered across Australia, taking the country’s full vaccination rate to 11.3 per cent.
NCA NewsWire has contacted Mr Hunt for comment.

It has prompted NSW health authorities to urge people to wear masks even when they’re taking out the bins.
Chief health officer Kerry Chant said the eight cases had been detected over a number of days, and all other residents of the 29-unit apartment block would need to undergo 14 days quarantine as they had been deemed close contacts.
“This is a reminder of the risk that Covid poses and why we are requiring masks in indoor common property areas of residential premises, and also discouraging social gatherings or any gatherings across household groups in those apartment blocks as well,” she said.
In a statement, NSW Health said the cases reinforce the need for everyone to wear a face mask in a shared foyer or lobby, lifts, stairwells and corridors, and shared laundry facilities of apartment complexes.
“This advice applies to everyone, including residents, visitors, building managers, concierge staff, contractors, delivery drivers and cleaners,” NSW health said.

Rhiannon Down 5.05pm: Medical centre, Coles, among bulging list of exposure sites
An immigration services and solicitors office in Sydney’s west are among a string of locations to be added to the list of exposure sites, with multiple time periods listed over the course of a week.
Australian Visa Now and Law and Order Office Work, both in Fairfield, as well as Belmore Medical Centre were added to the list this afternoon as close contact sites, with anyone who was present during the risk window asked to get tested and isolate for 14 days.
Numerous venues across the western suburbs have also been added as casual contact sites, including: PRD Real Estate in Liverpool, Fairfield Heights Babylon Bakery, Asal Sweet Patisserie in Merrylands and Tins and Wood in Penrith.
Australia Post Office at the Eastgate Shopping Centre and Irish Convenience Store in Bondi Junction and Coles Pyrmont, were also added to the list.
The full list is available on the NSW Health website.
Max Maddison 4.15pm: I never claimed I was involved in Pfizer contracts: Rudd
Former prime minister Kevin Rudd says his letter is “entirely consistent” with Pfizer’s public statement, as he hasn’t tried to claim responsibility for contractual decisions made by the company.
Pfizer, Health Minister Greg Hunt and Scott Morrison all moved to pour cold water on reports Mr Rudd helped broker a deal for the country to obtain vaccine supplies early via a Zoom call with Pfizer’s chief executive, Albert Bourla.
But Mr Rudd responded to a carefully worded statement from the pharmaceutical company which said he’d played no role in “contractual agreements”, by pointing out his letter had never claimed to have played a part in negotiations.
“Mr Rudd has not claimed responsibility for decisions by Pfizer and – as he made clear to Mr Morrison – all negotiating powers rested with the federal government,” the statement said.
“Mr Rudd would definitely not seek to associate himself with the Australian Government’s comprehensively botched vaccine procurement program.”

Rhiannon Down 3.30pm: Two Victorian cases linked to Sydney removalists
Victoria has discovered two cases of Covid-19 as the state is plunged into a state of high alert after a confirmed case in a Sydney removalist travelled to Melbourne, visiting a number of households.
Testing Commander Jeroen Weimar confirmed the two cases were from a family of four that had recently moved to Melbourne from Sydney on a red border permit.
“They all tested negative initially, this highlights the importance of the red zone permits, all of them travelled on the appropriate red documentation, all members of the family were tested shortly after their arrival, and tested negative, and they continued their isolation,” Mr Weimar said.
“Two members of the family became symptomatic and were tested yesterday.
“We received those results late this morning today, they were both positive, the other two members of the family will be tested again today.”
Mr Weimar said three of the family members had travelled down by plane, with a fourth driving from Sydney to an address in the Hume LGA, in Melbourne’s north and health authorities were “working with him to understand the exact nature of the journey”.
“We are not going to identify those flights because one of the positive cases did not arrive by plane, three people travelled by plane and they all tested negative on (July 6) after arriving on (July 4),” he said.
“We are confident they were not infectious on the plane.”
COVID-19 Australia: Cumulative vaccinations by state
Max Maddison 3.25pm: PM confirms he never spoke with Pfizer chief
While defending the country’s vaccination rollout, Prime Minister Scott Morrison has conceded he’d only met with Pfizer’s Australia director, Anne Harris, along with one of the company’s “senior board directors” in Europe, but not chief executive Albert Bourla.
“I have spoken to the head of Pfizer here in Australia — which is where the contract is, and that’s how it’s managed — on numerous occasions … So we’ve been managing that relationship at a very senior level,” he said.

Max Maddison 3.15pm: NSW financial support details ironed out tonight: PM
Scott Morrison says the in-principle support to provide financial support to struggling businesses has been agreed with the NSW Government, as he concedes he hasn’t spoken to the chief executive of Pfizer.
With the deteriorating outbreak in Greater Sydney meaning the lockdown will be extended for up to weeks, the Prime Minister said an agreement to provide NSW with an economic support package was “pretty close” to being finalised, with the details likely to be ironed out later tonight.
He foreshadowed the package would consist of a combination of income support for individuals and cash flow support for businesses.
“We’ve been working over the weekend with them cooperatively together to ensure that we deliver us support that is targeted, that is proportionate, that is scalable, and ultimately is support that doesn’t have to be there forever,” Mr Morrison told Sky News on Monday afternoon.
“It needs to back businesses in with the decisions they’re making right now to support their staff.”

Jess Malcolm 2.55pm: Queenslanders can head to NZ as travel bubble resumes
New Zealand health authorities have decided to resume quarantine free travel to Queensland from midnight tonight after a risk assessment deemed the public health danger to be low.
But some restrictions remain including travellers to clear a negative pre-departure test and must not have been in NSW since June 26.
Travellers who do not comply with these rules will be forced into mandatory isolation at their own cost, unless they are eligible for an exemption.
“A public health risk assessment for Queensland has been carried out by the Ministry of Health, and they have assessed travel with the state as presenting a low public health risk,” they wrote.
“The last community case was 7 July 2021. The last time a case was infectious in the community was on 4 July 2021. There have been no unexpected wastewater detections and community testing rates have been good. Queensland is also easing restrictions within the state.”
Jess Malcolm 2.19pm: SA woman dies after AstraZeneca vaccine
A 72-year-old woman is believed to have died from a rare blood clotting event linked to the AstraZeneca vaccine, the South Australian government has confirmed.
The woman was vaccinated on June 24, admitted to the Royal Adelaide hospital on July 5 and passed away overnight.
Founder and Executive Creative Director at DPR & Co Richard Ralphsmith says "Australians don't generally have sufficient fear of the virus" because our lived experience hasn't been as dire as other countries – leading to vaccine apathy. "If you're going to warn people against the risk of taking the AstraZeneca vaccine because of the risk of blood clots, then you may as well warn them not to walk out their front door," he told Sky News host Gary Hardgrave.
The South Australian Coroner is now investigating the death and authorities have reported it to the Therapeutic Goods Administration.
She is the fourth person to have died after developing rare blood clots linked to the AstraZeneca vaccine which is recommended for people aged older than 60.

Jess Malcolm 2.10pm: SA closes border to greater Sydney
South Australia will slam shut their border to greater Sydney from midnight tonight amid the growing outbreak in NSW.
Premier Steven Marshall has announced people wishing to return to the state will face a higher level of scrutiny and will no longer be able to easily apply for exemptions from health authorities.
People fleeing domestic violence situations will still be able to enter South Australia but will be forced into mandatory hotel quarantine.
Essential travellers will also be subjected to rigorous testing requirements.
There have been no new exposure sites added after a removalist worker travelled through the state and later tested positive in Sydney.

Max Maddison 2pm: Rudd had no ‘material contribution’ to Pfizer deal
Health Minister Greg Hunt has admitted the Pfizer chief executive wasn’t lobbied directly, but says he’s “completely” confident Australia received the “best outcome” possible, as he says Kevin Rudd had no “material contribution’’.
With reports emerging the Morrison government failed to engage the necessary executive levels at Pfizer, leaving former prime minister Mr Rudd to petition for advanced deliveries via a Zoom call, Mr Hunt moved to rubbish the claims, saying the story has been trumped by fact.
Sky News host Chris Smith says Sydneysiders are "frightened" and the New South Wales premier "needs to be aware of that". NSW has been bracing for more Covid cases and a lockdown extension as the state battles the Delta strain outbreak. Mr Smith said this latest outbreak was "not like Melbourne's 112 day lockdown" because the "circumstances are completely different". "In NSW we've jabbed the vulnerable, we are not going to have 800 people die," he said. "In nine days time you've got Pfizer coming on at a great rate a million doses per week. "We've got to hear the premier say we'll get through this and we will get through this rather quickly but right now do the right thing and stay home."
“The very foundation of this story is false,” Mr Hunt told a press conference on Monday. “The fact there is no attribution, no verification but then the most basic element of it is false should cause everybody to stop and say clearly it is a little bit of a game here.
“We just got exactly the best outcome that we were seeking on exactly the terms and on exactly the time frame. So I respect that individuals will sometimes take initiatives and we welcome and thank them, but did it make a difference? No.”
Mr Hunt conceded no one in the Morrison government had met with Pfizer chief executive Albert Bourla, but said it hadn’t made any material difference to the country’s ability to procure vaccines.
“We worked through the Australian office. We have dealt with one of the board members previously and the important thing is no earlier doses were available,” he said.

Max Maddison 1.50pm: NSW support package ‘likely finalised today’
Health Minister Greg Hunt says economic and mental health support packages for NSW will be completed in the “very near future”, as he moved to rubbish claims of limited contact between senior members of the Australian government and Pfizer executives.
Greater Sydney is looking down the barrel of an indefinite period of lockdown, amid reports the Berejiklian government were planning to put together a JobKeeper style wage subsidy program, in response to a perceived lack of assistance from the commonwealth.
But Mr Hunt said discussions between the Morrison government and Gladys Berejiklian had advanced on Monday, and a support package was likely to be finalised later today.
“The stresses that families, workers, businesses, are facing are real and significant,” Mr Hunt told a press conference on Monday afternoon.
“So these are supports to assist people through the difficult challenging lockdown period but I will say this. We have done this before, we have done this nationally.”
In response to a question about reports Scott Morrison hadn’t contacted the chief executive of Pfizer to secure Australia more vaccines, Mr Hunt said the country had “ongoing, continuous and multiple negotiations” with the company, which included weekly conversation’s he’d had with Pfizer’s Australia director, Anne Harris.
“We have been able to achieve the highest and best expectation that could be done in terms of bringing that forward,” he said.
“Pfizer could not have been more categorical. This is something that we’ve done through multiple discussions and dealing with the company directly and that’s our job.”

Jess Malcolm 1.25pm: Shutting ACT out of Vic ‘very frustrating’
ACT Health Minister Rachel Stephen-Smith says it is “very, very frustrating” that Canberrans can no longer travel to Victoria considering the NSW outbreak is occurring hundreds of kilometres away.
The ACT has not had a case of Covid-19 in over a year and has never had a case of community transmission.
But the Victorian government on Sunday moved to shut-out all residents of the ACT and regional NSW amid the uncertainty of the Sydney outbreak.
Ms Stephen-Smith said it was unfortunate but the decision was out of her control.
“It is always really frustrating for Canberrans when we get pulled in with regional NSW when other jurisdictions make decisions about their own borders,” she told Sky News.
“There’s nothing we can do to address this issue. I’ve been advised that the Victorian health advice was unequivocal in upgrading their border advice.”
“We are very much based on what is happening in greater Sydney and it is something we cannot control.”

Robert Gottliebsen 1.20pm: Vaccines a new force in global markets
The sharp gyrations in both the US share and bond markets last week were caused by a new combination of forces that will erupt again. And while we will look to the US for those eruptions, Australia is set for similar experiences.
Accordingly it’s important to understand those forces and the potential impacts on both the US and Australia.
I am going to illustrate with two Australian examples which show how these forces are working.
My first illustration is actually from Tasmania, where there is a limited ability to undertake construction in any one year. My Tasmanian friends tell me that if you combine the Apple Isle’s housing, infrastructure, and industrial projects, the amount of building scheduled to take place is about twice the state’s capacity to supply. Much bigger versions of that problem are being duplicated not only on the Australian mainland but in parts of the US.
If we follow past patterns then the shortage of labour, goods and materials so created will explode prices in building contracts and contribute to a spike in inflation which will flow through into interest rates. That theory has been the dominant driver of higher US bond yields (lower bond prices) and increased asset values.
Suddenly a second set of forces is challenging that assumption and nowhere is that better illustrated than in NSW.

Jess Malcolm 1.10pm: 105 fines for NSW Covid breaches
Some 105 infringement notices were handed out by NSW Police on Sunday for noncompliance with the public health orders across metropolitan Sydney.
There were also 400 cautions given, and over 3,000 calls to Crime Stoppers from members of the community dobbing in their neighbours.
Police Commissioner Mick Fuller thanked the community for its compliance, but cautioned police would not be afraid to be tougher if necessary.
“I think it is a stark reminder that most of the community get the issue, they get the health orders and the significance of them,” he said. “The police operation will continue throughout the week and, if necessary, during this escalation of the health orders right across Sydney.”
“However we will focus on areas where the virus is and obviously Fairfield is an area of concern at the moment, as well as Bondi and Sutherland.”
Police are also ramping up inspections on businesses to ensure they are using mandatory QR codes which are enforceable from today.

Max Maddison 12.55pm: Pfizer shoots down Rudd claims over rollout
Pfizer has shot down reports former prime minister Kevin Rudd played a hand in vaccine negotiations with the company, saying there were only two parties involved in the agreement.
In a statement released on Monday, Pfizer said “all agreements and supply arrangements” were exclusively made with the federal government, in which it maintained a “strong relationship”.
“Recent media reports suggesting that any third party or individual has had any role in contractual agreements reached between Pfizer and the Australian Government are inaccurate,” the statement said.
“The only two parties involved in these agreements are Pfizer and the Australian Government.”
The statement, however, didn’t deny representations had been made by Mr Rudd directly to Pfizer chairman and chief executive Albert Bourla Rudd via a Zoom call.

Jess Malcolm 12.15pm: Gladys suggests attempt to acquire more doses
Gladys Berejiklian has hinted that she has already attempted to secure more vaccines from overseas in a bid to boost immunity across NSW as the outbreak grew to 678 cases on Monday.
Sky News host Sharri Markson says Prime Minister Scott Morrison is facing blame for a lack of vaccine supply – with this issue being "such a serious one" that currently it is likely to "cost him the next election". Ms Markson said the issue is "turning uglier politically by the day". She also assessed the latest COVID-19 facts and figures across the state of New South Wales. NSW recorded 77 new cases of COVID-19 on Sunday – the highest daily total since the Bondi outbreak began. Of these locally acquired cases, 33 were exposed to the community while infectious. “The Premier says the situation is likely to get worse before it gets better and right now there is no end in sight to the lockdown that she could give,” Ms Markson said. “This situation is putting our political leaders under pressure”. Ms Markson said, however looking at the situation globally, it's not just Australia struggling to contain the Delta variant – as other nations battle with escalating infection numbers.
When asked by reporters what had stopped her from going it alone in the race to secure vaccines from the international community, the NSW Premier said: “I will say that the New South Wales Government never leaves a stone unturned.
“I will leave it at that but also say that it is not the state government’s responsibility, which is a fact, to source the vaccines or to get the doses.”
Ms Berejiklian was asked again whether she had attempted to secure more Pfizer supplies, but she declined to elaborate.
“I will just leave my comments at that. I don’t want to get into specifics.”

Jess Malcolm 12.00pm: ‘Almost impossible’ to leave lockdown this week
Chief Health Officer Kerry Chant is in “two minds” about whether the Sydney outbreak has reached its peak and was unable to predict whether numbers will continue to rise.
But Gladys Berejiklian has conceded it will be impossible for the city to come out of lockdown as scheduled on Friday, although she continued to rebuff calls to close down non-essential retail.
NSW Premier Gladys Berejiklian has conceded it is “highly unlikely” Sydney’s lockdown will end on Friday as planned since Covid case number are heading in the wrong direction. Cases are predicted to surge past 100 today after 77 new locally acquired cases were recorded on Sunday with 33 unknowingly infectious in the community. Ms Berejiklian wants to see case numbers as close to zero as possible to ensure no chains of transmission have been missed before the lockdown comes to an end. There are 52 people in hospital across the state with Covid and 15 of those are in ICU and five on ventilators.
“I don’t think it is helpful talking about scenarios at this stage but what I have said very clearly is given where the numbers are it is not likely, in fact, almost impossible for us to get out of lockdown on Friday,” Ms Berejiklian said.
Health authorities are constantly assessing the numbers, and are still hopeful to find the cases quickly enough before they are infectious in the community.
Dr Chant said it would be a “win” if high testing rates over the next few days revealed the extent of the spread in the community.
“I want to find every single person who currently has Covid or is at risk of Covid,” she said
“If we are getting to people really early when they are just becoming infectious then they probably have that chance of not infecting it further and if we can contain the family unit we can stop the spread.”
Dr Chant said compliance to the stay-at-home orders will hopefully see the majority of new cases in isolation before they test positive.

Jess Malcolm 11.46am: Support package hints at longer NSW lockdown
Gladys Berejiklian has refused to predict how long authorities will keep Sydneysiders locked up, but revealed it could be longer than initially predicted considering the extent of the economic stimulus package being prepared by Treasury.
The NSW Premier was worried about 34 new cases while infectious in the community in the past day, and reiterated that the number of cases while infectious in the community must come down to zero.
“This is a time to sit at home and not leave home unless we absolutely have to, especially in those local government areas we have identified but across all of the stay-at-home areas,” she said.
She also foreshadowed an economic stimulus package announcement for businesses and individuals struggling under lockdown either tomorrow or Wednesday.
Treasurer Dominic Perrotett has been involved in “high level” discussions with the commonwealth.
The NSW government is looking at offering individual payments to casual and part time staff, while it is likely the commonwealth will offer payments to individuals following a recent decision by national cabinet.
“Obviously what we announce in the next few days will have a mind on supporting businesses potentially for a longer period depending on how long the lockdown lasts,” she said.
“New South Wales has done its work, we are in negotiations with the commonwealth and we hope to have something to say in the next few days.”

Jess Malcolm 11.35am: NSW puts call out for unused Pfizer vaccines
NSW Health authorities have requested the commonwealth to redirect any unused Pfizer vaccines to their state hubs in a bid to boost immunity during its outbreak.
Dr Chant has confirmed authorities will consider all options to smooth out the process for people to get the AstraZeneca vaccine amid concerns there are delays.
This has been triggered by concerns of an operational lag when giving the AstraZeneca vaccine, considering GPs have to line up to 10 people at a time to ensure the doses are not wasted.
North Korea has rejected planned shipments of the AstraZeneca vaccine over fears of side effects. The country had been promised more than two million doses by the COVAX scheme but is seeking alternative vaccination options. North Korea has not reported any COVID-19 cases but the United States and South Korean officials have questioned the position.
“We are happy to look at all opportunities,” she said. “I think the reality at the moment is that we really need to prioritise getting older people vaccinated.”
Although officials are concerned about younger people becoming sick with the virus, Dr Chant said their priority is still to vaccinate the most vulnerable.
“I understand that young people are potentially contributing to the spread of it because they are more mobile but the most important component of our response at the moment is to protect the community from hospitalisations and deaths.”

Jess Malcolm 11.15am: AstraZeneca vaccine for all over-40s at NSW hubs
Anyone in NSW over 40 will now be able to get AstraZeneca at the government’s mass vaccination hubs across the state as it attempts to get on top of a worsening outbreak.
The government is also working to roll out the AstraZeneca vaccine to more pharmacies across the state, flagging this will be possible “very soon”.
Gladys Berejiklian also announced residents of the Hunter, Wollongong, Macquarie Fields and Fairfield will be able to come forward for vaccination with the new state government hubs set to open next week.
“We have increased our capacity and our access and now all we need are the extra doses and every time we get the extra doses we will make sure they get into arms which is so critical and so important,” she said.
Health authorities are also pleading for people not to leave home if they have symptoms as a number of medical centres and pharmacies have been listed as exposure sites.
The NSW Premier called out to the people of southwest Sydney to stay home, as a large number of new cases overnight were family and friends of positive cases.
If you are an essential worker especially in Fairfield, you are being asked to not leave home if you have symptoms, and do not work across multiple sites.
“It is a fact that if you get the virus, the next people who will get it will be those you love the most,” Ms Berejiklian said.

Jess Malcolm 11.01am: NSW records 112 new local cases
NSW has recorded 112 new cases of locally acquired infections up to 8pm last night.
There are at least 34 cases who spent time in the community while infectious.
Gladys Berejiklian confirmed the overwhelming majority of new infections were close family or friends of previously announced cases.
New daily cases in New South Wales
Health authorities are urging residents of both Fairfield and Canterbury-Bankstown in the city’s southwest to stay home amid fears it has spread rampant in the community.
There were over 48,000 tests conducted yesterday.
Of the new locally acquired cases, 64 are linked to a known case, 41 are household contacts and 23 are close contacts.
There are currently 48 cases still under investigation, sparking fears that contact tracers are not able to keep up with the pace of the Delta variant.
There have now been 63 people admitted to hospital, with 18 people in intensive care and four people requiring ventilation.
Chief Health Officer Kerry Chant issued a stern message to all people in Sydney about the dangers of the virus, warning people of all ages can get very sick and require hospitalisation.
“I can say that you don’t need to have an underlying health condition to be in hospital with Covid,” she said.
“Covid is a serious disease and is associated with hospitalisation and death.
“The risk increases with age and for those underlying health conditions.”
Officials are also concerned about an emerging cluster in an apartment block in the city’s eastern suburbs where eight cases have emerged across five households.
“This is a reminder of the risk that Covid poses and why we were requiring masks and have been in indoor common property areas of residential premises and also discourage social gatherings or any gatherings across household groups in those apartment buildings as well.”

Max Maddison 10.59am: ‘I did chuckle’: Hunt responds to Rudd story
Health Minister Greg Hunt says reported help from former prime minister Kevin Rudd to fast track Pfizer doses didn’t “add to the outcome”, as he defends the Morrison government’s Covid-19 vaccination advertisement, saying it sends a “strong message”.
Reports in the ABC that senior Australian business figures turned to Mr Rudd in a bid to bring forward Australia’s Pfizer vaccine supply were rubbished by Mr Hunt, who said the procurement was the result of hard work undertaken by the federal government.
“I did chuckle when I saw the story,” Mr Hunt told Ray Hadley on 2GB. “We appreciate all the help, even if it hasn’t added to the outcome.
“I’m happy for all the Australian people that we have been able to achieve this.”
Amid considerable criticism of the federal government’s new Covid-19 scare campaign, involving a young woman on a ventilator in hospital gasping for breath, Mr Hunt said the advertisement was purposely designed to drive home the seriousness of the outbreak.
“This is a deliberate strong message which says given the outbreak in Sydney anybody can catch it, anybody can pass it on and anybody can suffer the agonising consequences,” he said.

Remy Varga 10.56am: Sydney removalist who visited Vic, SA tests positive
A Sydney removalist who visited Victoria and South Australia has tested positive for Covid-19.
The man is believed to have been infectious when working in Victoria and SA on July 8 and 9.
Victorian Health Minister Martin Foley said NSW Health authorities alerted their interstate counterparts late Sunday night.
He said work identifying exposure sites and close contacts was being undertaken by contact tracers and the information would be released soon.
The man, who is an interstate removalist, will be included in NSW’s case numbers on Monday.
Jess Malcolm 10.38am: NSW outbreak’s peak still to come: AMA
Australian Medical Association Vice President Chris Moy says it was evident from mid-last week that the Sydney outbreak would spiral out of control amid concern the previous lockdown settings were not effective.
Doctor Moy said it’s clear the risk profile of the outbreak has now changed and that the peak of the outbreak is still yet to come.
Australian Medical Association President Dr Omar Khorshid says the public health system in Australia will be “brought to its knees” by both flu and COVID-19 this winter. “We are really worried about the extent to which our public hospitals will be able to cope with either the flu or Covid; let alone both at the same time,” Dr Khorshid told Sky News. “Right now our hospitals are actually full, all over the country, with ambulances ramped outside the front. “And yet, we have no flu, there is zero flu in Australia at the moment – nowhere near the thousands of cases that we normally see going to hospital every winter, and of course Covid will be on top of that. “So that I think is one of the biggest challenges for our health system, for both levels of government, is to plan for that. “Because the moment those borders open, both viruses are going to enter the country and we’re going to see our hospital system brought to its knees.”
“The movement has to stop,” he told Sky News. “Where we are now is at a level that hopefully people have got the message. Only go to work if you absolutely have to, only go to the shops if you absolutely have to.”
He has also urged all people in other states to get vaccinated as early as possible, considering strict PPE protocols and social distancing requirements makes mass vaccination harder and slower during an outbreak.
“It’s very difficult to vaccinate while there is an outbreak going on,” he said.
“For everyone else, go get vaccinated right now.”

Lydia Lynch 10.23am: Travel exemptions to NRL players’ families
Annastacia Palaszczuk said travel exemptions will be given to the families of NRL players to allow them to move to Queensland following an emergency meeting of the Australian Rugby League Commission on Sunday.
Twelve NRL teams will relocate to southeast Queensland as the Covid-19 situation in NSW deteriorates.
Nine Sydney clubs as well as Newcastle, Canberra and the Warriors will be spread across three hubs in Queensland.
The Queensland Premier confirmed authorities would allow players families to relocate with them.
“It is very hard on families with the NRL players,” Ms Palaszczuk said.
“They will be in their distinct hubs, so we are facilitating that the immediate family members can move with them and they will be in those tight hubs.
“It is up to the NRL to police that but we will be monitoring that very closely as well.”
Travel from Greater Sydney was banned last month for people without an exemption.

Lydia Lynch 10.13am: Queensland resists introducing hard border with NSW
Queensland has held off reinstating a hard border with New South Wales.
NSW recorded another 77 cases of COVID-19 on Sunday, at least 33 of which were in the community during their infectious period.
The state is bracing for at least 100 new COVID-19 cases on Monday.
Annastacia Palaszczuk said a hard border was not needed at this stage because Greater Sydney was still in lockdown.
She said authorities were keeping a close eye on sewage testing in regional NSW.
“We have had extensive discussions this morning and we will be having those extensive discussions each and every day,” the Queensland Premier said.
Victorian authorities closed the state’s border with NSW and the ACT at midnight while SA and WA blocked travel last month.
Meanwhile, Queensland recorded zero community-acquired cases for the fourth consecutive day.
“We haven’t had a case infectious in our community now since July 5,” Ms Palaszczuk said.
Mandatory mask wearing and density restrictions will be eased from 6am Friday and visitors will be allowed at hospital and aged care homes again.
Dancing will also be allowed.

Robyn Ironside 10.09am: Air New Zealand begin NSW ‘rescue flights’
Air New Zealand will begin a series of “rescue flights” from Tuesday to bring stranded Kiwis home from New South Wales as the Covid-19 outbreak sweeping through Sydney worsens.
The flights to Auckland and Christchurch will be numbers restricted to align with the number of spaces available in managed isolation facilities in New Zealand.
As a result only 40 to 60 people are expected to be able to travel on each service.
Air New Zealand chief customer and sales officer Leanne Geraghty said they were experiencing a very high volume of calls and messages and would endeavour to get residents home as quickly and safely as possible.
“We recognise this is a very stressful and emotional time for those customers wishing to return from New South Wales,” said Ms Geraghty.
“Our teams have worked tirelessly with the government over the weekend to get these managed return flights up and running so we can reconnect Kiwis with their loved ones.”
She said flights would be available on a “first-in, first-served basis”.
“Around 20 per cent of all available managed isolation facility spots will be reserved for compassionate grounds which will be managed by the government,” Ms Geraghty said.
“We appreciate our customers’ understanding and patience as our teams work to ensure they are kept up to date.”
The trans-Tasman bubble is currently not operating between New Zealand and New South Wales and Queensland.
Those in other states and territories travelling to New Zealand are now required to get a pre-departure Covid test at their own expense to confirm their negative status.

Jess Malcolm 9.55am: NSW Premier to speak at 11am
Gladys Berejiklian will address the media at 11am this morning alongside Health Minister Brad Hazzard, Chief Health Officer Kerry Chant and Police Commissioner Mick Fuller.
Authorities are expected to announce case numbers above 100, after the NSW Premier said on Sunday she would be “shocked” if they were anything less.
Police have also said they will be cracking down on compliance of stay-at-home orders, announcing a major shift towards being more firm than fair amid the worsening outbreak.
Compulsory check in to all workplaces and retail settings will now be enforced today, with authorities pleading with people to diligently sign to allow contact tracers to track any potentially exposed cases.
The state recorded 77 infections on Sunday bringing the total number in the latest outbreak to 566.
Jess Malcolm 9.35am: Next few days cases ‘critical’
Infectious diseases expert Catherine Bennett says high case numbers detected in recent days would be “unnerving” NSW Health authorities considering they would have been infectious in the community over a week ago.
Professor Bennett said the next few days’ case numbers were critical in helping officials understand just how far the virus has spread.
NSW Premier Gladys Berejiklian has conceded it is “highly unlikely” Sydney’s lockdown will end on Friday as planned since Covid case number are heading in the wrong direction. Cases are predicted to surge past 100 today after 77 new locally acquired cases were recorded on Sunday with 33 unknowingly infectious in the community. Ms Berejiklian wants to see case numbers as close to zero as possible to ensure no chains of transmission have been missed before the lockdown comes to an end.

“As they go and find those cases, test the people around them and find more cases, it’s not good in terms of the total case numbers,” she told Today.
“It probably tells us that they’re finding more cases out of this and getting a better understanding of how far the spread has gone.”
Professor Bennett also said the graphic new advertising campaign targeting Sydneysiders to stay home might work considering the success of previous public health campaigns designed to warn against smoking and road traffic accidents.

Glenda Korporaal 9.25am: Economic recovery depends on rollout: Cormann
The world economic recovery faces “serious downside risks” from any new outbreaks of more lethal Covid-19 variants, OECD secretary-general Mathias Cormann has warned.
In an exclusive interview with the Australian from the G20 meeting in Venice on the weekend, the former federal finance minister said the most important economic priority at the moment was to accelerate the rollout of the vaccine.
“Economic policy priority number one, two and three remains to vaccinate as many people all around the world as possible, as quickly as possible,” he said.
“The concern remains that new variants of the virus will create more lethal waves of infections, with a new wave of economic hardship.”
The OECD’s official forecast is for global economic growth to increase to 5.8 per cent this year, a more upbeat scenario than the 4.2 per cent projected by the organisation last December.
But the latest outbreak of the Delta strain of the Covid virus is now generating new concerns for economic policymakers.

Jess Malcolm 9.05am: Call for more pharmacies to join rollout
Pharmacy Guild President Trent Twomey has called on the federal government to allow more pharmacies across the country to join the vaccination rollout, saying over 3000 are trained and ready to go.
Some 113 pharmacies in three states will begin administering Covid jabs from today in a bid to ramp up the rollout, with many concentrated in regional and remote areas.
But Mr Twomey said the commonwealth should bring more city-based pharmacies online, saying pharmacies could administer the vaccines in a similar fashion as they do the flu shot.
“We’re really hoping that with the support of the New South Wales government, the national government will reverse their hold or blockage or deferral on pharmacies in major metropolitan areas which should see up to an extra 900 pharmacies in greater Sydney come on board,” he told Sunrise.
Mr Twomey said some three million Australian received their flu shot in pharmacy settings last year.

Max Maddison 8.55am: Sharma calls for more financial support for business
Liberal MP Dave Sharma has called for more economic and financial support for businesses in Greater Sydney, as he backs the confronting vaccine campaign, saying there’s a “degree of complacency” across the community at the moment.
With the state and federal government at loggerheads over who will provide substantial financial support, Josh Frydenberg revealed he had turned down a request from his NSW counterpart to reimplement JobKeeper for businesses affected by the lockdown.
But while not calling directly for the wage subsidy program, Mr Sharma said signs the lockdown could extend for another four weeks meant there was “certainly a need” to provide support to struggling firms.
“I think we’re in for a longer lockdown than we first envisaged, and business and workers will need our support to get through this,” the Wentworth MP told Sky News on Monday morning.
Despite staunch criticism of the federal government’s vaccination advertising campaign, Mr Sharma said the community needed to take public health orders seriously, and the ad was designed to ensure they came forward to get their jab.
“It’s important. There probably is a degree of complacency within Sydney – I think we’ve all seen it,” he said. “Because we expected that, like with previous lockdowns, this would be over quite quickly and the numbers would remain low.”

Max Maddison 8.35am: Bowen calls for return of JobKeeper
Opposition spokesman for health Chris Bowen has called for JobKeeper to be reimplemented for businesses impacted by lockdowns.
With Greater Sydney struggling with an extended lockdown which appears likely to continue for weeks, businesses have called for greater government support, but Premier Gladys Berejiklian and Josh Frydenberg have disagreed over where the funding will come from.
The McMahon MP called on the Treasurer to design a support package similar to the wage subsidy package which could be injected into regions when they went into lockdown.
“It needs to be JobKeeper, or something very like it. The beauty of JobKeeper was it kept the employment relationship between the employer and the employee – i.e. when things get back to normal, the employee goes back to work and has been paid over the lockdown,” Mr Bowen told ABC’s Radio National.
“The current arrangements don’t do that, it’s direct payments through Centrelink. There needs to be a carefully designed package. It shouldn’t be Sydney specific, it should apply to all lockdown areas.”

Jess Malcolm 8.30am: Another double doughnut day for Vic
Victoria has recorded no new locally acquired cases of Covid-19, and no new infections in its hotel quarantine system.
There were 19,239 test results received, and the state administered 12,005 doses on Sunday.
There are currently just 19 active cases in the state.
Jess Malcolm 8.25am: Break Covid rules, ‘visit the courthouse’
NSW Police Minister David Elliott has commended Sydneysiders for obeying stay-at-home orders over the weekend, reporting police are “quite comfortable” with the levels of compliance.
While he had been pleased with briefings from police, Mr Elliott threatened authorities would not be afraid to step up enforcement for people flouting the rules.
Deputy Police Commissioner Gary Worboys said on Sunday police will start to be “more firmer than fairer” following reports of large groups of people gathering to play cards and PlayStation over the weekend.
“That means they will not be using the high levels of discretion they have in the past in the last couple of days,” Mr Elliot told Today.
“They have been working with communities particularly those communities that don’t listen to mainstream media and maybe haven’t got the message so the days of excuses will soon
end and you will find yourself with either a $1,000 ticket or a trip to a courthouse.”
Mr Elliott also said he thinks people will respond well to the new graphic advertising campaign encouraging people to stay home, and that people would not be “at a loss” listening to the message.
“I think people will respond and it is a talking point to make sure people realise what they put at risk by flouting the rules and what they’re putting at risk by not getting the Covid shot.”

Max Maddison 8.15am: Frewen defends vaccination ad campaign
Vaccine commander Lieutenant-General John Frewen says the decision to use a confronting Covid-19 vaccination ad wasn’t made “ lightly”, but leaves people in “no doubt” about the seriousness of getting the virus.
The Morrison government’s confronting advertising campaign, which depicts a young woman on a ventilator struggling to breathe, has been blasted for being insensitive. But Lieutenant-General Frewen said there was “serious consideration” about whether it was required, but leant on expert advice.
“It is absolutely confronting and we didn’t use it lightly,” Lieutenant-General Frewen told Nine’s Today show on Monday morning.
“There was serious consideration given to whether it was required and we took expert advice. We took medical advice from Professor Kelly and we thought it was the time to run that ad in Sydney right now.”

Jess Malcolm 7.55am: Sydney outbreak outpacing Vic’s deadly second wave
Burnet Institute epidemiologist Mike Toole has warned the Sydney outbreak is moving much faster than Melbourne’s deadly second wave, warning residents could be in lockdown for at least another four weeks.
Professor Toole told Sky News Melbourne took 37 days to reach 566 total cases, which Sydney reached on Sunday in just 25 days.
“The pace of this outbreak is actually faster than Victoria’s second wave and that is due to the Delta variant which is very infectious,” he said.
“The proportion of new cases that have been out in the community is very concerning. Keep in mind those new cases were infected four to seven days earlier.
“If 33 people were out in the community it is inevitable that there will be more spread. We are basically seeing what happened a week ago.”
Professor Toole said it was “impossible” Sydneysiders would be freed from lockdown this Friday, saying it took Melbourne seven weeks to drive 100 cases a day down to zero.
He said another four weeks lockdown after this Friday was needed to reduce numbers permanently, and was a distinct possibility.
He also urged authorities to implement a Victorian-style stage four lockdown, limiting travel to 5kms, closing down all non-essential retail and imposing a curfew.

Jess Malcolm 7.40am: Warning hospitals may cancel elective surgery
St Vincent’s infectious diseases physician David Anderson said Sydney hospitals may have to cancel non urgent medical procedures if case numbers surge, with hospitals already facing unprecedented demand in winter.
Doctor Anderson said the healthcare system may be forced to cancel elective surgeries to make space for a wave of Covid-19 cases if the outbreak gets out of control.
“Winter is already our busy time,” he told Today. “We already had, even before this Covid wave, unprecedented bed blocks across the state and we are still doing elective surgery and the Covid clinical activity comes on top of what is already an extremely busy time for the healthcare system.
“It just makes everything we do less efficient and means we can’t do our normal jobs.
“We can’t look after patients with cancer, with heart attacks, with strokes as efficiently as we could if we weren’t looking after Covid as well.”
Dr Anderson said hospitals are not yet overwhelmed, but will need to consider where the systems could be further stretched or how to share the load.

Jess Malcolm 7.25am: Plibersek: Vax ads useless without enough doses
Shadow Minister for Education Tanya Plibersek has taken aim at the federal government’s new targeted graphic advertising campaign which features a young woman in hospital gasping for breath.
Ms Plibersek criticised the approach of using a young person sick with the virus considering the age cohort is not yet eligible for vaccination.
“We know from the New South Wales government that people who are being hospitalised with this (Delta virus) include younger people in their 20s and 30s,” she told Sunrise.
“You’d think with that kind of experience in that kind of track record, they do a better job, and one of the problems with advertising campaigns and perhaps the reason it’s taken so long is if you encourage people to go and get vaccinated, you’ve got to have enough of the vaccine available, and we simply haven’t.”
Ms Plibersek also called for more economic measures to help individuals and businesses struggling under Sydney’s Covid restrictions, saying most people “just barely scraped through” the first lockdown.

Jess Malcolm 7.05am : Littleproud backs NSW open state strategy
Agriculture minister David Littleproud has taken aim at some state and territory premiers for locking down prematurely and demanding Covid relief funding, backing the NSW government for resisting calls for restrictions and keeping the state open.
Mr Littleproud told Today the federal government has to strike a balance between providing emergency Covid economic relief packages and protecting people’s health.
“That’s about making sure we don’t have state premiers, not necessarily NSW which has done a very good and measured job in terms of lockdowns, but we have other states that have been jumping the gun on this and just expecting the good old Australian taxpayer to foot the bill,” he told Today.
“It is a great business model. They look strong and the Australian taxpayer foots the bill.”
Mr Littleproud said the strong working relationship between Gladys Berejiklian and Scott Morrison means Sydney residents can expect a targeted and measured economic support package.
He refused to say whether the commonwealth will funnel more Pfizer vaccines into the state amid the unfolding Covid outbreak, but assured people the vaccine rollout was ramping up.

Jess Malcolm 6.50am: Passengers exposed in Launceston-Melbourne flight
Victorian health authorities are urgently contacting passengers on a Qantas flight between Launceston and Melbourne after they were potentially exposed to Covid-19.
Officials are investigating the case of a Launceston hospital worker who tested negative but flew home to London and returned a positive test result.
Tasmanian and Victorian public health services say they are acting out of caution, as the worker spent two weeks in isolation in Tasmania making it unlikely that he caught the virus there.
It is suspected the person caught the virus while travelling from Australia to the UK.
The worker spent a brief time in Melbourne airport but the Melbourne domestic and international terminals are not considered exposure sites.
Tasmanian health authorities have added several exposure sites including a bottle shop, Salvation army store and an Officeworks but officials say the risk is low.

Jess Malcolm 6.25am: NSW braces for more than 100 new local cases
Sydneysiders are bracing themselves for locally acquired cases to surge past 100 after NSW Health added dozens more exposure sites overnight and Gladys Berejiklian warned the outbreak will get worse before it gets better.
Several major inner city shopping centres were added as contact venues late Sunday night, as the state recorded 77 new cases on Sunday with 33 new infections active while in the community.
Miranda Westfield, Fairfield Forum shopping centre, Neeta City shopping centre, Westfield Eastgardens are among some of the new venues added by NSW joining a long list which include several appliance stores, supermarkets and medical centres.
NSW recorded its first death during the latest outbreak on Sunday in a woman in her 90s who died in Liverpool Hospital, reinforcing authorities’ pleas for people to stay home and stop visiting extended families and friends.
It comes after the federal government launched its new campaign for the vaccination rollout which urges Australian to “arm themselves” against the virus.
Sydney residents are also encouraged to stay home by a targeted, new graphic video of a young woman gasping for breath in hospital.
There have now been 52 hospitalisations related to Covid-19, with 15 people in intensive care and five on ventilators.
Victorian authorities also slammed shut their border to NSW and ACT as the outbreak worsened, upgrading the entire regions to “red zones” under their traffic light permit system.

Patrick Commins 5.50am: Covid ‘turbocharges’ Sydney house prices
Covid-19 has “turbocharged” house prices and will leave Sydney buyers having to shell out an extra $125,000 to purchase a property, new KPMG modelling says.
The analysis shows home­buyers across the country now face a “Covid premium” for their houses as part of a global phenomenon driven by a dramatic fall in borrowing rates during the pandemic as central banks moved to boost economic activity.
The KPMG modelling estimates Brisbane property buyers will be paying 10 per cent more for homes by the end of 2023 thanks to the pandemic — $660,000 versus $600,000 had the health crisis not occurred.
The Covid premium in Sydney is similar in percentage terms, but equates to a larger dollar value thanks to the city’s already inflated property prices: $1.24m against $1.12m in the counterfactual where there had been no virus.
For comparison, the median Sydney house price in late 2019 was $986,000, according to the Australian Bureau of Statistics.

Jess Malcolm 5.30am: Clamp down or ‘be overwhelmed’
Epidemiologists and outbreak management experts have called for tougher restrictions as the Sydney outbreak surged to 566 cases, stoking fears NSW contact tracers are losing their grip on the virus.
As Sydney entered a new dynamic of the outbreak on Sunday, recording 77 new cases of locally acquired transmission, some epidemiologists warned of similarities to Melbourne at the start of its deadly second wave and fear an exponential rise in cases if authorities don’t clamp down.
While infection rates have slowed in Sydney’s eastern suburbs, authorities are concerned about rapid transmission of the Delta variant across social groups and connected households in the southwest suburbs, which now account for most of the new cases.
A Miranda David Jones department store, a Wetherill Park Officeworks and a Glebe JB Hi-Fi and Harvey Norman were among venues added to exposure sites on Sunday night, raising questions about people leaving home for non-essential items.
As department stores remained open across Sydney, Gladys Berejiklian has repeatedly refused to define what shopping is allowed, instead insisting people must stay home unless they absolutely needed something.
But UNSW epidemiologist Mary-Louise McLaws said the communication was confusing, allowing people to interpret the rules as they saw fit.
“It’s not working because people are not infection-control experts, most people will interpret the rules in a fashion that allows them latitude,” she said.
“A lockdown is highly effective when it’s done completely, not with retail shops open …”

Stephen Lunn 5.15am: Melbourne CBD ‘won’t recover until 2024’
Melbourne’s CBD economy will not return to pre-Covid levels until late 2024 or early 2025, when there will still be almost 20,000 fewer ­people working in the central city than before the pandemic began.
A study by Deloitte Access Economics reveals the flight of workers from Melbourne’s CBD was deeper than other capital city centres in 2020, driven by the more severe lockdown, and will take longer to recover.
The study said Melbourne’s CBD endured an “unprecedented shock” as a result of the pandemic and lockdown, with economic activity more than halving from $75bn in 2019 to $35bn in 2020.
But it’s recovery timeline projects a relatively strong rebound in 2021, up 16.9 per cent to $41bn, and then a big bounce in 2022 with economic activity jumping by 33 per cent to $55bn.
By late 2024 or early 2025, it is projected to have returned to its 2019 mark of $75bn.
Melbourne’s office workers will be slower back to work than other states, and will still be 5.5 per cent or 19,700 workers short of pre-pandemic levels by the end of the five-year forecast period.
Sydney will have about the same number of workers in its CBD by 2025 as there were in 2019, according to the projections.
The study does not factor in Melbourne’s lockdown last month or Sydney’s current lockdown.

States must honour PM’s plan to reopen the nation

Full text: That proviso is producing alarming consequences for hard-pressed Australians abroad and their families, with some one-way economy airfares from London to Australia soaring at the weekend. Capacity needs to be restored as soon as possible, especially if the vaccine rollout continues at its present pace of about a million jabs a week. Business, quite reasonably, is pushing hard for the road map to have lockdowns scrapped and the international border reopened by the start of next year.
With 9 per cent of Australians fully vaccinated and 30 per cent having had one jab so far, GPs will begin offering the Pfizer vaccine to 40 to 59-year-olds from this week. It will push the rollout closer to allowing the nation to move to the next phase of Mr Morrison’s plan. In the meantime, phase one includes important steps that will help boost the economy and encourage greater movement. State leaders need to co-operate in implementing those measures. They cover new quarantine options, including home quarantine for returning vaccinated travellers; expanding trials for the entry of student and economic visa holders; and lockdowns being used only as a last resort.
Barring unforeseen disaster, the current NSW lockdown should be the nation’s last. At this stage, the Berejiklian government is quietly confident it will be lifted on schedule at the end of this week.
At this stage, setting the vaccine thresholds for moving to the next phase of the four-phase plan is a critically important step. The targets – to be set by the COVID-19 Risk Analysis and Response Taskforce, based on scientific modelling conducted by the Doherty Institute – need to be realistic or the whole four-step agreement will fail, as Australian Industry Group chief executive Innes Willox warns: “We don’t want to set ourselves up to fail.” What is agreed has to be achievable and in a reasonable time frame, as he says. “To have a percentage target that is too high just defeats the purpose of having an agreement.”
The federation is fragile enough, as Mr Willox says, without a premier or chief health officer taking it on themselves to think they know best and undermining co-operation. The last thing the nation needs is a repeat of last week’s spectacle when Queensland Premier Annastacia Palaszczuk and chief health officer Jeannette Young unleashed a reckless assault on the vaccine rollout. Once set, the timetables will work only “if all the states and territories agree to end the patchwork of restrictions and work together in the national interest”, as Business Council of Australia chief executive Jennifer Westacott says.
As well as being critical to long-term productivity and prosperity, executing Mr Morrison’s four-phase plan will be an important test of the ability of the federation to unite in a crisis. In the early stage of the pandemic, national cabinet served the public well. Subsequent brawling, however, highlighted the shortcomings of the system. In the recovery phase, the states and territories need to look beyond parochialism to ensure borders can open and interaction with the outside world can resume as soon as possible. In a global economy, operating in a bubble is not conducive to trade, investment, public and business confidence, and building momentum for growth and jobs when other nations have reopened. Premiers must be accountable for honouring the agreement.

Covid-19: States hold key to freedom from lockdowns, business warns

Full text: While the Prime Minister on Friday clinched a deal at national cabinet for a path back to normality where Covid-19 is treated like other infectious diseases, business is pushing the government to go further by scrapping lockdowns and reopening the international border by the start of next year.
On Sunday Qantas chief executive Alan Joyce said having “clear metrics” about the next phase of the recovery was critical but he warned the public was “not of a mindset to say lockdowns should be continuing into next year”.
Australian Industry Group chief executive Innes Willox said state governments needed to abide by the plan and open up when the new vaccine thresholds were met. He said “business have had enough of lockdowns” and “the thought of more lockdowns this winter quite frankly terrifies people”.
“Our federation is already fragile enough without a premier or their chief medical officer taking it on themselves to think that they know best,” Mr Willox said.
Business Council of Australia chief executive Jennifer Westacott warned precise vaccine targets and timetables would work only “if all the states and territories agree to end the patchwork of restrictions and work together in the national interest”.
“People are depending on national cabinet to work together quickly to develop a realistic plan with achievable targets, based on the best health advice and in line with the supply of vaccine,” Ms Westacott said.
The push from business groups came as deputy chief medical officer Michael Kidd said 500 GPs across the nation would begin offering the Pfizer vaccine to those aged 40 to 59 from this week, as the government ramped up the rollout amid criticism it had been too slow.
“During this month another 800 general practices will come online with the Pfizer vaccine as well as the AstraZeneca vaccine,” Professor Kidd said.
“This includes many Aboriginal community-controlled organisations, which will be offering the Pfizer vaccine progressively through July and August.”
There were 16 new Covid-19 cases reported in NSW on Sunday, with Queensland and Western Australia each recording one case.
Speaking on Sunday, NSW Premier Gladys Berejiklian said more specifics were needed about the four-step reopening plan unveiled by Mr Morrison on Friday.
“The public would like to see some time frames, and I look forward to being part of those discussions,” Ms Berejiklian said.
“If national cabinet has determined a unified approach across the nation, I’m more than happy to support what that unified approach is, but I think we need to be ambitious and we also need timelines to give to the community.”
NRL: 13 Dragons players have been given fines by the police in relation to a Covid breach which threatens to jeopardise the league.
Ms Berejiklian previously has flagged a vaccination target of 80 per cent of the adult population before NSW begins reconsidering Covid-19 public health measures.
But Mr Willox said any new vaccine targets – to be set by the COVID-19 Risk Analysis and Response Taskforce based on scientific modelling conducted by the Doherty Institute – needed to be realistic or the whole four-step agreement would fail.
“We don’t want to set ourselves up to fail. What is agreed has to be achievable and in a reasonable time frame,” he said. “To have a percentage target that is too high just defeats the purpose of having an agreement.”
Grattan Institute health program director Stephen Duckett said Ms Berejiklian’s goal of 80 per cent was realistic but any vaccine threshold needed to apply to the entire population, including children. He conceded the task of coming up with the “magic number” would be a “complex equation” due to the varying risk factors for different age groups, with the government ideally aiming for “very, very high levels” of vaccination among those who were vulnerable and “moderate” levels of vaccination for less affected cohorts.
“When you’re setting the threshold you’re trying to make Covid look more like the flu, where you might have 1000 deaths a year. You would hope to convert Covid from a really deadly disease into something we’re more used to accepting,” he said.
Mr Joyce told The Australian there was potential for national cabinet to “find common ground” on vaccination thresholds, saying he agreed with Victorian Premier Daniel Andrews when he said last week that lockdowns should end when “everyone who wants to be vaccinated has been given an opportunity to do that”.
“If the logic of Dan Andrews and (Queensland Premier) Annastacia Palaszczuk applies, once we’ve got every adult who wants a vaccine to be vaccinated, then surely that should be the threshold,” he said. “I support that logic.”
Mr Joyce also pushed for a 2022 reopening of domestic and international borders given Mr Morrison’s view that every Australian in want of a vaccine would have one by the end of the year.
“Most people should be vaccin­ated before the end of the calendar year,” he said. “Hopefully they can meet that time frame.”
Anthony Albanese, however, said the lack of detail in the four-step deal announced on Friday “says it all”.
“The fact is that the rest of the world is opening up, Australia continues to be locked down in large part,” the federal Opposition Leader said. “That’s a direct result of the failure of the government on two issues: on failing to roll out the vaccine effectively and failing to put in place appropriate fit-for-purpose quarantine facilities.”
Deloitte Access Economics partner Chris Richardson said Australians were “stuck under the doona” because the population was “terrified” by Covid-19, arguing the success of the four-step plan unveiled by Mr Morrison would depend on overcoming vaccine hesitancy and the ability of premiers to honour the deal.
“The four-stage plan is fine but there are many potholes on that path out from whether it is individuals who will remain too scared around vaccines, and we simply won’t hit the percentage targets that the Doherty Institute eventually gives us, to states who might sign on to the four stages in theory but not necessarily in practice,” Mr Richardson said. “The question is whether it’s achievable.”
Tony Shepherd, who headed Tony Abbott’s commission of audit in 2014, said the “unfortunate thing in this crisis is that competitive federalism may be working against what is good for the whole”.
“And what’s good for the whole is, while protecting the health of everybody, to return the economy to full speed as full as possible,” Mr Shepherd said. “Politicians have realised in this that they can build community support by demonstrating that they are safe and sensible leaders … but at some stage we have got to put the national good above the state good.”

As Victoria’s restrictions ease, Queensland health minister has message for border dodgers: ‘you will be caught’ .
At least five Victorians have been caught sneaking across Queensland’s border this month. For the first time since the current outbreaks emerged, there have been no new locally-acquired infections in Victoria in the 24 hours to Friday. According to new research, the CoronaVac vaccine has proven to be 100pc successful in preventing death and severe disease. And a new mystery cluster of four cases in a household in Melbourne’s north has spooked Victorian health authorities, prompting a backflip on plans to ease rules governing the wearing of masks outdoors.

Rachel Baxendale 9.00pm: Surgery to resume, but without visitors
The Andrews government has succumbed to pressure from medical professionals and agreed to allow elective surgery to resume in Melbourne hospitals from Tuesday, but hospital ­patients still face an ongoing ban on visits from loved ones due to coronavirus restrictions.
News that there had been no new community-acquired cases of coronavirus in Victoria on Friday also renewed calls for a re­laxation of rules that prevent Victorians from having guests in their homes or driving more than 25km until at least next Thursday.
Health authorities warned that the current outbreak was not over, pointing to recent unlinked clusters and coronavirus detections at four Victorian sewage treatment plants where there are no known active cases.
The decision to allow elective surgery follows calls from patients and medical professionals, who highlighted what they saw as a double standard that has ­allowed Melburnians to go to a ­restaurant or get their nails done, but not have a medical procedure in a sterile environment with ­vaccinated doctors and nurses.

Adeshola Ore 8.00pm: Call to get moving on travel bubble
Tourism and industry groups are urging the federal government to fast track a quarantine-free travel bubble between Australia and Singapore, after Scott Morrison and his Singaporean counterpart confirmed the scheme will include a pilot program for students.
The Prime Minister also flagged that the travel bubble would focus on mutual recognition of digital vaccination certificates. Ahead of his departure to the G7 summit in the UK, Mr Morrison met Singapore Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong. He confirmed the city-state would be next in line for a travel bubble with Australia, after two-way travel resumed with New Zealand in April.
The commencement date will be linked to vaccination and transmission rates, with Mr Lee saying it would require the “majority” of the Australian population to be inoculated. Singapore has vaccinated more than one-third of its population, but less than 3 per cent of Australians are fully vaccinated.
The Australian Chamber of Commerce and Industry said the negotiations between the two leaders came “not a moment too soon,” after they were paused following a recent Covid-19 breakout in Singapore.

Geoff Chambers 6.45pm: Morrison commits 20m doses to workd vaccine effort
Scott Morrison will commit 20 million doses to assist the British effort to vaccinate the world by the end of 2022 with the Prime Minister saying Australia was playing its part on the global stage to combat the pandemic.
Mr Morrison made the announcement after touching down in the UK at the RAF Brize Norton base in Oxfordshire after his flight was diverted four hours north of Cornwall due to heavy fog.
Ahead of the G7 leaders’ meeting, Mr Morrison flagged he would be advocating for a free and open Indo-Pacific and provided an assurance the 20 million vaccines being committed by Australia would be rolled-out in the immediate region.
“These 20 million doses will go to support doses in our region, to ensure that we continue to exercise our responsibility,” he said.
Mr Morrison said Australia had the capacity to make the commitment because it had put in place supply contracts “many times over what is needed for the Australian population.”
“That puts us in a very strong position,” he said. “I’ve had discussions in recent weeks with Pacific leaders and leaders in South-East Asia and I know that’s greatly appreciated that Australia will be doing its bit in our region, but also as part of a global effort.”
“I really do commend Prime Minister Johnson for bringing us together to put even more effort into this area because the virus doesn’t know boundaries … the virus goes where it will.”
Mr Morrison said the extra doses came on top of Australia’s $100 million commitment in support for the COVAX initiative aimed at ensuring equitable access for vaccines across the globe, including for lower and middle income nations unable to pay for jabs themselves.
The key issues on the agenda at the G7 identified by Mr Morrison included the Covid-19 pandemic, the recession, the global recovery, climate change, the transition to new energy sources and stability in the Indo-Pacific and the world.
Amid reports that Joe Biden plans to use the G7 meeting to lobby the group against Chinese economic coercion and its treatment of Uighurs in XinJiang, Mr Morrison said that Australia always welcomed the “great friendship and support that we have from our ally the United States.”
He said Australia would discuss defence and technology co-operation at the G7, as well as the importance of maintaining strong supply chains across the globe, arguing the meeting was about “ensuring a world that favours freedom.”
Mr Morrison said that all nations should be able to “trade with each other and all countries, wherever they are, whoever they are … without coercion.”
He said there was “no substitute for leaders getting together” but noted the pandemic was raging outside Australia, noting that the UK was recording 7,000 cases a day despite having a vaccination rate on first doses of well over 70 per cent.
However, Mr Morrison said there was a “bit of work to do yet” on finalising a free-trade agreement with the UK.
Finn McHugh 6.35pm: Victoria overtakes NSW in vaccinations
More vaccine doses have now been administered in Victoria than NSW, as vaccination rates spiked during its latest Covid-19 outbreak.
Restrictions began to ease in Melbourne on Friday after a two-week lockdown, after the virus jumped the SA border at the end of last month.
Just over 48,000 doses were administered in Victoria on Thursday, almost 8000 more than in NSW, taking the state’s total to 1,558,081.
That figure stood at roughly 31,000 more than NSW, where 1,527,100 doses had been administered.

Finn McHugh 5.45pm: Victoria won’t get more federal support
Support for Victorians is now a matter for the state government, after its lockdown “dented confidence” and cost jobs, the Treasurer says.
Melburnians woke up to eased restrictions on Friday, after an initial seven-day lockdown was extended to the end of this week as the state brought its latest Covid-19 outbreak under control.
The federal government in June unveiled a new emergency payment for Australians stuck in commonwealth-designated Covid-19 hotspots, with the Commonwealth to cover the cost of payments to individuals and the states to fund those to businesses.
Speaking after talks with state and territory treasurers on Friday, Josh Frydenberg said states “make decisions about lockdowns” and were responsible for additional support once the payment was no longer available.
“It’s very clearly defined. It relates to where there is a commonwealth hotspot, and now that hotspot has been lifted here in Victoria,” he told reporters in Melbourne.

Jack Paynter 5.10pm: Vaccine hesitancy ‘could lead to thousands of deaths’
Almost 5000 Victorians could die from Covid-19 in just 12 months if the virus is “left to run” without a public health response, new modelling has revealed.
Experts say the research, developed by the Burnet Institute, has highlighted the need to preserve public health measures as a key line of defence against coronavirus even with high vaccination coverage.
The COVASIM mathematical modelling also suggested Australia was unlikely to achieve herd immunity with current levels of vaccine hesitancy and the higher infectiousness of new variants.

Rachel Baxendale 4.29pm: Driving through floods ‘could be the last decision you make’
The SES has urged Victorians not to drive through floodwaters, amid fears the Traralgon Creek in the Gippsland town of Traralgon in Victoria’s east could rise to above major flood level on Saturday.
The warning follows the death on Thursday of a man in his 60s at Woodside, 70km southeast of Traralgon, and the discovery of a woman’s body in floodwaters at Glenfyne, 45km east of Warrnambool, in Victoria’s southwest, on Friday morning. Both appear to have died while attempting to drive through floodwaters.
SES Victorian chief operating officer Tim Wiebusch said severe weather on Wednesday night had resulted in “tree carnage” and closed roads across the southern part of the Great Dividing Range, from the Macedon Ranges to the Central Highlands, Yarra Ranges, Dandenongs and across to the Latrobe Valley and Bass Coast.
Mr Wiebusch said there had been more than 7,400 requests for SES assistance since Wednesday night, more than 5,800 of which had related to fallen trees.
Victoria SES Operations Chief Officer Tim Wiebusch says the organisation is frantically working to provide assistance to areas impacted by flooding.
“We still have over 100 roads that are now closed as a result of the tree carnage,” he said.
Mr Wiebusch said about 2,500 requests for assistance were still yet to be cleared, with reinforcements being provided by SES and CFA volunteers from all over the state, Forest Fire Management Victoria and the forestry industry.
The two most significant ongoing road closures are those of the Mount Dandenong Tourist Road and Maroondah Highway from Healesville to Narbethong, both east of Melbourne.
Mr Wiebusch said 42 flood rescues had taken place over the past 24 hours, with an emergency warning in place for the Yarra River at Coldstream, northeast of Melbourne, on Friday afternoon, in addition to the evacuation order for Traralgon.
Flood warnings are also in place for Sale and the Mitchell river in Gippsland, in Victoria’s East, and for the Thomson and Werribee rivers in the hills to the north and west of Melbourne.
“We can’t emphasise enough to never attempt to drive through flash floodwaters. It could be the last decision you make.”
Already on Thursday, 30 homes had been impacted by flooding in Traralgon, Hazelwood and Maffra in Gippsland.
“The challenge for our community in Traralgon is while the water has receded and the Princes Highway has reopened, we are expecting to see up to another 80-100mm of raib over the Traralgon catchment later today and throughout the night.
“The advice that we have is that it will result in a renewed major flooding.”

Debbie Schipp 3.50pm: You will be found out: Border dodgers warned
As Victoria’s restrictions ease, the nervous wait continues for many across NSW and Queensland regions after lockdown dodgers sparked a flurry of testing at exposure sites in both states.
Queensland has issued a grim warning to those attempting to jump the border illegally after police reveal five more people were caught fleeing lockdown for the Sunshine State.
Queensland Police Deputy Commissioner Steve Gollschewski said “random intercept” checks had turned up five people have failed to comply with directions coming into Queensland, including two women who crossed at Goondiwndi, the same crossing the Victorian couple who have since tested positive to Covid-19 in Caloundra made, on June 4.
“Two women were intercepted having come across the Goondiwindi border … and they have been issued with penalty infringement notices of $4003,” Commissioner Steve Gollschewski said.
“On top of that, we have had another male person who has come into Dalby via the Coolangatta border who has also been fined for having an untrue declaration on their border pass, and two persons in the Wide Bay district to have come up from Victoria as well who had no border pass at all.”
Queensland health minister Yvette D’Ath pulled no punches – with a stark warning to those coming to Queensland “who do not have the exemptions or travel declarations to do so”.
“We will be making sure that you are found. This is an offence. You cannot come into this state if you are from a hotspot and put our state at risk. And we will make sure that you will face the consequences if you do that,” she said.
“So these people who think that they can avoid our border controls by jumping in their car and coming across, it is every chance that you will be found out. Either someone will be picking up the phone and telling us, or the police will be doing intercepts and finding you.”
The couple who sparked the Covid crisis could face prosecution in three states, and possible jail time.
Police are waiting to interview the infected pair — who are in isolation in Sunshine Coast Hospital — until it is deemed safe.

Rachel Baxendale 1.50pm: New warnings for four Victoria wastewater areas
Victorian chief health officer Brett Sutton has urged all Victorians living near four wastewater catchments, to monitor for coronavirus symptoms and get tested.
The call comes after fragments of the virus were detected in recent days in Melbourne’s north and east, as well as in Central Victoria.
Anyone who lives in or visited the following locations between June 3 and June 7 is urged to be vigilant:
– Glenroy, Hadfield, Oak Park, Pascoe Vale, in Melbourne’s north;
– Burwood East, Forest Hill, Glen Waverley, Scoresby, Vermont South, Wantirna South, Wheelers Hill, in Melbourne’s east;
– Balwyn, Balwyn North, Blackburn, Blackburn, North, Box Hill, Box Hill North, Bulleen, Doncaster, Doncaster East, Donvale, Mitcham, Mont Albert, Mont Albert North, Nunawading, in Melbourne’s east;
– California Gully, Eaglehawk, Epsom, Huntly, Jackass Flat, Maiden Gully, Marong, North Bendigo and Sailors Gully, near Bendigo in Central Victoria.
Professor Sutton warned that Victoria was “at the halfway point in many respects” in overcoming the current outbreaks.
He said Victorians should expect to get tested multiple times over the winter cold and flu season.
“There are many people who’ve been tested, who’ve gotten over an illness, and of course we’re in winter, who’ve developed symptoms again.
“So of course if it’s a worsening of some normal symptoms, if you’ve had symptoms resolve but again you’ve got upper respiratory tract infections symptoms, sore throat, runny nose, cough, fever, you really must get tested again.
“We will all go through winter as Victorians, probably needing to test once or twice or three times.
“That is the only way we can be sure we know where coronavirus is, and to run it out of the state.”
Professor Sutton also welcomed sustained vaccination numbers, with approximately 20,000 people visiting state-run centres most days, and another 30,000 being vaccinated through GP clinics.
“The higher coverage we get, the better off we are. It is our long-term way out of this,” he said.

Rachel Baxendale 1.50pm: Victoria’s mystery clusters both Kappa variant
Genomic sequencing has confirmed both of Victoria’s new mystery coronavirus clusters are the Kappa strain of the virus, and linked to the wider Whittlesea cluster which emerged on May 24 and originated with a man who caught the virus in an Adelaide quarantine hotel before returning to Melbourne on May 4.
The two latest clusters comprise four members of a household in Reservoir, in Melbourne’s north, and a couple from Melton, in the city’s outer northwest, who tested positive after travelling to Queensland.
Chief health officer Brett Sutton said the source of acquisition for the Reservoir household remained unclear, despite some “critical” close contacts testing negative.
“Some blood testing will be done for those cases to determine how far into their infection they are, when it most likely began, to help us investigate exactly when it was transmitted and where,” Professor Sutton said.
NED-3679-Indias-Mutant-Covid-19
He said Victorian health authorities were also investigating the acquisition source for the Queensland couple, who were finally interviewed by Victorian contact tracers late on Thursday, after undergoing the same process with Queensland and NSW authorities on Wednesday.
Victoria is still yet to list exposure sites for the couple, who left the state on June 1, despite NSW having done so within an hour of Queensland making the first case public on Wednesday.
“We have been looking quite a bit earlier than June for that acquisition, where they may have picked it up, whether or not they were infectious through that,” Professor Sutton said.
“It is difficult to say though. It does seem to be that they were right at the end of their infectiousness when they were tested in Queensland, so we need to go back to determine where they picked it up.
“Like the Reservoir household, the variant of concern appears to be the Kappa variant for these cases as well.”
Authorities are investigating links between the couple and the Craigieburn Central shopping centre, which was visited by nine people who subsequently tested positive for the virus.

Rachel Baxendale 1.35pm: ‘The week ahead probably won’t be all zeros’
Victorian chief health officer Brett Sutton has warned the state is likely to have more cases of community-acquired coronavirus confirmed in coming days, despite having no new cases on Friday.
“The week ahead probably won’t be all zero cases,” Professor Sutton said, citing thousands of primary close contacts who are currently in quarantine, “some of whom will become positive”.
He also warned that it had been less than 48 hours since Victoria detected new cases of “uncertain acquisition”.
The source of four cases in a Reservoir household in Melbourne’s north is yet to be identified, with health authorities also still investigating where a Melbourne couple who tested positive in Queensland may have contracted the virus.
“That’s a real lesson that we yet see cases. There’s still lots of investigation to go, and a really strong reason for everybody with symptoms to get tested, because you might be part of those unknown chains of transmission.”
Professor Sutton said there were 3400 primary close contacts of positive cases in isolation in Victoria as of Thursday, with 900 having tested negative and cleared their 14 day period in the previous 24 hours.

Adeshola Ore 1.15pm: Singapore travel bubble ‘can’t come too soon’
The Australian Chamber of Commerce and Industry says a travel bubble between Australia and Singapore should be established swiftly.
Scott Morrison has flagged that the quarantine-free travel bubble would focus on early pilot programs for students and set-up a mutual recognition of digital vaccination certificates. Following a meeting with Singapore Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong, the Prime Minister said the nation would be next in line for a travel bubble with Australia.
“Negotiations between Prime Minister Scott Morrison and Singapore Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong on quarantine-exempt, two-way travel come not a moment too soon,” the chamber’s acting chief executive Jenny Lambert said.
“ACCI strongly supports an arrangement that enables free movement of migrants, workers, international students and tourists, as well as goods and services.”
Ms Lambert said Australia was “continuing to haemorrhage billions in lost revenue” across numerous sectors including tourism, higher education and hospitality.
“Reopening our borders in a staged and safe manner is vital in meeting critical worker shortages, increasing international student enrolments and growing foreign tourist arrivals,” she said.
Last month, the chamber published a four-stage proposal for Australia’s reopening. Under the plan, fully vaccinated Australians would be eligible to travel to medium-risk countries once at least 80 per cent of the most vulnerable – essential workers and people aged 70 and over – were immunised.

Heidi Han 12.50pm: Delta variant’s swift, intense spread in southern China
Faster development of severe illness, more fevers and higher viral loads are among the key features of the Delta variant of Covid-19 that dominated the latest outbreak in southern China, according to Chinese experts.
The fast spread of the Delta variant led to strict “stay home” orders in parts of Guangzhou — Chian’s third largest Chinese city, where more than 13 million people reside — after a spike of cases in the centre of Canton province.
“Patients progressed into a severe or critically ill stage within only three or four days after the onset of symptoms,” Zhongde Zhang, a specialist in the local medical team, told Chinese state media.
“About 10 per cent to 12 per cent of patients enter severe and critical conditions, which is higher than before.”
According to Zhang’s clinical findings, Delta variant patients had more obvious symptoms, with about 80 per cent developing fever, and “a very high viral load, which decreases at a very slow speed”.
It echoes observations of another local chief doctor, Weiping Cai, who revealed that patients’ nasopharyngeal swab tests showed the viral load was “nearly double that of last year”.
The disease also developed faster: “the incubation period last year was 5.9 days on average, while this time it only takes 3.2 days”, Cai said.
Between May 21 and June 9, Guangzhou reported a total of 119 local acquired cases, including 112 confirmed cases and seven asymptomatic infections.
The partial lockdown in Guangzhou, also a sister city of Sydney, was the toughest China had taken since its height of the pandemic, when Wuhan and surrounding towns of Hubei province in Central China were in lockdown for 76 days.
It remains unknown how the latest wave of infections started in the major port city that accounts for over 90 per cent of China’s inbound arrivals during the pandemic.
Rachel Baxendale 12.30pm: Elective surgery to resume in Melbourne next week
Melbourne hospitals will be permitted to resume elective surgery from Tuesday, Acting Premier James Merlino has confirmed.
The decision follows immense pressure from patients and medical professionals, who highlighted what they saw as a double standard which has seen Melburnians able to go to a restaurant or get their nails done, but not undergo a medical procedure in a sterile environment with vaccinated doctors and nurses.
Victoria’s health system has been under great strain in recent months due to delayed treatment as a result of last year’s 112-day lockdown.
“This has been an anxious time for many Victorians whose surgery was delayed due to the pandemic,” Mr Merlino said on Friday.
“I want to advise the Victorian community, Melburnians, from Tuesday next week, hospitals will be able to restart their elective surgery lists, giving Victorians certainty they will get the care that they need.
“It is not as simple as flicking a switch. Hospitals need time to scale up. They need staff and resources available to ensure that Victorians needing surgery will receive world-class care that our health services have always provided. We will work hard to clear the backlog as quickly as possible.”
Mr Merlino said Victoria was in the midst of a $300 million elective surgery blitz, with an extra $136m provided in the recent state budget expected to fast-track 18,000 surgeries.
Hospital patients and aged care and disability facility residents are still unable to receive visits from loved ones under Victoria’s current restrictions.
Rachel Baxendale 12.15pm: Victorian virus outbreak ‘nowhere near over’
Acting Victorian Premier James Merlino has hailed the state’s first day with no new coronavirus cases since the first of the current clusters emerged on May 24 as a “terrific outcome”, but warned that the outbreaks are “nowhere near over”.
“We cannot be complacent but it is good news to be at zero,” Mr Merlino said.
Amid terrible weather on Thursday, there were 17,604 tests processed in Victoria in the 24 hours to Thursday night, down from 23,679 tests on Wednesday, 28,485 on Tuesday and well down from the June 2 record of 57,519.
Mr Merlino said the number was “good given the extreme weather conditions”, but warned authorities would like to see higher testing numbers, particularly near Craigieburn, in Melbourne’s outer northwest, where the Craigieburn Central shopping centre – linked to nine positive cases – is being investigated as a possible exposure site for a couple who subsequently tested positive for the virus in Queensland.
“I am asking Victorians that if you live in the Craigieburn area and did not get tested yesterday, please go out and get tested today, please make plans today to get tested immediately,” Mr Merlino said.
He said the easing of restrictions overnight on Thursday night meant more people would be moving around Melbourne, making getting tested and checking in using QR codes even more important.

Rachel Baxendale 11.55am: 121,000 Vic homes still without power after storms
Acting Victorian Premier James Merlino has thanked State Emergency Services volunteers for responding to more than 7,400 requests for assistance since wild storms destroyed houses and causes flooding across large parts of the state.
More than 121,000 Victorian homes are still without power, with weather warnings still in place across the state.
Mr Merlino, who lives in the storm-ravaged Dandenongs, east of Melbourne, warned the clean-up was only just beginning.
“We know it is not over yet,” he said.
“It was quite extraordinary leaving home and driving through the Dandenongs to work this morning, having a few different routes to go through to get off the mountain – massive trees across homes, across the roads, so my thanks again to all of the wonderful SES volunteers and everyone in our emergency services for the work that you do.”
Mr Merlino offered his thoughts and prayers to the loved ones of a man in his 60s who lost his life in floodwaters in Gippsland in Victoria’s east on Thursday.

Darren Cartwright 11.26am: Nearly 1000 contacts of Melbourne couple identified
Queensland Health has identified more than 950 contacts of a Melbourne couple who broke Victoria’s lockdown laws and have since tested positive to coronavirus.
Queensland’s chief health officer Dr Jeanette Young said there were up to 402 close contacts of the husband and wife who are quarantined in Sunshine Coast University Hospital.
Overall, contact tracers have identified 959 either close or casual contacts and the genome sequencing has shown the couple has the Kappa variant which is slightly less infectious but still a variant of concern, Dr Young said.

Lydia Lynch 11.23am: Queensland’s Melbourne ban in place for another week
Travel to Queensland from Greater Melbourne will remain restricted for at least another week.
Queensland lifted its border restrictions for regional Victoria on Friday when Melbourne’s two-week lockdown ended.
The Melbourne couple who brought COVID-19 to Queensland after escaping Melbourne’s lockdown could face prosecution in three states. Police are set to interview the infected couple when it is safe to do so after they have completed isolation. The couple did not have an exemption to enter Queensland and police are investigating if they lied on border declarations when travelling through New South Wales and why they did not enter mandatory hotel quarantine.
The state will review its closure to Melbourne in another week.
Police have encouraged Queenslanders to dob in border dodgers from Covid-hot spots as the state relies on an honesty system for those arriving via road.
At least five people escaping Victorian restrictions have been nabbed in Queensland this month.
The penalty for lying on a border pass is a $4000 fine.

The news conference comes as Melburnians enjoy their first day of relative post-lockdown freedom, amid lingering concerns over missing links between coronavirus cases detected in recent days and previously identified outbreaks.
Mr Wiebusch is expected to provide an update on damage caused by severe storms which have destroyed houses and resulted in the death of a man in his 60s who became trapped in his car in floodwaters in Gippsland on Thursday.

NSW has recorded one new case of Covid-19 in hotel quarantine overnight among an overseas returned traveller.
The state recorded 18,525 tests in the 24 hours to 8pm last night, down from 19,810 the previous day.
Over the same period NSW Health administered 15,623 COVID-19 vaccines, a third of which took place at Sydney Olympic Park vaccination hub.
Lydia Lynch 11.02am: Five Victorians caught fleeing to Queensland
At least five Victorians have been caught sneaking across Queensland’s border this month.
People fleeing coronavirus restrictions in Victoria have been driving through NSW and into Queensland, Health Minister Yvette D’Ath said.
“We will be making sure that you are found,” she said.
“This is an offence. You cannot come into this state if you are from a hotspot and put our state at risk.
“So these people who think that they can avoid our border controls by jumping in their car and coming across – it is every chance that you will be found out.
“Either someone will be picking up the phone and telling us, or the police will be doing intercepts and finding you.”
A Victorian couple who ignited a multi-state Covid-scare when they escaped Melbourne’s lockdown and tested positive remain in an isolation ward.
Travel to Queensland from Greater Melbourne has been banned since May 28 following an outbreak in Victoria.

Adeshola Ore 10.50am: Australia-UK free trade deal ‘very close’
Finance Minister Simon Birmingham says Australia and the UK are “very, very close” to an in-principle agreement free-trade deal between the two nations.
Following the G7 summit in Cornwall this week Scott Morrison will travel to London for a meeting with his British counterpart Boris Johnson at Downing Street where the pair hope to sign a deal.
Senator Birmingham, who last year launched negotiations for the post-Brexit deal, told Sky News: “It’s always useful in these negotiations to have some deadlines there and the leader’s meeting is a strong deadline.”
Sky News host Peta Credlin says global economic partnership arrangements are "about more than trade" – they are "a signal to the wider world about who matters and who you trust". "As current chair of the G7, what Boris Johnson is really trying to do here is refashion the old Euro-centric, economics-focused G7, into something that's global and geopolitically focused," she said. "He wants it to be the D10 – the ten major democracies: with Britain, the US, Germany, France, Japan, Italy, and Canada joined by Australia, South Korea, and India. "If at some point the G7 can formally segue into the D10, that will be good for our standing in the wider world as well as a key signal to China that the democracies are taking a stand against regional bullying and unfair trade practices." Ms Credlin said this of course would not come without some awkwardness given China remains our biggest trading partner and also the greatest strategic challenge. "This is where, as the emerging democratic superpower, India has such a big role to play. As a country that understands commerce and respects the rule of law, India could readily meet some of the supply chain challenges that losing China could bring," she said. "An important task for a prime minister with an increasingly deft grasp of diplomacy will be kickstarting the Australia-India free trade talks."
“From Australia’s perspective, we’ve always been clear from when I first launched these negotiations, that we’ll only do a good deal if it’s a good deal and if it is in Australia’s national interest to do the deal.”
British farmers are concerned the deal could have negative financial impacts for them by allowing Australian producers tariff-free access to the UK market.
Senator Birmingham said Australia would be looking to have as “open market as is possible for Australian goods to enter as free as tariffs and free as quotas as can be negotiated.”

Amy Silver 10.39am: Why people fear the return to the office
The reduction of Covid restrictions means many people must now return to working together in offices. For many of us, our bodies and brains will be distracted by the threats we feel as we emerge from the safety of our bubbles.
Tech Expert Trevor Long says one of the “big things” which was announced at Apple’s 2021 Worldwide Developers Conference was ‘Focus’ mode which will allow iPhone users to filter notifications between work and home. “So you might have do not disturb now on your phone but you’ll be able to say I’m in work mode or home mode,” he said. “When you’re in work mode those messages from your family and those group chats, they won’t come up. “When you’re in home mode, those emails from work won’t come up as notifications. They’ll still be there if you need them or want to get to them but you won’t be distracted by them. “You’ll get this ability to say I’m in work mode, I want to focus right now, and that’s the kind of notifications you’ll get”.
When our fear systems are activated, our fight (defend/attack/blame) or flight (avoid/freeze/run) reactions kick in. When we act in fear, our intelligence is dulled, we become distracted, our thoughts become more muddled, and our decision-making abilities become more biased as our brain tries to take shortcuts. We probably make poor choices. Fears and worries will cut down our connection, our communication and keep us looking towards stability, not innovation. Fear will eat at our engagement and motivation. Our collective intelligence will suffer and the impact will be on our productivity, capacity and capability.
Leaders need to manage people’s fears. Here are five things you can do to help.

Lydia Lynch 9.54am: ‘They should not have left’: Premier takes aim at couple
Annastacia Palaszczuk has hit out at the Victorian couple who ignited a multi-state Covid-scare when they fled Melbourne’s lockdown.
Police are yet to interview the pair who are isolating in a Covid-ward at the Sunshine Coast University Hospital, but authorities have confirmed they were not granted an exemption to enter the state.
“Honestly, everyone needs to do the right thing,” Ms Palaszczuk said.
“There was a lockdown on down in Melbourne, they should not have left Victoria, it just puts people at risk.
“I know there is an investigation into that, I do not want to jeopardise that investigation but we want to make sure we are keeping our country, and I especially want to make sure we are keeping Queenslanders safe.”
No new Covid-19 cases have been linked to the couple in Queensland.

Joseph Lam 9.20am: New research points to mixed vaccine benefit
Researchers have found that mixing Covid-19 vaccines has boosted the immune response of recipients, producing a spike in antibodies.
The news arrives as Several European nations and Canada have resorted to recommending different Covid-19 vaccines as a second dose for patients facing extended wait periods due to vaccine shortages.
Early data has found the approach, seen as a last resort, could actually benefit those who receive multiple vaccines, according to reports in the American Association for the Advancement of Science’s magazine.
Victoria Acting Premier James Merlino says the government’s response to future COVID-19 outbreaks in the state will be determined by public vaccination levels and the construction of more purpose-built quarantine facilities. Despite recording four new cases overnight, health authorities confirmed the state is still on track for an easing of restrictions at midnight on Thursday with the exception that masks will be required in all outdoor settings. Asked if Victorians would be faced with a series of continuing lockdowns in the future, Mr Merlino said a highly vaccinated population would bring “more comfort” to public health in responding to outbreaks. “We are not out of this pandemic until we are in a position where we’ve successfully rolled out the Commonwealth’s vaccine program, and we have purpose-built quarantine facilities to deal with our highest risk individuals,” he told reporters. “The more people you get vaccinated, the more comfort public health have in the advice that they give to government, in terms of how we respond to an outbreak. “If we are in a position now where the population was vaccinated at a level where we should be … if we had purpose-built facilities, then we may well not have the public health advice in terms of the lockdown we are just moving out of as of midnight tonight.”
The story cites three recent studies where researchers discovered strong immune responses in blood tests from recipients who received a dose of the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine after the AstraZeneca vaccine
“Two of the studies even suggest the mixed vaccine response will be at least as protective as two doses of the Pfizer-BioNTech product, one of the most effective COVID-19 vaccines,” it read.
It also cites Berlin Charité University Hospital infectious disease expert Leif Erik Sander who found that 61 health care workers given two vaccines about 10 to 12 weeks apart produced a spike in antibodies at levels comparable to those who received Pfizer-BioNTech three weeks apart.

Lydia Lynch 9.13am: ‘We’re at final hurdle for Olympics’
A vote on whether Brisbane will host the 2032 Olympic Games will be held on July 21.
The International Olympic Committee has decided to progress Queensland’s bid to a vote at the Tokyo games next month.
Brisbane Lord Mayor Adrian Schrinner said 84 per cent of venues were already built to host events for the games.
“It is not in the bag yet, but we are at that final hurdle,” he said.

Rachel Baxendale 8.45am: No new local cases in Victoria
Victoria has recorded no new community-acquired cases of coronavirus in the 24 hours to Friday, for the first time since the first of the current outbreaks emerged on May 24.
Amid terrible weather on Thursday, there were 17,604 tests processed in Victoria in the 24 hours to Thursday night, down from 23,679 tests on Wednesday, 28,485 on Tuesday and well down from the June 2 record of 57,519.
State-administered vaccination centres gave 20,752 jabs on Thursday, on par with 20,784 on Wednesday and up from 19,533 on Tuesday, but still down on last Thursday’s record of 24,169.
The total number of active cases in Victoria is now 75, down from 78 on Thursday, 83 on Wednesday and 94 on Tuesday, indicating early outbreak cases are recovering.
This number includes cases in overseas travellers in hotel quarantine, with one new hotel quarantine case confirmed in the 24 hours to Thursday.
The zero day comes after lockdown restrictions in Melbourne eased on Friday. Victorian health authorities are still working to establish the movements of a couple who left their Melton home in Melbourne’s outer northwest on June 1 and travelled through NSW to Queensland where they tested positive for coronavirus on Wednesday and Thursday respectively.
A possible link has been established to the Craigieburn Central shopping centre, which was attended by nine other positive cases.
Work is also ongoing to identify links between the main outbreaks and four members of a household in Reservoir, in Melbourne’s north, who were confirmed as having tested positive on Thursday.
A range of exposure sites in the Reservoir, Thomastown, Epping and Bundoora areas have since been listed.
Authorities are also urging residents near three wastewater treatment plants in Melbourne’s east and north to be on alert from symptoms after coronavirus fragments were detected in sewage from three sites where there are currently no confirmed cases.
The detections in Pascoe Vale in Melbourne‘s north, and Scoresby and Vermont in the east, come after unexpected detections in the Bendigo area on Wednesday and last week.
The latest cases follow four new cases on Thursday, one new case on Wednesday and two new cases on Tuesday, and bring the total number of community-acquired cases in Victoria since May 24 to 93.
The majority of those cases are genomically linked to a man in his 30s who caught coronavirus in an Adelaide quarantine hotel and returned to the northern Melbourne suburb of Wollert on May 4.
As was confirmed on Tuesday, at least 15 of the cases, centred around a West Melbourne family, are linked to a genomically distinct Delta cluster sparked by a man in his 40s who arrived in Melbourne from Sri Lanka on May 8.
Of 89 community-acquired cases in Victoria to Wednesday, 32 have been linked to the main Whittlesea cluster, which was the first to emerge on May 24, while an associated cluster centred on the Stratton Finance workplace in Port Melbourne comprises another 32 cases.
A further 10 cases have been linked to the Arcare aged care facility in Maidstone, in Melbourne‘s west.
While the Whittlesea, Port Melbourne and Arcare outbreaks are all genomically linked to the Wollert man, direct links to the Wollert man and the Arcare outbreak have not been established.

Adeshola Ore 8.28am: Tragic AZ death must be kept in perspective: Dutton
Defence Minister Peter Dutton says the second Australian fatality from blood clots likely linked to the AstraZeneca vaccine needs to be kept in perspective.
The TGA reported on Thursday a 52-year-old NSW woman died after developing blood clots after receiving the AstraZeneca vaccine.
Chief Medical Officer Professor Paul Kelly says the AstraZeneca vaccine remains an “extremely important” component of the vaccine rollout after it was revealed a 52-year-old woman's death was "related" to the jab. Professor Kelly said the woman was administered the vaccine a couple of weeks ago and developed an "extremely rare" blood clotting event. “It (AstraZeneca vaccine) remains an incredibly, extremely important part of our vaccine rollout with our large numbers of doses that are available here in Australia,” he said. “It is absolutely key in relation to us becoming safe from Covid as a population here in Australia, and that remains the case. “I will point out that this remains an extremely rare event to get these serious clots but when they happen, as we have seen in this case, it can have tragic consequences.”
“As tragic as clearly it is for that family, we have seen circumstances where in Canada 23,000 people have died from Covid and there have been some devastating numbers right around the world,” Mr Dutton told Channel 9.
“We haven’t had that here and we don’t want it, which is why the vaccine rollout is important. I think as you have seen in Victoria people have lined up in huge numbers to get the vaccine because they know this is our only pathway out of Covid.”
Chief Medical Officer Paul Kelly on Thursday said the death was “extremely unfortunate” and an “extremely rare event”.

Joseph Lam 8.11am: Indian doctors say gangrene, hearing loss linked to Delta
A Mumbai-based cardiologist says doctors in India are witnessing severe side effects to the Delta Covid-19 variant including hearing loss and gangrene.
Dr Ganesh Manudhane told The Sun he has seen a growing number of patients suffer from gangrene since the first wave of the virus struck India last year.
“I saw three-to-four cases the whole of last year, and now it’s one patient a week,” Dr Manudhane said.
Doctors who are treating patients with Covid-19 in India have identified shocking new symptoms including gangrene and hearing loss.
Some medics have said severe gastric upsets, hearing impairment and blood clots that lead to gangrene have been linked to the deadly Delta variant.
Chennai Apollo Hospital infectious disease physician Abdul Ghafer told Bloomberg the virus has become more unpredictable as new variants emerge.
“Last year, we thought we had learned about our new enemy, but it changed,” Dr Ghafer said. “This virus has become so, so unpredictable.”
Dr Ghafer said he’d also seen a rise in diarrhoea among patients with the virus.

Joseph Lam 7.54am: ‘Gamechanger’ to defeating pandemic worldwide
Researchers say China’s second Covid-19 vaccine has proven 100 per cent successful in preventing severe disease and death in late-stage trials, according to new research published by Nature.
CoronaVac, produced by the same company behind China’s first approved vaccine Sinovac, was found to have 51 per cent efficacy in curbing the virus spread. But importantly while its efficacy rates are low, its ability to prevent severe disease has led to the vaccine becoming China’s second approved for emergency use by the World Health Organisation.
A recent study in Brazil found the vaccine reduced cases, hospitalisations and deaths, leading its trial leader Ricardo Palacios – medical director of clinical research at the Butantan Institute – to declare it could be “a game changer in controlling the pandemic”.
The approval on June 1 as well as ambitious campaigning in more than 40 countries could lead to further distribution of CoronaVac to low-income countries.
Over 600 million doses of the vaccine have been administered globally.

Joseph Lam 7.15am: PM to meet the Queen next week
The Queen is set to meet Scott Morrison at Windsor Castle next week after she addresses world leaders at the G7 Summit.
The Prime Minister is expected to meet Britain’s head of state for a one-on-one meeting after the summit has ended before he departs for Paris.
Mr Morrison made a quick stopover to meet Singapore Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong on Thursday to discuss travel bubble arrangements before the summit begins.
The Queen will begin the annual diplomatic discussion on Friday in Carbis Bay, addressing leaders from Canada, Europe, France, Germany, Italy, Japan and the US.
Leaders are expected to discuss climate change and global efforts to curb the spread of Covid-19.

Greg Brown 6.40am: Boris sets target to vaccinate the world
Boris Johnson will urge G7 leaders to adopt a target of delivering one billion vaccines to developing ­nations to inoculate the world for Covid-19 by the end of next year.
Writing in The Australian on Friday, the British Prime Minister says the G7 summit this weekend will “begin a new effort” to develop a vaccine for the next communicable virus within 100 days, down from 300 days during the Covid pandemic.
But infectious disease experts have warned Mr Johnson’s plan is unrealistic, although Chief Medical Officer Paul Kelly has backed the need for wealthy nations to “accelerate the spread of vaccines in developing countries”.
In contrast to Australia’s delayed rollout of Covid-19 vaccines, Mr Johnson writes that Britain and other countries are “inoculating their populations more swiftly than anyone thought possible. Now we must bring the same ­spirit of urgency and ingenuity to a global endeavour to protect ­humanity everywhere. It can be done, it must be done – and this G7 summit should resolve that it will be done.
“I want the G7 to adopt an exacting yet profoundly necessary target: to provide one billion doses to developing countries in order to vaccinate everyone in the world by the end of next year.
“Nothing like this has ever been tried, and if you doubt whe­ther it can be done I would urge you to take heart from the unprecedented feats already achieved in the adversity of this pandemic.”

Jon Kamp 6.25am: More Covid deaths this year than in all of 2020
More people have died from COVID-19 already this year than in all of 2020, according to official counts, highlighting how the global pandemic is far from over even as vaccines beat back the virus in wealthy nations.
It took less than six months for the globe to record more than 1.88 million COVID-19 deaths this year, according to a Wall Street Journal analysis of data collected by Johns Hopkins University. The university’s count for 2021 edged just ahead of the 2020 death toll on Thursday.
These numbers underscore a worsening divide between developed and developing nations as President Joe Biden and the leaders of the other Group of Seven advanced economies prepare to gather in England to discuss next steps in the pandemic response.
While Western nations like the US, Canada and the UK celebrate low caseloads and declining deaths thanks to mass vaccination campaigns, the intensified pandemic in parts of Asia and Latin America propelled global deaths higher.
“We are living through our worst moment since the start of the pandemic,” Argentine President Alberto Fernández said late last month.
His country is facing its longest and most severe wave, with well over 500 people dying of COVID-19 on average every day. The government has implemented new lockdowns that are among the most stringent in South America, including the closing of commerce and restrictions on drivers, as well as the suspension of classes and religious ceremonies.
The numbers collected by Johns Hopkins reflect official counts of COVID-19 deaths from nations around the world, adding up to a global tally that recently topped 3.7 million. Patchy recording of COVID-19 cases and deaths means the true toll is likely substantially higher, disease experts say.

Rachel Baxendale 5.05am: Household cluster sparks outdoor masks backflip
A new mystery cluster of four cases in a household in Melbourne’s north has spooked Victorian health authorities, prompting a backflip on plans to ease rules governing the wearing of masks outdoors.
The about-face came despite an admission from Victoria’s Covid logistics chief, Jeroen Weimar , that there has been no evidence of outdoor transmission of the virus this year.
Victoria’s latest cases include a man in his 80s, a woman in her 70s, a man in his 50s and a man in his 20s who all live in the same household in Reservoir in Melbourne’s northern suburbs.
Despite the easing of Victoria’s lockdown rules, the current cases show it is still too early for a complete relaxation of restrictions, says Deputy Chief Health Officer Professor Allen Cheng.
How they caught the virus remained a mystery on Thursday, with the man in his 80s the first to return a positive test result on Wednesday, followed by the others. Victoria’s health department said authorities had also tested “a number of high-risk primary close contacts of the cases outside of the household” and all had returned negative results, although no detail was provided on the nature of the “high-risk”.
Exposure sites visited by household members included a shopping centre in Bundoora and a service station in Thomastown on Monday, and a grocery store in Reservoir and Bunnings in Thomastown on Tuesday.
Acting deputy chief health officer Allen Cheng said instances of outdoor transmission had been confirmed during Victoria’s second wave of coronavirus last year.
“They’re not very common but they do occur. When there are active cases in the community, I think it’s a small thing to ask for people to continue to wear masks at all times when outside of home,” Professor Cheng said.
Victoria COVID-19 Response Commander Jeroen Weimar says the state is “starting to see increasing stability” from the outbreaks but it is still important Victorians get tested regularly.

Lydia Lynch 5am: Police delay Queensland border hopper interviews
A Covid-positive couple who fled Melbourne’s lockdown for Queensland will not be interviewed by police until they are no longer infectious, as the state dodges another lockdown for now.
A 44-year-old woman and her husband triggered public health alerts in NSW and Queensland when they tested positive to the virus after mingling in the community while contagious. The couple, who did not have an exemption to enter Queensland and who are co-­operating with authorities, remain in isolation at the Sunshine Coast University Hospital.
Goondiwindi Mayor Lawrence Springborg says the recent COVID-19 cases in Queensland are alarming but the community is working to prevent a spread of the virus.
They crossed into the state through Goondiwindi on June 5, but travel from Victoria to Queensland was banned on May 28. Goondiwindi mayor Lawrence Springborg said he was concerned about “what appears to be a flagrant breach of Covid Hotspot protocols and unauthorised access to Queensland”.
Police will not interview the couple until health authorities are confident they are not infectious. However, Queensland chief health officer Jeannette Young said the pair was “towards the end of their illness” so the risk of them infecting others was not as high as when they travelled through Victoria and NSW.
Seventeen of the couple’s close contacts have been tested and three of those have returned negative results so far, including the woman’s parents.
Contact tracers are now on high alert after a positive COVID-19 case drove from Melbourne to Queensland via New South Wales over a five-day period.

Joseph Lam 4.45am: Clotting death amid new vaccine reaction fears
As vaccinations increase more serious reactions to the AstraZeneca shot have emerged.
The TGA reported that a 52-year-old NSW woman had died after developing blood clots in her brain with low platelets – consistent with the syndrome thrombosis with thrombocytopaenia (TTS) – after receiving the AstraZeneca vaccine. The woman developed a blood clot in her brain associated with haemmorhage.
Chief medical officer Paul Kelly said the death was ­“extremely unfortunate” and an “extremely rare event”. “I will point out that it is only the second death with now over 3.6 million doses of this vaccine being given across Australia,” he said.
The first reported person to die after receiving the AstraZeneca vaccine was a 48 year old NSW woman.
Other deaths reported this week included a NSW man, 55, who developed blood clots in his lungs eight days after receiving the jab, and a 78-year-old man from Western Australia who died from multi-organ failure.
The TGA said an expert group could not conclusively determine if the 55-year-old’s death was related to the vaccine.
Chief Medical Officer Professor Paul Kelly says the AstraZeneca vaccine remains an “extremely important” component of the vaccine rollout after it was revealed a 52-year-old woman's death was "related" to the jab.

Full text: Thousands of people could die of COVID-19 in Victoria in the event of a highly infectious outbreak if no restrictions such as limits on movement and gatherings are in place even if 70 per cent of the population were vaccinated.
These are the findings of new mathematical modelling developed by Melbourne's Burnet Institute, which suggests Australia is unlikely to ever reach herd immunity against COVID-19 at the current level of vaccine uptake, as more highly contagious variants could undermine immunity. The medical institute's modelling also suggests public health interventions such as increased testing, home isolation and face masks will be required for several years when new COVID-19 cases emerge, even if there is high uptake of the vaccine.
Herd immunity occurs when a large enough proportion of the population is vaccinated against a disease, or has been infected with a disease and developed antibodies against it, preventing the virus from transmitting widely.
The Burnet Institute modelling assumed a vaccine rollout speed of either 150,000 or 250,000 doses per week in Victoria, and examined several scenarios projecting the number of COVID-19 infections, hospitalisation and deaths one year after new infections enter the community. Modelling for one scenario examined the likely outcomes if a new strain 1.5 times more infectious than the Wuhan strain which plunged Victoria into lockdown last year, seeded an outbreak after 80 per cent of Victorians aged over 60, and 70 per cent of the rest of the population, was immunised
The projections were modelled on a vaccine that had roughly 50 per cent efficacy in preventing infection and 93 per cent efficacy in preventing death, with face masks not mandated and no major public health response, such as lockdowns or increased testing and quarantine, in place to control an outbreak.
Burnet Institute head of modelling Nick Scott, who led the research, said it found even if a small outbreak of a highly contagious stain of the virus seeped into Melbourne at roughly 60 per cent vaccine coverage, it could result in 4885 deaths within a year. "Those who are vaccinated would be protected and may only experience mild or no symptoms," Dr Scott said. "But among those not vaccinated - possibly up to 30 per cent of the community - we could see a large number of hospitalisations and deaths."
The modelling tool, which can be tweaked to adapt vaccine efficacy around variants, also showed if the same scenario played out when vaccine coverage increased to 95 per cent, the projected number of deaths would drop to 1346. If the vaccine's efficacy against infection increased to 75 per cent, with the same parameters in the scenario described, the number of deaths after one year could be less than 1000.
"What it really shows is without herd immunity, if we stopped taking a public health approach and allowed the virus to spread it is still likely to infect a large proportion of the community," Dr Scott said.
Burnet Institute deputy director Margaret Hellard said the modelling depicted a "worst-case scenario", showing what could happen if governments decided not to intervene and "let the virus run" even with moderate-to-high vaccine coverage.
"This is a scenario that is unlikely to happen because we would intervene," Professor Hellard said. "But what this modelling highlights is we need much higher vaccine coverage to reduce infections and severe infection. It also tells us that even with really high vaccine coverage there will be occasions where we do need to bring in some extra levels of restriction, like face masks and increased testing, but probably not as harsh as the lockdown we have just experienced in Victoria."
Experts are divided on what level of vaccine uptake is needed before they would be confident virus transmission would be minimal. Some say the figure is around 70 to 75 per cent, while others estimate coverage must exceed 80 per cent of adults.

Full text: Scott Morrison says an overnight agreement will ensure Australia will now have access to 40m Pfizer jabs this year. NSW Health is temporarily pausing the administration of the AstraZeneca vaccine to all age groups while it updates its informed consent information. Calling on Australians to maintain confidence in the vaccination program, Chief Medical Officer Paul Kelly suggests a deal with Moderna is being considered among other measures.
Jess Malcolm 11.15pm: Review launched into Johnson & Johnson vaccine
The EU’s drug regulator has launched a review of possible links between the Johnson & Johnson COVID-19 vaccine and blood clots after reports of four cases, one of them fatal.
The European Medicines Agency (EMA) said on Friday that its safety committee “has started a review of a safety signal to assess reports of thromboembolic events” with people who had received the shot.
“Four serious cases of unusual blood clots with low blood platelets have been reported post-vaccination with Covid-19 Vaccine Janssen,” the EMA said, referring to US pharma giant J&J’s European subsidiary.
“One case occurred in a clinical trial and three cases occurred during the vaccine rollout in the USA. One of them was fatal.”
The watchdog has approved the Johnson & Johnson vaccine for use but its rollout across 27 countries in the EU is not due to start until later this month.
The probe comes days after the Amsterdam-based watchdog said it was listing the same type of blood clots as a very rare side effect of the rival AstraZeneca vaccine.
Australia does not have any contracts for this vaccine.

Jess Malcolm 8.00pm: ‘Steady as she goes’ in vaccine rollout
Health authorities believe the timeline for vaccinating the ­nation’s most vulnerable people will be will largely unaffected by recommendation that under-50s receive the Pfizer rather than the AstraZeneca jab.
But the government cannot say if the switch to Pfizer for younger people will cause a blowout in waiting times for the less at-risk members of the community.
Scott Morrison announced the government had secured an extra 20 million Pfizer jabs in the wake the decision to recommend it rather than AstraZeneca for under-50s.
But many of the extra doses will not become available until the final three months of the year.
The federal government had anticipated four million doses would be administered by the end of March, and all Australians vaccinated by October.

Agencies 7.08pm: India’s hardest-hit state battles huge vaccine shortages
Leading hospitals in India’s most coronavirus-hit state halted vaccinations Friday, citing shortages as infections across the country crossed 13 million and set a new daily record.
The nation of 1.3 billion is confronting a ferocious second wave that has brought the fastest infection rate since the pandemic began, with nearly 132,000 cases recorded in the past 24 hours.
In the financial and film hub of Mumbai, one out of three private hospitals administering jabs ran out of supplies Thursday, city authorities said.
The situation at government-run inoculation centres was not much better, with a giant 1,000-bed field hospital turning away people arriving for their first dose on Friday morning.
“There is a shortage of vaccines so the programme has been halted,” Heeba Patwe, a doctor at a facility inoculating 5,000 people daily, told AFP.
India’s vast vaccination programme -- which has already administered 94 million shots -- is reportedly facing major supply snags in the quest to inoculate its huge population.

James Kirby 6.21pm: Could house prices fall next year?
Just when absolutely everyone is buzzed up on the prospect of escalating house prices the killjoys arrive armed with some sobering forecasts: they think prices will drop next year.
What! So soon?
Every weekend we hear of ludicrous scenes at auctions where rival bidders slug it, out pushing prices higher than estimates.
REA Group's John Healy says while house prices continue to rise, so to, do questions around housing affordability, with fears house price rises could be as high as 20 per cent, if not more, over the course of the year. "This week, some leading economists have said it's increasingly likely that the regulator, APRA, may need to intervene with macro-prudential controls to put some speed limits into the market," he said. The Reserve Bank left interest rates on hold this week - as the market continues to boom - with the current price surge leading to increasing concerns around housing affordability. "While interest rates remain low for some years yet, it may be the case that interest rate buffers on home loan applications are increased - meaning people's borrowing capacity is reduced," Mr Healy said.
And we all know that waiting for prices to drop has been a loser’s game for most people, most of the time.
What’s more, we have recently endured the rarest of events — the double dip — when house prices fell 3 per cent in 2015 and then managed a 15 per cent tumble over the years 2017 to 2019.
Still, there are plenty of reasons to be sceptical of this latest boom, even if the major banks are suggesting prices will lift by 20 per cent.

Jack the Insider 5.35pm: Media noise hides good news on the vaccine rollout
There was all manner of politicised babble in the wake of the government’s vaccine announcement on Thursday night, much of it of the opportunistic look through the rearview mirror type.
The Prime Minister, Scott Morrison and Health Minister, Greg Hunt have acted on advice and recommended that those under 50 should opt for vaccines (at this stage the Pfizer vaccine but others are coming) rather than the AstraZeneca vaccine due to emerging data that younger members of the community, particularly in their 20s, faced a heightened but still extremely low risk of blood clotting and thrombotic episodes.
Prime Minister Scott Morrison says the states and territories have agreed to the same principles for the vaccine rollout including ensuring lockdown measures “are proportionate to outbreaks”. “States agreeing and territories to the following principles about prioritising the vax rollout, maintaining the readiness to ensure suppression so that goes to the COVID-safe behaviours of testing, tracing, et cetera, ensuring that measures are proportionate to outbreaks and are consistent,” he said. Mr Morrison also said states had to make sure the “national wellbeing” of Australians were not harmed by restrictions and mandated many restrictions be repealed or softened to make Australia more open. “What we are working and planning for and have tasked the medical professionals who advise us on is what are the marks we have to enable to meet to enable us to open up Australia more than we are now?” he said.
Cue sound and fury. It was said the Morrison government had stuffed up the rollout. The delays would curtail Australia’s economic recovery. The country would remain locked away with international travel an option only for a lucky few. Most of all, the government had put too many eggs in the AstraZeneca basket.
Well, possibly but these decisions are a damned side harder to make with foresight rather than in hindsight.
Mostly, the noise hid one salient fact.

AFP 5.14pm: Brazilian Senate to probe handling of pandemic
The Brazilian Senate will open an inquiry into the government’s handling of the coronavirus pandemic, as President Jair Bolsonaro continues to resist lockdown measures even with Covid-19 deaths at new records.
Brazil's brutal surge in COVID-19 deaths will soon surpass the worst of a record January wave in the United States, scientists forecast, with fatalities climbing for the first time above 4,000 in a day on Tuesday as the outbreak overwhelms hospitals. Lucy Fielder reports.
A judge from the country’s supreme court on Thursday ordered the Senate to create a commission for the inquiry, after requests from 32 of Brazil’s 81 senators.
The president of the Senate, Rodrigo Pacheco, finally conceded to their demands at a press conference minutes after the judge’s ruling, after having opposed the move previously.
Far-right leader Bolsonaro has defied expert advice on containing the pandemic even as cases and deaths in Brazil soar, criticizing face masks and vaccines while doubling down on his opposition to lockdown measures as recently as Wednesday.
On Thursday Brazil recorded over 4,200 coronavirus deaths in 24 hours, bringing its total toll to more than 345,000 – the second highest in the world after the United States.
Remy Varga 4.45pm: Victoria hits pause on vaccine for under-50s
The Victorian government has advised health services not to give the AstraZeneca vaccine to people under the age of 50, following the Commonwealth’s announcement last night.
Victoria’s Health Department has also asked health services to reschedule any appointments with people under the age of 50 who are booked in to receive the AZ jab between Friday and Monday.
“Eligible persons who are booked to receive their second dose of AstraZeneca, including people aged under 50 years, with no major adverse reaction, should receive their second dose as planned,” a DH spokesperson said.
“This is safe and is recommended by ATAGI.”
The DH spokesperson said they were waiting to receive consent forms and consumer information from the Commonwealth before AztraZeneca vaccines could resume.

Angie Raphael 3.50pm: WA changes NZ border rule; venues back to capacity
New Zealanders will soon enjoy quarantine-free travel to Western Australia and if the state shuts again to other jurisdictions it will slash the number of days of no community transmission needed to reopen.
Under changes announced on Friday, a jurisdiction that is deemed a “low risk” will move to a “very low risk” after 14 days of no community spread of COVID-19, rather than 28 days.
From midnight on April 19, Western Australia will also treat New Zealand like any other jurisdiction and classify it as “very low risk”, which will effectively create a trans-Tasman travel bubble.
That means New Zealanders can undertake quarantine-free travel to Western Australia, but they will need to complete a G2G pass.
“This is an encouraging step forward,” Premier Mark McGowan told reporters on Friday.
Queensland will also transition to a “very low risk” state from April 19.
Meanwhile, Western Australia will allow major sport and entertainment venues with fixed seating to have 100 per cent capacity from midnight on Saturday.
Mr McGowan said that included Optus Stadium and RAC Arena, as well as theatres, cinemas and places of worship.
“This is a big step forward in the removal of restrictions and one that we can only take due to the hard work from West Australians across the community, giving health experts the confidence to proceed,” he said.
The 75 per cent limit for restaurants, clubs and cafes with dedicated seating, and the two square metre rule for pubs, nightclubs, bars and other music events, will remain in place for now.

Greg Brown 3.30pm: National cabinet to examine women’s economic security
A face-to-face national cabinet meeting will be held in Darwin in July to work on a nationwide plan to improve women’s economic security.
The meeting will be held ahead of a women’s safety summit to be held on July 30-31.
Scott Morrison said the meeting will bring together all of the initiatives and programs that are being run by state and federal governments on women’s economic security.
“There will be a special package brought together by the Secretary of Treasury that will be identifying the issues that relate to women’s workforce participation, gender pay gaps and issues related to those to aid that discussion,” the Prime Minister said.
“The purpose here and what we will consider in July, is whether we can then move - and I hope we do and I think that is the shared view of premiers and chief ministers - that we can embark on a similar national plan process on women’s economic security as we have on the protection of women against violence.”
Charlie Peel 2.45pm: Queensland widens Pfizer rollout to all hospitals
Every Queensland hospital will be equipped with the capability to administer the Pfizer vaccine under new plans to make it more readily available in regional and remote areas.
The expanded rollout was prompted by issues emerging with the AstraZeneca vaccine that led to blood clotting in some rare cases.
Chief Health Officer Jeannette Young announced the changes following Friday’s national cabinet meeting.
Previously, the Pfizer vaccine was to be administered only at a select few major hospitals.
Dr Young said recent studies of the stability of the vaccine, which is normally kept at minus 70 degrees Celsius, showed it can be stored in the temperature of a normal freezer for two weeks or at fridge temperature for up to five days before use.
“Because of these changed storage requirements, we will be putting a Pfizer hub in every single hospital and health service,” she said.
“Originally they were only going to be in the larger ones but now they will be across the whole state.”
Dr Young and Premier Annastacia Palaszczuk welcomed the Prime Minister’s announcement that Australia had secured an additional 20 million Pfizer doses.

Nicholas Jensen 2.40pm: NSW lifts pause, resumes AstraZeneca jabs
The NSW government has resumed administering the AstraZeneca vaccine to all age groups after a brief pause to update clinical consent services.
“The only reason we took a pause this morning was to update all of our clinicians, our workers, to make sure they had the latest advice which came out very late yesterday evening,” Premier Gladys Berejiklian said.
Earlier today Health Minister Brad Hazzard said the state government had confidence in Australia’s vaccine program, despite temporarily halting the rollout of the AstraZeneca jab this morning.
The AstraZeneca rollout was resumed at 1pm.
Mr Hazzard said it’s simply “because we had a large number of people booked in and we’ve got to check their ages and make sure the issues are discussed with them.”
In this afternoon’s press conference, Ms Berejiklian, who turned 50 last year, said she intended to get a second dose of the AstraZeneca vaccine.
“It’s really important for people to assess their own health risks. If you’re over 50, you should not be overly concerned with getting that AstraZeneca vaccine,” she said.
“The chances of you acquiring or getting an adverse reaction is very low.”

Greg Brown 2.30pm: PM’s mother booked for AstraZeneca vaccine jab
Scott Morrison says his mum is getting the AstraZeneca jab in “a couple of weeks”, as he moves to downplay concerns over the vaccine.
“She told me she is booked in and she is looking forward to having her AstraZeneca vaccine and she was pretty happy for me to tell people about that,” the Prime Minister said.
Mr Morrison said the government never instructed people to not take the AstraZeneca vaccine.
“There is an acknowledgment of the risk that is there but as is the case always with these matters these are decisions for Australians,” he said.
“Certainly for those who are over 50 there is a strong encouragement to be taking this AstraZeneca vaccine which we discussed today to ensure that we can continue down the path of the vaccination roll out.
“The goal here is to protect the most vulnerable in our community. If we want to treat COVID-19 like the flu then we need to ensure that we’re vaccinating those in our community who are most vulnerable.
“The most vulnerable people in our community are not just over 50, they are actually a lot older than that. The AstraZeneca vaccine is well suited to address those critical vulnerable groups.”

Greg Brown 2.05pm: National cabinet endorses ‘less restrictive’ indoor venue limits
State and territory governments have backed an easing of restrictions, including allowing 100 per cent capacity for large, ticketed and seated events.
National cabinet has also endorsed a maximum restriction of one person per two square metres at indoor venues.
“I know that states have moved to make it even less restrictive than that and others will be doing so very soon,” Scott Morrison said.
The Prime Minister said that national cabinet had tasked the Australian Health Protection Principal Committee with providing advice on how vaccinated Australians could travel overseas.
“What we are asking the medical expert panel to tell us is what are the thresholds that we need to be able to meet to do things such as the following: Australians who are vaccinated being able to travel overseas and return to Australia and not go into hotel quarantine, potentially go into hotel quarantine or not even into home quarantine at all,” Mr Morrison said.
“That will be a major change and to extent to which Australians returning from overseas, who have had recognised vaccines also approved here in Australia with appropriate accreditation, can return to Australia on that same basis and to enable potentially down the track travel from low-risk countries with similar vaccine arrangements.”

More than 1 million doses of COVID-19 vaccines have been administered in Australia, as national cabinet strikes an agreement to release daily statistics about the distribution of the vaccine.
The agreement will include daily and weekly statistics on the delivery of the vaccines by state, territory and federal governments.
There have been 81,297 delivered in the past 24 hours.

Greg Brown 1.30pm: PM: 20m extra Pfizer vaccines ordered
Scott Morrison says Australia has struck a deal with Pfizer for an extra 20 million vaccines, as concerns grow about the safety of the AstraZeneca job.
The Prime Minister said the overnight agreement would ensure Australia would now have access to 40m Pfizer jabs this year.
“Through our advance purchase agreement with Pfizer, these additional 20m Pfizer doses means that Australia will now receive a total of 40m Pfizer doses in 2021,” Mr Morrison said.
“It is anticipated that these additional 20m doses will be available in quarter four of this year, that’s our current instruction, and we will obviously be doing everything we can to seek to move that forward where we can.”
Mr Morrison released new advice on Thursday night, recommending people under the age of 50 do not take the AstraZeneca vaccine because of concerns of blood clotting.
Erin Lyons 12.55pm: Urgent testing as airline crew tests positive
Urgent testing is under way after an airline crew member tested positive for COVID-19, halting a flight from Sydney to Los Angeles.
The American Airlines flight was scheduled to depart Sydney just after 9am on Friday but was postponed due to a “possible COVID-19 case in a flight crew member”.
“The crew member was tested as part of routine surveillance. They are currently in special health accommodation,” NSW Health said in a statement.
Health officials are now waiting for the results of urgent blood tests to determine if this potential case is an historical infection.
Other crew on-board the AA72 flight are considered close contacts and are in quarantine in a Sydney hotel.
“There is no risk to the broader community,” NSW Health said.

Greg Brown 12.50pm: Frydenberg rules out reinstating JobKeeper
Josh Frydenberg has ruled out reinstating the JobKeeper payment, amid concerns a delay in the vaccine rollout will damage the economy.
The Treasurer said JobKeeper was “always meant to be a temporary measure”, after ACTU secretary Sally McManus called for the payment to be reinstated for businesses impacted by the travel restrictions because of the delay of the rollout.
Mr Frydenberg said retaining the wage subsidy program would be “counter-productive to the economy”.
“We must remember that every dollar we spend is a borrowed dollar. And we have now moved to the next stage of the economic recovery plan with more targeted support,” Mr Frydenberg told 3AW radio.
“You’ve heard the government announce support for the arts and entertainment sector for live events to be held, support the tourism and the aviation sector with half price airfares, cheap loans that are available to businesses to help them get to the other side.”
Mr Frydenberg said the lowering unemployment rate was evidence the economy was improving.
“As the economy strengthened if we left JobKeeper in place, it would actually be counter-productive to the economy and prevent workers moving more freely to other jobs across the economy,” Mr Frydenberg said.

Nicholas Jensen 12.20pm: NSW Health pauses AstraZeneca to all age groups
NSW Health says the government is temporarily pausing the administration of the AstraZeneca vaccine to all age groups while it updates its informed consent information.
However, AstraZeneca vaccinations for those aged 50 years and over are set to recommence later on Friday, after the informed consent information is updated.
Following the new advice from the commonwealth last night, informed consent information will be updated to provide patients and those administering the AstraZeneca vaccine with the latest information,” a spokesperson from NSW Health said.
“As with all other vaccines, informed consent is required before administering COVID-19 vaccines, ensuring recipients make decisions based on an understanding of the risks and benefits.”
NSW Health said the Pfizer vaccine would continue to be administered at clinics.

Nicholas Jensen 11.30am: NSW also reports no new local cases
NSW has recorded no local cases of COVID-19, with two cases of the virus recorded in hotel quarantine.
There were 14,078 test results received across the state in the past 24 hours, with health officials monitoring 40 active cases, none of whom are in ICU.
Most of these cases are being treated in non-acute, out-of-hospital care, including returned travellers in the Special Health Accommodation.
NSW Health said 6173 vaccinations were administered on Monday, bringing the total number to 146,724.
Ewin Hannan 11.25am: ACTU wants JobKeeper back for travel sector
ACTU secretary Sally McManus has called for JobKeeper to be reinstated for businesses impacted by travel restrictions and lockdowns given the vaccine rollout “will be delayed”.
Ms McManus said federal support remained necessary as much of the under-50 population no longer eligible for the more accessible AstraZeneca vaccine worked in industries most affected by lockdowns, including tourism, hospitality and retail.
Ms McManus said there could be no return to pre-pandemic economic certainty until the vaccine rollout was delivered.
“Now that the rollout will be delayed, the government must ensure that businesses and their employees are not abandoned by reinstating JobKeeper to all those impacted,” she said.
“Australia is currently 3.4 million jabs behind schedule and it’s still in question if everyone will be vaccinated this year. We’re nowhere near back to normal and for our recovery to continue there needs to be continued support”.
Nicholas Jensen 11.10am: AZ boss must support vaccine reputation: investors
Chief executive of AstraZeneca, Pascal Soriot, has been criticised by investors for failing to defend the effectiveness of the company’s vaccine, suggesting he has not adequately promoted its benefits amid growing fears it could be linked to rare blood clots.
Mr Soriot has been in Australia with his wife and children since Christmas, according to the UK Telegraph, with investors saying he has been absent and not defending the company.
Ketan Patel, a fund manager at EdenTree Investment Management, which has a stake in AstraZeneca, said Mr Soriot’s absence “did not give the right signal or message”.
“If we were grading the PR effort, they could do better,” he told the Telegraph.
“If you look at the data, and see that the chances of getting a blood clot with this vaccine is about four in one million, compared to four in 10,000 for the contraceptive pill, that perspective needs to be highlighted.”
“Where is the chief executive in terms of articulating the healthcare benefits? He hasn’t been that public and being halfway around the world doesn’t give the right signal or message,” Mr Patel said.
Earlier this week AstraZeneca suffered a further setback when the UK Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA0 warned over a possible link between the jab and rare brain blood clots. It came after a number of European countries suspended its use due to concerns over blood clotting.
Mr Soriot has been credited with reviving the business by developing new oncology drugs and putting greater emphasis on research and development.
AstraZeneca’s share price has fallen by a fifth since last July.
A spokesperson for AstraZeneca said Mr Soriot would return to the company’s European offices after travel restrictions were eased.
“Travel restrictions and local lockdowns mean it makes little sense to be travelling right now, particularly given that many countries require quarantine,” the spokesperson said.
Nicholas Jensen 11.05am: Pfizer says it fills local commitment
Pharmaceutical giant Pfizer has released a statement saying it is “on track to meet its commitments of 20 million doses” to Australia throughout the course of 2021.
The company said it was continuing to have “ongoing constructive discussions” with the Australian government.
“More than one million doses have been delivered and we continue to be on track to meet our commitments.”
“Pfizer is committed to working collaboratively with all governments to support the global public health need for COVID-19,” the statement read.
Jared Lynch 11.03am: CSL ‘fully committed’ on AZ delivery
Australia’s biggest health company CSL says it “remains committed” to fulfilling its contract with the federal government to produce 50 million doses of the AstraZeneca COVID-19 vaccine, despite health advisers warning Australians under 50 not to get the jab.
Prime Minister Scott Morrison announced a “major recalibration” to the nation’s coronavirus vaccine program on Thursday night, with the government forced to rely on the imported Pfizer vaccine or yet-to-be approved Novavax vaccine to inoculate those under 50.
While the move has cast doubt on whether the whole population will be vaccinated against COVID-19 by October, CSL has declared it is business as usual at its two Melbourne factories which are producing the AstraZeneca vaccine.
A CSL spokeswoman said, following Mr Morrison’s announcement, that the locally produced doses of the AstraZeneca vaccine “remains critical for the protection of our most vulnerable populations”.
“CSL remains committed to meeting its contracted arrangements with the Australian Government and AstraZeneca for locally produced AstraZeneca COVID-19 vaccines,” a CSL spokeswoman said on Thursday night.
CSL shares were trading flat on Friday morning at $266.

Rhys Blakely 11am: Results bolster confidence in Moderna longevity
People who have been given the Moderna vaccine still have antibodies capable of neutralising the coronavirus six months after their second shot, a study has shown.
The results will bolster confidence in the longevity of protection from the Moderna jab, which started to be administered in Britain this week.
The study looked at blood samples taken from 33 healthy adults in a large clinical trial that was held in the US last year. Six months after they had been fully immunised, antibody levels were strong across all age groups.
The rate at which the antibodies were decaying was consistent with that seen in people who had contracted the virus naturally. The results were published in The New England Journal of Medicine.

Nicholas Jensen 10.45am: Hunt says vaccine contracts ‘in place’
Health Minister Greg Hunt has rejected claims that the government did not secure enough vaccine agreements, saying despite the new recommendation on AstraZeneca for under 50s “the vast bulk of the program remains unchanged”.
“We secured five agreements and nobody knew which vaccines would be successful.” Mr Hunt told Sky News this morning. “There had never been an mRNA [messenger RNA] vaccine that was produced for any time and there had never been a coronavirus vaccine.’’
Mr Hunt pushed back against suggestions that the government did not follow expert advice regarding the acquisition of different vaccines, saying it followed the advice and have secured key contracts.
“We have four vaccine deals in place: 870,00 Pfizer doses already here, 20 million ordered, and we have 130,000-150,000 arriving a week currently, and increases that are due in May and July.”
Asked if the new recommendation on AstraZeneca would delay the rollout, Mr Hunt said “it will have an impact on the timing for now for those under 50” but refused to say it would have a significant impact on timelines and the government’s October deadline.
Mr Hunt said he was satisfied with the vaccinations that had already taken place: “The states have overwhelmingly completed their frontline health workers and overwhelmingly completed their hotel quarantine and border workers.”
In response to the new advice on AstraZeneca, Mr Hunt said the government will look into all options.
“I certainly won’t rule out any additional purchases,” Mr Hunt said. “But for reasons of intense global competition I will not pre-empt anything.”
“Australia in a position which is very different to the rest of the world because of that medical advice and although it was a difficult decision (border closures), we didn’t hesitate to make it.”
READ EARLIER: Blood clot fears force AZ switch
Chief Medical Officer Professor Paul Kelly says the adverse side effect linked with the AstraZeneca jab is “not a normal clotting mechanism” and appears to be “associated with vaccination." “We’ve looked very carefully and our expert medical advice the ATAGI group … have looked at the information on this extremely rare, but often serious side effect,” he said. “It’s not a normal clotting mechanism, this is actually a new disease, it’s become much clearer over the last couple of weeks that it’s associated with vaccination, specifically the AstraZeneca vaccination”. Prime Minister Scott Morrison and national health authorities last night announced the Pfizer vaccine is now the preferred vaccine for most Australians aged under 50 after concerns about rare blood clots linked to the AstraZeneca vaccine. Professor Kelly told Sky News the decision to change the advice surrounding the AstraZeneca vaccine for those under 50 is based on the heightened risk of the rare side effect in younger people. “There appears to be a trend for this to be a more common issue in younger people and that would make sense if it's an immunological mechanism, the immune system is stronger in younger people than older people,” he said. “Really, it’s that risk benefit equation, that’s what went into that cut off. “Under that the risk is unacceptable compared with the benefit of the vaccine, over that the balance shifts."
Nicholas Jensen 9.45am: Albanese blasts rollout, calls for more varieties
Opposition leader Anthony Albanese has called the government’s vaccine rollout a debacle, saying it did not consider access to a wider range of available vaccines, which could have redressed current shortfalls.
“We now have circumstances whereby just under 20 per cent of aged-care residents have been vaccinated,” he said this morning in a press conference. “They have stopped promising to roll out the vaccine to aged-care staff and are now telling aged-care staff to check with their GP.
“Labor was warning for a long period of time that we needed to do what international best practice told us we should do and that was to have access to five or six vaccines.”
Mr Albanese said that uncertainty concerning the rollout was “a direct result of an arrogant government that was too focused on the 24-hour media cycle and not focused on what Australia needed”.
“Scott Morrison is addicted to the spin cycle rather than to substance,” he said.
Mr Albanese said more should have been done to “hedge our bets”.
“We knew, just like the UQ vaccine fell over, there can be issues with the rollout of a vaccine … which is why international best practice would have had us do deals over Moderna, over Johnson & Johnson.”
Opposition Leader Anthony Albanese has strongly criticised the Morrison government for its execution of Australia’s inoculation program – labelling the vaccine rollout a “debacle.” “In 2021 Scott Morrison – as the prime minister – had just one job, to get the rollout of the vaccine right, because the rollout of the vaccine is a precondition for us to return to normal life in Australia, for our economy to get going and to stop lockdowns and to engage with the world,” Mr Albanese told the media. “It’s very clear Scott Morrison has got this wrong.”
Nicholas Jensen 9.20am: Qld reports no new local infections
Queensland has recorded no local cases of COVID-19 in the last 24 hours, with one case recorded in hotel quarantine.

Queensland health authorities are currently monitoring 63 active cases.
READ EARLIER: Comment: Wait for ‘new normal’
The shift in Australia’s vaccine rollout following revised AstraZeneca advice will top the national cabinet agenda today when state leaders meet for the first time in five weeks. State leaders already frustrated by the glacial pace of the rollout are expected to discuss further delays flagged by Prime Minister Scott Morrison in a late night press conference yesterday where he announced the change in health advice. The premiers’ push to ramp up the speed of the rollout stems from the fact opening up the nation and keeping state borders open largely hinges on the success of the country’s inoculation program. The Pfizer vaccine is now the preferred jab for Australians aged under 50 following concerns about the AstraZeneca vaccine being linked to blood clots. A small number of people have developed blood clots after receiving their first dose of the vaccine – a condition health officials say affect four in every six million doses. Concerns were raised over the level of risk due to Australia’s relatively low COVID threat and the susceptibility of younger Australians to the AstraZeneca jab. The prime minister said the decision was made out of the abundance of caution, and acknowledged it will delay the national rollout program in some form. “Ultimately here, the choice is with individual Australians and their doctor,” Mr Morrison said. “The advice here today is not to not have the AstraZeneca vaccine, there is not a prohibition of the AstraZeneca vaccine for persons under 50, there is an expression of a preference.”
Nicholas Jensen 8.55am: No new cases recorded in Victoria
Victoria has recorded no new cases of COVID-19 in the last 24 hours.
There were 18,463 test results received across the state in the past 24 hours.
Victorian Health said 6057 vaccinations were administered on Sunday, bringing the total number to 137,320.

Former AMA president Tony Bartone says Australia “has no other option” but to proceed with its vaccine rollout program as it is the key to life returning to some form of pre-pandemic normality. His comments come as the health advice is shifted to make the Pfizer vaccine the preferred jab for people aged under 50 after concerning links were made with the AstraZeneca jab and blood clotting incidents. “It is important that we instil confidence back in the rollout program … and ensuring we get back to the task at hand,” he told Sky News. “And that is that we have no other option really but to continue with our vaccination program if we want to see our lifestyles return to some sort of sense of normality in the long run. “Vaccination is saving lives, it’s been proven right around the world, this is an important part of our response in dealing with COVID-19 and we need all Australians to continue … to have that vaccination as they are invited to take part.” He also pointed out there was time to secure additional doses of the Pfizer jab or an alternative vaccine as the wider community aged under 50 were not eligible for the vaccine until “well deep into phase 2b.”
Nicholas Jensen 8.46am: Time to readjust to shortfalls: Former AMA president
Former president of the Australian Medical Association Dr Tony Bartone says “it is important we now instil confidence back in the rollout program” following news of vaccine shortfalls and changes to advice on AstraZeneca for under 50s.
“These shortfalls will be putting questions in the minds of the Australian community,” he told Sky News this morning. “We need to ensure we get back to the task at hand, and that is that we have no other option but to continue with our vaccination program.
“If we want to see our lifestyles return to some sort of sense of normality in the long run we need to trust vaccines … we need Australians to continue, especially in this current phase, to continue to have that vaccination.
“The incidents of this (blood clotting) are rare, but it’s a very serious condition, and in particular the reports, which are varied in parts of the literature, show a predilection to younger members of the population.
“We’re still getting more information and it made the decision to proceed with the analysis and continuing on that.”
Dr Bartone said there is time enough to refine the rollout and adjust for shortfalls.
“The Phase 2B segment will be coming up in the middle of the year means we have time … we have time to look at our diversified vaccine portfolio and reach into finding the one that’s most appropriate.”

Former AMA president Tony Bartone says it is not uncommon for different vaccines to be made available to target different “sub-groups” of the population. He told Sky News he would like to see conversations happen between Australians and their GPs to reiterate the vaccine is “an important next step in terms of our protection and our coming out from the COVID-19 pandemic”. “Any negative circumstances or information or events around any implementation or rollout of a new vaccine is of course very, very worrying,” he said. “We are in the middle of one of the most extensive public health campaigns in our lifetime in terms of vaccinating an entire population against COVID-19.”
Nicholas Jensen 8.30am: Nothing off table in jab rollout: CMO
Chief Medical Officer Paul Kelly has reiterated calls for Australians to maintain confidence in the vaccination rollout, saying “nothing is off the table” in order to redress the shortfall.
“Of course something like the announcements overnight can affect vaccine confidence,” he told the ABC this morning. “But the important thing is for the Australian public to know that as soon as we’ve known something, as soon as our expert advice from the ATAGI group gives us the guidance on immunisation, we went out and informed the public.
“We’ve made this preference for not using AstraZeneca in the under 50s on the basis of that safety concern but I would really urge people to make sure that they are lining up when it’s their turn.”
Department of Health Secretary Brendan Murphy says healthcare workers under 50 will be "prioritised" to receive the Pfizer vaccine following a revision of advice on the AstraZeneca vaccine linked to blood clots. “We now feel that, out of an abundance of caution, given that this syndrome seems to occur mainly in younger people for whom the risk of severe COVID-19 is not so great – that there is a basis to have a preferred recommendation for those under 50," he said. “For Phase 1, which is vulnerable people, we will pretty much continue as we are. Those over 70 and 80 will continue to get AstraZeneca at their GPs and be confident in its efficacy and its safety. “For those healthcare workers under 50, they will now be prioritised to Pfizer, and that might delay that particular phase of 1B. But that's the only phase that might be delayed.”
Following the change in advice, Professor Kelly said “nothing is off the table”, suggesting that the government was considering a deal with Moderna to redress vaccine shortfalls.
“We are looking at all of those options right now. We know that Novavax – we have 51 million doses on order – is not yet approved by the TGA.
“The TGA will absolutely expedite that matter and as soon as Novavax is ready to supply to Australia we will be going through those processes,” he said.
Professor Kelly refused to say there was a problem with the vaccine rollout, saying the issue would be discussed at today’s cabinet and that he will “not pre-empt those discussions”.

Courtney Walsh 8.25am: French Open on the move again
For the second year in succession, the coronavirus crisis has forced tennis officials to postpone the French Open.
But unlike the 2020 clay court championship, which was shifted to October, the delay this year will only be for one week, with the country hopeful it will be over the worst of what is effectively a third wave of the virus.
The shift in the calendar will again disrupt other lower-tier events being held as warm-ups to Wimbledon, with the gap between the French Open and the All England Club Championships now only two weeks.

Nicholas Jensen 8.03am: Lies, deception plague WHO probe
Three senior Australian scientists are among 24 international researchers to have denounced the World Health Organisation’s probe into the origins of COVID-19, saying wilful politicisation, lies and deception have stymied proper scientific inquiry and access to vital evidence.
This week, professors Colin Butler , Nikolai Petrovsky and Rosemary Mcfarlane joined 21 others in penning an open letter to the WHO calling for another full investigation into the origins of the pandemic. “What we want is a situation where proper scientific method and inquiry can be pursued without corrupt politicisation,” Professor Petrovsky said. “Now we’re hearing from the WHO that they never said they were conducting an ­investigation.”
Professor Petrovsky, whose research group at Flinders University uses artificial intelligence modelling to understand whether a particular species started a virus transmission, said the WHO investigation succumbed to pressure and became highly politicised. He said the WHO was not the right inter­national institution to conduct such a probe. “We need a new international mechanism that compels countries to permit proper investigations into these issues,” he said.

Nicholas Jensen 7.35am: TGA approves new Pfizer storage method
The Therapeutic Goods Administration has agreed to make it easier to store and transport the Pfizer vaccine, as the government changes its advice on the use of AstraZeneca in people under 50 years of age.
The TGA will now permit unopened vials of the jab to be stored and distributed at -15C for up to two weeks.
Previously the vaccine was stored at a temperature 10 degrees cooler over the same time period, but a temperature between -90C and -60C will continue to be required for longer term storage and transport.
Last night Prime Minister Scott Morrison said the Pfizer vaccine is now the preferred vaccine over AstraZeneca for Australians aged under 50, signalling a dramatic change to the country’s rollout.

Jess Malcolm 7.00am: CSL committed to vaccine rollout despite AZ call
Commonwealth Serum Laboratories says it respects the decision taken by the Australian government, and reiterates that blood clotting is “an extremely rare” side effect of the AstraZeneca vaccine.
CSL is the only company capable of producing vaccines onshore currently, and is responsible for Australia’s domestic AstraZeneca supply.
“Regulators around the world, including the Therapeutic Goods Administration (TGA), have reviewed the rare clotting events and did not identify any risk factors, such as age or gender, or a definite cause for these extremely rare events,” the statement read.
“However, they came to the view that these events have a possible link to the vaccine and requested they be listed as an extremely rare potential side effect.”
“Whilst concerning, the events under assessment are very rare, with low numbers reported among the almost 200 million individuals who have received the AstraZeneca COVID-19 vaccine around the world.”
CSL said it is still committed to providing vaccines in the nation’s rollout, in light of Thursday evening’s changes to the use of the AstraZeneca jab.
“CSL remains committed to meeting its contracted arrangements with the Australian government and AstraZeneca for locally produced AstraZeneca COVID-19 vaccines,” the statement read.
“We will continue our focused and important efforts to manufacture this vaccine which remains critical for the protection of our most vulnerable populations.”
“We are proud of our unique role in Australia as the only onshore manufacturer that can produce this vaccine and remain dedicated to our ongoing contribution towards this effort.”

Nicholas Jensen 6.45am: AZ call shouldn’t ‘undermine confidence’ in rollout
Infectious disease expert Dr Paul Griffin has urged Australians to trust the country’s regulator, saying advice on the AstraZeneca vaccine should not “undermine our overall confidence” in the rollout.
“They (the federal government) have exercised an abundance of caution and the thing to keep in mind is it is extremely rare, we’re talking a few cases per million doses and the majority of those people will recover,” he told Nine’s Today show.
Sky News host Paul Murray says "all the eggs are not in one basket" and "no one under the age of 50 is currently getting the vaccine" following updated advice regarding the possibility of blood clots from the AstraZeneca vaccine. Opposition Leader Anthony Albanese tweeted his criticism following the prime minister's announcement the Labor Party had been pushing for the Coalition to secure five or six vaccines for distribution. Mr Murray said the Australian Department of Health announced the nation had access to four approved vaccines but were part of a list of nine vaccines to be made available to the public, when applicable. "Nine different vaccines we've started the process of wither acquiring or we have deals to get when they have been approved. So all the eggs aren't in one basket and no one under the age of 50 is currently getting the vaccine," he said. "When it is their turn, they will be getting something different from the AstraZeneca vaccine. "Something that is currently not available to millions of people in Australia is still going to be made available to those people, but you should double-check with your doctor whether there is an infinitesimal chance you may get a blood clot if you take it. That's the announcement."
Dr Griffin said that clotting symptoms have been well publicised and “typically happens between day four and 20 post-vaccine”.
“We should have faith in the decision and the abundance of caution we’re taking.”
Dr Griffin said Australians should remain optimistic about the rollout, but warned there will be major delays.
“Novavax hasn’t completed the clinical trial data needed to use in this country. That is many months away … It is going to take a significant amount of time.”

Nicholas Jensen 6.25am: Spain widens use of AstraZeneca jab
The use of the AstraZeneca vaccine is set to widen in Spain to include people between the ages of 66 and 69 amid fears the jab could be linked to rare cases of blood clotting.
“The aim is to complete the inoculation of the people who are most vulnerable of COVID-19 as soon as possible,” read a statement from the Spanish health ministry.
The change was based on advice by the European Medicines Agency which has encouraged countries to continue using the AstraZeneca vaccine, insisting that the benefits far outweigh the risks.
Music fans in Barcelona had rapid COVID-19 tests ahead of attending a rock concert on Saturday in a trial that, if successful, could provide a route to recovery for the ravaged live music industry in Spain and beyond.
The Spanish government said a decision would be taken soon on how to proceed with people under 60 who have already received one of the two doses of the vaccine.
Health officials in Madrid aim to have 70 per cent of the population vaccinated by August.
At the moment Spain has vaccinated under seven per cent of its population of 47 million people with two doses and administered jabs to more than 9.8 million people.
Spain is among the European countries hardest-hit by the pandemic with more than 3.2 million infections and over 76,000 deaths.

Nicholas Jensen 6.15am: AstraZeneca move ‘not unusual’: British officials
British health officials and ministers have reassured Britons that the AstraZeneca vaccine remains a reliable and effective form of inoculation, saying that it was not unusual that people under 30 should be offered alternative jabs and that it would not impact the pace of the country’s rollout.
Health officials said the suggestion that under 30s should be offered an alternative vaccine did not reflect any serious safety concerns, only a “vanishingly rare possible side effect”.
Deputy Chair of the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation Anthony Harnden said it wasn’t an unusual step, pointing out that people of different ages had already received different flu shots.
“This isn’t unusual and this is not undermining what the regulators are saying,” he said.
“The regulators are saying this vaccine is suitable for all age groups, but it’s up to the individual countries to decide how best to deploy those vaccines.”
Britain’s Health Secretary Matt Hancock defended the advice, saying that transparency over potential side effects should bolster confidence in the rollout.

Ewin Hannan 6.00am: Call to ease foreign student work visa limits
International students should be able to work unlimited hours and foreign backpackers continue with the same boss for more than six months under a temporary easing of visa restrictions being sought by employers to address COVID-driven labour shortages until overseas travel resumes.
Minister for Agriculture Mary-Anne Thomas has warned Victoria’s agricultural industry “backpackers are not coming back any time soon” as growers struggle to find a new seasonal harvesting workforce. Ms Thomas noted the pandemic had revealed the horticulture industry was “over-reliant on overseas” workers and said the Andrews government had adopted a multipronged approach to dealing with the problem. More than $76 million has been diverted to programs designed to aid growers, attract a local workforce and bring some overseas workers into the country.
National business groups urged the Morrison government to temporarily remove the cap on international students working more than 40 hours a fortnight and allow unrestricted hours in targeted regions and industries including hospitality, accommodation, cafes and restaurants that are facing shortages.
Employers also called on the government to expand the priority migration skilled occupation list to include chefs, veterinarians, cafe and restaurant managers and seafarers.

Remy Varga 5.40am: Victorian quarantine staff refuse vaccine
With Rachel Baxendale
A number of workers at Victoria’s hotel quarantine program have refused the COVID-19 vaccine and have been stood down with full pay. Some have declined the vaccine on medical grounds, but The Australian is aware of at least one worker who refused the jab out of concern it could affect her ­fertility. A spokeswoman for COVID-19 Quarantine Victoria, the agency responsible for the state’s hotel quarantine program, said they were looking for alternative work for unvaccinated staff members who were not permitted to work at the hotels.
“All staff members working at our active quarantine hotels must have had at least their first vaccination; if they have not been vaccinated, they cannot work a shift in the hotels,” she said. “We are working with the small number of staff who remain unvaccinated on alternative work arrangements outside of the hotels.”
Opposition police and crime prevention spokesman David Southwick said receiving the COVID-19 jab should have been stipulated in the contracts of hotel quarantine workers.
“Anyone has the right to refuse a vaccination but this should have been a condition of employment for working in hotel quarantine,” he said. “No one should be sitting at home on full pay doing nothing.”
But employment law expert and partner at law firm Swaab Michael Byrnes said standing down staff with full pay avoided exposure to unfair dismissal laws.

Natasha Robinson 5.30am: Blood clot fears force AstraZeneca switch
Australians aged under 50 will not be given the AstraZeneca vaccine under recommendations from the nation’s health advisers that have cast doubt on plans to give the whole population a jab by ­October.
Scott Morrison on Thursday night said a major “recalibration’’ would be required to the vaccination program for under-50s, with the government forced to rely on the ­imported Pfizer vaccine or the yet-to-be-approved Novavax to complete the program.
Responding to the findings of the European Medicines Agency that there was a link between the AstraZeneca dose and a rare blood-clotting syndrome, the Australian Technical Advisory Group on Immunisation recommended the Pfizer vaccine now be given in preference to AstraZeneca for people aged under 50.
ATAGI advised that the AstraZeneca ­vaccine, which is made locally, was safe for those aged over 50, and said those in priority groups aged under 50 who had ­already been given one Astra­Zeneca shot could safely receive the second jab.

Full text: The additional cases came after five cases were linked to a mystery source earlier on Thursday.
Victorian health authorities have urged anyone who has been in Sydney’s Northern Beaches since December 11 to stay at home and get a coronavirus test on Friday.
In a tweet on Thursday night, the Department of Health and Human Services said they should take particular care not to visit aged care facilities and hospitals.
“Further guidance will be issued as information becomes available,” the department said in a tweet.
University of Melbourne epidemiologist Tony Blakely said people from the Northern Beaches should be barred from travelling to Victoria because of the seriousness of the outbreak.
“I’d be surprised if we (Victoria) don’t ban arrivals of anyone from the Northern Beaches or anybody who has spent time there in the last 10 days or so. It’s just too risky,” he said on Thursday night.
Professor Blakely, who helped provide modelling for the state government’s road map, said there was no need to panic and slam shut the Victoria-NSW border completely.
But he said it would be appropriate to have a targeted response to stop people from affected areas travelling freely to Victoria.
“Let’s hope this is contained in the next 72 hours,” he said.
“If it’s not then boy is this the start of a superspreader Christmas event. Let’s not panic yet, the next 48 hours will be telling, but it would be astute of other states to protect themselves.”
But Deakin University epidemiologist Catherine Bennett said on Thursday night it was too early for Victoria to impose any restrictions.
She said it was more likely NSW health authorities would advise people from affected areas not to travel.
“It’s really hard to actually manage from other states’ points of view to check where people are from and crosscheck certain postcodes,” she said.
“At this level it’s not necessary and it’s also hopefully enough for people in Sydney’s Northern Suburbs to think ‘if I was going to travel up to see grandma for Christmas maybe I won’t now’.”

HEALTH EXPERTS MEET AS NSW OUTBREAK GROWS Top medical and health officers are set to meet tonight amid fears over rising COVID-19 outbreaks in NSW.
The Australian Health Protection Principal Committee (AHPPC) will meet for two hours from 8pm to discuss the NSW situation.
The committee is the key decision making committee for health emergencies and could recommend the return of border closures.
There are fears Victoria could move to shut its border with NSW just one week out from Christmas.
Victoria closed the border with South Australia when 15 new cases emerged there based on public health advice.
“Our public health team is in regular contact with NSW Health and we continue to monitor the situation,” a government spokesman said.

AIRLINES MONITOR SITUATION Airlines have advised passengers to check the latest advice from state governments prior to travel.
Virgin Australia said in a statement: “Any impacted customers will be provided with options to rebook on alternative services or be able to obtain a travel credit for use at a later stage.”
Jetstar and Qantas said they were monitoring the evolving situation.

TESTING BLITZ UNDERWAY IN NSW An urgent testing blitz was launched in Avalon on Thursday as NSW Health worked to track down the source of the growing COVID cluster that could have started with a mystery case at the Avalon RSL.
NSW chief health officer Kerry Chant said it was “critical” that anyone at the club on Friday December 11 come forward for testing, as authorities scrambled to identify the source of an emerging outbreak that has put the state on edge just before Christmas.
NSW Health was yesterday working under the theory that someone who attended the RSL club was the original source of up to five cases identified on Wednesday and Thursday.
The cases include two Avalon residents — a 65 year old woman and a man in his 70s — who both live together.
As well as venues on the northern beaches two new locations were added to coronavirus alerts this evening.
Anyone who attended Penrith RSL on December 13 between 1-6pm and the Kirribilli Club on December 14 between 12-3pm should get tested immediately and isolate until they get a negative result.
The partner of a woman who tested positive on Thursday morning has now also tested positive, NSW Health Minister Brad Hazzard said.
Mr Hazzard confirmed a man in his 60s who tested positive for the virus this morning plays in a band - called “Nothing Too Serious” - and had travelled extensively.
The band’s guitarist said they are all really health conscious and do not think they have been the cause of the outbreak.
Nothing Too Serious was playing at Avalon RSL on Friday night in a gig that was attended by a local elderly couple who health authorities revealed had tested positive to the virus on Wednesday night.
Mr Le Bars said other band members were getting tested and self-isolating but none of them had symptoms.
Another one of Thursday’s new cases is understood to be a woman who works at the Pittwater Palms retirement home in Avalon.
Two other cases in Sydney’s Northern Beaches, from Avalon, were confirmed with the virus on Wednesday and a positive test for a southwest Sydney van driver who transported an airline crew to a quarantine hotel.
On Thursday, aged care homes in the Northern Beaches were told not to accept visitors until the source of new COVID cases is identified.
Premier Gladys Berejiklian said that NSW Health will issue a directive to certain aged care homes to stop outside visits until there’s more certainty around the emerging cluster.
“At certain aged care facilities in the Northern Beaches we’re recommending no visitors until we identify the source of infection and feel more confident that we have it under control,” she said.
It comes as colleagues of a bus driver who is believed to have contracted COVID-19 while transporting an international airline crew have tested negative to coronavirus.
NSW Health said all colleagues of the man tested so far have returned negative results.
Those contacts were household contacts and work colleagues.
NSW Health has issued stern warnings to residents and visitors to the northern beaches who may have been in certain places and should self-isolate.
There are seven venues where officials urge anyone who visited to get tested and then isolate for 14 days, even if they receive a negative result.
Those venues are:

- Hungry Ghost Cafe, 20 Avalon Parade, Avalon – Sunday, December 13, 9.30am-11am and Tuesday, December 15, 9.30-11am
- Sneaky Grind Cafe, 3/48 Old Barrenjoey Road, Avalon Beach – Monday, December 14, 9.30-11am
- Barramee Thai Massage and Spa, 4/42-44 Old Barrenjoey Road, Avalon Beach – Monday, December 14, 2-3.30pm
- Bangkok Sidewalk Restaurant, 1/21-23 Old Barrenjoey Road, Avalon Beach – Monday, December 14, 7-8pm
- Avalon Bowlo (bowling club), 4 Bowling Green Lane Avalon Beach – Sunday, December 13, 5-7pm (not 3-5pm as previously reported) and Tuesday, December 15, 3-5pm
- Palm Beach female change rooms – Sunday, 13 December 9-9.15am
- Coast Palm Beach Cafe, Barren Joey Road, Palm Beach – Sunday, December 13, 10‑11am

There are also a number of spots where any visitors who were there at certain times should get tested and then self-isolate until a negative result is received. Those venues are:

- Bing Lee, Gateway, 1 Mona Vale Road, Mona Vale – Monday, December 14, 4.30‑4.45pm
- Woolworths Avalon Beach, 74 Barrenjoey Road, Avalon Beach – Sunday, December 13, 12-5pm, and Tuesday, December 15, 12-12.30pm


- Oliver’s Pie, Careel Shopping Village, 1 Careel Head Rd, Avalon Beach – Monday, December 14, 9-9.15am


It comes as Victoria recorded no new cases overnight. Nearly 9500 tests were received on Wednesday.
HOTEL QUARANTINE STAFF CASHED IN WITHOUT WORKING Some hotel quarantine staff pocketed up to $40,000 pay during the pandemic, despite not working.
Many of the “standby” workforce — which peaked at 1500 people, including out-of-work airline crew — continued to be paid despite the hotel quarantine program having been suspended after outbreaks.
It comes as Victoria recorded no new cases overnight. Nearly 9500 tests were received on Wednesday.
The Herald Sun can now reveal that some full-time staff were paid annualised salaries that equated to between $28,000 and $40,000 over the five-month shutdown, with others on part-time contracts.
And the government issued a $750,000 contract in July to buy uniforms, including polo shirts and jackets for them to wear, when they finally returned to work.
Some of the staff were redeployed to the Hotels for Hero program to house health workers, as well as hotels for the homeless and domestic violence victims – but the majority did not carry out a shift in a hotel until the scheme restarted earlier this month.
Despite repeated requests the state government has refused to detail how much was paid for the “standby workforce” and instead maintain it was a necessary cost.
It comes as the state’s return traveller program kicked off again on December 7 with nine hotels in action, but the workforce of Resident Support Officers has now been reduced to 1022 workers.
A government spokesman said “there has been an ongoing recruitment and training campaign for Resident Support Officers (RSOs) since July, which has been critical to building a well-prepared workforce ready to welcome home returned travellers”.
“All RSOs have received extensive training and on-site induction, and have recently undergone a refresher training program before being deployed to hotels.”
Earlier this month, Treasurer Tim Pallas defended the move to pay people sitting at home saying “I believe this is an investment in the security of our domestic economy by making sure we have the most conservative quarantine system in the nation”.
When asked whether it was a good investment he responded “this has been a fast moving event and certainly at the time of retention of these people we didn’t have an immediate need or the capacity to deploy, but we also got a good level of skill and expertise in terms of people from the airline industry.”
To add insult to injury at the same time the government was paying RSOs thousands of dollars to not work, cleaners on low wage government contracts continued in their duties.
Mr Pallas denied the state had effectively created a two-class system, but said the pandemic had identified unfair employment issues.
The state’s new Hotel Quarantine Program kicked off on December 7 with return travellers now required to pay an estimated $3000 for their stay.
However, Emergency Services Minister Lisa Neville revealed on Wednesday that the legislation meant payment could not yet be processed until next year.
Instead, people would be sent a bill.
The inquiry also heard the new quarantine program testing regime was up and running to identify any cases that escape the scheme early.
So far, staff within the hotels have had 5000 tests, and travellers took 900 tests.
There are 528 police officers and Protective Service Officers currently working in the program, which chief Commissioner said would add a “significant” cost in terms of overtime paid.

PUSH TO SCRAP FRINGE BENEFITS TAX FOR HOSPO The hospitality industry is calling for the fringe benefits tax to be scrapped or suspended, in a move to bring back the long lunch and kickstart business.
Frank van Haandel, the owner of St Kilda’s Stokehouse, where thousands of deals have been sealed over steak and shiraz, said removing the fringe benefits tax on restaurant meals would be “a winner for everybody”.
“It’s not just the restaurant industry that would benefit from the FBT being dropped,” he said. “With China imposing trade sanctions, our fishing industry, our wine industry, our growers are hurting. If we drive more people through restaurants, the knock-on effect for those other industries would be fabulous.”
Industry bodies including the Restaurant and Catering Association have joined calls by Small Business Ombudsman Kate Carnell for the government to abolish or temporarily suspend FBT on food and accommodation to encourage corporate entertaining to return to struggling restaurants.
Industry doyen Jacques Reymond has seen the introduction of FBT cripple the restaurant industry twice — first while running a restaurant in France in the late 70s, then here in 1986 when it was brought in by the Hawke government.
“It’s not just the restaurant (it affected), it’s everything related to a restaurant — the flower supplier, the fisherman, everything. It’s a huge compound effect,” he said. “If you can get rid of that tax, I can assure you it will be fantastic for the whole hospitality industry. It will be a big boom, I’m absolutely convinced of that.”

COVID HEROES GET TO PUT THEIR FEET UP After months of working on COVID-19 wards and even catching the disease herself, nurse Karlee Robson has finally got the getaway she deserves.
The Royal Melbourne Hospital worker is one of 250 nurses and hospital staff to win the Herald Sun and Crown Melbourne’s Healthcare Hero campaign, which celebrates the work of nurses across the state.
She said she felt “very spoiled and very lucky” to have won a weekend away at Crown to share with her partner Adrian.
It’s been a rough year for Ms Robson, who was nominated by her sister, a fellow COVID nurse.
The infectious disease ward nurse took on a second role in infection prevention just two weeks before the pandemic struck and found herself tracing patients’ contacts within the hospital.
“The cases just kept coming; it was really full on,” Ms Robson said.
She suspects it was working on those wards that led to her returning a positive a COVID-19 test and having to quarantine away from her family.
“It was very scary and emotional,” Ms Robson said.
“I spent so much time thinking and analysing: where did I get this, who have I spent time with, did I give it to my partner?”

Premier Daniel Andrews on Saturday conceded the expectation for Melbourne to drop below five coronavirus cases per day before he lifts stage-four restrictions may be ­watered down, or scrapped.
Although Victoria’s Chief Health Officer, Professor Brett Sutton, said the target was “within our grasp”, he said a decision might have to be made to reopen the city before all community transmissions were eliminated.
The concessions came after one of the experts whose ­research was used by the government to justify extending the stage-four lockdown said the target of fewer than five daily cases was too tough.
As revealed by the Herald Sun on Saturday, University of Melbourne professorial fellow in epidemiology Tony Blakely — who co-authored the modelling Mr Andrews relied on to extend the lockdown — said the target to release Melbourne from stage four was “too stringent”.
The road map released by Mr Andrews last Sunday demands an average of fewer than five daily coronavirus cases across two weeks, and a maximum of five mystery cases in 14 days, before the curfew and stay-at-home orders are dropped.
Victoria is on track to meet the average of fewer than five daily cases by October 26, but Prof Blakely said he would have aimed for an average of 10 cases a day, which would have slightly increased the risk of a third wave — from 3 per cent to 10 per cent.
Metropolitan Melbourne’s 14-day coronavirus daily case average dropped to 61.6 on Saturday, while regional ­Victoria’s hit 4.3.
On Saturday Mr Andrews said his public health team recommended the target, which he and his cabinet endorsed.
However, the Premier appeared to step away from the target as well as his reliance on modelling, saying the targets were constantly reviewed as information flowed in.
“This is not an academic exercise, this is life, it is real and we have to lock in some settings and then push to achieve those targets,” he said.
“On the issue of the achievability or otherwise, we look at putting the data in every single day, we keep running the models we will see how things unfold day to day, week to week and we will use common sense.
“If it became clear that the tail of the second wave was more stubborn than even the most rigorous modelling tells us, then of course we would look at that.
“We have at no point said these are stone tablets and can never be changed.” Speaking after Prof Blakely’s comments were published, Prof Sutton said the targets ­demanded under the government’s road map were meant as a “general movements in those directions”.
He said revision of the modelling was occurring daily “We are at a point now where we are at 30-odd cases a day, so it is within our grasp,” Prof Sutton said. “ “If we get to the point where it is clear that it is not possible to get to (a rate of) no community transmission, we will make a call on that.
“And it is also possible that we will get to a point where the numbers are higher but we will investigate those numbers, see where they are occurring, why they are occurring and how they are occurring, and make a judgment about whether five is the appropriate target or if it is 10 cases a day but eight of them are in aged care.” grant.mcarthur@news.com.au EDITORIAL, PAGE 55
HOW DAN SOCIALLY DISTANCED HIMSELF FROM MODELLING IN SIX DAYS SEPTEMBER 6: PREMIER ANDREWS DEFENDS LOCKDOWN WITH MODELLING SCIENCE “The expert modelling tells us that even with that enormous effort – we’re likely to be averaging around 60 cases a day by next weekend.
“If we go too far too soon, the modelling also tells us we’d be on track for a third wave by mid-November” SATURDAY: MODELLING EXPERT PROF TONY BLAKELY SAYS GOVT WENT TOO FAR “It is too stringent, in my view. “That’s their call, it’s not the one I would have made, but that’s their decision.
“I think the difference between a three per cent riskof a third wave and a 10 percent risk is not that much really” LATER SATURDAY: PREMIER ANDREWS SAYS ‘DATA’ MORE IMPORTANT THAN ‘MODELING’ “I have said many times this week and I will make the point again because I think it is an important one, data trumps modelling every time. Actual numbers. “This is not an academic exercise, this is life, it is real and we have to lock in some settings and then push to achieve those targets”

Full text: Calling out the captain YESTERDAY the Herald Sun revealed a schism between the state government and one of Australia’s leading health experts.
Professor Tony Blakely, an expert in epidemiology, was one of the key architects behind the modelling used by the Andrews government in its justification for the arduous targets outlined last week in its road map to get us out of this virus crisis.
That target demanded that Melbourne record an average of fewer than five daily coronavirus cases across two weeks for the lifting of curfews and stay-at-home orders.
At the time, the state government gave the very strong impression that this modelling was behind its targets and its entire strategy.
Now though it is clear this was not the case, with Prof Blakely, a University of Melbourne professorial fellow in epidemiology, telling the Herald Sun he thought those targets were too stringent and that they were not recommended in his modelling.
Prof Blakely’s comments on the targets being far too severe cannot be ignored. He is the expert in this.
Other respected scientists linked to the modelling used by Premier Daniel Andrews have also come forward to say their research has been misrepresented.
Faculty of Medicine dean at the University of Melbourne, Professor Shitij Kapu, and professor in mathematical biology and epidemiology, James McCaw, have urged a rethink of the targets and called for a refining of the modelling to include factors “such as aged-care versus community, or rural versus metro”.
It is truly astonishing that the work of these researchers and their institution appears to have been used by the government to justify its decisions — yet their work did not in fact recommend the measures that were announced by the government.
During Saturday’s press conference, the comments of professors Blakely, Kapu and McCaw were addressed by Premier Andrews and the Chief Health Officer, Prof Brett Sutton.
Clearly the criticism hit a nerve at the state government, with Prof Sutton vowing to speak to Prof Blakely about his concerns.
Victoria must know how this modelling from the University of Melbourne and University of New England was used to design the recovery road map.
The government went to great lengths last Sunday to use that modelling to justify severe restrictions and targets contained in the road map which are gutting this state; destroying the morale, businesses and livelihoods of hundreds of thousands, if not millions, of Victorians.
And yet Prof Blakely told Saturday’s Herald Sun that he had no meetings with the state government or the Chief Health Officer to discuss his modelling ahead of the announcement.
The other question raised by these revelations is: Who is making the decisions that are having such a profound impact on our lives?
Are decisions being made on the very best medical advice, or are they essentially captain’s calls?
Throughout this crisis certain critical calls have been made that have defied logic and raised serious questions about the judgement and the decision-making process of the state government.
The decisions to refuse to use Australian Defence Force personnel to assist with the hotel quarantine program and contact-tracing efforts have had disastrous outcomes and yet it is still unclear who within the Victorian government is responsible for them.
Likewise, it is still a mystery who made the ultimate decision to impose a draconian curfew on 5 million Melburnians, a curfew that will remain in place until October 26 and perhaps beyond.
The curfew wasn’t proposed by the Chief Health Officer nor by the Chief Commissioner of Victoria Police. Victorians deserve clarity on who called for the curfew and on what basis they made the decision, given it wasn’t based on medical or law- enforcement advice.
And now, there is little transparency on who determined that Melbourne must have an average of fewer than five daily coronavirus cases over two weeks for the easing of restrictions.
The Premier maintains that the decision was based on the best medical advice, but it remains a mystery whether the call was made by himself, the COVID-19 cabinet or by senior bureaucrats.
In the absence of parliament sitting, in the absence of transparency of the decision-making process, in the absence of clear answers to key questions, it is hard not to conclude that these decisions — from the rejection of ADF assistance, to curfews, to harsh road map targets — were captain’s calls made exclusively by the Premier. Whether or not they were, we do not know for sure as we cannot get any clear bead on what is going on. And that is deeply troubling for this state and our democracy.

Full text: World-leading scientists linked to the modelling Daniel Andrews has used to lock down Melbourne say the research has been misrepresented and have urged the Premier to rethink the restrictions as his virus ­suppression targets are impossible to meet.
Melbourne University’s dean and head of medicine is urging the Victorian Premier to rerun the model with more ­realistic data that could allow an earlier move to ­restrictions being lifted.
The scientists have argued that aged care, which has been devastated by the outbreak, should be ­separated from the model, which didn’t distinguish between those cases and those in the general community.
In a bombshell claim that will ramp up pressure on the Victorian leader to revise his controversial COVID-19 road map, Shitij Kapur, dean and assistant vice-chancellor of health, and University of Melbourne colleague James McCaw, professor of mathematical ­biology, said no city in the world, apart from the virus source city of Wuhan, had achieved the same suppression goals contained in Mr Andrews’ road map released last Sunday.
Writing in The Weekend Australian, the respected scientists ­suggest that the models do not support the extreme lockdowns imposed and have been over-relied on by the government to make a political decision.
“Translating model outputs into a decision requires a consideration of many other factors,” they said. “It requires consideration of acceptable risk. In this case, the risk of overwhelming the public health response, in turn leading to unacceptable social, economic and health and medical costs.
“It requires balancing the trade-offs between lives affected and livelihoods lost. It entails a choice of how much one can and should constrain the liberties and lives of citizens.
“Just as we laud the government in providing clear guidelines based on a September 3 model, we urge the government to keep refining the models, perhaps build in considerations such as aged-care versus community, or rural versus metro, into future modelling. And when new information in mid-September is fed into such a model perhaps a different set of trade-offs may seem more optimal.” Mr Andrews has used the modelling to justify an extension to stage-four lockdowns in Melbourne until at least October, claiming it showed an early lifting of restrictions would spark a third-wave outbreak.
Professors Kapur and McCaw have questioned the Victorian government’s suppression target of less than five new cases over a two-week period by October 26. While they said it wasn’t impossible, it would be a target not yet achieved in any comparable ­country.
“No major city in Europe has attempted to suppress transmission to this extent — not London, nor Paris or Berlin. Nor have New York or LA or Chicago; and certainly not Sao Paulo, Mexico City or Mumbai,” they said.
“Even the Asian cities lauded for their public health systems and compliant populations — Hong Kong, Singapore, Tokyo or Seoul — have not managed to achieve this strict threshold. Ironically the only major city that has achieved this is Wuhan. A city of 11 million that ­endured thousands of cases but then imposed perhaps the harshest of lockdowns, barring practically all movement and work.” The professors said the models had not justified the political decisions the government had made.
They also revealed that they had informed the government of the limitations of the modelling based on the data the government was providing for the computations.
“While this model captured many elements of the real world, it did not capture them all,” they said.
“For example, the model does not distinguish between cases with known contacts versus ‘mystery cases’ and nor does it distinguish between cases in aged-care settings from those in the community; or where in Victoria they arise.
“These limitations of the model, as well as many others, were openly acknowledged by the authors in the details released.
“Models are only as good as their inputs and assumptions. Many of the two dozen inputs and assumptions that informed this model may change even before the end of September. Some of these assumptions will improve (e.g. our testing and tracing ability) and some may worsen (e.g. physical distancing fatigue).” The modelling team included Jason Thompson, Tony Blakely and Mark Stevenson from the University of Melbourne and Rod McClure from the University of New England.
While they haven’t directly criticised the government, professors Kapur and McCaw have offered a way out for the Premier to revisit the lockdowns using different data in the models in the context of the “real world”.
The Weekend Australian understands federal health authorities had an initial briefing from their Victorian counterparts in the past two days on the detailed modelling, which is believed to have confirmed their concerns about the modelling assumptions used.
Business and employer groups last week demanded that the Andrews government release the detailed modelling to reveal the basis for the continued shutdown of businesses until at least the end of October.

Full text: EXCLUSIVE THE target to release Melbourne from stage four lockdown is “too stringent”, says an expert whose research was used by the state government to justify the stage-four extension.
University of Melbourne professorial fellow in epidemiology Tony Blakely said the target for the most substantial easing of restrictions — an average of fewer than five daily coronavirus cases across two weeks — was too tough.
“It is too stringent, in my view,’’ said Professor Blakely, who co-authored modelling Premier Daniel Andrews relied on to extend the lockdown.
CONTINUED PAGE 4 FROM PAGE 1 Professor Blakely told the Herald Sun the road map that demands the five-case average, and a maximum of five mystery cases in 14 days before the curfew and stay-at-home order are dropped, was not recommended by his research.
“This is not the University of Melbourne view. In my view it is too stringent.’’ Prof Blakely said the decision to settle on a threshold of an average of five cases a day to trigger a move back to stage two restrictions was overly cautious.
“That’s their call, it’s not the one I would have made but that’s their decision,” he said.
The recovery road map predicts Victoria could be in a position to ease the harshest restrictions about October 26.
But Prof Blakely said he would have settled for an average of 10 cases a day, which would have slightly increased the risk of a third wave from 3 per cent to 10 per cent.
That would have resulted in metropolitan Melbourne easing out of restrictions sooner.
“I think the difference between a 3 per cent risk of a third wave and a 10 per cent risk is not that much really,” he said.
Prof Blakely also sought to clarify what he said was confusion — following the release of the road map — that the research had dictated an extension to the lockdown should be made.
Premier Daniel Andrews cited the modelling to justify his recovery plan, forecasting a 60 per cent chance of a pre-Christmas lockdown.
Prof Blakely said there was a misconception the modelling dictated the policy decision.
“It’s sort of been conveyed to the public that the model ran and the model said ‘do this’.
“That’s not what the model does,” Prof Blakely said.
“The model provides outputs and then you look at it, and you say, ‘OK it’s saying this but I think we’ll take a little bit more risk than that’.
“You can’t avoid a human brain at the end of it considering political risks, economic consequences, all those sorts of things.” Prof Blakely said those factors could be accounted for in modelling, but not in the tight time frame he and his co-authors had to complete their work. He said he did not have any meetings with the government or Chief Health Officer Brett Sutton to discuss the modelling ahead of the announcement.
“So there was quite a clear separation, which is a fair way of doing it, between us as providing information and the actual decision-making process,” he said.
He said he was “reasonably happy with how the model’s been used although it has actually made us look as though we somehow set the policy levers”.
Deputy Chief Health Officer Allen Cheng this week defended the modelling. But he said experts would reassess information about Victoria’s coronavirus situation every day to build a complete picture of how the state was faring. shannon.deery@news.com.au

A city of 11 million that endured thousands of cases but then imposed perhaps the harshest of lockdowns, barring practically all movement and work.” The Melbourne University team said the models had not justified the political decisions the government had made.
They also revealed that they had informed the government of the limitations of the modelling based on the data the government was providing for the computations.
“While this model captured many elements of the real world, it did not capture them all,” they said. “For example, the model does not distinguish between cases with known contacts versus “mystery cases” and nor does it distinguish between cases in aged-care settings from those in the community; or where in Victoria they arise. These limitations of the model, as well as many others, were openly acknowledged by the authors in the details released.
“Models are only as good as their inputs and assumptions. Many of the two dozen inputs and assumptions that informed this model may change even before the end of September. Some of these assumptions will improve (e.g. our testing and tracing ability) and some may worsen (e.g. physical distancing fatigue).” The modelling team also included Jason Thompson, Tony Blakely and Mark Stevenson from the University of Melbourne and Rod McClure from the University of New England. While they haven’t directly criticised the government, they have offered a way out for the Premier to revisit the lockdowns using different data in the models in the context of the “real world”.

Full text: Nation’s economically crippling lockdown based on calculation error CORONAVIRUS modelling used by the federal government to send Australia into ­financially crippling lockdown used the wrong figures and dramatically over-estimated how many people could need intensive care.
When the modelling was released at the start of the pandemic by the Melbourne-based Peter Doherty Institute it horrified health officials.
“This is a horrendous scenario,” chief medical officer Brendan Murphy said at the time. “A daily demand for new intensive care beds of 35,000 plus.” But The Daily Telegraph can reveal the modelling that Prof Murphy said was “highly technical” and could only be understood by people with “scientific brains” was wrong.
The modelling accidentally transposed the figures for the number of people who would be hospitalised during COVID-19 if no measures were taken for the number of people who would be admitted into intensive care units.
The error made the effect of the pandemic appear four times worse than the modelling actually intended, predicting 12,000 people in NSW would go into ICU rather than 3000. And it informed the advice that led to economically crippling lockdowns across the nation.
“I strongly believe we lock down too hard,” James Cook University professor of infectious diseases modelling Emma McBryde said.
Her team in Queensland uncovered the error after they were left “scratching our heads” over why the Melbourne modelling was so much worse than their own.
Once her team had worked out how the error occurred they contacted the Doherty ­researchers and received an email back confirming the modelling would be updated.
“That was three months ago and we are still waiting,” Prof McBryde said. The ABC quoted the incorrect figures again this week.
“Leaving something inaccurate uncorrected on the public record is pretty close to research misconduct,” Prof McBryde said.
Professor Jodie McVernon, from the Doherty Institute, confirmed the error was ­noticed in June but said it was confined to two graphs and “the conclusions on the ­response strategies needed to ensure enough ICU beds were available were still accurate”. She said they informed the government of the mistake at the time.

Ex-Andrews MP urges Premier to release road map modelling

Full text: A federal Victorian Labor MP has urged the Andrews government to release the full modelling underpinning its road map to recovery, declaring “more detailed information” would improve community confidence in the plan.
Fraser MP Daniel Mulino, a former Andrews government MP from the party’s Right faction, also declared Premier Daniel Andrews should provide information showing contract tracing processes had been strengthened since the beginning of the second wave.
Mr Mulino, who left state politics for Canberra last year, said Scott Morrison should also be more transparent and provide an explanation on why the COVID-19 tracing app has not found more contacts in Victoria.
“Families in Melbourne’s western suburbs are of course frustrated. The best way to ease that frustration is to offer more detailed information that is informing key decisions,” he told The Australian.
“People in my community back Daniel Andrews’s efforts to fix this public health crisis.
“Releasing more modelling and data, as they have done in recent weeks, will help build greater community confidence. Clear and detailed explanations about why the road map is going for low thresholds of active cases will reduce concerns and confusion.
“This includes information about how contract tracing processes are being strengthened.” Mr Andrews has so far resisted pleas from the Prime Minister to release the full modelling that underpinned his road map, prepared by Melbourne University researchers Jason Thompson, Mark Stevenson and Tony Blakely, and University of New England health academic Rod McClure.
While the Andrews government has released a seven-page document that references the University of Melbourne modelling, the Morrison government says it does not explain the data or assumptions behind the modelling clearly or in enough detail.
Federal government sources said on Wednesday the commonwealth had received the “highest level elements” of the modelling and were expecting more detail. Former federal opposition leader Bill Shorten on Tuesday said he wanted Victoria’s lockdown restrictions to “come off a bit quicker”, while other Victorian Right MPs have also told The Australian they are concerned about the plan and messaging from Mr Andrews during the crisis.

Slight hope in lockdowns

Full text: ON THE worst day for new infections in Victoria, there is a slim ray of hope as the state tightens its lockdown laws.
Stage three lockdowns in Melbourne stopped a spread of up to 37,000 new COVID-19 cases, new research in Medical Journal of Australia shows.
This would be five times more than Victoria's active case tally, which stood at 7227 on Wednesday.
Now all regional Victoria is in stage three restrictions and Melbourne is under stage four lockdowns.
Researchers from the Burnet Institute, Monash University and the Peter Doherty Institute measured the reduction in the virus' reproduction ratio in 10 Melbourne postcodes under stage three restrictions from July 2 to 31. Their modelling found the lockdowns averted between 9000 and 37,000 new coronavirus cases in this period.
Numbers continue to grow slowly in the Ballarat region. City of Ballarat recorded two new active COVID-19 cases on Monday, with an overall tally increasing to 31. Ballarat and Moorabool Shire both have 13 active cases and Golden Plains has two more active cases with 12 active infections. Hepburn and Pyrenees shires have both dropped an active case so their infections are back to one person.
Fourteen metropolitan local government areas top the health department's active case list. City of Greater Geelong has the highest regional portion with 132 active cases and a further 92 in the Colac-Otway Shire.
Hepburn mayor Licia Kokocinski said it was a question of when, not if, more coronavirus cases might crop up within the Hepburn Shire.
The shire had been listed as coronavirus free for about four months until recording two active cases earlier this week. This was despite great concerns with rising crowds in tourism spots like Daylesford as restrictions eased.
Cr Kokocinski said the shire's key focus was on fast-tracking emergency relief as regional Victoria enters stage three lockdowns on Wednesday night. The shire's tourism industry and large commuter population are set to be hit hard, the latter by stricter restrictions on metropolitan workplaces.
In the bordering Macedon Ranges - which takes in Kyneton, Woodend and Gisborne - there are 36 active COVID-19 cases.
Six Australian Defence Force personnel have been deployed to help Central HIghlands Rural Health meet COVID-19 testing demands at its respiratory clinic in Kyneton for the next fortnight. The health service, which also covers the Hepburn Shire, also runs a COVID-19 screening clinic in Daylesford.
Cr Kokocinski said having new cases in the Hepburn Shire was not a nice way to start another round of stage three restrictions, but residents and council had to focus on what they could do best to support each other.
"We're not immune from this issue...severe impacts will happen," Cr Kokocinski said.
"There's only so much we can all do. Community well-being and looking after community health is really important to us."
Cr Kokocinski said emergency recovery efforts, led by civic leaders across the Hepburn region, were in the process of being launched sooner than planned in a bid to reach those most in need who were now under added pressures with new lockdowns.
She said it was vital to "do it properly, but do it fast".
In such turbulent times, Cr Kokocinski said it was important Hepburn communities know what the shire and other key bodies in the region could do too.
"It's about bringing people together," Cr Kokocinski said.
Pyrenees Shire had been without any known COVID-19 the whole pandemic until Sunday.
Pyrenees Shire Council did not wish to make comment.
It remains unclear where in each shires the active cases are located.
The state government has confirmed new postcode data will be released weekly.
The first issue of postcode data on Friday was before cases in the Pyrenees and Hepburn were counted.

Full text: The unprecedented restrictions Australians are living with are working, so far, to curb the rise in new COVID-19 cases.
Nationally, on average around 50 new COVID-19 cases were reported each day in the week leading up to April 15, compared with a peak of 460 on March 28.
Fewer people are testing positive, and these cases are infecting fewer additional people, as we close international borders, work and study from home, keep 1.5m apart and limit unnecessary travel.
New modelling indicates ten people with the virus now infect only five others.
So many people are asking when physical distancing measures can be relaxed.
When can life go back to normal? The simple answer is, life as normal cannot resume anytime soon. Prime Minister Scott Morrison has said current restrictions will be in place for at least the next four weeks.
COVID-19 remains highly infectious, and our population is still almost entirely susceptible to catching it.
Most people won't have been exposed to the virus and won't have built up immunity to it. And we're unlikely to have a vaccine for at least the next 12-18 months.
This means we need to continue to modify the way we work, socialise and travel to minimise the chance of catching the virus.
What might trigger a return to 'normal'? When we know who's immune
Serosurveys survey the population for antibodies in blood that protect against COVID-19. These can indicate the proportion of the population with natural immunity after COVID-19 infection.
These studies are underway internationally, including in the United States, and are planned for Australia.
Eventually they could inform who gets vaccinated and guide decisions around lifting restrictions. But these results are still likely to be some time away.
Few new unexplained local cases for at least two weeks
The widespread physical distancing measures in place in Australia aim to prevent community transmission of COVID-19. This is distinct from border measures, which are designed to prevent the introduction of new cases from overseas.
As the restrictions on daily life have important health, social and economic ramifications beyond COVID-19, we will need to begin to roll them back before the Australian population is COVID-19 immune (and before we have results from serosurveys to confirm this).
These changes could begin when the number of locally acquired cases, particularly those transmitted in the community without a known source, is very low for a sustained period. This would need to be longer than the incubation period (the time from infection to symptoms showing), which for COVID-19 can be up to two weeks.
Now is an appropriate time to develop this "exit plan", but we need to be cautious and responsive in doing so.
More testing, tracing and quarantine
First, we need an even stronger capacity to identify and isolate cases, and to trace and quarantine contacts.
As we've increased testing capacity in Australia, we've also expanded testing criteria. While initially restricted to returned travellers and contacts of a known case, some jurisdictions are now testing all people with COVID-19 symptoms - regardless of their travel or contact history - to determine the extent of community transmission.
Testing should continue to identify geographical areas or sub-populations with ongoing (or new) transmission, to pave the way for rapid and targeted public health responses.
Once a case is identified, a network of thousands of contact tracers work to to identify their contacts and provide advice around quarantine requirements.
Many countries have employed technological solutions such as contact tracing apps, and Australia is looking to follow suit. But such an app will be effective only if uptake is high.
Fewer than one-fifth of Singapore's population had downloaded their TraceTogether contact tracing app by April 1, well short of their target.
When we know more about people with mild or no symptoms
Social distancing measures minimise the risk a person will transmit the virus to others when that person doesn't know they're infected. So before we consider relaxing them, we need to better understand the relative infectiousness of people with no or mild symptoms.
Studies currently underway are following families and close contacts of cases to see who develops typical COVID-19 symptoms, who is infected with mild or no symptoms, and who is not infected.
Likewise, understanding the role of children in transmitting infection is essential to support reopening schools, with appropriate social distancing in place. Research is similarly underway to attempt to answer this question.
We will likely see restrictions lifted in stages While returning children to classrooms and opening businesses will be a priority, restrictions around international travel are likely to be in place for many months. Isolation of cases and quarantine of contacts are likely to be ongoing.
While Australia is developing its "exit plan", other countries have revealed theirs. Iceland has announced physical distancing restrictions will be gradually lifted starting on May 4, including increasing the limit for gatherings from 20 to 50 people, and re-opening schools and universities.
Likewise, Norway is planning to re-open kindergartens, primary schools and certain businesses from April 20.
Even the best-laid plans might not eventuate. Physical distancing measures had been relaxed in Singapore, Japan and South Korea after flattening the curve, but were recently re-introduced following a surge in cases.
No-one knows how the coming months will play out, but this is a marathon, not a sprint. We'll need to carefully manage the risks that come with easing restrictions. But Australia is well-placed to do this, having successfully navigated the COVID-19 journey so far.

Full text: Following the emergence and rapid spread of COVID-19, several countries have succeeded in bringing local outbreaks under control. The most dramatic of these is China, where large scale restrictions on people's movement appear to have halted domestic transmission.
South Korea, Singapore and Taiwan also had early success containing local outbreaks, using a combination of extensive contact tracing, testing, border measures and differing degrees of social distancing.
However, COVID-19 is now widespread across the globe, and these countries remain at risk of a second wave of infections, sparked either by overseas arrivals or undetected pockets of infection.
As China has begun to lift travel restrictions, the world is watching to see whether they can avoid a second wave of outbreaks.
What causes a second wave of a disease outbreak?
Infectious diseases spread via contact between infectious and susceptible people. In the absence of any control measures, an outbreak will grow as long as the average number of people infected by each infectious person is greater than one.
If people who recover generate a protective immune response, the outbreak will leave a growing trail of immune people. Once enough people are immune, there are fewer susceptible people to become infected and the outbreak will die away.
When an outbreak is brought under control by social distancing and other measures, it's possible only a small proportion of the population will have been infected and gained immunity.
If a population has not achieved herd immunity, enough susceptible people may remain to fuel a second wave if controls are relaxed and infection is reintroduced.
Will we see a second wave in China? Despite the scale of the outbreak in Hubei and other Chinese provinces, it's likely most residents remain susceptible to infection.
Even for those people previously infected, immunity to COVID-19 is an open question. Reinfection appears uncommon, and a study in rhesus macaques suggests a protective immune response does occur. But we need more data to understand if this is common in humans, and how long immunity might last.
The strong social distancing measures used to control COVID-19 in China have a human cost, and cannot be maintained indefinitely.
As China winds back social distancing measures, new infected cases could, if not quickly detected and isolated, trigger a second wave of COVID-19.
A recent modelling study indicated a second peak of infection might arrive in Wuhan by mid-year if interventions were lifted too quickly.
During the 1918 influenza pandemic, it was the second wave that was the largest and most deadly. But that probably won't happen today. As we learn more about COVID-19, we become better placed to control its transmission.
If a rapid increase in transmission is detected in China, it's likely authorities would quickly reintroduce the restrictions that successfully contained the first wave.
Preventing a second wave of COVID-19 When the first wave of an outbreak is sufficiently large, then enough of the population could become immune that there are too few susceptible people remaining to fuel a second wave. But the potential human cost of an uncontrolled outbreak is immense and unacceptable.
Alternatively, a globally coordinated response that eradicated the virus could prevent a second wave, as was achieved for SARS in 2003. However, the milder nature of many infections, and the broad global spread of COVID-19 make it a much greater challenge to eradicate.
Another end point is the rapid development of a vaccine that could help achieve herd immunity without extensive infection.
In any event, after the first wave has passed, preventing a second wave will require ongoing surveillance and testing to detect and isolate any new cases as control measures are unwound.
Could we face a second wave in Australia? We use mathematical models to explore the dynamic behaviour of infectious diseases. They can help explore how factors such as the strength and timing of control efforts might affect the likelihood and timing of a second wave.
However, models provide a simplified view of reality. One of the complexities they often (but not always) omit is human behaviour and how it might change in response to government and media communication, social and economic realities, and direct experience of COVID-19.
Australia's current efforts are focused on "flattening the curve" of the first wave of COVID-19.
Border measures have greatly reduced the arrival of imported cases, and the coming weeks will reveal the extent to which social distancing measures have succeeded in slowing community transmission. The decline in numbers of new cases reported over recent days is promising.
But this is only the beginning. If social distancing measures are to be relaxed, ongoing vigilance will be needed to prevent a second wave.
And even if we avoid a second wave, the path to long-term control is not straightforward.
We'll need a broad variety of expertise, including modelling, to help Australia navigate beyond the first wave of COVID-19.

Full text: Dana McCauley talks to experts about what coming out of lockdown would look like.
As millions of Australians spend Easter at home, pressure is mounting on authorities to give people a sign that heavy restrictions on social and economic activity will eventually be eased.
Those who are obeying the rules this weekend are skipping the usual trips to the coast and big family gatherings to help "flatten the curve" of the coronavirus pandemic - but even the most conscientious social distancers want to know when the lockdown will end.
Health Minister Greg Hunt has declared the state and federal government restrictions - including shutting the nation's borders, banning large events and, more recently, limiting gatherings to no more than two people who don't live together - a success.
The minister has declared that the behaviour of Australians over the Easter break will dictate how soon state governments can begin easing COVID-19 social-distancing measures.
So, many are wondering when beaches, gyms and pools will reopen - and what about cafes, restaurants and bars? How soon should parents send their kids back to school?
These are the questions being examined by an expert taskforce made up of more than 80 leading academics from Australia's Group of Eight universities, which the national cabinet has tasked with preparing advice on "the challenge of recovering from the current state of pandemic shut-down".
Experts are divided on what restrictions should be maintained and for how long, but most agree that it would not be possible to maintain a lockdown for the 12 to 18 months it is expected to take to find a vaccine.
University of Melbourne professor of epidemiology Tony Blakely says the detail of which restrictions could be lifted, how soon and in what order remained uncertain, as modelling had not yet been done on the impact of each layer of social distancing.
"One of our tasks in the next week is to assemble that list, in priority order," Professor Blakely says.
Allowing people to have a small number of visitors in their homes would be a "sensible loosening to try initially", he says.
Associate Professor Adam Kamradt-Scott, an expert in health security with the University of Sydney who is advising the government, says public spaces like beaches and gardens "are not problematic themselves" and could be reopened if distancing rules are observed, while gyms and nightclubs are more likely to remain closed.
Professor Jodie McVernon, director of epidemiology at the Doherty Institute, says researchers are still "uncertain about the actual contributions of different measures that have been implemented" to reducing the virus' spread.
"Things like school closures, people are trying to unpick these from observations in Europe, but it's still very unclear," she says. "We're now closely observing what's happening in Australia to see what our measures are doing."
Prime Minister Scott Morrison has repeatedly primed Australians for their lives to be disrupted for "at least six months", but has recently spoken of trialling an easing of restrictions in some areas and warned the government's capacity to prop up the economy is "finite".
Corporate titan Richard Goyder, the chairman of Qantas, Woodside Petroleum and the AFL Commission, has called for a swifter easing of restrictions, warning that balancing health and economic concerns would become difficult as the virus stretched Australia's balance sheet.
Professor Blakely warns the health impacts of relaxing social restrictions must be weighed against "all the costs of lockdown", both social and economic - saying "there is a real risk the societal cure we choose may do more harm".
Not only do lockdowns damage employment and GDP, he says, but these effects can feed back into health impacts such as increased suicide and heart disease.
Mr Hunt says the strategy being worked on "needs to be very, very nuanced and carefully thought out" and "sustainable in the medium term" while research into COVID-19 treatments and a vaccine continue.NSW Premier Gladys Berejiklian has promised to review the state's restrictions on a monthly basis, and has said some rules could be loosened as early as next month, while Victorian Premier Daniel Andrews says strict social distancing measures "are with us for the medium term".
Professor Blakely says the timing of lifting restrictions depends on "what our endgame strategy is".
If it's to eliminate the virus - assuming that is even possible - restrictions could be lifted in four to eight weeks, he says. If the aim is squashing the curve to keep rates of infection "really low until a vaccine is found", he says "a very gentle easing" is possible after some weeks of "meticulous planning".
That would mean easing off the social distancing rules until the reproduction rate of the virus is about 1.0 but no more (meaning each infected person passes it on to one or fewer people), and holding the restrictions at that level for 18 months or until the vaccine is rolled out.
"We just do not yet know what that looks like - but many people are working on this, right now," Professor Blakely says.
Professor Raina MacIntyre, head of the biosecurity research program at UNSW Sydney's Kirby Institute, says a "short, sharp lockdown" of between four and six weeks would be enough to bring Australia's number cases to a "very, very low baseline".
"I don't think we need to be locked down for six months," she says.
ANU Professor Peter Collignon says the current rules are too harsh and that authorities have overstepped by fining people for sitting on park benches or teaching their teenagers how to drive, warning that this approach will eventually drive people to civil disobedience.
"If you're in a car, how are you going to give to anybody else or get it? We've got to have laws that make biological sense," he says.
Professor Collignon says a ban on visitors at home is "not sustainable", but that closing pubs, clubs and bars and restaurants "was a good idea" and that they should remain closed "until at least September or October", as winter would be a danger period.
"What we put in place mid to late March - closing our international borders, quarantining high-risk people like returned travellers and close contacts - we're going to have to continue that for at least six months," he says.
"We're going to have to keep the two-metre rule going for quite awhile and limit the number of people you meet - but that doesn't mean we have to become hermits."
The prospect of allowing the virus to circulate with the aim of achieving "herd immunity" has been raised repeatedly, despite scientific uncertainty over whether people who recover from COVID-19 are actually immune (something that won't be settled until a reliable blood test is found).
Professor Blakely says if governments decided to pursue herd immunity by allowing the virus to circulate, they would ease off restrictions with the aim of achieving a rate of spread that generates a "manageable" three-week ICU caseload.
Borders would need to remain closed for six months even under a herd immunity plan, Professor Blakely says, and at least 18 months for either elimination or suppression.
Grattan Institute health economist Stephen Duckett says while the number of new cases is falling, the decrease has been driven mainly by "regaining control of the borders" and that the level of recorded local transmissions remains flat.
Dozens of new cases each day are still "way too many", he says.
"You've got to get it really, really right down low before you can risk lifting the restrictions. Singapore were getting it down then it rebounded.
"Because this is a highly infectious virus, it is easy to get out of control again."
But, Dr Duckett says, some loosening of restrictions was needed as the current rules could not be sustained for another five months.
The strategy of flattening the curve is aimed at buying time while authorities learn more about how the coronavirus is behaving in Australia, and build the capacity of the healthcare system, buying new ventilators and masks, training up health workers and finding more effective treatments.
University of Melbourne epidemiologist James McCaw says if we returned to normal while the curve is flattening "we would see rapid and explosive resurgence in epidemic activity". Sweden and Singapore opted for fewer restrictions but then had to toughen these after cases rose dramatically.
Perhaps this is why the Prime Minister has been careful to warn Australians not to expect life to return to normal any time soon.
Chief Medical Officer Brendan Murphy says Australia is "on a life raft", with infection rates falling in the wake of restrictions. "We now have to chart the course of where we take that life raft," he says.
The direction in which the nation is steered will be scrutinised, with a Senate committee examining the government's response.
Liberal senator James Paterson, the committee's deputy chair, says it will "carefully consider that economic cost on the lives of ordinary Australians" and question both government decision makers and the experts who advise them.

Full text: Following the emergence and rapid spread of COVID-19, several countries have succeeded in bringing local outbreaks under control. The most dramatic of these is China, where large scale restrictions on people's movement appear to have halted domestic transmission.
South Korea, Singapore and Taiwan also had early success containing local outbreaks, using a combination of extensive contact tracing, testing, border measures and differing degrees of social distancing.
However, COVID-19 is now widespread across the globe, and these countries remain at risk of a second wave of infections, sparked either by overseas arrivals or undetected pockets of infection.
As China has begun to lift travel restrictions, the world is watching to see whether they can avoid a second wave of outbreaks.
What causes a second wave of a disease outbreak? Infectious diseases spread via contact between infectious and susceptible people. In the absence of any control measures, an outbreak will grow as long as the average number of people infected by each infectious person is greater than one.
If people who recover generate a protective immune response, the outbreak will leave a growing trail of immune people. Once enough people are immune, there are fewer susceptible people to become infected and the outbreak will die away.
When an outbreak is brought under control by social distancing and other measures, it's possible only a small proportion of the population will have been infected and gained immunity.
If a population has not achieved herd immunity, enough susceptible people may remain to fuel a second wave if controls are relaxed and infection is reintroduced.
Will we see a second wave in China? Despite the scale of the outbreak in Hubei and other Chinese provinces, it's likely most residents remain susceptible to infection.
Even for those people previously infected, immunity to COVID-19 is an open question. Reinfection appears uncommon, and a study in rhesus macaques suggests a protective immune response does occur. But we need more data to understand if this is common in humans, and how long immunity might last.
The strong social distancing measures used to control COVID-19 in China have a human cost, and cannot be maintained indefinitely.
As China winds back social distancing measures, new infected cases could, if not quickly detected and isolated, trigger a second wave of COVID-19.
A recent modelling study indicated a second peak of infection might arrive in Wuhan by mid-year if interventions were lifted too quickly.
During the 1918 influenza pandemic, it was the second wave that was the largest and most deadly. But that probably won't happen today. As we learn more about COVID-19, we become better placed to control its transmission.
If a rapid increase in transmission is detected in China, it's likely authorities would quickly reintroduce the restrictions that successfully contained the first wave.
Preventing a second wave of COVID-19 When the first wave of an outbreak is sufficiently large, then enough of the population could become immune that there are too few susceptible people remaining to fuel a second wave. But the potential human cost of an uncontrolled outbreak is immense and unacceptable.
Alternatively, a globally coordinated response that eradicated the virus could prevent a second wave, as was achieved for SARS in 2003. However, the milder nature of many infections, and the broad global spread of COVID-19 make it a much greater challenge to eradicate.
Another end point is the rapid development of a vaccine that could help achieve herd immunity without extensive infection.
In any event, after the first wave has passed, preventing a second wave will require ongoing surveillance and testing to detect and isolate any new cases as control measures are unwound.
Could we face a second wave in Australia? We use mathematical models to explore the dynamic behaviour of infectious diseases. They can help explore how factors such as the strength and timing of control efforts might affect the likelihood and timing of a second wave.
However, models provide a simplified view of reality. One of the complexities they often (but not always) omit is human behaviour and how it might change in response to government and media communication, social and economic realities, and direct experience of COVID-19.
Australia's current efforts are focused on "flattening the curve" of the first wave of COVID-19.
Border measures have greatly reduced the arrival of imported cases, and the coming weeks will reveal the extent to which social distancing measures have succeeded in slowing community transmission. The decline in numbers of new cases reported over recent days is promising.
But this is only the beginning. If social distancing measures are to be relaxed, ongoing vigilance will be needed to prevent a second wave.
And even if we avoid a second wave, the path to long-term control is not straightforward.
We'll need a broad variety of expertise, including modelling, to help Australia navigate beyond the first wave of COVID-19.

Full text: Relief from the restrictions will be slow and could be painful
Australians have grown used to living their life under the rudely ­intrusive ­shadow of COVID-19.
They are used to empty streets, shuttered shops and supermarket aisles stripped bare of toilet paper and pasta. They are used to tubs of hand sanitisers on the counters of the few gallant businesses that are still trading. They are used to frozen borders, stranded cruise ships and the daily bombardment of grim statistics: alarming death tolls, soaring infection rates and millions unemployed.
They have made their peace with travel bans, self-isolation, ­social distancing and elbow bumps instead of handshakes.
But as the complete shutdown of Australian public life nears the end of its second week, the question everyone is asking is: how much longer will this last?
“Outbreaks end with a whimper,’’ University of NSW epidemiologist and adviser to the World Health Organisation Marylouise McLaws tells Inquirer.
“They end with a long tail.’’ For the first time since health authorities began removing liberties, shutting businesses, locking up the sick and the at-risk — all in the name of ridding us of COVID-19 — there are now clear signs the government is contemplating how and when to return us to “normal” life.
“If the advice in a couple of weeks is that there might be a couple of aspects that we can tweak to provide relief to our citizens, well then, we’ll take that advice,” NSW Premier Gladys Berejiklian said on Wednesday.
Ms Berejiklian’s remarks were in response to reports that authorities were leaning towards loosening some of the operating restrictions imposed on businesses to curb the spread of the virus, but which — in the enforcing — have ­kneecapped the state’s economy.
Ending the lockdown Most experts agree that lockdowns will end gradually and with extended periods of observation to see what impact, if any, the measured changes have.
“It will obviously start with things that keep society functioning but would maintain things that have high impact, like social distancing and hygiene,’’ University of Newcastle epidemiologist Craig Dalton said. “You wouldn’t have large gatherings any time soon. You would still be limiting non-­essential gatherings.’’ On Tuesday, the federal government released modelling, ­compiled by Victoria’s Doherty Institute, that illustrated just how catastrophic the impact of an unchecked outbreak of the coronavirus in Australia would have been.
According to the modelling, an unmitigated outbreak afflicting 23 million Australians would send 35,000 people into intensive care units across the nation’s hospitals, a figure light-years beyond the ability of any country to cope.
A second scenario, in which people infected with the disease were isolated and where incoming visitors to Australia were quarantined, would require 17,000 ICU beds, still an impossible figure.
The third scenario, combining isolation, quarantine and strict ­social distancing, was shown to ­reduce demand on ICU beds to manageable levels.
A fourth option — adopting a policy of herd immunity, which would simply allow the virus to spread throughout the community until the majority of the population had contracted the illness and developed a resistance to it — had initially drawn support from some quarters when COVID-19 arrived on our shores.
But Health Minister Greg Hunt on Wednesday strongly rejected the tactic of herd immunity, insisting “our goal is for people not to be infected”.
Mr Hunt also said Australia was now facing a “different future” below the infection rate predicted in original modelling.
“We’ve rejected that because herd immunity is 60 per cent of the population on the best advice that we have. (For) 15 million people, if there is a 1 per cent loss of life, that would be a catastrophic loss of human life,” he said.
“So that’s not a theory which the Australian government or the national cabinet have been considering or proposing. We reject it.
“Our goal is for people not to be infected. Let me be really clear about this. We want as few people as possible to have this condition, because it can kill you.” As it turns out, even the relatively mild scenario proved far worse than the experience across Australia thus far.
“In fact, the measures we put in place now have already reduced our infectivity rate much lower than the model impact of even this most significant implementation,’’ the country’s Chief Medical officer, Brendan Murphy, said.
The Doherty Institute’s modelling was theoretical, not empirical. Modelling based on Australia’s ­actual experience of the corona­virus is now under way. The government has promised to release it once it is complete.
But it is already clear that Australia will avoid the worst of the disease. Unless something drastic changes, we will be spared the horrific scenes witnessed in Italy, Spain and now the US and Britain, where the stricken die in hospital corridors because the ventilators needed to save them are not there.
Changing course The frightening early trajectory of COVID-19, which saw a doubling of the number of infections across Australia every three days, has sharply altered course.
The rate of known infections is now doubling every eight to nine days. Australia has recorded just 50 coronavirus-related deaths, and fewer than 100 people with the disease are in intensive care. The overwhelming majority remain in the community, but in isolation.
Our experience of COVID-19 will be longer, slower and milder than what is happening overseas. Most importantly, it looks set to occur at a pace that will allow authorities to scale up the critical care facilities needed to treat the small number of patients mortally stricken with the virus.
“It has occurred well beyond our expectations, in the way that we have been able to bring that daily growth rate down together, and certainly ahead of what all the theoretical models would have suggested,’’ Prime Minister Scott Morrison said of the progress Australia has made.
That in itself does not mean Australians will be able to quickly resume normal lives.
Quizzed on that point on Tuesday, Dr Murphy evinced the trademark caution of all public health officials: “What we do next in Australia will very much depend on our real-time Australian data. And that’s too early to say yet.’’ A day after the government released its modelling, the Chinese city of Wuhan ended its 76-day lockdown. Wuhan was the epicentre of the coronavirus outbreak and the first of the world’s cities to go into intensive lockdown.
The city’s 11 million residents were sealed off in late January as infection rates soared, threatening to send the pandemic into an uncontrollable upward spiral that could have cost tens of millions of mainland Chinese their lives. About two-thirds of the country’s 80,000 COVID-19 infections occurred in Wuhan. Shops were closed, public transport ceased and residents were confined to their homes. No one was allowed to leave the city.
Wuhan’s journey out of that long hibernation will provide insight into how the rest of the world might do the same.
The city has been gradually easing restrictions for weeks. ­Although residents can now leave the city, they must first obtain ­government approval. They also face a 14-day isolation period when they arrive at their destination, which is long enough for the symptoms of coronavirus to manifest and run their course.
Authorities will be watching closely to see how the gradual easing of restrictions affects the city’s infection rate. Their mortal fear is that even a gradual easing of ­restrictions will unleash a second wave of infections.
Mr Hunt told The Weekend Australian last Saturday, a staged reopening of society was a “very realistic assessment’’.
A slow road For the business community, this liberalisation cannot occur soon enough. The head of the Australian Industry Group, Innes Willox, said the pandemic would shave ­between 4.5 and 5 per cent off Australia’s trillion-dollar ­economy and send unemployment skyrocketing to between 10 and 15 per cent. Furthermore, he said that whereas the shock to the economy was ­brutal and sudden, the recovery would be painful and slow.
“The first parts of our economy to be shut down will be the last to resume activity, as they largely involve significant public contact,’’ he told Inquirer. “Aviation, tourism, hospitality and entertainment — they’ll be the last to come back.’’ Mr Willox acknowledged the pandemic was predominantly a public health issue. But he said the time had come to give business some guide as to when things would liberalise.
“What we need for the sake of business is some time frame around when decisions will be ­reviewed or actioned,’’ he said.
“At the moment, there is not much on the horizon for business to review or look forward to.’’ For all the talk of curve-flattening, Professor McLaws said Australians should not expect a neat end to the pandemic.
She said the bell-curve beloved by the media, one that showed a sharp increase in cases, then a ­plateau, then an equally sharp decline, rarely occurred in practice.
“It has several peaks and troughs, then it will start heading towards the horizontal axis. Even then, you still can’t get excited because you can still have outbreaks,’’ she said.
This can go on for years.
The Spanish influenza pandemic ran from 1918 to the northern summer of 1919. By the time it had run its course it had killed between 20 million and 50 million people and infected 500 million, a third of the world’s population at the time. A second wave of infection killed more American victims than the initial outbreak.
The debate occurring about when and how to return to normal life is not confined to Australia. It is occurring all over the world. French Prime Minister Edouard Philippe said the question about when and how to end the lockdown was impossible to answer definitively because the situation was without precedent.
“We have never confined such a large number of people, and by definition we have never relaxed confinement of such a large number of people. There is no written process or tried method.” As well as easing restrictions by sector, Australia may see any relaxation occur geographically or unevenly across the population.
Hot spots, where the infection is known to be more widespread, may have to wait longer for businesses to reopen and mass gatherings, such as sporting events, to be allowed.
The elderly and the vulnerable may also be encouraged to remain in isolation longer, while younger and fitter members of society resume their normal working lives.
If there is to be a definitive end to the pandemic, it will come with the development of a vaccine.
That, however, could be as much as 18 months away. In that time, rich countries are likely to have contained the disease. In the developing world, however, coronavirus threatens to be a deadly juggernaut.
“I think it could be one of the greatest public health disasters in history,’’ Dr Dalton said.
Australia is not immune from this. An eruption of the disease in the southern hemisphere will have a profound impact on the ease with which we trade with and travel through the developing world.
“There’s no playbook for this pandemic,’’ Dr Dalton said. “It is totally new. Every government is learning as they go.’’

Full text: On the frontline of war against COVID-19, there is cautious optimism that in Victoria, the public embrace of social distancing and a doubling of intensive care capacity across the health system will enable our hospitals to cope with the peak of the coronavirus.
Although leading epidemiologists, intensive care specialists and senior government health figures warn there is no room to relax the draconian measures that have shut down normal social and economic life, they no longer fear our hospitals will be overrun.
With the peak of the local epidemic still up to three months away, Royal Melbourne Hospital director of intensive care medicine Chris McIsaac said the message to the public needed to be balanced.
"We are trying to motivate the public to take this seriously but also, reassure them that if they do, we are going to be able to provide a high level of care for them," he said.
"From my perspective, governments at both a state and federal level are taking every precaution and pulling every lever that they have at their disposal to flatten this curve."
Exclusive modelling for The Age by leading epidemiologist Tony Blakely indicates that the culmination of the coronavirus crisis - the peak number of patients requiring admittance to intensive care units - can be controlled to fall within the expanded capacity of our hospital system. Scenario projections calculated by Professor Blakely and researchers from the University of Melbourne's Population Intervention Unit predict that shutdown measures introduced a week ago could reduce by between two-thirds and three-quarters the peak ICU admission rate in the state.
This means instead of about 1000 patients a day requiring intensive treatment, the more likely number will be between 375 and 240.
Professor Blakely said his calculations were subject to fluctuation and "pessimistic", as they assumed the same rate of ICU admissions across all ages.
"If we protect our elderly and people with chronic conditions well, I would expect these numbers to halve," he said.
With each patient requiring between four and five days in hospital, this predicted rate of admissions would stretch but not break our intensive care capacity, which stands in excess of 1000 units and will continue to grow.
The modelling is based on what Professor Blakely estimates to be the true numbers of infections in the state, which is about three times the number of confirmed cases, and indicates that the peak may not arrive until late June.
If the modelling is accurate, the pandemic will infect more than 2 million Victorians but, in stark contrast to what we have seen in Lombardy and are now seeing in New York, leave our hospital system intact.
"If what you are getting from health service managers and clinicians is that they think the sky isn't falling in and they will cope, I agree," Professor Blakely said.
Still, the state government continues to plan for and warn of a worst-case scenario.
"We are scaling up our health system to prepare for this global health crisis as quickly as we can and on a scale never before seen in our history," Health Minister Jenny Mikakos said.
However, the coronavirus endgame - where the peak of the virus meets the limits of our health system - has changed significantly due to the public acceptance of this message and a two-month campaign within our hospitals to increase their COVID capacity. Western Health chief executive Russell Harrison said COVID preparations began in January as dire reports of the epidemic were first emerging in Wuhan.
A small team of senior clinicians, nurses and managers were taken off regular duties to lead COVID planning. Clinical and administrative staff were split into A and B streams, one assigned to Sunshine Hospital and the other to Footscray Hospital, to prevent a single infection from disrupting the operations of both hospitals.
An acute respiratory clinic was established in a suite of nine outpatient rooms at Sunshine Hospital, separated by a road from the emergency department, so that suspected COVID cases could be tested without risk of cross-contamination.
There are currently no COVID in-patients at Sunshine or Footscray hospitals. When that changes, a staged response will begin rolling out, starting with those patients - between 2 per cent and 5 per cent of total COVID cases - who require intensive care.
"The plan scales out from a single patient in a negative pressure room to a whole ward, to two wards and three, four etc," Mr Harrison said. "We have got plans to scale our ICU and surge it."
At Sunshine Hospital there are two wards with a total of 56 beds empty and ready for COVID patients. When those beds are full, there are a further two newer wards with 64 beds, that will be readied and staffed to take patients. If the number of cases exceeds those beds, there is planning for the entire Sunshine campus to become a COVID-dedicated hospital, with all non-COVID cases shifted to Footscray.
"We have had the benefit of time," Mr Harrison said. "There is a cause for modest optimism that this is working, the challenge is to keep that going."
Mr McIsaac said the Royal Melbourne Hospital's standing capacity for 42 ICU patients had more than doubled.

Full text: Young people are not spared the worst effects of coronavirus, with figures showing those aged 30 to 39 are hospitalised in the greatest numbers to treat the disease.
While the virus is most serious if it is contracted by people aged over 70, experts have cautioned young people that they should not be complacent about the infection and have raised concern that young people were failing to heed social distancing measures.
A total of 164 new cases of COVID-19 were diagnosed on Friday, a steep jump of almost a quarter, bringing the national case tally to 875. Six people are in intensive care in NSW hospitals.
Federal Health Department figures show people aged between 30 and 39 were hospitalised for COVID-19 in greater numbers than any other age group. Those aged 35 to 39 were the second-most likely age group to be diagnosed with the disease.
Robert Booy, an infectious disease professor from the University of Sydney, has noticed in busy Sydney suburbs that many young people are continuing to socialise and mingle in close groups despite the spread of coronavirus.
“It’s as if we’re living in the times of Noah just prior to the flood,” Professor Booy said.
“So when I see large crowds on beaches or having cappuccinos together with half a metre between each other, I ask myself, ‘Do they realise this is the real world?’ “I think we need to be like the Germans and be willing to put more discipline into our lives.” University of Melbourne epidemiologist Tony Blakely modelled the expected number of deaths in Australia from COVID-19 using recent UK estimates from Imperial College London on death rates, and applied these to Australia.
Based on an assumption that 60 per cent of the population would need to be infected for herd immunity to be achieved, triggering the epidemic fading away, Professor Blakely’s modelling estimates there would be a total of nearly 60,000 deaths in Australia - including 3070 people under 40. That prediction assumes Australia can keep the infection of those aged over 60 to 20 per cent, meaning infection rates are 70 per cent for younger people.
However, if Australia can deliver care of the sick better than the Imperial College estimates, Professor Blakely believes deaths could be slashed to 30,000 — with 1480 of those deaths among people aged under 40. Based on the estimates of state health authorities that 20 per cent of the population would be infected in the first wave, 430 people aged under 40 would die in the initial sweep of the disease.
“Young people are not immortal, they do have a chance of dying from this disease,” Professor Blakely said. “And those numbers will add up.” The modelling assumes a death rate of 0.01 per cent in 10 to 19-year-olds, 0.03 per cent in those aged 20-29, and 0.08 per cent in those aged 30-39.
Under the modelling, the case fatality rate climbs to 9.3 per cent in those aged over 80.
Peter Collignon, an infectious diseases physician at the Australian National University Medical School, said although young people were at low risk of dying from COVID-19, they should not ignore the risk.
“I worry that young people may have the attitude that they’re bulletproof. I think that’s a concern,” Professor Collignon said. “In France, people in their 30s are in intensive care with this disease. Even at a very low rate of death, it does not mean young people are bulletproof.” COVID-19 infections rose by 164 on Friday, their biggest one-day jump. NSW made up the largest of the leaps in new diagnoses with 75 cases, bringing the state total to 382. One of the NSW cases was a resident of Dorothy Henderson Lodge aged-care facility, which now accounts for 11 infections.Globally, there are now almost 250,000 cases of COVID-19 and more than 10,000 deaths.

Full text: Melbourne-based researchers working on a corona­virus vaccine will expand their work into developing new diagnostic tests and potential treatments for the deadly illness, following a $6m grant from the Victorian state government.
The Peter Doherty Institute for Infection and Immunity and Burnet Institute welcomed the funding support announced on Tuesday, which comes after China’s richest man, Jack Ma, pledged $3.2m to accelerate development of a coronavirus vaccine.
While an Australian-made vaccine remains in the early stages of development and would require rigorous testing before being available for public use, Doherty Institute director Sharon Lewin said the state’s funding would “go a long way” towards assisting Australia to “build capacity to prevent, detect and control this new virus”.
The extra funding comprises $4m for a consortium led by the Doherty and Burnet institutes to develop point-of-care testing, potential therapeutics and public health initiatives aimed at reducing the spread of the illness. A further $2m will go to the Victorian Infectious Diseases References Laboratory at the Doherty Institute to boost the state’s capacity to rapidly diagnose those who have been infected.
“The Doherty Institute’s allocation will allow us to build on what we’ve already been able to achieve … being the first laboratory outside of China to grow and share the virus, and to now work with other laboratories to increase Victoria’s capacity to rapidly diagnose infected people,” Professor Lewin said.
“We will also develop better ­diagnostic tests to understand who is exposed and can clear the virus without symptoms.
“Through this new consortium, we will work with collaborators across Victoria to evaluate and discover novel antiviral drugs that reduce virus replication. Finally, we will fund clinical trials of new antiviral drugs and use mathematical modelling to understand the impact of COVID-19 on the community and our healthcare sector, which will directly inform health system planning.” The coronavirus has spread rapidly around the world in the past few months, infecting more than 87,000 people and killing almost 3000 so far.
In Australia, 33 cases have been recorded, including nine in Victoria. A man who flew into Avalon Airport southwest of Melbourne on Tuesday is being tested for coronavirus and could become the state’s 10th coronavirus case Unveiling its public health response on Tuesday, the Victorian government said although COVID-19 had not yet been declared a pandemic, “there is a high probability (it) will spread”.
“While we are doing what we can to contain COVID-19, we are also preparing to take more targeted action if, as expected, the virus starts impacting more Vic­torians,” Premier Daniel Andrews said.
“We are working closely with the commonwealth and our response is being guided by the very best expect advice.”Health Minister Jenny Mika­kos said hospitals and emergency services had existing pandemic­ ­arrangements in place “which are ready to be activated if they are required”.
